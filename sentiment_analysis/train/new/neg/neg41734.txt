this seat cover was ok. It is quite a  pain in the butt to get on the bumbo.  It fits super snug. I don't have straps on my bumbo but I can imagine is only harder to squeeze on when you have to deal with straps too.  Once it's on it stays in place well. The fabric I think feels cheap and it's scratchy. I don't think I'd buy it again, I think I'd look for a nicer one online that is made of soft material, I've seen several others that were made on etsy that I think would be better.
