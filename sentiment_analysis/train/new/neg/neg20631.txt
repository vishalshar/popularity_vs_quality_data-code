This is a great set! The colors are so fun and I like the size of everything. My 2.5 year old was still using baby silverware from when she first started eating. Oops. The silverware is big but easy for her to hold. I like that the bowls are deep and tall. Her last set of bowls were more shallow and didn't keep food in as well! She loves choosing which color to use each day.EDIT: I just saw that IKEA offers the whole set for around $8....so this is twice the price. Just an FYI. I moved my rating from 5 stars, to 3 starts. I should have done my research before ordering!
