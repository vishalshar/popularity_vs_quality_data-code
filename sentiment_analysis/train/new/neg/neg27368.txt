The "hair" on the monkeys is a funny texture and you can pull it apart. As in, you can pull it off the monkeys’ heads very easily – it doesn’t stay on there. I would have preferred that this item be more durable. Also, the fabric is not as thick as I expected. And although I didn’t think about it when I bought this item, there is no way to help keep these from sliding up or down the carseat’s straps. Having some grippy material on the back of these would help keep them in place better by providing a little bit of friction.
