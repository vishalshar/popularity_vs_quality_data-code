I hope this review helps other moms from wasting their time. I have a medela BP and I exclusively pump since my son could not latch. Let me just start by saying what a complete nightmare it is when the pump doesn't work and I have no way to get the milk out. I mean, what kind of cruel fate, right? Well for some reason the ac adapters for the model I have are quite seriously flawed and I have gone through not 2, or 3, but 4 of these adapters. In fact, I have purchased 3 different brands. This one is a poorly made cheap piece of crap. It stopped working almost immediately. I would suggest pony-ing up the 20$ for the medela brand adapter. It is at least sturdier and more reliable.  I have learned to keep more than one adapter around so I don't have to go through engorged boobs and no way to pump!
