I use this everyday, mostly I love it but about a third of the time it LEAKS EVERYWHERE...I've done everything that their website instructs you to do if the machine starts to leak and nothing has fixed it.  For the price I thought I would receive something a little more high quality (some of the parts really seem junky).  I do love making baby food, so I am considering sending this back to see if a different one will work better.
