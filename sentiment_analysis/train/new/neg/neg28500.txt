This is fine for what it is and I like the case.  My complaint is that there aren't any small bristles, e.g., on the other side where the bumps are.  On the bristle side of the brush, the bristles are too long to brush my one-year-old's front teeth comfortably.  If there were smaller-raised bristles on the other side, that would be better for brushing my LO's teeth.  The raised bumps don't really do it.
