This chair is advertised as having extra "trays" but in reality this model only has ONE extra tray. I find all the Chico colors muddy and unattractive and this is no exception. It was much cheaper here than at the local stores and we needed 2 chairs for our 2 new grandkids and I need them to fold and be stored between uses. The Chico apparently folds as flat or flatter than other chairs of its kind, but I miss the circa-1970 Cosco high chairs we had for our kids! They were nice metal chairs with metal tray and folded VERY flat! I sure wish I had kept ours when we moved to AZ! I am not impressed with all this overpriced plastic crapola with the "bells and whistles". I don't think this chair will be sturdy enough to be able to serve as a youth chair for a rambunctious toddler, but I hope I am wrong since it was so expensive. I have very little faith that any of this expensive plastic stuff will be around to be handed down and I'm sure that's what the manufacturers have in mind! Shipping time was longer than expected but the chairs arrived in perfect condition. But if I saw the old Cosco chairs at a garage sale, I'd  buy one and get rid of this behemoth in a second. The wheels are the best feature.
