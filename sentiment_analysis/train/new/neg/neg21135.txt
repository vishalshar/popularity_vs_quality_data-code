We purchased these covers for our son's changing table and I must say I am very disappointed.  Aside from the fact that they shrank (and I do know how to do laundry, for those that say "you just have to be careful when you wash them") they all got snags and lines in the fabric after just one laundering.  We ended up getting the "especially for baby" covers along with a quilted cover offered in the store, though not online, and couldn't be happier.  I wouldn't waste my money on these, you will just have to purchase different ones in a short while.
