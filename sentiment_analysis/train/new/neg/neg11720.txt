I usually love all things by Dr. Browns and purchased these and the matching bowls. I think they are probably better for older babies. I tried using them when my son was 4 months and found it difficult to get the flat edge in his mouth beyond his gums. The rubber tipped spoons are much better for when baby is first learning to spoon feed. He is almost 6 months now and will try using them again now that he has the hang of it.  Also, I was slightly disappointed to receive 2 red and 2 green spoons in the 4 pack, instead of 4 different colors like the matching bowls.
