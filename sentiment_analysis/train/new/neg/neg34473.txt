I ordered this for my skinny toddler who needs 18 month pants for the length but the waist is nearly always too big.  This product is ok -- how well it works depends on the exact belt loop placement on the pants.  At least in these smaller pants sizes, sometimes the belt loops are too close together for the Dapper Snapper to actually cinch up the waist at all.  It would be nice if this product was more adjustable -- more snaps, or maybe velcro (would that be strong enough?)  Overall, this is still a great idea and it gives us a few more options for pants (previously I could only find one brand and style of pants that fit perfectly without the Dapper Snapper!)
