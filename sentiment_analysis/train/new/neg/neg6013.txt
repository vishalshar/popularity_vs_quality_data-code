I picked these sheets because I am trying to go a little more gender neutral, but I loved the animal print.  They seem soft enough as well.  Because I'm a little paranoid I put the sheets on the mattress before I even washed them.  They are SO tight.  The mattress even bows just a slight bit when they are on because they are so tight.  I was afraid I was going to break the elastic bands on the sheets to get them all the way on.  They still fit this way after washing.  I haven't had to do a middle of the night sheet change yet, so this rating could still go down further depending on how that goes.
