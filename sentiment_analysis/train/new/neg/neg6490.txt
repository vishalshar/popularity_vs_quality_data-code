originally got this for my 30lb son for overnight, was waking up soaking wet with overnight diapers with 2 boosters, and no i was not giving a gallon of water before bed. he would sleep for almost 12 hours so that alot of pee!!! anyway bought 2 of these and 2 dozen toddler size indian cloth diapers. the cloth prefold diaper is way to bulky and it make the diaper and the wrap so big and bulky that my son could barely walk and it was sad to see him try to sleep without being able to close his legs. i ended up getting AIO diapers and putting 2 liners. i am now looking to get bigger sized AIO's they're typically sized 8-35 lbs. i've researched like crazy and ended up getting the bummis AIO. so far been happy with them. will post my review for the bummis soon
