Dr. Browns recommends descaling the heating element every 4 weeks using the following mix: (3 oz/80 ml) with white vinegar and water (.5 oz/20 ml), for a total of 3.5 oz/100 ml. a mixture of vinegar/water.The heating element in this units are made with low-quality materials that will rust with the treatment and IF you don't clean it up it will build up scale reducing the efficiency of the process or reducing the temperature of the water (critical for the sterilization process).Rusting heating will leachate metals (no idea if there is any content of heavy metals that could be problematic for babies) but will produce DISGUSTING rust staining the entire lower part of the sterilizer. No idea why Dr. Browns will produce a product with a heating element without protection against corrosion.
