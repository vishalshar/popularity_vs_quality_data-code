Horribly misleading advertising. The pictures it advertises is extremely misleading. The mat is about 1/2 the size and in the picture, it looks like a blanket but in reality, it is an extremely piece of thing plastic. The dinosaurs are also about 1/2 the size as they show in the picture. Would not have bought this if it advertised what it truly was.Plus side was that my nephews are young and play with anything dinosaurs BUT we could have bought them 40 $1 sets at the dollar store and had tons more to play with. I am not a fan of false advertising and do not appreciate it as due to this, I feel ripped off!
