In excellent condition when I received it. Very easy to assemble. Very nice sturdy stroller for the price. The only complaint is one of the front wheels start squeaking so loudly that everyone was turning around to see what the annoying sound was. This was the second time i had used it.Ive not been able to make the sound stop so I will be calling babytrend soon. I have owned the stroller for 3 weeks.
