The lunch bag itself is great.  It's cute, well-made, and durable.  It does not, however, hold very much.  Be sure to check the dimensions to ensure it will meet your needs.  We purchased this bag for an adult's lunch bag.  It would make a nice snack bag, but not big enough to be a lunch bag for an adult.
