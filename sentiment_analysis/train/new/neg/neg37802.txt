This car seat is huge, and takes up a large amount of space in your car.  I have an Acura SUV and it wiped out my blind spot totally, and the passenger front seat had to be moved all the way up (preventing anyone from sitting there) in order to accommodate this seat at the proper recline.  The material is foam, which in the midwest and warm humid summers would lead to disaster and overheating.  I placed my girl in the seat, and with the proper recline (based on bubble level installed in the carseat), she seemed too much in the laying position, and kept trying to get up or out.Being so HUGE, I had no blind spot and that would be dangerous driving, I returned the seat.
