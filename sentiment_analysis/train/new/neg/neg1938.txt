I made one for my first son and loved it this time I ordered it and the cream was missing so I used Vaseline to lubricate my skin even thought he cast came out great I have to add plaster of pastor to strengthen he mold. I would still recommend this to anyone and order them for others as baby shower gifts all the time it is easy to use.
