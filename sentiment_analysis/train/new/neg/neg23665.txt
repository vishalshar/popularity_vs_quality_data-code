Frustrated after not being able to purchase these nipples in a store in our area, I was relieved to find these on Amazon. I ordered 2 of the 2 packs. BIG MISTAKE!! All 4 of the nipples are marked "slow" for the flow, however they most certainly are NOT. My newborn would choke and spit with each of the nipples. After that, I tested them just by turning the bottle upside down and the formula would just pour from the nipple. I am very unsatisfied.
