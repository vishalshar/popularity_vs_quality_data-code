This is the absolute worst, most uncomfortable carrier ever. I would give it negative stars if I could. I have had three Infantino carriers, and loved them all. I thought this had a back like the classic, and that baby would be slightly more secure in it.The front, between you and baby is open, that is fine, but there is no way to secure baby, or tighten the straps enough, and if you lean forward AT ALL, baby may topple out. I'm use to baby wearing and doing normal chores (loading a dishwasher for instance) by just supporting baby a little extra while wearing them. This one you have to be extra careful with supporting baby a lot or bye bye potato!Plus- Baby (one month old) doesn't seem to give a care that this carrier is awful.Go for a Infantio classic or something with better back straps and baby support.
