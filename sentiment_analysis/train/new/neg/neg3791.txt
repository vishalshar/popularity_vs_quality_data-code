First of all a word of warning; every single photo of this chair shows it on a wooden dining room chair, even though we knew it was not included I could see some people expecting to find it in the box. What you get is the space saver chair that you attach to your own chairs.That said; this chair is big. It's not a real space saver as it takes up a lot of room. It's pretty high (in fact, too high for our dining room set) and the armrests mean your kid will most likely not fit up against the table when you move away from the tray to sitting at the table with mommy and daddy.The straps are nice and secure, it reclines and the seat padding is quite comfortable.But in the end I don't think we'll be keeping this, the non-removable armrests and the sheer size of it make it too impractical for our table.Be sure to check measurements before purchasing this chair.
