Bad choice.  Once I received the item I found that it was not what I wanted.  One thing, there were just one pair of training pants and what can you do with just one pair of pants.  Another thing, was the cost.  It was rather costly, especially for one pair.  Sorry I purchased this one. But at the time, I was looking to help my daughter-n-law with finding training pairs for my granddaughter.
