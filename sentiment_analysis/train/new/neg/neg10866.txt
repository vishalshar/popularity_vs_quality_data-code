They are balls, which will make any kid fall in love with them, but the appeal didn't really go any farther than that for my kids. For one, when a baby is first learning to grab things, these are great because the texture is appealing, but honestly, they're round, and they roll away. When baby is crawling, the appeal is heightened, but so is the appeal of any ball. That said, if your sold on sensory balls in general, these are great sensory balls in the fact that they aren't a hard plastic, with good bounce, and a good variety of texture from ball to ball. They have now lasted for three years and I expect them to last for a long time. The quality is great, just they weren't any better than any other ball to my kids.
