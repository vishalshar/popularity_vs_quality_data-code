As far as a pillow case goes, it's just okay.  We bought this to go with the kid's pillow made by the same company.  Pillow case is actually kind of short, it's only *just* the length of the pillow.  It's really not worth the price at all, but if you want a small pillow, you don't have many options, especially for the pillow case.  These should come in 2 packs for $9.99, it's really kind of pathetic what they charge.  I will say that it is soft and our daughter likes it, but we'll see how many washings it stands up to.
