We recently dropped our Summer Night and Day Baby Monitor and broke the 2.5 inch screen. We were happy with that model other than the fact it interfered with our wireless.We purchased the Samsung Wireless Video Security Monitoring System to replace the Summer model since they have discontinued the model that we had. We have had a couple of days to try out the Samsung and here's what I think:Cool:-You can hook the handheld unit up to your TV and watch your baby on the big screen.-Design is sleek-Manual is straight forward-Easy to use Menu-Decent picture quality-Night light (wish it was dimmable though or a soft blue - it's bright white!)-Has temperature reading which reads a little high-Ability to radio in to the babyNot Cool:-Sound it is very tinny-Sound is delayed (digital?) - I can hear the baby crying in the room and a quarter second later you here it on the handheld (kind of like a weird echo). We do (did) not have this issue with a Graco monitor we still have and the Summer monitor that was lost-The built in lullabies again are very tinny and annoying so probably won't use-The skype connection was a failure (at least for me) all I got was a black screen when connecting the unit to the computer and skype-Camera does not pan. It is completely stationary unless you walk in the room and move it yourselfOverall I would give it about 3.5 stars. I could probably overlook most of the flaws with the exception of the tinny sound and the delayed feedback. Otherwise it is a decent monitor for the price. If you want to hear your baby in real time and a more robust sound, then check out the Summer Brand models.
