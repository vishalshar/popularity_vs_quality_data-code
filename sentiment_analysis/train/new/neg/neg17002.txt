These are a decent size and a cute color, but I wouldn't buy them again and I really never use them.  They do not have enough traction to stay in place on a table.  My baby ends up constantly lifting them up and spilling everything on them.  I think they make similar ones that either have more traction or that have little suction cups to keep them in place.  Maybe for an older child who isn't tempted to play with them, they would be fine.
