Purchased multiple sets on the recommendation of a friend. I like the dual sides, but the quality is severely lacking, especially for the price. After one month of use, the sewn edges are unravelling. (Use is probably once every 3 days - I have about 60 wipes of various brands.)  Disappointed and definitely not worth the cost.
