I purchased these for my 5 month old as we attend a church that has loud music.Pros:-They arrived on time.-I tried them on and they do a good job reducing sound.Cons:-The off gassing smell from them when you open them is horrible. When trying them on my child after opening them, his head smelled the rest of the day.-The first time we used them at church, one of the songs started with some drums, my child jumped. I'm a bit concerned this may not be enough protection. I will test these more to determine if we need to send them back and purchase something more substantial.
