This pack-n-play is great for it's general use.  very easy to put together.  sturdy.  The mobile however is extremely on the cheaply made side. the product tags are long and unattractive, and they attach to the mobile bar via velcro.  The mobile is by far the most unattractive, useless part of this product.  Everything else is great!!!
