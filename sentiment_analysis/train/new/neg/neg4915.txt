I purchased 3 of these for a vacation for my 3 toddlers.  The children didn't even have a chance to really use them, one broke coming out of the package, and the other 2 only lasted about an hour.  The little bit of time they did work, the amount of air generated was very poor.  What a waste of money!!!
