The lead broke within a week. Crazy expensive for no helpful use.. this does not help my son in any way.. i was reccommnded to get this bottle by my son's speech therapist, who assured it would would. I read good reviews, and was waiting this cup to do a miracle within some time, but it just broke. We still try it, but no results. If I knew how it looks, I would just get honey in this type of bottle for $4, eat the honey, wash the bottle, and insert the straw - same thing! disappointed.. and feel i was fooled. this does not cost more than $3
