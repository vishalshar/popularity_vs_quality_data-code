I'm changing my review from five stars to three. This week 2 of the three bottles we ordered have just started leaking out of the bottom. I've always cleaned and sanitized according to the instructions. What a waste.  Our baby enjoys the bottle, but it is too expensive to keep replacing every few months. No matter whether you give breast milk or formula, both are a precious commodity you don't want to see wasted. Not to mention the mess it leaves on furniture when you put the bottle down. I've heard tommy tippee and dr.browns are helpful bottles for breastfed babies so maybe will give them a shot.
