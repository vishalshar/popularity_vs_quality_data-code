Great product.... But the only thing we ended up using was the nail clipper, the brush and toiletry bag. First the things that I did use: the nail clipper. Easy to hold and very sharp. Soft Brush- my son loves it. Its like getting petted on the head. When he was younger, everytime I brushed his hair with it, he would lift his chin up with his eyes closed with a pleased expression. As he got older, he'd grab it and try to brush his own hair. The Toiletry bag... Well its useful when we travel but its not large enough for everything. And if you are a female, chances are likely you have extra toiletry/cosmetic bags that could be used in lieu of this one. The things I didnt use? The nail filers were too flimsy and ineffective, as well as hard to hold- I did better just using my full sized adult nail filer on baby nails. We also received two baby thermometers from the hospital stay, so never used this one. Given what we did end up using, $20 for a brush and nail clipper seems a bit much. The nose bulb is useless- the ones from hospital are better, or just get a Nose Frida. I'm sure if your baby comes down with something and needs to take medicine, the medicine bottle with nipple would be handy. But you could just as easily use the milk bottle. My son had very very mild cradle cap at the front of his scalp for one week. The cradle cap comb (one with rounded tips) didn't really help comb it out. We just rubbed coconut oil into his scalp to loosen up the flakes overnight and shampooed his hair following day. The tooth brush is too large for any child under one, not to mention unnecessary. And once they are mobile, you really don't want them walking around with that toothbrush in their mouth lest they trip and God forbid impale themselves. Check out the Banana Brush instead... Much safer and funner for little baby to chew on, and massage their gums.So you really just need a nail clipper and soft baby brush. You probably have everything else already.
