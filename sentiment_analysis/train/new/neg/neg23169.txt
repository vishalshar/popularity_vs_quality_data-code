I haven't had leaking problems directly from the cup, but my 12 month old does tend to spit water out because it comes out a little fast for her. The result is a lot of water dribbled down her shirt. For that reason, I never put anything but water in it, and I only use it when my Life Factory sippy cup is dirty (that one is my absolute FAVORITE). But this one is not bad. I do like that it's comparable with the glass born free bottles I already have. Just don't use the handles, or that does cause some leaking.
