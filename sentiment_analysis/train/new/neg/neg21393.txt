First let me say that the actual nipples I would give 5 stars.  Our baby has done really well with the Dr. Brown nipples, progressing through the various levels.  I was also super happy when she started using the level 3 nipples as it really cut down the time to feed her a bottle. (Just don't advance to the next level too soon, or you might find yourself water-boarding your baby.)The reason I've taken some stars away is that I'm pretty sure that they have changed the packaging everywhere to only have two nipples in a pack.  So I'm guessing that this 3 pack selling here is old inventory, which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't so much more expensive than you could get the 2 packs for, Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 3 Standard Nipple.In conclusion, highly recommend these, just not the three pack at its current price.
