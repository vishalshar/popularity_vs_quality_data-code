Over the past two weeks we've ordered six Badger Basket storage units.  For my daughter, two of the three-bin storage tubs, and then one of the drawer cubby units.  Together they look organized, and just fine as a white accent to a girl's room.  No issues with the finish, except the screw holes are exposed.  The kit comes with stickers to cover the holes.  If the holes were plugged with a bit of painted dowel, I'd give these baskets a 4 or 5 stars.  They are easy to assemble, and the holes have all lined up perfectly and been properly drilled.*The espresso is not a "finish"- it is brown paint. Do not order these expecting Pottery Barn-like finishes or quality.*  They are, however, very stackable, reasonably good quality and strength, and easy to assemble.  Would recommend the white finish over any other.  The espresso cubby with three baskets was purchased for our son's closet floor, to store his socks and larger toys.  It blends nicely enough with a wood floor, but I wouldn't use it as a piece out in his bedroom.
