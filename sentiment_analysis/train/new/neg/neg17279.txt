I was so excited about these clips when I first received them as I had wanted them for quite awhile. After a couple months though I realized they are far more work than they're worth. I go through more struggle tiger them to stick to the magnet than it would be to simply holdback each strap one at a time or both together. Allot takes to become dislodged from the magnet ( IF it sticks at all!) it the slightest, lightest bump from baby/toddler while settling them into their car seat and they become a worthless addition to your car seat that has now left small tears in my child's $350.00 Britax car seat. I would HIGHLY not recommend these. Unless I happened to get a lemon set, which I highly doubt.
