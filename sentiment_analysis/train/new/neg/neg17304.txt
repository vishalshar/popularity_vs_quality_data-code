These spoons are pretty, but that's kind of where it ends.The bowl of the spoon is too deep for my 6 month old, probably better for an older kid who knows how to eat.Each time he opens his mouth, the food goes to the bottom of the bowl of the spoon and he can't figure out how to get to it.I will come back to these when my baby is older.
