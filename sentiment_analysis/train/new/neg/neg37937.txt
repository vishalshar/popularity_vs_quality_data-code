I purchased this product for my daughter who was developing a flat spot on her head from sleeping on her back.  I wasn't thrilled with the effectiveness of the Noggin Nest, but was still glad I purchased it.  I use it in her carseat, bouncy seat, and when she's laying on the floor playing with toys.  Not sure if I would recommend this product because I didn't see any marked improvement, but it's worth a shot I suppose!
