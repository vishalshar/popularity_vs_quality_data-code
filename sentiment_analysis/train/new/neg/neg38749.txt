I am giving 2 stars because my son immediately took to the blanket. But, within 4 days of giving him the blanket, the seam between the satin and the rest of the blanket came apart! We were so upset because the cotton filling was all over the crib! Total choking hazardMy son is only 5 months, so I'm certain it wasn't him and his brute strength that ripped it open
