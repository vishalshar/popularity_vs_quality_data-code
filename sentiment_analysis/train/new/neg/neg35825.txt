Update : although this is my sons favorite thing to do, please be aware that the snapping clip on this that you adjust height with broke while my son was jumping, it was so scary and he landed on his butt thank god!  We have been using this since he was around 4 months and he is 11 months now and 23 lbs which is below weight limit of 28lbs. A carrabeener  clib would be more solid.  This my son's favorite part of his day, he absolutely loves his jumper, it makes us so happy to watch him in it. And he gets sleepy too in the evening after a good jump bonus for us.
