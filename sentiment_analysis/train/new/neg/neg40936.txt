I ordered this for my son, as he had been having issues with spit up and gas. I already had the smaller version, and it had been working well. After some time of using both of the bottles, though, they starting leaking a lot and the flow seemed to be much faster than my newborn could keep up with. I probably wouldn't purchase these again.
