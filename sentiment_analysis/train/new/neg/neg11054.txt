These bibs have a cleverly designed pocket and a secure attachment at the back of the neck, but that doesn't matter: my 8mo baby just grabs hold, and in one motion, rips them from her. The bib itself tears and there is no salvaging it. By the time we fasten the bib, she has already ripped it off. Very disappointing. We used Bibsters with previous kids--the fabric of those was much sturdier so they didn't tear, and they fastened with velcro rather than tape, so they were easy to re-use. I've heard that Bibsters are no longer the same, which is why we tried these, but for us, these aren't worth the money because they tear too easily.
