I got these as a gift from my grandmother for our son. I am so glad that she got them on clearance at Wal-mart instead of paying full price for them. We got them all charged up, and were so excited because they were supposed to be these great monitors. I thought since they were Sony, surely they would be good quality. I was sorely mistaken. They crackled and popped, and honestly, I couldn't hear the baby. Randomly they would squeal, so I couldn't sleep either. We tried changing the channels and moving the base around, but nothing helped. It would even pick up the sound from the air conditioning unit outside my son's room, which is something you can barely hear while standing in the room. I ended up turning the thing off and bringing the baby into my room. I wanted to take a sledgehammer to them, but my husband wouldn't let me. Heehee... My husband got online the following morning and bought a set from Avent, and those are the best monitors ever! I wish I had had those for my first child.
