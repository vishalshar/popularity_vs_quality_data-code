A crucial piece was missing rendering the product useless.  The instructions are not at all clear, they are cluttered and confusing.  Quality control is non-existent, extremely poor fit and finish and materials for the price.  I would not consider ever buying one of their products again after this fiasco.  After putting together countless pieces of do it yourself furniture over the last 3 decades, I can say that this is the worst I have ever seen.  It's going back in the same flimsy box with the same cheap packing materials it came in.  Very disappointed with this purchase.
