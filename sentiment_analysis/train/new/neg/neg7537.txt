The concept is great!, I love the hook and design overall, however, our toilet seat hole is contoured and it is wider at the top and narrower at the bottom.  The widest part of the hole measures 7.5" and it is 11.5" long.  I can fit this potty seat in but then I can't push down the green handle, so its unstable.  Apparently most of the potty seats that are bestsellers here on Amazon do not fit these newer contoured seats.  My best bet is to lift up the toilet seat and get this one, Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up, instead of trying to find one that fits on top of the existing toilet seat.Update 04/21/2014: I ended up also returning the Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up.  Even with the entire toilet seat up, the Step up seat is still slightly wiggly.  The reason is because the elongated toilet with the set up has too much extra room so the seat slides a little up and down each time my son tries to use it.In the end we could not find a suitable seat that had side handles that my toddler can hold on to that we liked.  We ended up buying the "Bemis 1583SLOW Elongated NextStep White SLOW Closing Potty Seat" with the "Growing Up Green Wood Step Stool, Natural".  This works great, except we lose the handles on the seat but gain stability.
