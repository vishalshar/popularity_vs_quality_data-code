I thought that this would be a great toy for my at the time 7m old son. He does enjoy the little stuffed toys specifically the phone. The large wolf itself has not really become a favorite. My 3yr old daughter loves the little red riding hood and plays with her often. Over all it has worn well and though not a favorite, my children play with the small toys about once a week. For the cost I feel that perhaps buying some small stuffed toys from a department store would have been more practical.
