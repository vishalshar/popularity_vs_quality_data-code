I bought this for my 1 year old when she was about 8 months old.  She didn't have much interest in it then, and even less now.  It's a little hard to hold for an 8 month old, she can hold it now but doesn't really want to...and she never liked to chew on it at all...the eyes and nose are hard plastic so watch out when they wave it around (if they get a good enough grip on it to do so)
