Used this device for a good 4 months before it started going wacko on me. I lost the ability to control the mouse cursor, the keypad became unresponsive and the device just became a total pain in the butt to use.Also the two halves that make the device started coming apart. I constantly had to snap the thing back together.For a cheap keyboard it worked pretty well until it started falling apart.
