As a new mother, I thought this ball and cube set was adorable.  The recommended age was 3mos+, so I imagined it being perfect for my 3 month old daughter and expected her to actually *play* with it.  Consequently, I was very dissapointed when all she did was clutch the toys and took no interest when I rolled the ball and cube towards her.  At around 6 mos, I gave up on her liking them and I packed them away for the next baby only to pull them out a few weeks ago.  Now, at 18 Months of age, she is nuts about them!  Throwing them into the air and bouncing the soft colorful ball across the floor to me.  I was amazed at her interest and came back here to check on the review I had written months ago... when I discovered the age span was 3mos - 2 years.  I wish I had known that last year!  To sum up, if I had known then what I know now, I would buy this set again - only I wouldn't expect to see her actually playing with the ball and cube til she was older.  I guess the only advice I can pass along is, the recommended age seems to be set very young and don't worry if your baby is really not interested... because someday, he or she will be. :)
