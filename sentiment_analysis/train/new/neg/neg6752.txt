Heard good things about these cups only to be disappointed. They leak like crazy. My son sat one down on the highchair a little too hard and I ended up with a face full of milk even though I was a good three feet away from him. My cheap take in toss never do that. When on its side it pours out like crazy. The only redeemable quality of this product is the lid stays on and would be a good cup for older children
