At first we LOVED this high chair. It was comfortable, easy to clean, and converted easily from high chair to booster seat. But after washing the cover two times (following instructions) the leather started coming off in patches. Now the leather is coming off in large chunks and the underlying material gets caked with food that is impossible to clean. Replacement covers are not available or we would buy one of those. But now we are forced to throw away this high chair and get a new one after spending $150. Very disappointed in this quality.
