Pros- Does the job great! I mean excellent! Better then any other aspirator I've used. My daughter is 18 months. It works like a gem!Cons-I hate how you have to connect it to your own home vacuum. I just think its weird and loud.My daughter is terrified by it because she hates the vacuum. So make sure your kids like the vacuum and get them use to the aspirator. Because it does looks very different from most aspirator.I don't like cleaning it because there's too many parts.You also have to make sure you don't lose any of the parts.For the most part it works great but you do have to deal with all the cons.
