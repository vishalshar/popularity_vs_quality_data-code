I have used this stroller for the past 8 months (since my son was born).  For the first 6 months, we used it as a travel system with the Companion infant seat, and I loved it.  It handled so well, was surprisingly light to push, and was easy to use.  However, when we began to use the stroller with the seat that comes with it, I was extremely disappointed!  The stroller takes up an enormous amount of room in the trunk of my SUV and it's so incredibly heavy that I can barely lift it in and out of the car.  Also, the sunshade is virtually nonexistent.  I have recently replaced it with a Joovy Kooper (which I love!) to keep in my car, and will be keeping the Vigour at home for walks around our neighborhood.
