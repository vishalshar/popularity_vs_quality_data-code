For starters I hate getting something damaged right out of the box. It was mostly cosmetic but there were a lot of scuffs. One chunk is deep enough that it's sharp if you rub your finger over it which I don't like. Not too beat up to return but annoying.Second, I borrowed this same soother just a few years older from a friend before I bought it to make sure it was a hit with the LO. It worked magic, he falls asleep to it every night on the softest volume and wakes up and turns it on in the mornings when he is hanging in the crib. Score! So fast forward to buying it myself and this comes in...a little damaged and TOTALLY different noises. Not the soothing jungle noise that he's used to but a loud motor that is SO noisey you can't hear the "soothing" over it when it's on the softest setting. Totally different experience than the older model. To drown it out the volume has to be way up...not easy to put a baby to sleep with, right?! The solution would be turning off the moving parts but he loves them! It's half the entertainment. I'm disappointed to see how much quality is failing here but I guess with it being the one of the cheaper soothers, you get what you pay for.One pro: even with Amazon Prime it came overnight.
