We bought this crib for our daughter before she was born -- and until she got older, it was fantastic, I loved it.  But she was an early crawler (5 months), early walker (9 months), and is extremely intelligent and independent for her age.  At 18 months, she realized that she could loosen the crib railing by shaking back and forth against it and pulling on it -- ultimately loosening the screws and breaking the plastic sliders as well as breaking the railing off the track so that we can't lock it into the up position.  Now at 20 months, we had to move her to her big girl bed already -- which she was ready for in terms of sleeping and being comfortable in it, but we were not ready as now she can get up and dink around in her room while we are asleep.  I'm not very happy that this happened so early.  It should have been built tougher.  Aside from that, it was built nice, looked pretty, easy to put together and adjust, easy to move the railing up and down, and easy to move around the room on the casters.  I would recommend it to most people as long as they are prepared to have their child move to a toddler bed at a year and a half.
