Smaller than expected. Dimensions listed under technical details are for the packaging, and none are given in the item description.I guess I should have known from the photo, but it is sort of hard to tell that way.I would expect toy straps to give you a bit more leeway. If this is strapped to a toy bar and the kid leans back into the stroller, the toy won't even come close to reaching. At least you can link them up.They will also work for keeping toys nearby when he's in his carseat at least.
