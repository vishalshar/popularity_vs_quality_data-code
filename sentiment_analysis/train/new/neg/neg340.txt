The swing isn't as compact as you'd think it would be.The arc of the swing only varies from a 6 inch movement (lowest setting) to a 10 inch movement (highest setting).The motor is really noisy.  The whole reason why I bought this was so that I could bring the sleeping baby out of the car, then put her in this swing so that she couldnt tell that she had stopped moving.  Well, because the motor is so loud, and right by her head, it would wake her up every time.  Maybe if she fell asleep with that rhythmic clicking, she could stay asleep, but its not a noise you want to start making while trying to keep a baby asleep.  I hardly ever use it because of this.  I mean, how often do you need your baby to fall asleep BEFORE you start driving?
