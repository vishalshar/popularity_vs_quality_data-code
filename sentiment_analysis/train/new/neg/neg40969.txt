before I start I'd like to mention that I only have three months of cloth diapering experience.i first saw this diaper on zulily but purchased it here on amazon for its more affordable price. I received the item as it said I would in the time frame I was given.the texture of the outer lining definitely beats my bumgenius but the overall quality comes short when compared to it as well. I guess you can say that it isn't fair to compare this to bumgenius diapers so I'll also add that I prefer to use my prefolds before I use this. of the three months that I have had this, I probably used it just twice because of its leakage issue. like others have mentioned, the opening of the leg is too big for my three month old who averages 46% in height and 52% in weight. the last time I successfully used this without any leak was when I used it as a shell over my prefolds...
