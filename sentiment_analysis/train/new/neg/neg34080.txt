I have a couple Wubanub pacifiers that I love. I ordered this because it have options for other pacifiers and also for the teether when my son gets older. Maybe it will work ok when he gets older but he is 8 weeks old and still uses Soothie pacifiers, while it does attach to the soothe, because of the way it attaches it actually pulls the pacifier out of my sons month, not very helpfulâ€¦Hopefully when he gets older I can use it, but for now it just sits on the shelf.
