I purchased these in July of 2016 and have procrastinated writing my review. At the time the description did not say that it does not fit the oxo 2-in-1 so I'm glad to see they've updated the description. I would not have purchased if I had seen it.Now, I have 4 brands of potties. It does not fit the IKEA potty or the Potette potty (in the way that the bag is intended to be attached). One reviewer was able to come up with their own solution for the  Potette but that is not personally acceptable to me for a few dollars difference to have a possible mess on my hands and defeats the purpose of the bag for me. It also did not fit my summer infant potty very well. The only potty it fit was the Bjorn of which I have 2 (both borrowed and could be requested back). I purchased these to go into my car potty for emergencies- so for the Potette or the IKEA potty and they're pretty much useless. Very shallow. I am not big in plastic bags in the first place but I'm going to hold onto them for $7 and I'm sure I'll find uses over the years with 3 kids. I ended up getting a small pack of the Potette ones and haven't had to use any of them yet.Maybe a helpful tip - I started out using the potty chairs and then switched to the built in toilet seats like the Mayfair (which is nicer than the summer infant but I have both). While I was using the potty chairs I used a scrubbing bubbles flushable cleaning wipe to clean the inside of the potty chair after each use which kills 99% of germs and flushed it down with the dumped contents.
