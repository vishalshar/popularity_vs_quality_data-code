I am a research maven and tried every stroller.  This one is perfect for us.  We  ought this for a family trip with an infant (6 months) and a tall toddler (2.5 years old).  The stroller rides like a dream, it's sturdy, the fold is incredible.  We yes it for trips and  family walks around our hilly neighborhood.  Yes, basket is a little challenging but easy trade off for all the great features. Plus Amazon had a great price and shipped in two days with Prime.  The only problem is that the stroller keeps getting stuck in the closed position.  It has nothing to do with the lock but seems more like a issue with the internal folding mechanism.  I don't know what it is but the challenge is I don't have any recourse to get it fixed.  It has been six months-- too late to return but this stroller should not break or malfunction after 6 months of light use.  We have not abused the stroller in any way and it is kept inside.  So while the stroller is great- I do not recommend unless you can purchase with a warranty or a way to deal with any problems should they arise at a local store.
