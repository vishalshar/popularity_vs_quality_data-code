I often dismiss negative reviews of tech products if there are enough good ones to outweigh the negatives -- figuring that most people have no idea what they're doing.  Well, this time I got burned enough to write a review!My unit worked so-so for 3 weeks (correctly, but it is poorly designed as I review below), I was pretty disappointed though, but I figured the deal was done and I had to keep it.  Then, after three weeks it just totally stopped working.  It would establish link between base and remote but after 5 minutes drop out.  I was secretly thrilled to have a chance to return the unit as defective for a return.  Best possible outcome.Pros:Small parental unitCons:Only digital zoom/pan, which is pretty much worthlessClunky interface with loud beeps after each keypress.  The software on the handset is horrible.Green flashing light that your baby could easily be kept awake byOften blurry reception when just a room away.  Goes in and out.Hideous battery life on the portable unit.  Probably 20 minutes with the video running.Its expensiveBroke after 3 weeks.  Great quality, safety first.  How about putting quality first.My advice: steer clear of this one.
