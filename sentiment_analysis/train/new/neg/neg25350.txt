This did not fit with  my citymini.  it only has a strap in the back that you presumably hook onto the back of your stroller, except my stroller doesn't have an "open" back that accommodates a strap.  That's all fine and dandy if the back is sturdy enough to stay up on it's own, like the jjcole ones, which also has the same design, but it doesn't, while the jjcole one does.  plus the jjcole one definitely is thicker.
