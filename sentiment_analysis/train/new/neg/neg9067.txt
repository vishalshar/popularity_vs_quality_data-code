We wanted to get a potty our son would "enjoy" and liked that this one would play music as a "reward" for going in the potty. Well, the music often plays when we are not even in the room! We disabled the music because it would go off in the middle of the night. Other than that, it is a potty and fine for a potty training toddler.
