My lactation consultant recommended I use the Lansinoh bottles and corresponding nipples because they are supposed to mimic a breast. One of the nipples cracked across the hole (definitely defeating the purpose of "slow-flow") within a few days of arriving at my house. Luckily, it seemed to only be a defect in one of the nipples. The other 3 nipples I bought seem to be holding up well. Amazon customer service was very nice and replaced the defective nipple.
