I think I looked at every diaper bag on the market before purchasing this one. After doing a lot of research and reading tons of reviews, I'd decided that nothing was 100% perfect and this was the bag that would best fit my needs. The good thing is, it does. It is attractive and I get compliments on it frequently. The straps are comfortable and an appropriate length. There are tons of pockets inside and out, with plenty of places to organize things for both the baby and myself. There is a zipper on the main compartment and several of the outside pockets. The changing pad is nice. The bad thing is, this bag has not held up well at all. It started fraying badly on the bottom corners after just the first month of use, which only included a few outings to the doctor's office. I'm so disappointed because this bag had pretty much every feature I wanted and the price was good. However, I could never recommend this bag to anyone knowing that it would start showing wear after just one month of light use.
