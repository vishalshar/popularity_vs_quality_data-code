I purchased this diaper caddy two years ago.  It was attractive and I thought it would meet my needs.  When I received it two years ago, one side fits a standard wipe box while the other side holds diapers.  The drawer was a nice idea but it was difficult to open.  Two years later, the glue started to lose its adhesive qualities.  Although I tried to glue it back, it still falls apart.  I ended up recently purchasing a Trend Lab diaper caddy which has proven to be far more useful and can be repurposed easier than this caddy once my son is out of diapers.  The Trend Lab diaper caddy also folds up for easier storage.
