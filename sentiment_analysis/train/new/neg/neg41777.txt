This highchair has a bar above the leg openings that makes it very difficult to put your baby in the chair. You have to bend the baby legs to guide them into the leg openings of the highchair. My baby has some chubby thighs and it is very difficult & akward to get her in and out of this chair. I do not recommend the chair at all! I received this through Target.com as a baby gift. I didn't open the box and put the chair together until my baby turned 5 months and was ready to use the highchair. Unfortunetly, this was after Target.com's 45 day return policy. My husband called Target and the manager agreed to issue us a store credit for the chair. Great customer service from Target! I am now in search of another highchair that isn't so difficult to use.
