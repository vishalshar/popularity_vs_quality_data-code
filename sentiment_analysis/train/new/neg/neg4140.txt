I love the idea of placing something in our long drive way to stop cars  while kids are playing. Also like the idea of something that folds but this is simply too lightweight. One good gust and I was chasing it across the yard.I guess you could put something weighted in it, but I want easy.My girls loved to play INSIDE it, not the ideal safety situation. The Step2 Kids sign did the trick Step2  KidAlert V.W.S. and the kids leave it alone now.
