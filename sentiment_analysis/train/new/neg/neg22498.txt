The sheet is fine, but don't buy it if you want something that is really soft and will hold up for a long time. I purchased three sheets from Serena & Lily when I was pregnant and have used them for 19 months now. They been washed once a week, sometimes more and still after 19 months feel like they did after their first wash. They are crazy soft, the material is really strong and there has been no fading at all. I just got the Zutano and washed it yesterday. The reason I bought it is because I've purchased clothing by Zutana and have always been please with the quality, feel and style. I knew pretty much right when I took this sheet out of the package that the quality of it didn't compare to my other sheets. After the wash, I'm certain that this thing will not hold up and quit frankly it's not soft at all. Very disappointed. Going to stick with Serena & Lily for my next purchase.
