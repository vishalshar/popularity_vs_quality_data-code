This is very cute in person. Please note it's a TODDLER bedding. When I bought the bedding I thought it was for a twin bed. It's not so I gave it to my other child since it won't fit my oldest bed. The sheets are very bright and a good material. The comforter is very thin. Not a lot of thickness or warmth. So she still needs a thick blanket under it. Super cute print though. It still looks good in her room.
