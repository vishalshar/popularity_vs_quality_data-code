I received this bag as a gift for my baby shower and it's the best diaper bag for the compact size and the amount of items that can fit inside.  I plan to buy one for my sister-in-law's shower, and have recommended it to friends. The only complaint I have is that the adjustable shoulder strap does not "grip" or stay adjusted, meaning that it fits my 6'4" husband well but it slips really easily off of my shoulders... a minor problem since I usually stow the bag beneath the stroller.HOWEVER, it almost pains me to purchase another one of their products because of my experience: the JJ Cole personnel treated me very poorly!!!!  My bag arrived with a defect: the inner lining that separates one compartment from another was not attached, so objects inserted into one section fell down into the one below.  When I contacted the company to tell them that I received a flawed bag, they told me that they'll send me a new one, charge me the price of the bag, but then refund me once I returned the flawed bag.  I thought this was strange but since it would remedy the problem and result in no charge to me (or so I thought)I went with it.  Well, they wouldn't cover the shipping cost of $10, and wrote me back a REALLY NASTY e-mail when I asked for the reimbursement!!! I suppose I'm naive but I thought that when a company aims to correct their mistake they follow through, but you cannot count on JJ Cole for that.
