This container is extremely small. I'm sure if I'd read the fine print a little better I would have known that. However the opening to which the snacks come out is also very small. My son can't stick his hand inside to grab the snacks. He has to turn it over and dump it into his hand, and you know what that means! Food everywhere! I'm pretty bummed because it's cute and fits in my diaper bag well.
