My little one loves this but I had to rinse it with cold water because she dropped it to the ground. I was really disappointed to see that the white background turned red - perhaps from a few drops of water that made their way into the clear sphere. Not sure how safe it is! This is sad because my baby enjoyed it so much. Still 3 stars for entertainment factor.
