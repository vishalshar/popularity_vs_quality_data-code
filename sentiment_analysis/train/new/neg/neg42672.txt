We have had this for about 6 months now. We love the looks and the fact that it is easy to clean. However, everything else seems to be a problem. The break does not work well on hardwood floors. I called up Boon customer service and they were of no help. Last week, the brake wheel came off. Also, I feel there is not enough room between my child and the tray. There are two different settings for locking the tray in place, however, even on the farthest setting, the tray pushes against her tummy.
