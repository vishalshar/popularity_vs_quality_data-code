When this came I loved it. The color made it look like a stone necklace, very pretty, but obviously it was actually soft and chewable. My daughter loved it and it kept her from scratching me while she was nursing. Unfortunately, the first time she gave it a good yank, the clasp came apart and after that it came apart on its own all the time. I lost it a few days later. I assume it just came undone and fell off without me noticing. I'll probably get another one, but maybe a different brand hoping for a more reliable clasp.
