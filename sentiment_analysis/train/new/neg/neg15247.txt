I was excited to buy this rubber ducky as my son has fallen in love with them. I was looking for a rubber ducky that would actually sit upright whilst in the water, and wouldn't have to be tossed after getting mold in it.  This seemed to fit the bill!However...while it does a better job than some of the other rubber duckies I've bought at staying upright, that's not saying much.  Instead of floating upside down like many of them do, it just floats with its butt up in the air.  Better than the others...but not what I was looking for.It also has a hole for water, which surprised me given the reviews that stated that it did not.  I actually thought that I might have bought the wrong product when I received it, but decided to give it a try (it's not the wrong product, but they appear to have changed the design). Despite all of my best efforts, the ducky has developed a bad case of mold so I've had to toss it. As a certain political candidate who shall not be named often writes, "Sad!"  I'm on the hunt for another.
