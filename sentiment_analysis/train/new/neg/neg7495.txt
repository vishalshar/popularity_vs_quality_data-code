We bought this for our daughter when she was just an infant.  As she started getting older, she started turning it on herself in the middle of the night or early in the morning.  She loved laying there watching it.  Now she is 17 months and about a month ago, it started making a loud noise when the motor is running.  It's attached to her crib so it isn't like she carries it around and dropped it.  The noise has gotten so loud, you can barely hear the music.  I hate to buy another at this point, but she really does love it.I loved the fact she could turn it on herself, but I hate how loud the motor is even when you first get it.  I have to agree with the other reviews, it takes a new set of batteries about once a week.
