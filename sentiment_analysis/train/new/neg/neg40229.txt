I bought these to use as burp cloths and really liked them so ordered another set.  Unfortunately the second batch I ordered twi months later seems inferior to the first one I received.  I'm not sure why they are different, but the second one had clothes that were poorly edged; where the cloth was folded under and sewn, the cloth was not folded properly or was too short; the cloth is frayed and falling apart after the first wash.  I compared these new ones to the old ones and the first batch had edges that looked well made with even stitching and good 1/4 inch edge.  The second batch had edges that are much thinner and variable (so sewing was not straight or even) leaving some of the edges to fray badly.
