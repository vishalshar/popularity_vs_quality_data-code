I have toddler triplets and we travel a good bit. I bought this item when they were 16 months and I could not get it to stay on the carseat (they are Eddie Bauer carseats). When I did get it to stay on it pushed their heads forward and they were obviously more uncomfortable with it than without it.I definitely would recommend NOT purchasing this item. It has a very poor design and doesn't work.
