This is the second sippy cup I got from this brand. Exactly the same model, but for some reason I really don't understand, some dirt keeps appearing every time I wash it in my dishwasher. It is sticky and I spend my good 5 minutes cleaning it. Then I put it in the dishwasher again, and the dirt comes out again. After 4 times doing it, I toss it. Gross.
