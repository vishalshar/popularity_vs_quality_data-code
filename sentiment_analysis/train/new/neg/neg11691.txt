While the design is cute, a growth chart -- being a product that is solely intended to *measure* the actual growth of our little ones -- isn't worth a heck of an anything if it doesn't have accurate measurements on it!I ordered this because for some reason finding a cute, yet reasonably priced, non-solid wood growth chart seems to be an impossible task these days. Then I went back to look at it (I think I was copying the link to send to my husband) and I happened to look at the reviews. DUH! I ignored my own best advice -- to never buy without looking at the reviews first -- and paid the price for it. Many people mention the incorrect measurements, and I just totally overlooked those when I hit "buy". So I pretty much knew I'd be returning it, but it was on its way.So when it arrived, I opened it, unfolded it, and held it up to a tape measure -- and...voila. There were the totally off growth markers and measurements printed on it.What the H, people? How hard it is to make a freaking growth chart?I packaged it right back up, cursing under my breath the entire time. Sent it right back to Amazon. SO ANNOYING. SO LAME. SUCH A WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, AND MONEY.I'm surprised they still carry this product, as I imagine it costs them quite a bit to pay for return shipping for such a defective product!
