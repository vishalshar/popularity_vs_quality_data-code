I just received this item today, and it is nothing like the photos. First of all, it says size 0-12 months (which is a huge size range), but sadly, the bottoms don't even fall in that category! Width wise, maybe they would fit a baby. Length wise, I held the bottoms up to me (and I'm 25) and they would come to my belly button if I put them on. I have three children, and this wouldn't fit any of them in a stage from 0-12 months. Also, the cute flower is not on the hat. It is an ugly knit flower. Maybe there is a seller out there with this specific item, but the one I received when I ordered is not made to fit a human. PS- I have never taken the time to write a review. But I was very disappointed.
