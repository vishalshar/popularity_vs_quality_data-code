Dear parents, who want to buy this toy for their toddlers! Please notice, that this toy doesn't make any sound at all! It looks nice and my daughter was excited first 3 minutes, but than she understood that there is nothing to do with this thing but to throw it downstairs from the second floor. It is the only way you can play with it, I'm really disapointed!
