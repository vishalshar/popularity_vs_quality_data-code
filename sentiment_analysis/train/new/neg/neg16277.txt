The concept sounds very nice, but in practice this didn't work well for us at all.  For one, after countless tries we never really got the strong footprint seen in the marketing picture.  We just couldn't get that amount of depth and detail, especially in the toes.  There's just no way we were going to push down on our baby's foot hard enough to try to get it.  Second, after drying, not very much sand stuck to the plaster.  The plaster had a number of bald spots, and if you so much as touched the sand which did stick to the dried plaster, that sand would fall off.  Third which was the most troublesome was that the frame didn't come with a glass.  There's nothing to prevent anyone (including baby) from touching the plaster and rubbing more sand off, and nothing protecting the carpet/floor from sand accumulating under the place the frame is hung.  The frame currently sits on a table in our basement face-side up to keep from losing the rest of the sand, but where no one can enjoy it.  It's unfortunate, because the concept is a good one.
