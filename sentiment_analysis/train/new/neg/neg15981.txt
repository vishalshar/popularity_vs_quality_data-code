The concept is wonderful -  stacking animals that a child has to engage both hands to pull apart and place back together.  The chime in the elephant is very pleasant and the rattle in the zebra isn't obnoxious like many other rattles.  The animals are fun to look at and play with either together or apart.  My only complaint is that the velcro doesn't stick after about a day.  So after that first day of playing with it and stacking and unstacking the animals, you can't stick them together anymore.
