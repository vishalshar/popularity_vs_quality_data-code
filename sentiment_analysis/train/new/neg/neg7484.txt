These has good protection.  They saved some of the pants as my baby puts holes in the knees when she crawls on the ceramic floor.  However, they seem to constrict knee movement as they are a little tight.  Also, the traction stickers easily fell off.  Sometimes, the pads would move below the knees.  This is an "okay" product that I will likely skip out on if I have another baby.
