I got these for my granddaughter because, 5 years earlier, I'd had them for my grandson. They are comfortable to hold, the soft plastic flexes but doesn't scratch or trap the baby's hand as he puts it in and pulls it out. The slats cut into the top are flexible enough to bend but not that soft that food (usually) falls out. I've tried other brands, and they do not compare in ease of access or flexibility with this one.My problem is not so much with what comes in the set, but with what now doesn't come with the set.My grandson's set came with an additional top. It was a flat and solid lid made of semi-clear,  flexible but sturdy plastic, a little heavier than a margarine top. This lid went on top of the snack trap lid that the baby pulls the food through. The advantage of having this second top was that you could prepare the snack ahead of time and have the prepared container in your diaper bag without leaving it to the last minute. All you get now is a very thin transparent plastic covering that has about a 2" hole on it. It is completely useless. Because of the opening, it doesn't seal out humidity and the material is one that is so thin that it's not only useless, but a scratching hazard. (similar to the paper cup tops McDonalds uses for sodas). The manufacturer probably saved a lot of $ by not providing a better quality lid but, in doing so, greatly diminished the functionality of his product.
