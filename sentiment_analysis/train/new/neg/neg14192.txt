I really like these accept for how big the "berry" part of it is. My son wants to put it in his mouth like a nookie. He is 7 months old and this thing takes up most of his mouth. His mouth is just an average mouth. He has been teething for a while and he wants to chew hard, but this is hard for him to get in there without it taking up too much space. I think it would be ideal for children 1 year and up. Much younger and it is hard for them to use properly. I have seen other teethers that I think work better then these for younger children. Aside from the size the nubby texture is good, and it is pretty flexible.
