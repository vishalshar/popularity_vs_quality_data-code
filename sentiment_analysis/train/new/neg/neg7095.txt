I had ordered it for my 4 year old son to carry him during hiking trips. My overall feeling was that it was a decent idea but the design has some flaws and would not be suitable for a lot of people.Pros :The quality of materials used is of good quality and feels well madeCons:There are a couple of design limitations. First, the harness for the child has no buttock support so the child has to stand and balance himself on a steel rod the whole time. The idea of having the child stand up and have a clear view appeared good in theory but in practice didn't work that well and my child was tired quickly trying to stand and balance himself on the steel bar (which does sway a little as you move) and he got off after 20-30 min of use.The second factor, that others have also mentioned is that there is no load bearing waist straps (for the adult carrying the child) and the complete weight of the child falls on the shoulder. This was not an issue for me as my child did not stay for longer than 20-30 min on it but I can imagine it become tiresome for the adult for long trips.Overall I would say, it may make sense if you have a child 5-6 year old who can stand upright and balance himself for longer periods of time. Kids smaller than 5 may find it too tiring to stand and ride, and kids above 6 may be too heavy to carry in this harness.
