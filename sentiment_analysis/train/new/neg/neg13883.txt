We had to abandon the convenient disposable night time undies.  Based on the reviews we bought Mother-Ease and Super Undies (overnight) from Amazon.Super Undies started out the favorite. They are cute, soft, and comfortable, and less bulky. If you're using a bedwetting alarm that attaches to the undies, you can place the sensor inside and change only the undies when your child wakes to the alarm.Super Undies cons:  If you enjoy matching socks, this ones for you.  After washing you need to gather the desired number of liners (2-3 to come close to Mother-Ease absorbency.) and place them in the undies.  Not a big deal unless you're doing the laundry for 5 people (including a bedwetter or two!) My son needs help to get them on and keep the liners in place, otherwise they'll be bunched up or sticking out the leg-whole. They leak.  Those soft comfortable fleece sides, or maybe the seams where it's sewn in are the weakest link. We always have wet pajamas and sheets when we use these overnight. (yes, following proper washing instructions, no fabric softeners blah blah blah,)They help, but don't get the job done completely.  They seem more like a day-time training pant and now stay in the back of the drawer, only to be used when there's no other option and in combination with a sheet-saver pad.Mother-Ease:  Everything is sewn in place.  When you pull them out of the laundry, just turn them right-side-out and they're ready to go.  They work as well as or better than disposable overnight pants, and wash nicely.  Bottom line: We have dry pajamas and sheets with these.Mother-Ease cons:  They are not cute, they're bulky, and plain white.  So if you'd take cute over dry and comfortable, then go with cute and enjoy the extra laundry.  If you don't care if your kid looks like a 70's baby, and just that they stay dry enough to get everyone a good nights sleep with less laundry, these are for you. In fact they work so well my kids think its a good reason to sleep in places other than their own beds.  "Mom can I sleep _______? I'm wearing the white ones."
