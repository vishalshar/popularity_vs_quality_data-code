I absolutely LOVE the format of this album, as well as the cute John Lennon designs!!!!!!!!That said, I MUST tell you about the poor quality binding.  I wrote in this baby book once a month for DD's first few months.  After about 3-4 months the pages started getting loose, and finally after 6 months I took it back to Babies R Us.  I showed them the problem and they agreed that it looked disastrous (most of the pages had fallen out completely).  They let me exchange it for the loose-leaf baby book, and they even let me keep all the pages I had written in including the page with DD's footprints!  While I appreciated that BRU provided excellent customer service, I am very dissatisfied that they would continue to sell such a poor quality product (it's still on their shelves now, an entire year later!).  I hope that the manufacturers acknowledge this problem and fix it very soon.I am very satisfied with my loose-leaf John Lennon baby book.  It is a bit thicker (due to the 3 ring binding), but it's SO convenient!  You can move the order of the pages, which I really appreciate!  And it even comes with some clear pages that hold sentimental items and pictures!  I would rate the loose-leaf one with a rating of 5!!!!
