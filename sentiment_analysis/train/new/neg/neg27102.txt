I was so excited to receive this seat.  I have been looking for and researching convertible seats for over a week, and I chose this one after a friend had highly recommended it to me and reading reviews on multiple sites.  It looks great, my husband was particularly excited about its design, I believe he said it looks like it should go in a race car.  It was easy to install; it took a minute to figure out how to move the shoulder straps up but once i found the door in the back it was super easy to do that too.  My only complaint (and the reason I am sending it back) is the crotch latch does not allow enough room for my son to grow.  He is six months old and 20lbs and it is already VERY snug in that area.  Bums me out, I love this seat except for that and unfortunately it just isn't going to work for my growing boy.
