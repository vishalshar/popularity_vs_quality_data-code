Very specific to sizes. If you have to use extensions they do not have much room to be flexible as far as sizing goes. 3it was too small without all of them and too big with all of them. My husband is pretty handy and was able to cut some bars off to make it work. Now that it is all custom fitted we love it. The latch is easy enough for my 8 year old to use too! Just was very difficult for us to install. We have a very old house so maybe our arch is an off size
