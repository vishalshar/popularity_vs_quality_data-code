My baby girl happened to be 27 lb 8 months old...not fat, not huge, but dense :) Even my iron arms and shoulders could not handle those walks...Sides are a weak spot.... Baby tries to seat down or pick something up, looses the balance and then can easily fall. Those belts hardly can prevent baby from falling...Keep your eyes on a baby 100% of the time.
