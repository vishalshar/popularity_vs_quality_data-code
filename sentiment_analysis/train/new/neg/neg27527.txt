After spending far too much time examining and weighing the merits and flaws of various seatback organizers, I decided to get this one. It sounded like it had a lot of great features, and since my car lacks cupholders in the back seat, I liked the idea of its capacity for holding water bottles.The organizer fits the backseat just fine, but installing it was something of a pain as I had to tie the bottom strap around my bucket seats as I don't have any metal supports at floor level. This isn't too big of an annoyance as I don't notice the strap when I'm sitting in the driver's seat, even though it's stretched across the back.My big complaint about the organizer is the large pocket at the top, which is attached only with velcro. The velcro is not very strong, and this pocket tends to flap open, which means it's hanging over my kids' laps. My four-year-old overfilled his and the sides of the pocket ripped and frayed. My ten-year-old was more careful about what she put in there, but hers is also shredding on one side. This means the main pocket hangs down and is useless, also rendering the smaller zippered pockets useless. I'm very disappointed with this product and wish I'd gone with something else.
