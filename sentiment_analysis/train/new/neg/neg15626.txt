I LOVE the traditional grovia magic stick for general rash prevention so I thought I would give this one a go for when my son actually has a rash. It smells nice and works in the same way as the traditional sick (horray no gooey fingers!) But to be honest, I'm not sure that it really does much to help the diaper rash (my son still seems red even after a couple of applications) and it's also very 'chalky' so you have to rub it on quite firmly to get the balm onto the baby. I have had better luck with other zinc-based diaper rash creams.
