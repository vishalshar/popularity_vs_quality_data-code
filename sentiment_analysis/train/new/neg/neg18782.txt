The mobile is cute, but the music box seems to be either defective or poorly made.  After a little over a month of use, the switch that controls the "on" and "off" slips into the "off" position while in use.  Sometimes it goes all the way off and other times it slips partially and causes the song to skip or slow down.  Additionally the wind up crank seems to get a little stuck or jammed while the music is playing, causing a really annoying clanking sound.  Overall, it's adorable and my son really likes it, but it is disappointing that it's breaking after just a little over a month of light use.
