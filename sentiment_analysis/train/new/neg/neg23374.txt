This seat is very hard and leaves marks on my toddler's bum.  I had to go ahead and buy a cushioned one so she might actually stay on the toilet for more than a few seconds.  It certainly hasn't helped with potty training, and due it my daughter's discomfort, it may have hindered it.  On the flip side, it seems easy to keep clean (though she hasn't actually gone to the bathroom on it yet!).
