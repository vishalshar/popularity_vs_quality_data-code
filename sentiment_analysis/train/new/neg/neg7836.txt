This wrap was not for my baby and me.I watched video after video and still could not get my baby in a correct position. This is supposed to be for infants and up, but for infants, many videos suggest using a string or a tie at the bottom of the wrap...seems like something that should be built in to take from infant to toddler. Also, with the straps being so long, they drag on the ground when you tie this on. Imagine being in a dirty parking lot or store and having the straps drag on the ground while you're holding your baby with one hand while trying to tie with the other.It would be convenient to have an option to put on the wrap, place your baby in it, then secure it, rather than trying to do both at the same time. Lastly, other brands make this exact same wrap for a much cheaper cost, and unfortunately I found that out after i purchased this one. Still on the hunt for the right wrap for my baby and me.
