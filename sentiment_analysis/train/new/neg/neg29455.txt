I just received this the day I had my grandson. Taking it out of the box, it's on the small side, though I chose this one because of the dimensions of the item (needed to fit my chair). It's lightweight plastic, easy to clean. The train track toy detaches from the tray. The child plays by pushing the train around the track- old fashioned play, which is good. It is easy to remove and replace the tray. They tray is dishwasher safe. The child security belts are lacking, especially if you have an escape artist. I will not leave my grandson unattended. It serves the purpose of dining, but I personally wouldn't leave a child in it to just sit. Now, my grandson was unsure of it. He's a year old and fit in it fine with the tray set at the middle adjustment. He could wiggle out of it, he tried.  If he's eating, he will sit just fine. It's on the "cheap" side, but for the money it will serve it's purpose for me.
