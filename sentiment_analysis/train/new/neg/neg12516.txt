I bought this harness as back up so if my child breaks free from holding my hand, she won't get lost in public places. The price is great, but the harness fastens with velcro. For a child big enough to walk, this could be a problem because the closure could potentially break open. The wrist strap also has a velcro closure. I like that it is so compact though. I also have a stuffed animal one that I can use on my other daughter, but it is bulky to store. If I had known the closure was velcro, I would not have bought it.
