I ordered this in spite of reading all of the negative reviews...I figured I could make it work! No luck..I wired the antennae together, took out the battery clips etc. and it's still not working correctly. The monitor in the next room causes it to turn on and off unexpectedly...waking my daughter and it only runs for 10 minutes at a time, which isn't long enough for her to fall into a "deep" sleep. I sooooo wanted to like this thing! I just can't turn the monitors off, so this isn't the crib vibrator for me. I broke down and purchased the "Sleep Tight Crib Soother" even though it's 5 times the price. I'm encouraged because it doesn't run on batteries and will run until I turn it off..although you should never use it for over an hour (I'll buy a timer). The company really needs to redesign this thing...make the remote unit wired to the other unit, have it run for at least a half an hour at a time, design it to run off of electricity and not batteries. The only plus for me was that it came on automatically if the baby made any noise. I'm done fiddling with it! Frustrating!
