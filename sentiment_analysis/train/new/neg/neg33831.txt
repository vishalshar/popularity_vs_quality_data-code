I bought this a few months ago, but discovered about a month ago, that it is no longer waterproof.  In fact, it even fooled me because it stayed clean and I later discovered the mattress pad below it was completely stained.  I'm throwing it away and buying a different brand.  I'm going to try Invacare which is a much cheaper brand (probably because it's not in the 'baby' category).UPDATE:  The Invacare brand worked as needed.  It has stayed waterproof & stains come out just fine.
