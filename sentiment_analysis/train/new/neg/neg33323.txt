You pay for what you get..... my son loves spongebob, and so of course it's a win with him! I thought the quilt/comforter would have more to it, it is really light weight, and has pretty much no filling. I didn't expect the sheets to be a very high thread count, and they weren't. For the price and the look on my 2 year olds face totally worth it...... even if it doesn't hold up for very long.
