First of all, the instructions say the number on the product corresponds to the number of scoops of formula.  This isn't the case at all - it corresponds to the number of ounces it makes as most formula scoops at 2 ounces/scoop.  This seems like it would result in a lot of (hopefully briefly) underfed babies.  Even then, it didn't correspond to the number of ounces either but this might be because of the kind of formula we're using.The product also doesn't make the operation of filling bottles with measured formula any quicker and tends to create the mess that I was trying to avoid.  Formula clumps like powdered sugar.  When trying to dump the clevascoop full of formula into the funnel, it tends to come out all at once and goes everywhere no matter how carefully I try to pour it.  Again, this could be the kind of formula but we used Similac for a while and it has a similar consistency.
