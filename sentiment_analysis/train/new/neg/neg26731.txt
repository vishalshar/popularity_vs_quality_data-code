I hate to say it because I really prayed that this would be the be all end all solution but it sadly is not.  An expensive binky catcher, yes but little more.  I suppose the younger the baby the better this product is suited.  My son is six and a half months old, this did not contain his arms or legs and certainly did not prevent him from bumping his head on the crib rails, (the whole reason I purchased this).  I laid him in his crib as I installed the product and arms and legs were protruding the boundries as I was finishing installation!  The foam at its highest point is only about 2 inches, not enough to protect baby's head.  Sorry.
