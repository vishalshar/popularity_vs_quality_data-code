I bought the Swaddle Designs muslin swaddle blankets on Zulily because they were on sale (obviously, I guess...) and they were so soft and work perfectly for what I wanted them for.  I purchased these as a second set because I find myself needing to wash the swaddles frequently with a breastfed, spitting-up, occasional blow-out-diaper baby.  Even after washing and drying them, they were so much rougher than the Swaddle Designs blankets that I didn't even want to consider wrapping my newborn up in them.  I immediately packed them up and sent them back to Amazon.  I only gave them two stars because the designs are so cute.  I do have the wrap-around burp cloths and bibs, which are also kind of rough but it doesn't bother me as much because they won't be tightly wrapped against her skin for long periods of time...
