I bought these directly from the One step ahead website because they were attractive and thicker than most mats.  I did my research first and since it had a favorable review I decided to buy it.  I wasn't turned off by the smell that others have commented on.What really irks me and makes me regret buying them is the fact that THEY PEEL!!!!The pretty sticker that makes it look like wood rips.  Our 8 month old keeps picking at it and trying to eat it!  I have to trim the ends with scissors so to minimize her ripping at it.Wish I bought another brand! Check out the picture I uploaded.  That is a square after I cut most of the peeled sticker off.  Very Disappointing.
