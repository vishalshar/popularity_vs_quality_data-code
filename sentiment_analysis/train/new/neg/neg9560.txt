I received this as a Christmas gift. Never opened it until 5 months later. It was easy to put together, but now I am unhappy with it. The so called 5 point harness seatbelt is a joke! It isn't easy to put on and by the time I got it on my very wiggly 11 month old, I was frustrated and about to put the whole thing back in the car and just carry my baby. The seat belt waist/T-strap rides up on my baby's chest and neck area and the shoulder straps are very easy for her to get caught in. My ten dollar umbrella stroller has an easier seat belt than this piece of junk! Also, the back of the seat/pad moves forward about a foot when my baby leans forward. She sits there and bounces back in forth front to back and it seems so unstable. There is no way to fix it either. I had a clerk at a professional babygear supply store look it over and she agreed it isn't made right. After being on hold for 40 minutes with In-Step I hung up and called back the next day and finally talked to a real person and they said they could send me a new seat/pad with a new seat belt but if I wasn't happy with the whole stroller in general that I would have to return it to Target. Target would only give me an instore credit because it has been over 90 days, so if I don't like Target's other strollers, I am stuck with it. The stroller looks very cool, drives very smooth and is lightwieght, but very unsafe in my opinion.
