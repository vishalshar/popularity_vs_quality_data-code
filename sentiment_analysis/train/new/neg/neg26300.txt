I love the look of this booster seat but the straps didn't keep my daughter in. I guess the way it is made my daughter is able to get herself out with no problem (she is 2 years old). So we don't even use the straps because she is more likely to fall working her way out of them than just by getting in and out of the seat on her own. I keep the straps tucked in so it looks better than having them hanging out. The seat is easy to keep clean. I do have to lift the cushion part of the seat to clean the crumbs that fall in there and lift the whole seat itself to clean everything that falls under it too. For the most part it is pretty easy to clean and it works fine for us.
