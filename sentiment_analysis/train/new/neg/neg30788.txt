Great pillow, I love it, it's been great for my pregnancy and I've had it since about 16 weeks I think. (Now 36)Many have complained about how the seam at the top of the pillow cuts into your shoulder, this is very true, but I'm such a short person (5'2) it doesn't bother me. The reason this seam cuts into your shoulder is because the case/cover is sewn straight across, instead of curved like it should be, because the pillow is curved shaped.Curious, I decided to look at some of the overpriced "replacement" covers the manufacturer makes for these pillows, and all the descriptions for the new covers touted the bonus feature of having that irritating straight seam be curved (as it should have been from the beginning).Um, not cool. It appears the manufacturer purposely made the default covers with a flaw to encourage buyers to also purchase their ridiculously expensive and over priced replacement covers! That's just fishy and dishonest in my opinion. It's a great pillow, but the price for a fully useable pillow apparently is higher than you think.
