I purchased this item through "Apple Green Baby" here on Amazon. I am giving the stars based on their performance (not the Boba's) I haven't even tried it out. I was sent the wrong color even though it clearly states "tweet" in the item description (a drop down choice wasn't even available) I have to wait for a shipping label, send back the item, wait for a refund, so I can order another, then actually order another, and wait for the item to get here. So much for using it on the trip this weekend!!What a pain, only giving two stars because Amazon resolved my problem quickly and it appears I can receive a refund... Lets hope I do "/
