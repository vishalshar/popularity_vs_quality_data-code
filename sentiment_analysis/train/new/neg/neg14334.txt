The overall concept of this little device is good.  My 6 month old baby loved using it right away.  BUT, after just one use the netting developed a small pea sized hole.  It seems that any additional usage will cause the hole to get even larger which could certainly lead to a choking hazard.  The netting really is quite frail and I'd be surprised if no one else experienced this problem.  In our case, my baby only used the product for maybe 10 minutes and she does not yet have teeth.  Obviously I will not be using this feeder anymore and it was a complete waste of money. I'm quite disappointed as my baby really did seem to enjoy using it.  Perhaps I will try the Munchkin brand though I read negative reviews on their netting as well.
