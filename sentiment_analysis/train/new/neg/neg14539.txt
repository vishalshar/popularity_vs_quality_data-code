Another reviewer said these are redundant and I can see their point. I bought them for my 2 1/2 year old daughter to play with during bathtime but I think I like them more than she does. She basically just pours water from one to another and I can see how that might get old after a few baths. But they also float in the water like rubber ducks would and I use them to pour water over her head when washing her hair. Otherwise, they're pretty large and basic. Colorful though- I really like the colors! And the plastic is solid- not easily bent or warped. And I like that they at least stack well, instead of taking up more space.A little too simple for the price and you probably only need 1 or 2, not 3, but we've got them now and I like them so they're staying!Shipping was quick; they arrived in excellent condition.
