It works as advertised. It's a great extension. I just don't like how it also relies on the tension that keeps the gate in place to keep it attached to the gate. There are no screws or anything to help it connect so it makes for another weak point in the gate. It doesn't sit snug enough on the frame of the gate so when you tighten the gate to the wall it can get a little crooked looking. This is all really hard to explain unless you actually have the gate. Just know that it works well and, so far I haven't any real issues.
