Not great quality for the price. Pandas pals just has pictures of animals with what it is in writing. The words are cut off on some of the animals (see attached pictures) and it is not very interactive like the peek a boo book. The peak a boo book is better for an interactive book but sometime the animals are not completely hidden behind leafs and you can see parts of the animal without looking behind it.
