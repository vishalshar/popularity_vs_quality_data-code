We purchased the Samsung wireless baby monitor and camera with an additional camera when our Summer brand baby monitor stopped working right before the birth of our second child.  Straight out of the box the monitor (parent unit0 would not work with either camera.  Customer service from Amazon and the seller (forgot their name) was very helpful in providing Samsung's information for replacing/repairing the monitor.  The owner's manual has limited trouble shooting information and no of it addressed this problem and it did not include any contact information for Samsung.  Samsung's website does not list contact information for baby monitors (goes to CCTV department, who knew?).  When I contacted Samsung, they emailed me a form to fill out and requested that I scan in my reciept and email this information back, fortunately, I have a scanner, but I am not sure what someone who doesn't would need to do.  After several days (5 at least) and 1 phone call to make sure that my email had been received.  I then received an email reply with a "ticket" to print out and mail, at my expense the monitor to the closest authorized repair -- in California, and I live in the midwest.  After 3 weeks and 2 phone calls regarding the where abouts, a replacement monitor was sent. This was also, 3 weeks after the arrival of said second child!The actual monitor and camera are okay.  I like that is togggles between the 2 cameras, but the picture quality is a bit jerky.  Our previous Summer brand monitor was able to move the c amera and scan the room, these cameras do not have that same scanning ability.In summary, the customer service from Amazon and Simeon Health were very good.  Samsung customer service and repair/replacement was poor.  The actual product is okay, but not worth the hassle.  I would not recommend based on my experience.
