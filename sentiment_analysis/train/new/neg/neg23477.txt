The lights, music, and drawings were very interesting to my 3 month old, who got it for Christmas.  However, after a couple of days, it seems like it got stuck in demo mode.  It stops music and lights after a couple of seconds, when they should last for 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, I cannot exchange it and give it another try, since at the moment it is not available directly from amazon and the current vendor has it priced at $10 more.
