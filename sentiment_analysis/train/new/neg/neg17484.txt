These car seat strap covers are well made and not expensive but I personally don't like the white fuzzy side. I prefer the grey side. I also think they are too wide for the straps, they should be tighter.I will not be using these for the reason that my toddler ripped them off in a matter of minutes. I would recommend these for a child that isn't old enough to take them off.  Waste of money because I won't be using them but maybe I will in the future.
