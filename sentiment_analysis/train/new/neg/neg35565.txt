I'm writing this review as a service to other parents because my husband and I got quite a shock tonight: My husband ran upstairs to the baby's room to get something and I was washing dishes in the kitchen, everything was closed up so we thought she was safe, we were right nearby her. Suddenly my husband heard her on the stairs. He dashed out of her room just as she stood up in the middle of the staircase and turned around as if she was going to try to walk back down the stairs she had climbed (she can't walk downstairs at 15 months old!). Not only that, it's an open staircase so she could've fallen down the side. My husband said his heart was racing so fast, thinking what could've happened. We bought two of these gates because he needed one for our fireplace area and one for our stair case. The problem is if you shake it hard enough you can get the latch to come loose. They don't make the metal on the latch long enough that if it is shaken hard enough, it won't come off. If a little 21 pound toddler could shake it loose... It's not safe!! We were lulled into semi-complacency, thinking it was childproof. I would hate to see another parent make this mistake. He left her alone for one minute just to get a book from her bedroom to read to her. I guess she went upstairs looking for daddy. God for bid some other parent could likewise turn around for a minute or two and they're trying to get through this gate into harm's way. It's too flimsy. At the top of the staircase we have a summer infant metal gate and that thing is sturdy. We would've bought more of them but they didn't make a long gate like the Regalo. I now have a rope tied around it holding it shut at the base of our staircase until we can install a permanent fix. Buyer beware.
