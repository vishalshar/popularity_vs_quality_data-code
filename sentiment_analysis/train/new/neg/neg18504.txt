I bought this seat based on the great reviews, and I have to agree with some of them - it has a bigger seat area, it's easy to clean, it's a simple and effective design.  But for my kitchen chairs, it was not a good fit.  I posted 2 pictures in the gallery.  Make sure you look at the measurements of the booster seat and compare them to your chair(s) before ordering, to make sure it will fit.  I'm back to using my highchair for my 21 month old as well as dealing with the Fisher Price Healthy Chair deluxe (blue/green adjustable height) chair that has a strap between the baby's legs, which collects food, so it's a no-win for me at the moment!  Also, the strap that goes under this booster seat & attaches to the chair wouldn't tighten when I pulled on it - it would come apart with even the slightest tug.  The back strap seemed fine & I was able to tighten that one.  All in all, I think the one I got was partially defective, along with being too big for my chairs.
