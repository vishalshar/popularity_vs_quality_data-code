My son was not interested in this rattle. It looks nice, but it's not very easily manipulated. It's also bigger than I expected. My son prefers skinnier rattles with things that move (addition rings etc.) attached to them, so this one was rather boring for him. He puts it down after only a few seconds without another glance. I gave it three stars because there isn't anything structurally wrong with the rattle, it just doesn't appeal to my son.
