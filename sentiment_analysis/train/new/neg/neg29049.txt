I bought this car seat after reading all of the safety information on consumer reports, and I was initially impressed with how tight this fit into the car rear facing, which was much better than our Evenflo that I had for my older son. It was very secure, and I liked that. I was also very happy with the Safe Cell technology on the straps, but unfortunately, after two months of light use, the Safe Cell portion of the strap broke, making it very difficult to strap my son in. I called the Britax number, and they are currently sending me a replacement strap, but it's a pain in the butt that I will have to unstrap my car seat from the car, re-strap the thing myself, and put then strap it back into the car again after all of the money I paid to have the top of the line car seat like this. I have multiple kids, and I don't have time for things like that. I would suggest trying something else:)
