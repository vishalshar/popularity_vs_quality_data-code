After our first baby was born we were overwhelmed by the amount of "things" that people gave us. It was really difficult to keep the nursery in order and maintain our sanity.  I picked this up thinking that it might be a good place to start and it is...sort of.It's small.  Much smaller than I expected. - The "large" bins are large enough to hold a human head.  NOT THAT I WOULD.  Obviously.  But I mean, just to give you a way to imagine the largeness of the "large", that's a good place to start.  We're using one of the bins to hold all of the cards, mementos, and so forth that were given to us by family and friends.  Not shabby. - Then the "small" bins are very small.  They're big enough to store a human hand.  And again, NOT THAT I'M SUGGESTING THAT YOU SHOULD DO THIS.  It's actually the exact size of the little hangy-downy storage shelf thing, so you can just store a handful of pacifiers or a few smaller squishy toys. - Speaking of that hangy-downy storage shelf thing...  It's small, too.  We're storing shoes, winter hats, scarves, and stuff like that in it and just keeping it off to one side.  It's not big enough to really get a bunch of stuff out of the way. - The hangers are great though.  They're covered in a velvety material that ensures that clothes won't go sliding off.All in all, I'm not going to shout from the rooftops about how awesome this is, but I'm also not dissatisfied in the purchase at all.  There may be some dimensions in the product information that I didn't pick up on when I was reading about this set, but who needs words when you have pictures?
