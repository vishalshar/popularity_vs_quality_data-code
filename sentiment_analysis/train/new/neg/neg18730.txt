I spent $170 for this bag and I'm disappointed with the quality. This bag looks great, but it broke when I was traveling internationally for 6 weeks and had to get it fixed. Once I started using the bad, I noticed some threads coming loose on the outside top part. The big pocket on the inside where you put the changing pad, is not stitched properly. The stitching is slanted on one side and the threads have come undone.
