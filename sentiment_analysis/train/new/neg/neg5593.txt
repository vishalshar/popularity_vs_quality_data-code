A very disappointing product. It doesn't play at all. I think it could be the batteries, but I can't find a way to open it to replace them. It's too hard to play with. My grandson can't make it work. All in all, I wish I hadn't purchased it. $5.00 is too much to pay for something I'm going to toss in the trash. The instructions here say I have to give it a star rating so I'll give it one star, but I wouldn't give it a star at all if I had the choice.
