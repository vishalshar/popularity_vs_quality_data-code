As of January 2010 there is a recall on the handle for units manufactured between 1/06/08 and 4/06/09 of certain models - not sure if this exact one is included.  You can get a list of model numbers at [...].Review:  The car seat/travel system was a gift ... I really didnt want a travel system.  I've used the stroller once and hate it.  The car seat/infant carrier itself is ok.  My baby is just 4 months old, 12 lbs, 24" and her feet stick out the end already and have for at least a month (at her doctor's appt her weight is in the 25%, and her height in the 50% just so you have an idea of the "average" size baby).  This seat is supposed to fit an infant up to 29" - dont think it will.  She has room to grow from her waist up, not not from the waist down.  Also, the seat seems to be very upright compared to other brands.  It does not seem to be comfortable, baby doesnt like being in it even a short amount of time unless she's sleeping.  I'm not impressed with the padding either.  The straps are a pain to adjust and the head support really isnt adequate (way too wide to serve it's purpose).  If it wasnt a gift I would have returned this product a loooong time ago, but since it was free to me it's not a bad deal.Overall I'd say keep looking.  Look for a seat that sits more reclined than this one and one that will hold a taller baby ... keeping in mind that a bigger car seat will be heavier to carry and get in and out of the car - this one is plenty heavy enough for me (5'6" 120 lbs) to get in a pick up truck.
