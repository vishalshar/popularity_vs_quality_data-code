We purchased these for our 2-year-old for our trip to Europe.  They are pretty large and bulky to bring in carry on luggage, considering how limited carry on space is these days.  For plane flights I should have purchased something inflatable - these are better for car trips when you have more room.  Our son didn't want us to set them up before he fell asleep, so we had to sneak them in after he dozed off.  They definitely help with head slumping and seemed to make it more comfortable for him to sleep in his car seat.  There is a strap connecting the two pillows together, and I wish it were removable so that you could use just one pillow at a time if you wanted.  With our son's car seat (a Britax) there wasn't enough room to use both pillows at once.  The product seemed well made, it just didn't work great for our needs.
