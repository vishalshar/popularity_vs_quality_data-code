this is by far the hardest thing I've ever had to use in my life. It took me a good 20 minutes of trying to get the pillow inside the cover. I broke a nail I broke out into a sweat and I possibly started going into labor. LOL just kidding on that last one. Long story short I can't even get the whole thing on now I need to wait for months for my husband to get home from deployment to do it for me. Even if I did get the thing on I would never in my life take it off to wash it because it would never get back on again. As cute as the cover is it's a pain in my butt. It ripped and totally deformed my pillow.
