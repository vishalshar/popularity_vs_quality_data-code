It's an inside doorway gate. You can see from the picture that it's four panels slide open to extend. So the cool part is you can install the gate from a fairly small size to a much larger size. The description says 62 inches. My opening is 63, and I was able to get it installed. You can slide the door panels closer together, and they slide together in such a way that they stack up against each other.The pros -  It does the job. It swings both ways. That part is awesome. It swings open, so you can open it as wide as you want to. And that's awesome too. I have another gate - one of those metal actual gate things, and it only opens out 18 inches (have you ever tried carrying a squirming toddler and opening one of those and sliding through? Ugh.) So it opens as wide as you need it to, because you can swing it open, and it swings very, very smoothly. So all pluses.But there's one minus, and it's a very big minus, in my book. You can't close it with one hand. You have to put down everything in your arms (including said squirming toddler) and then pull the door toward the other end, and then lift it about two inches and then slam it down. It latches nicely, but sheesh. Whoever designed this apparently has no clue that mommies of crawling babies or mischievous toddlers almost never walk around with free arms around the house, that they are always busy ...Do I regret buying it? No, because it's a great price - there's nothing out there for 63 inches at this price. But I do wish it could be closed with one hand.
