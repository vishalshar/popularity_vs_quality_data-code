Lovely colors, but this set is not made of the softer, slightly flexible plastic I expected.  Instead, each boat is quite substantial and rigid (melamine-like) and is comparatively heavy.  To me that means the unpleasant effect of banging-for-sound play if used in the tub area, also potentially painful bonks on the head or elsewhere.  Trouble awaits, should an energetic kiddo decide it might be fun to throw one!But, hey, if you want an attractive and really sturdy set of toys that will hold up for outdoor play, these Boon Fleet Stacking Boats are just the thing.
