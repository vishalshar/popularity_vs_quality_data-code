The design is cute and that is all.  The three wall hangings have crooked seams and stitching, which twist and bunch up the fabric so that it is obviously slanted even after trying to flatten them out with all the heavy books in my home.  Worse yet, the stitching is sooooo crooked that you can see it even when standing across the room.  One wall hanging is even entirely a square inch smaller than the other two!  Such horrible craftsmanship.I know bedding sets are a waste of money anyways, but I put it on my registry just in case I needed to refer to the color palette and design motif.  To my surprise someone actually bought it, but now that it arrived, I feel so guilty that my best friend used her money to buy this overpriced middle-school-level home ec project.
