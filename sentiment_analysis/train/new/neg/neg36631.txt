I'm a customer of Gerber Bag since one year ago and I've bougth about 12 bags, I sell this in my country.  The desing is very good but in the seams of the borders the thread doesn't take enough fabric and it unstitchs very soon. I cann't return them for the seller because it's very expensive for me, living out USA. Some times my rating was 5 stars because I tought could be one bad bag, bat now with three, I think the manufacturer doesn't have a good quality control. I hope to continue buying this bag, because my customers like it.
