We've vacationed at a home that had a brass one like this and it worked perfectly. So, when we came home, I purchased this one and it's REALLY hard to flip open. The only way open this is to *gently* nudge it up with the tip of our finger. If we do it any other way, the latch won't swing back. It's a real pain to have to stand there and fidget with it just to go open the front door.
