I bought this rail for my 6 year old who has Down syndrome on June 13, 2014 directly from Amazon.  He is only 37 pounds, but a restless sleeper.  Last night, my son became entrapped between the rail and the bed at the level of his chest.  He was barely able to whisper for help.  Had I not fallen asleep with him....he would have died.  When we looked at the rail...the cheap plastic clip that connects the metal rail to the canvas security strap had broken, allowing the rail to slide slightly away from the bed.  This could cause very serious injury or death.If you take time to read the reviews, there has been a design change in the rail (likely due to cutting costs) and several episodes of this clip breaking have occurred.  I just spoke with Summer Infant, and will be calling the CPSC.  They are taking this complaint seriously, as I pray you will.
