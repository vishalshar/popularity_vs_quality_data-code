I registered for this sleep positioner and got it at my shower!  As soon as I brought my son home from the hospital I was using it to ensure that he was sleeping safely!  However, within a day or two he figured out how to slide himself down the mat so he ended up with his butt at the very bottom and often with his head between the two side pieces which terrified me!  He was 8 lbs at birth and I never felt that I could get the sides tight enough to actually hold him secure.  Now my son is suffering from acid reflux and I need to keep his head elevated when he sleeps.  I have given up on the side pieces all together and I use the mat alone althought he still ends up at the bottom in a crunched up position anyway.  This item may be great for a nice docile baby that does not move in his/her sleep but I don't think it is workable for a baby with any tendency to move or fuss in the night!
