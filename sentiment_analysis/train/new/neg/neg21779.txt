I love this set, but it did not contain a valance or diaper stacker... I got receiving blankets (2), crib sheets  (2), quilt, mobile, crib skirt, rail cover, wall hanging and a carrying bag. It was a great price and I like the look, but I was probably would not have ordered it if I had known what actually came with the set. Still a good value for the price I suppose.
