The boppy tummy play pad is very colorful with cute toys.  The pillow helps my son tolerate tummy time a little better because he wasn't a big fan of tummy time without it.  The only negative things that I have to say is that the material, although super easy to clean, is a little slippery so he sometimes works his way off the pillow wiggling.  Second, the pillow started to come apart at the seems after only 2-3 washes in the washer and a month or so of use.  I just sewed it back up before the hole could get too big but it doesn't seem too durable.
