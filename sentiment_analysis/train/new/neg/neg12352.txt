We have these door handles throughout our house and expected to receive something that would allow adults to open the door but not toddlers.  This isn't the product.  I sure have read a little more but all this handle lock does if forces the door to be locked from inside AND out!  BEWARE - If the handle lock is applied on the inside and the door it shut, the lock will not allow the door to be opened from outside of the room.Even though I selected 2 day shipping, it took over 4 business days for the product to arrive.  It was double boxed in retail packaging that provided sufficient protection for shipping.My suggestion is to temporarily replace the door knobs on the doors you need to secure with cheap round knobs and buy the pressure child guard or simply lock the doors and use the little key to enter from outside the room.UPDATE - I couldn't get this product to work with my exterior door handle.  I ended up throwing them out and would not recommend them.  Why purchase something that could possibly lock you in or out of a room and should be installed upside down.  Don't waste your time or money.
