Pros:This is a very solidly built, gate. It has mostly metal parts, which I like, and would do a good job at keeping babies out from area where they are not allowed. I also like that it is pressure-mounted so you don't need to drill holes into your walls. Additionally, it's one of the best-priced metal gates on the market.Cons:The opening is way too small! This is a picture of my average-sized husband standing in the gate's opening. As you can see, it's a narrow fit. It is considerably smaller than a similar Munchkin brand gate we own. The latch to this gate is also difficult to operate, much more difficult to open than the Munchkin gate. I was not able to open it single-handed, which is a necessity when you are carrying a baby in your arms.Verdict:I am sadly returning this gate; it just did not work for our family. While I like the metal construction, I need a gate with a wider opening and a latch that is easier for me to open single-handed.
