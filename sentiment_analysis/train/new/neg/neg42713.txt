I cut the prefolds into thirds and serged the edges so that I could use just 2 at a time.  When I try to use the entire prefold it makes the diaper a mile thick.  I like to use a microfiber insert on top as a quick absorber and then back it with 1 or 2 of the econobum pieces I made.  It is really super absorbant and does not suffer compression leaks like microfiber alone does.  Putting them together is a great combo.
