I bought the Pathway expecting it would work for my 9-yo and 6-yo who are close in height and weight.  The seat has a lot of great features -- LATCH to keep it from flying when unoccupied; easy-to-adjust headrest; secure cupholders; good seatbelt placement.  However, it is too small for both of my kids.  I had to put the headrest at the highest position to get proper shoulder/seatbelt positioning, so this seat would not last us several more years.  Neither the 9-yo nor 6-yo fit inside the narrow shoulder wings.  The interior seat depth looked uncomfortably short (knees dangling over the edge).This seat would work well for most 3-7 year old children, but for my average 9-yo and tall 6-yo, this was not a good fit.  It is going back.  (I'm trying the Sunshine Kids Monterey next -- it has a higher weight limit, deeper interior seat, and an adjustable-width back.)For carseat and booster specs, check the forums at car-seat d.o.t. org for "Carseat Quick Information - Measurements & Feature Capsules."
