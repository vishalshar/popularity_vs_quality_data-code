I bought this crib because I wanted something small and simple, but the moment my husband took everything out of the box, I've been ANNOYED! It didn't come with any instructions on how to put it together. Another reason why I bought it is because there were so many people saying it was such an easy assembly. I would agree if I had instructions to help us out. It's not fun when your husband works 12 hours 6-7 days a week and you're 9 months pregnant, about to blow, and you both are trying to put together a crib with no guide. After looking for videos, online instructions, and calling customer service we just gave up and did it ourselves. It wasn't rocket science but it took us longer than what it should have. On top of all of that the wooden board was chipped, and I also noticed a few scratches. They were very unnoticeable though.The mattress it came with is a complete joke. It's not even a mattress, it's like a thin pallet. I still plan on putting that to use; maybe put it in the playpen or under the other mattress I purchased. I purchased the Dream On Me 3" mattress which is very firm and comfortable, I highly recommend it.In the end, I actually love this crib because it is exactly what I wanted and it's extremely sturdy. Hopefully whoever orders this has better luck with receiving everything in the box.
