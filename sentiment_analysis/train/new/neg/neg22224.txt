When I first got these bibs I loved them. They were great colors and matched a ton of my sons outfits but the more we owned them the more I disliked them. They are not terribly thick so if you're getting them for food they work ok but if you need them for a drooling baby they are not the best choice. The thing that really irritates me is that we've had them for several months now and they've been used and washed several time and the Velcro is not working very well anymore. If my son (who's 1) tugs on it slightly on the front it come detached. Sometimes it just falls off. It's really disappointing.
