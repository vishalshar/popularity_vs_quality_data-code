From a pure cleaning aspect this is a great bottle cleaning brush. My baby has to drink soy formula which seems to leave a heavier residue. This brush does a great job at removing the oily residue without a whole lot of elbow grease on the first try.I have used other bottle brushes that just have the bristles and it always seems to leave a lot of oily spots behind. I would always have to go back and do a second round of cleaning when I discovered oily spots when rinsing the soap off.The foam lasted on each brush about 8 months before I finally had to replace it (which I was thoroughly surprised).Onto the bad...After I replaced the foam on the large brush the latch that keeps it in place would no longer stay clipped together. I now have to use very light pressure to prevent the clip from opening. It's now very frustrating to use... I will most likely look for a replacement brush soon.If the clip could be redesigned to stay secure through the life of the brush I would definitely give this 5 stars. I'm only give it 3 stars just for the fact it does such a great job cleaning the bottles.Like:Does a great job cleaning bottles with ease.Foam head has longevity with normal use.Dislike:Brush stick becomes basically useless after first replacement of foam head. Retaining clamp keeps popping open.
