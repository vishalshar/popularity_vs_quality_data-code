This shelf is super cute. That bring said it's not great quality. The first one we got was very poorly packages and had scratches, and was smashed on the corners. After we returned it and ordered another we got one in the original packaging in great shape. There are no holes to attach the top shelf to the back, even though there are screws to do so. The wall screws included are too small to really stay in the drywall screws, so once you hang it, it still pulls out a little bit. It looks great, but I'm not sure it will be able to handle much weight!!
