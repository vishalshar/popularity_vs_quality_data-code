Bought this to use with a contoured changing pad, but it doesn't fit well. It bubbles up on the ends and will not lay flat. As another review mentioned, it snags very easily. It is very soft and I really do love the color. Will keep it, but also looking for a second cover that is a little thicker and will fit the contoured pad a little better.
