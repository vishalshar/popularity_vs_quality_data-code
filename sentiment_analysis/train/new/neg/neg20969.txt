My son likes to play with toys while eating, so he constantly is moving his hands up and down. I tried all three positions for the snap but in any of them he gets the bib fold to cover his mouth so I have to hold the bib with one hand to get spoon with another in his mouth. We are still on stage 1 foods and we are spilling a lot and the material does not soak it in, so I had to use the softer white side out to avoid all this liquid food spilling on his clothing when I remove the bib. And maybe my fingers are not too strong, but I have hard time removing it  when opening the snap with one hand (holding baby in another).
