We tried Comotomo and mimijumi for our 9mos old boy..they both worked great! But they are pricy.  When I saw the adiri bottles I had to try it out considering the reviews aren't bad at all and the price is good. but boy was I wrong.... The bottle guaranteed a non leak feature but it still leaks. The vents are build underneath the bottle and everytime my boy nurses, it leaks all over the place. Very messy. I gave it a 3/5 because my boy liked the bottle, the bottle  cute and the silicon material is good however it leaks, so we went back to the ol' Comotomo  bottles.
