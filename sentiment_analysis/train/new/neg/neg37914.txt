I originally loved this stroller, the height is perfect for me, I'm 5'10", it's light and sturdy and love the fact that it folds up, but the more I use it, the more I hate it. (And when you're trying to get back in shape after a baby, you don't want to be turned off from exercise!)  It continues to veer right now matter how often my husband has straightened it.  First we thought it was the front tire, then we thought we assembled it wrong then we realized it's the frame itself.  It's a shame, because it was a gift and I can't bear to tell my friend I don't like running with it.  I am going to try and get a refund on it, it does have a one year warranty so hopefully they will honor it and replace it with a better model or refund me money to use toward another jogger.  Hope this review helps.
