I bought this same mattress pad in 2005 and sure it was a little snug but it fits the crib mattress.  Since I already had one of these I was wondering what the previous reviewers were talking about.I know now!  They are absolutely right.  These pads are way too small.  They changed them.  The one I have from 2005 fits - this new one I just bought is so tight that it bends the mattress and it stays bent.  It never flattens back out.I really liked the fact that it's 100% cotton and the one I already have fits ok but this new one doesn't.  They changed the material around the padded part that fits over the mattress and it wasn't a good change.  You can easily poke your fingers through it because it's so flimsy and because it's so tight.I need another 100% cotton pad so I will be looking at a different brand.  I hope I can find one!
