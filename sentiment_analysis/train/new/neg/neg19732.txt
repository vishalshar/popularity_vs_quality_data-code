I'm due any day now so I haven't actually used this yet. I bought it to carry in the diaper bag as a waterproof changing pad. I washed all my baby's clothes, bibs, etc, including this pad, and I was pretty disappointed when I got it put of the dryer. It was pilling and just overall looked liked it was really used and had been washed 25+ times. I can only imagine it will look worse after each wash & dry. Oh well. Hopefully it will at least serve it's purpose.
