When I saw this online, I thought it would be so great on my existing car seat. However, when I received it, the fabric was really thin and not much support. I was thinking for a car seat cover that it would be thicker. I had to order the head support seperate at hipncozy.com to complete it. Otherwise I don't really think its enough support.
