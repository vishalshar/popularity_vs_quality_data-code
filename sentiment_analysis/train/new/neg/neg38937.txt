You certainly get what you pay for here.Knowing  it rains almost every day in Florida I bought this for our week long trip to Disney. However i didnt expect to be throwing it out the night before we were coming home because the zipper broke off and the front shield was cracked all over. I would recommend it if you only need it for a. Few dayshttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1355s
