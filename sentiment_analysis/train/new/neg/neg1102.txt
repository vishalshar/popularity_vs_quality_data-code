I recieved the Graco Tango in the Tongo diaper bags that I had registered for as a baby shower gift.  It looked good on paper.  But on the larger bag the inner plastic lining ripped at the zipper within two months (really not that big a deal it as the bag still functioned, but still...) and then the strap came unstitched where it attaches to the bag at 4 months.  I used the bag heavily, the baby and I have been on the go every day since he was born, but I feel it really should have held up better than this.  The little bag got used maybe twice, so getting this product for that reason wasn't such a good idea.  The Graco bag also is not nearly as well designed from an organization stand point as the one we are using now.  I wish I had done more comparison shopping before registering for this product, and didnt let myself be swayed by the cute pattern.
