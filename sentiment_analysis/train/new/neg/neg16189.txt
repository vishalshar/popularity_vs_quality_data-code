The trailer itself is nice and well made. However, if I want to fold it I have to disassemble most of it in order to fit it in my car. With 2 kids, that is not ideal. The second thing I did not like was that the front wheel does not swivel, it stays straight. Therefore, when I go running I have to keep pushing the trailer to turn to the right or left. With two kids inside and full running speed, I end up with soar wrists. If I had to purchase it again I wouldn't.
