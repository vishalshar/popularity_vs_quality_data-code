I've had a few exersaucers and was very excited when Baby Einstein came out with theirs.  My son loved it, but the problem we had was that the toys (the ones that were pre-attached and the ones we attached)are not anchored well and keep falling off.  Some I was able to re-attach after getting creative, others, like the star and the soft blocks I can't get back on at all.  Also, the screws for the animal sounds toy weren't long enough and so that toy (the one that makes the animal sounds & music and says the animal's name in 2 languages) kept falling off as well.I gave my other exersaucers to my daycare and after 3 years they're still in one piece, if this one would just stay together it would've been great.
