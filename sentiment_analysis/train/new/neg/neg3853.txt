Okay ladies, if you need an xl or bigger, this will not hold the ladies in:) It may be comfy for just laying around the house, but don't get up and do much. It just doesn't have really any support. It's comfy fabric, but has already started to fray on mine. I wash with delicates, but still kind of falling apart. Probably works for smaller ladies, but for larger....it just doesn't work
