Unfortunately, this was pretty terrible. The arms stick and are difficult to get to stand up, and the whole thing is so light and flimsy that if you don't balance the bottles and parts exactly right, it leans and moves around. Also there's no mat underneath and you really do need one because the counter gets all wet. I gave this a shot because I thought it was more modern-looking than the popular Boon grass which all my mom-friends have (and this was super cheap), but the esthetics and price weren't enough to make it work. As a mom to a newborn, I don't have time to be messing with something that feels like it's going to tip over, or that feels like it's about to snap because I'm trying to move the arms into place. I returned this and bought the Boon grass. There's something to be said for sticking with what other moms recommend.
