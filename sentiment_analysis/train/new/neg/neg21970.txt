I love the Playtex system, especially the drop-ins as it makes the bottle really light and babies can hold it every early with their own hands. For us worked the slow natural latch silcone nipple, the y cut nipple (awesome for quicker feedings) and the ortho nipple (short one). The medium and the fast flow nipple didn't work at all. Both of my sons (2.5y apart) choked on them and the constant drip makes a quite a mess. Try the Playte y-cut or the short ortho nipple instead.
