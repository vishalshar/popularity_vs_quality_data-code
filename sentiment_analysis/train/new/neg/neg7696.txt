I was really looking forward to receiving this item because my stroller only has a bar and not a tray.  This makes toys for the stroller a little more complicated. Now, I should probably be specific and say that it does not fit the bugaboo chameleon stroller properly.  I am not sure about the fit with other strollers with a bar.  So if you have the same stroller and are looking for a toy that attaches to this bar, I would not recommend.  I will say that it is quite colorful, and my son likes pulling the bee.
