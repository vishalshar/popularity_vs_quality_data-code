This is a quality made mirror and my issue is not with the build but the delivery. This does not work with Jeeps that do not have adjustable rear headrests. This is surprising that you don't really expect from Britax, their quality and thought on their products often blows me away like they have thought of every possible scenario. But with the back seat mirror if it can't wrap for under the headrest you can't use it without coming up with some clever rigging.As many new parents will acknowledge you can surely return this and find one that is a universal fit but honestly who has that type of energy, personally I still have it and its just sitting in our car. I think they should do a better job of explaining which car models it works with, its the extra steps that typically set britax apart from the competition.Lastly if you have a adjustable headrest, i recommend it as i attached it in my mothers car and it looked and worked nicely.
