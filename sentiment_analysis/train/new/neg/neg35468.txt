I really wanted to love this stroller and there are parts that I do love. I was looking for something for my newborn and 16 month daughter.Pros:1. I love that the seat will lay flat and the fabric comes up to make it a sort of bassinet! I LOVE this feature!2. It is pretty narrow, I think it should fit through pretty much any door.3. I like that the belly bar is soft and flexible. My daughter can pull herself up and I don't have to worry about her bonking her head.4. The fold! I love that it will fold standing up and is small enough to fit in one cargo space of my mini van. The fold is also really easy.Cons:1. My biggest problem with this stroller is the wheels. It seems like the front wheels are constantly fighting each other, making it tricky to steer.2. It only holds Combi's car seat. I knew this when I purchased it, however some other reviews said they could fit their car seats so I thought I would take a chance. I have a keyfit 30 and there is NO way it will fit!3. The locking mechanism to keep it folded upright. It is an awkwardly placed plastic piece that seems really flimsy. I am pretty sure I would have it broken off within a week!4. Storage. Ummm... there pretty much isn't any! I have a Baby Jogger City Micro single so I am used to a small basket; however, this basket is unusable! The baskets are small and then they have a metal bar going through them at the opening making it impossible to use!Overall:This stroller is lightweight, compact, and easy to store. If you have a combi car seat and plan to use it only on smooth surface, then this stroller will probably be great. I am returning it and getting something a littl sturdier that holds my car seat.
