Had higher expectations from a TOMY soap. Failed on pretty much all accounts. Does the bottle look good..yes. Does it clean bottles or other baby related items..sort of..if you add enough soap. I had to add 1/4 of the bottle the first time just so I could get some suds in the water. Maybe it's my hard water but this product let me down. Too expensive for something not even half as good as the Palmolive bottle wash.
