I'm so sad, the new scent is so horrible and perfumey. The soap also seems to lather slightly differently than before. I was actually questioning if I had been sent counterfeit product from Amazon because it was so gross and cheap smelling, but other reviews are reporting the same changes from Mustela they bought at other stores. Mustela has been the only soap I've used on my children for 4 1/2 years, but I'm going to have to switch to something else now.
