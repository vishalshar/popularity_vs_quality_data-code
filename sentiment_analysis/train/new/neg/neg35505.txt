I like these toys because they seem to be well-constructed, have great color contrast, and a variety of different features. The strap is velcro, which a great feature to attach to car seat handles. Also, each toy contains either a rattle and/ crinkly sections, which I think that intrigue most babies.Unfortunately, my baby only plays with these toys sometimes. Of the 3 toys, he likes to chew on the flower connected to the giraffe the best. He likes the crinkly ears on the monkey, but not the teether. I haven't noticed much attention to the elephant.Even though my baby didn't think of these toys as his favorite, I would still buy this product again or buy it as a gift.
