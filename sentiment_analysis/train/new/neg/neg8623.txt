Adorable blanket! I wish it was made a little better so it would last longer. A few threads along the edge are loose and some of the stitching is questionable. The worst part - baby can pluck bits of the fleece fuzz out and I imagine this blanket will be threadbare in no time. I did buy two because I had hoped it would be a "lovey" blanket candidate. A real shame because this would make a wonderful "lovey" type blanket.
