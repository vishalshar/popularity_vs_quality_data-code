Cozy and warm. I really like them aside from the fact that zippers keep breaking. I contact Halo each time and they've sent me a new one - and a return ready package for the old one. Customer service is pretty good in that respect. However, when I told them the zipper falling off in the middle of the night was a chocking hazard for infants they sent me what appeared to be a form letter saying that their zippers meet the required standard. Ok great but if they're falling off in infants cribs the required standard isn't good enough. I've had this same issue with 2 sleep sacks now.
