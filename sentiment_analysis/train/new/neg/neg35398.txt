I am so disappointed with this chair. It is tiny, even for my 15 month old daughter! The back is lopsided and uneven, the seams are all off kilter, it's oddly lumpy, and one of the wooden feet are cracked. I paid 60.00 for this chair and feel like it may be worth 20.00. It is definitely not the quality I expected for the price. It is also very lightweight. I mark that in the negative column only because little ones scrambling up into the chair can easily topple over if there's not a little weight to the chair. My daughter loves having a chair her size to climb on though since the little ones are not concerned with silly things like quality craftsmanship and durability :) so there was no way I could return the chair without replacing it immediately. I found a chair of comparable price (70.00) on the Walmart website and it met the mark. I have pictured my new chair next to the Amazon chair so that you can see the size difference and how tiny the Amazon chair is.
