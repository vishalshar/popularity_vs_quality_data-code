So unhappy with these blankets! They were expensive but I thought they would be worth the price because the reviews were so good. But they are poorly made. I opened them today and washed them once on a gentle cycle and one blanket has a hole it it already! Posting a photo of the hole below. There are also threads fraying along all the seams which could get wrapped around my baby's toes or fingers or even throat. I would think for the price of these blankets, the quality of how they are made would be higher. We already have the Target knock off brand and they have held up great after two months of washing and use. They were half the price of these! These do feel soft and nice but the hole and the fraying threads are just terrible.
