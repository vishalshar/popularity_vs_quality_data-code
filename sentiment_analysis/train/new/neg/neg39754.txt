This shade is very difficult to attach to the combi twin sport stroller. I was very excited to receive it as I have read some great reviews but it seems that after struggling to find a good place to tie it down, I spend the whole time we are out wrestling with it. It is constantly falling creeping forward and I have to tug it back. A tie in the middle would be a good step in the right direction. I can't get my kids in or out of the stroller with it attached because of the way it bows down & in, it's impossible to get them out without snagging them on it. The ties are very difficult to untie, velcro straps would have been a much better material.
