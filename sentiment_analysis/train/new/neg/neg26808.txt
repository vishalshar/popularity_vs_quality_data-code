On the postitive side, the design is cute and neutral, so it goes with any decor and the height adjustment is quick and convenient. However, the negatives just totally outweigh it all. As the other reviewer said, the seat back won't stay in the complete upright position any more, which is bad when baby gets older (mine is 20 months now). The seat cover comes off and on quickly for washing, but whatever you do, don't toss it in the dryer. It shrinks and the back of ours melted, even though it appeared to be just material before the initial wash. They designed the tray to come off with one hand, but they positioned the mechanism front and center. My little guy figured out that he can stick his foot in there, give one teensy push and the whole tray goes flying off. NEVER place your baby in this seat without securing the buckles! The removable tray is a good idea but ours just won't stay on. He figured out how to get that off when he was 6 months old. If they fixed the reclining back, moved the latch and made it so the tray stayed on it would be much better. That said, I'm in the market for a new high chair.
