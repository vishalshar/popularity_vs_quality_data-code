I got this bag as a gift and loved it.  The colors were perfect so my husband would carry it and it held everything I needed.  My big problem is that after about 4 months of use, the plastic liner started ripping.  Not only on the inside but on the bottom also.  I probably would have tried this bag again but when I returned it, the store did not have the bag anymore.  As a busy mother of 3, I have lots of things that I spend money on and I do not think that I should have to buy a new diaper bag every 3-4 months.
