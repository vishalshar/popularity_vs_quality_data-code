I ordered this chair for my third baby; due in June. I picked this chair because it was basic with a 30 degree incline and breathable material. None of the unnecessary bells and whistles. (melodies that sound horrible anyway, extra speeds, toy bar) However, all the negative reviews were correct, the motor is quite loud (we remedied this by placing egg crate padding around the frame under the motor). An easy and effective fix if your crafty.  And the plastic guards are cheap. It's not the feet that are breaking, (as mentioned in other reviews) nor, is it anything load bearing or dangerous to baby, however, I have had this item one day, and taking the fabric off to wash, the plastic guards broke into little chards.
