I have a ridiculous amount of experience putting together furniture like this, not just for myself, but also for family and friends because I'm one of those weirdos who usually enjoys it. I did *not* enjoy working on this one, and would not recommend this to people who aren't at least a little handy. Among the things I had to do: sand down a couple pieces so that they were square, re-drill holes in the back pieces for the drawers because they were neither straight nor large enough, glue a badly chipped corner right where a drawer slide attaches, reshape a plastic dowel, and fix a small cosmetic ding in one of the drawer fronts.I got this for a very good Cyber Monday price and decided to keep it as a result, but there were other issues. too. The espresso color I received is darker than what the pictures show, and darker even than the other customer pictures I saw; it's really black, with no visible wood grain unless you look at it in very bright light. The exterior sides of the drawers are also clearly made generically for multiple furniture items. They're an ugly and very cheap-looking grey, rather than a matching "espresso" color. Several of the pieces are incredibly flimsy. The worst example is that the drawer slides are very cheap, non-load-bearing plastic. One of them arrived split, but in a place I could still use it. I'm nonetheless very skeptical of drawer longevity after regular use due to the poor design. I also didn't receive 10 (a full 50%) of the cam locks that are supposed to go with this piece. I've requested them from the company, and they refused to quote me even a ballpark time for their arrival, saying only, "oh, it depends on a lot of things." Fortunately, I'm not in a rush for them, but that's clearly not ideal customer service.Maybe I had an exceptionally bad experience since this item has so many positive reviews, but frankly I'm mystified as to why people like this so much.
