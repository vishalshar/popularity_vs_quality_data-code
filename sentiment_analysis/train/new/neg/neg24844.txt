I had purchased a Baby Sherpa Short Haul six years ago when my first child was born and we used the life out of that bag. It was perfect for us, but after so many years of heavy use (and baby #4 arriving), I decided to order the bigger Baby Sherpa. WOW, what a difference in the two bags. The materials on the new bag are absolute garbage! It feels like a cheap knock-off that you'd buy at a flea market. The diaper changing mat is also made of a cheaper material and I don't envision it holding up well with two kids in diapers. I really wanted to love this bag, since our other one served us so well...what a shame that this manufacturer has chosen to source cheaper materials. I'll most likely be contacting them directly to see about a refund. What a disappointment!
