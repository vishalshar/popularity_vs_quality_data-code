Love that this bib has snaps so my LO can't pull it off and a pouch to catch food/water. However, it started smelling like a old sponge after a month. I don't have a dishwasher so I hand wash  it and let it air dry. I even changed my sponge twice and the material on the back still smelled like an old sponge. The sponges I used don't even smell that bad. Oh well, I really liked it but it got stinky.
