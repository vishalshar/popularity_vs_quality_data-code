I would have left 5 stars as I find the methods used to be very relaxing and I am quite confident that this technique will work for me when I actually go into labor (I will update my review after baby is born).  The reason I left 2 stars is because I had such a hard time finding a CD player that would play this CD.  The only place it worked was on my desktop computer.  I was disappointed by this as it is hard to get comfortable in an office chair so I haven't been able to get the full benefit of the CD and I also won't be able to use it at the hospital when I go into labor.
