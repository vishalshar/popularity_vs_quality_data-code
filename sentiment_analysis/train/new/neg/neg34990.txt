I've had this diaper for about 8 months and use it at least twice weekly.Pros:No leaksSoftLarge insertsCons:The opening to pull out the insert is too low and can get messy when trying to remove it from a poopy diaperI don't care for the gussets.  My diapers without gussets don't generally leak, so they seem like a waste, especially when poop gets trapped in the little gusset crevicesOrdered snap but received velcroIt seems like it has become misshaped since I first bought it - like the soft inside fabric shrunk so it doesn't really match the size of the waterproof outsideThe rise is too short for my 1 year old who weighs 26 lbs and is about 30 inches tall.  There is no way that it will fit him until potty-training
