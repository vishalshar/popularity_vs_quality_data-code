I purchased this humidifier and used it while my infant was sick.  Within one week the filter smelled so bad I couldn't use it, I needed to buy a new filter.  You can not purchase this filter at stores only from a 1 800 number.  Then, it takes two weeks to receive the new filters which are expensive.  I had to buy a NEW humidifier because I could not wait two weeks and it was only $4 for replacement filters vs. the three times as more expensive filter for this product.
