I had problems with the straps on the carrier coming undone very early on, but didn't think anything of it.  I just kept checking them and re-adjusting them. The longer I have it the more I have to adjust them so they don't come completely undone.  I noticed a different reviewer said that hers didn't come undone and that we should check whether the strap in front is adjusted or not.  This has nothing to do with the problem I'm having.  The problem is not evident when you first adjust the straps.  Any movement of the straps (ie when you strap your baby in and get baby out) jiggles the straps out of the mechanism in the back.  I did a little field test at Target on the Eddie Bauer where I jiggled the staps from the front and eventually the straps came undone.  I tried the same test on a Graco model with the same configuration and the straps remained intact.  I'm not sure why they come out since the two looked identical.  Go figure...  <br /><br />Initially my husband and I hated this seat because the plastic buckles have to be put together and then snapped in the recepticle (very cumbersome).  The pieces that go in between baby's legs were too large which also made it hard to snap in.  We cursed it every time we had to put our daughter in the seat.  I eventually got used to it, but would still prefer the ones that snap in independently like on the Evenflo or Graco.<br /><br />For the most part I was fairly happy with my Eddie Bauer travel system , but the reason you get an infant car seat is for safety first so I have to rate this one very low.  I felt I needed to share my rating to get the overall rating down on this model.  As someone else said...If I had just read these reviews before, I would have gotten a different system
