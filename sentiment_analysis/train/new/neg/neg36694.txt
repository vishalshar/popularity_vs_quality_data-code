The pictures and description should be changed. You do not get 2 sets of tubing despite the description stating "retail pack of two". You get one package of tubing that contains two tubes and two connectors. Aside from the poor description, the product itself is nice quality, fits well with my pump and no issues to speak of. No need to spend the extra money on the tubing from Medela.
