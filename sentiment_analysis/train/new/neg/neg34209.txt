My 2 year old is in the midst of potty training and I thought this would be a fun addition to use instead of just the sit down potty chair.  We tried it a couple times and it was difficult as it's so low to the ground hanging it off the toilet and was difficult to try and mount higher up in our small bathroom.  If you have somewhere you can mount it a little higher for better aiming and less spray then maybe it would work better.  It just didn't work out well for us.
