The thickness is nice to add an extra layer to the hard pack and play mattresses. (We used it on our Graco) The fact that it is organic is also definitely a plus. But it shrunk in the dryer and I had trouble keeping it fully on without it raising the mattress up a little on the sides. Unfortunately, there aren't really any other affordable organic options for a waterproof pad... if I were to do it over, I would air dry it.
