I'm in much needed relief for my sore nursing nipples, so I ordered this to use as a bra during the day at home and overnight. Please beware of the sizing. I'm wearing a 34D these days, so I ordered the M/L size. The description says S/M is for 32-34 A/B and the M/L is for 36-38 C/D. I got the M/L because I thought the smaller size would be too tight for my cup size. Plus I'm wearing M or L shirts these days.When you order, make sure you order on your numerical bra size (32, 34, etc.) and NOT your cup size. The fabric is really soft and stretchy, so it can accommodate a larger cup size. The M/L was SO large on me, it was almost 2 sizes too big. The velcro would not close because it nearly wrapped an extra time around my body, and it felt like it might fall down.Had to go through the hassle of returning and ordering the smaller size. If anything, order it a bit smaller than you think you will need and it will be perfect.
