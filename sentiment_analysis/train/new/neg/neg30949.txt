These got great reviews, but my experience was disappointing. There was no way to turn them off (despite instructions to the contrary), which got loud and annoying really quickly. And of course, if you can't turn them off, then they will run out of juice very quickly, which they did. There was no way to change the batteries, so after 1 month, they were essentially useless.
