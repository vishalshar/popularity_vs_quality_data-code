i been using these for a few years when i was breastfeeding problem with these bags were they would tend to leak especially when it's out of the freezer. there were times where the milk would just pour out i use there because they were way cheaper than the medela ones. i prefer those bags they are much studier but they are so expensive. i use a lot of bags so this worked.
