I purchased 3 cups for my daughter who refused the bottle at 2 months and frankly never took to it. I had to return to work after 9 months so began introducing a cup to her by 6 months.I found these cups easy to use due to the angle but honestly, you can use small Dixie cups and train your baby to take from it. Price is rather expensive for a plastic container.However, my kid did like it and I was overall satisfied with the product.Well, be aware though that after more than 7 months of use, I started to notice that when we drink water from these cups, the water tasted PLASTIC! I thought maybe it was our water but tested all cups out and it's them :( so I had to toss.Thus, a rating of only 2.5 stars. I won't buy again for next child due to price and above issue.
