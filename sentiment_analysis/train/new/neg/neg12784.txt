We have the baby version of these with the headband and absolutely loved them for our infant, so decided to order the kids version as he's 1.5 now. These don't seem like they are any larger than the baby version to me. They were extremely tight on his head (maybe he has a giant head?) and he seemed very uncomfortable in them. We were hoping to use these until he is big enough for an adult size, but there is no way that these would fit him for any length of time. I wanted to love them, but we're returning them and going with another brand that has a pair for 2-10 year olds.
