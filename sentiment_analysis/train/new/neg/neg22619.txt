I guess you get what you pay for.  I though this was like the canvas-type Carter's tote my friend has, but this one was much smaller inside.  The outer material was ok - looked easy to wipe clean - but the inside material was very cheaply made, the one large pocket (the only one large enough for diapers, although too large to hold diapers neatly) had no closure, and the 2 net pockets weren't big enough for diapers (they must be meant for bottles).I purchased this because it looked like my friend's and on hers, the outside pockets go all the way around - but they don't on this one - the back has one big pocket - not what I was looking for.  The inside is also fairly small.  This one is going  back.
