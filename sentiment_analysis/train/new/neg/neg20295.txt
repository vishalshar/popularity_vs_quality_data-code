This nursing cover is too sheer to use out in public (I ordered the flower pattern).  Also, the eyelet detail is carried throughout the entire cover (pretty but not functional).  They aren't big enough to see anything through, but combined with the sheer fabric it left me feeling very exposed.  Also, the cover is incredibly short.  I am 6'3" and even when seated and a boppy over my lap, the cover barely touched the boppy.  I can't imagine that this will cover much of the baby once she arrives.  Will be returning this for sure and looking for something that provides more privacy.
