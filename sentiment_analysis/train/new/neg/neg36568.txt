The way the chart is designed, it will be filled up within three days. For some people that's not enough to consider the child "fully potty trained". I like the review which said she altered the reward chart to include going #1 or #2. Anyone potty training understands that that #2 hurdle is the last but most difficult to overcome. My daughter would rather get the sticker as a reward (she puts it on her shirt), so we ended up just using a marker to put check marks for each accomplished task. It's a nice idea, but could use a better design. You'd be better off buying a sheet of stickers from your local store and making your own chart. I plan on drawing one up and using the printer to make copies. I would not purchase this kit again.
