when i ordered this toy bag i was looking at a bag shaped like a frog, which is honestly one of the main reasons i chose it. it arrived as a blue mesh bag w/ green trim. not ugly, but not what i'd expected & ordered. it's rather small, although it does stretch, but when using it for the bath toys of a 4 & 5 year old it definitely wouldn't be my first choice. it's durable but the suction cups won't stick to our tub/shower wall so i had to use command brand's general purpose hangers to keep it up. this review is pretty mixed i'd say; it's an okay, durable product if you have very young bathers but i was expecting something completely different(atleast it was still the same colors???) & i had to buy another product just to keep this one hung to our tub's wall!
