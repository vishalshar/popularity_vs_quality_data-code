I spent hours researching a stylish, lightweight and functional umbrella stroller to use for quick trips around town with my toddler. I couldn't find a Flite in my local store to test drive but I took a chance and ordered it because it seemed to have everything I was looking for. Unfortunately it fell short of my expectations.The Pros:-beautiful color-durable fabric (very similar to the B-Ready stroller)-small footprint, fairly lightweight-decent sized canopy-I could hang my diaper bag on the support bar without tipping the stroller which made up for the zero storage space in the basket.The Cons:-the top of the seat has a fabric border around it that protrudes making the amount of usable seat height too short for even my 19 month old.-The center of the seat sagged and lacked support. The only support came from a Velcro strap underneath.-I found the fold very frustrating. I'm 5'3 and felt that I wasn't tall enough to fold the stroller correctly. It definitely didn't fold easily even after the 3 steps you have to take to unlock it but maybe that could be attributed to it being brand new and stiff? (In the store I could fold the Maclaren, the Joovy, and the G-Luxe easily)-the basket is tiny. I knew that when I ordered it but I was shocked at how small it was.-the weight limit printed on the package says the max weight capacity is 45 lbs while it is marketed as 50 lbs. Not a huge difference but I was confused by the conflicting weight limit.This stroller is beautiful but it wasn't functional for my needs. If I was using it with an infant and a car seat I can definitely see the value in this stroller but for my average sized 19 month old, there just isn't much room for her to grow with this.  While I know that no stroller is going to be perfect, I felt like for the price I should "love" this stroller and I didn't.
