Ugh.  This blanket is cheap!  The material for the blanket itself and the binding just look really cheap.  It's somewhat thick, but nowhere near as thick and plush as I thought it would be.  It is cute for sure, but only worth maybe $8.  My plan is to hold off washing it as long as possible because I'm worried it won't handle the washing machine well.
