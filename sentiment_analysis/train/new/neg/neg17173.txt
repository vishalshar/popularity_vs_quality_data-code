I would like to give a good review but in installing the stickers, they ripped. They were very difficult to remove from the sticker sheet due to the small lines of the smile. Now our toilet looks funny and we haven't even used it. I contacted Summers Infant and they were charging $3.99 for replacement stickers. Kinda silly if you ask me.
