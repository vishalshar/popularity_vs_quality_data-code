Product is well-made, stable and sturdy for a folding crib.  Would be very satisfied with crib but was delivered with a big gash in the top of fixed side of crib which appeared to have been  repaired (by manufacturer) with some kind of plastic glue. Manufacturer should not have sold this part in this condition especially since it is a brand new crib.  Would like to keep crib because it is a good product but would like manufacturer to replace the fixed side of the crib with one that does not have a dangerous defect like this one has.
