I am happy to have silicone sleeves that fit my nice glass bottles, making them less likely to break if they get dropped to the floor, but the open holes in these sleeves do not line up with the measurement markings on the bottles, making it hard, sometimes impossible, so see exactly how much is left in the bottle. I would think since these were designed specifically for Dr. Brown's bottles, that that would not be the case. Poor design!
