It's just okay... I had another Maclaren  techno stroller 6 or 7 years ago and loved it. Thougt I would have the same experience with this one. I'm tall so I searched for a stroller with adjustable handlebars.  This stroller doesn't turn well. It seems to get locked into place. Basket is small underneath.  No storage room.  Harness straps that fit around baby are hard to work and just don't seem to fit quite right. Honestly I would have returned this stroller if it weren't such a hassel!
