The product in the pictures is not what we received.  For one it does not fold into a handbag, but rather a little square puch.  Secondly, it does not have a big flap that can fold over the back of a cart or high chair;  there is nothing to fold over the back at all.  Third, the front is not a big round flap (which would fold into the handbag), but just a small square flap that folds into a little pouch.  This is not at all what we ordered and we are extremely disappointed.  I will be contacted the seller or manufacter, because we feel ripped off.
