This is an adorable set. It looks great in my daughter's room. We are currently using it in her crib and plan to transition it to the toddler bed soon. The bedspread is not overly warm. Both the bedspread and the top sheet have fitted pockets at the bottom that go around the mattress, so it stays in place and she can't get it over her head. I washed everything before I put it on her bed - I always wash sheets in hot water, so perhaps I shrank it before using it, but the bottom fitted sheet was very snug. I almost tore it when putting it on. The sheets are not super soft either. I'd say it's a little pricey, too.
