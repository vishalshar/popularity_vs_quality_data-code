I purchased this to serve as a back up for my double electric avent pump (purchased in 2010)... so my guess is perhaps the pumps have undergone remodel or these aren't sized correctly???  I also purchased replacements for the other silicone pieces (the valves and such) and those fit. Perhaps this massage cushion replacement part is wonderful, but only if it fits your pump. The outer edge fits, but the inner portion is too wide to fit inside the horn entrance (whatever it's called) of the pump. Oh and this listing was for a single piece (not a pair), just to be clear, the other replacement parts I purchased came in sets.
