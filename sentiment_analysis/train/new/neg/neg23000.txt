Thanks, but no thanks. This says it will prevent your little one from spilling, but if they squeeze the food will still squirt out. If the "topper" is not pushed down far enough the food squeezes out the bottom. When pushed on all the way the spout fits so far down on the Plum Organics food pack that it was hard for my child to pinch the end open for food to pass through easily. Also, after feeding my child straight from the pouch or using the spoon ends that attach to the pack, he could not get the bite and squeeze concept. The "cap" also hangs along the side and hits their cheek which is a design flaw in my mind. Overall a waste of money for me.
