Great cover but be warned - mold will grow inside the bubbles and Elmo's head. My older son likes to take the cover off and play with it (like a spaceship) and I just noticed how gross it is inside. So off to the trash it goes. It worked great and my kids loved it, but I guess rinsing and air drying didn't work.
