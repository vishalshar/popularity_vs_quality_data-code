I like the Peek-a-blocks in general, but not this specific theme.  I thought that the blocks were pretty boring.  I didn't like manually turning the wheel on some to make the inside spin.  Some of the other types of peek-a-blocks are more exciting.  The "Big Top" storage unit was useless.  I didn't really see much value in it except to store them in, which the toy box does just fine.  Especially since we own more peek-a-blocks than the 9 that came with it.As far a safety goes, I didn't have a problem with it.  If my child fell face first on any toy, it is bound to hurt them, so I didn't find these to be dangerous.
