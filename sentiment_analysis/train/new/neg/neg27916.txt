These seemed like a great idea for baby-proofing, since all the other door jambs like this have pieces that come off and are a choking hazard, the one-piece construction was what I was looking for.  However, they are not "soft" in any way - they are all one hard piece of plastic!  They work and all, but if you were to slam the door hard, I'm afraid they could leave a hole in our (cheap hollow) doors!  I'm upset that I was looking for something soft or with some give to it so as to protect the wall AND the door.  If I knew of a substitute product, I'd recommend that, but I'm not sure if what I was looking for exists.  However, the product does prevent the doorknob from making a hole in my walls and it's baby safe.  So it still gets 2 stars.
