I have used this carrier for 4 years with 3 kids. In short, it is great to use with 0-6 month olds but is not too comfortable thereafter. And after 2-3 years of use, the clips can become a safety issue.THE GOOD:-Ease of use. The design of this carrier is so ideal for new parents, new baby wearers, grandparents,etc. Adjusting for a different wearer is easy, both short and tall people do fine with it, and you can get it on and off gracefully even if you're not a pro babywearer. Great to throw in the car for errands.-Facing out option. Some babies simply dislike facing in, and many popular carriers (like the fantastically comfortable Ergo) do not allow for facing out.-Got a drooler or "spitter"? You can buy drool pads for this carrier and wash them, and the carrier itself washes up well. My second child basically kept Oxi-Clean in business, so I have good experience with this facet of baby carrier use!THE BAD:-Lumbar support becomes an issue, in my opinion, at about the 15 lb. mark.-Because of this, the lifespan of this carrier as a comfortable option is short.THE UGLY:-Sometime into using this carrier with my second child, one of the side clips began to spontaneously loosen. Yikes! Major safety issue there. As easy as the clips on this carrier are to use, consider other carriers with more of a safety feature on the clips (like Beco carriers, which are my favorite).Do I still use this? Yes, sometimes, but with caution, and not for more than the first few months. If you want a soft structured carrier with good versatility in carrying positions (and that allows facing out), I would recommend the Beco Gemini instead. Hands down my favorite carrier and still going strong (and safe!) with child #3.
