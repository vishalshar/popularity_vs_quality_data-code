I bought this to match a rocking chair from Dutailier.  The chair went together well.  This ottoman on the other hand, which should have been extremely simple, drove me crazy.  IT'S FOUR SCREWS!  I'm a process engineer for an automotive manufacturer, so I'm not a complete idiot (depending on who you ask), and this should have been well within my capabilities.  However, of the four screws which attach the cushion to the rocking base, I was able to get a single screw to actually drive in.  Two of the four screws cross threaded right off the bat, which chewed up the threads on the screw and likely caused irreparable damage to the threaded hole.  I eventually gave up on those two after trying over and over and over to get undamaged screws to go in correctly.  The third screw appeared to be going in well, but it bottomed out in the hole before the head of the screw actually clamped on anything.  The final screw went in just fine, so I at least proved to myself that I hadn't forgotten how to turn a screwdriver; a welcome boost to my bruised ego.  In the end, it was secured enough with 1.5 screws that it probably wont fall apart, and when my frustration subsides I'll probably just drive a couple wood screws to secure everything.Overall, the experience left me sour.  I can't recommend this ottoman, and the catch is that you're not likely to find one from a different manufacturer that matches the fabric of the Dutailier chair.  Bummer, and not what I expected from the Dutailier name.
