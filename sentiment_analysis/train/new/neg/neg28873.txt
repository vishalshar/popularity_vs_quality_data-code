I have always bought HALO sleep sacks for my son since he was an infant (he is now 2 years old) and have always been happy with my purchases.  However, this one smelled like toxic chemicals right out of its package.  I have washed/soaked it multiple times and the smell is still there.  It is so strong that I get a headache if I get too close to it.  I have never had this happen with prior HALO sleep sacks.  Will be returning it and buy another one to see if the problem persists.
