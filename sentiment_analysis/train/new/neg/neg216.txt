I registered for this carrier versus the others mainly cause I thought it would be more comfortable due to the hip strap.  I thought it would be a nice middle of the road carrier between the more expensive Baby Bjorn and the cheaper Snugli.Having gotten the carrier and tried it with my baby girl (now 10 weeks old), I've decided to exchange it.  The $20 difference to upgrade to a Baby Bjorn is well worth it in my opinion.  The straps on the Eddie Bauer carrier slip and need to be constantly readjusted.  The carrier itself where the baby sits does not provide much support; the baby does not look as comfortable as in the Baby Bjorn and looks like she's slouching.  The Baby Bjorn, even without the hip strap, is much more comfortable to me as well.Bottom line, if cost is an issue, I see little difference between this carrier and the Snugli (other than the Eddie Bauer name which is probably the only reason why this carrier costs more).  But if you can, splurge for the Baby Bjorn instead.  I did after trying them both.
