I don't usually write negative reviews but I felt obligated to let people know about this product.  There are not many choices on the market and this one looked okay on the website, so I gave it a try.  There were several problems.1. The screws that came with the package that were supposed to be used to attach the tethers to the tv were not long enough. My husband was able to find the right size at the hardware store so this was not a deal breaker.2. The clips that hold the tether to the wall or tv stand are made of cheap plastic. I have NO confidence that these would not break under the weight of the tv or even a good tug. It was difficult to tighten the straps because the clips continue to bend to the point of breaking.3. When we decided to disconnect this, three of the six screws actually broke (and not under extreme pressure, just typical unscrewing. This only happens with extremely cheaply made screws. We now have three broken screws stuck in the back of our tv stand. I didn't mind having holes in it if it would protect my little ones from the tv but it now has ugly holes with no protection.I think it's terrible that a product designed to protect children would be made with the cheapest possible materials. This is not some novelty item but an item that is meant to prevent serious injury. The design team who created this should be embarrassed.I will continue to look for another product and would be happy to pay much more for something that will actually do the job. We watch our children carefully but wanted something to at least buy a few seconds should anything happen when we turn our backs. I don't believe this product would even do that.
