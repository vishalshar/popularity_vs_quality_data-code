This is quite a solid booster, my kid loves it. It is nice to know that the booster seat has some side impact protection, but the seat is also quite heavy.I am not sure I would call it "booster" since I think one has to fix the seat to the car, it feels to heavy to be sitting loosely and only held by the seat belt.This brings us to the point that the seat is only easy to fixate to your car if you have the isofix latch system built into the back seat. Our car doesn't, but only has hook-up point for latches a bit further in the trunk. These hook-up points worked fine for our previous car seat, but not for the Monterey booster.So I had to get some tools and straps to build something allowing to fix the seat into the car.Given the price of the seat they could have provided some additional straps and things to allow fixing the seat to non-isofix cars.I am particularly anoyed that they don't state this in the product description or write it on the packing or anything. So finding out that the seat is borderline incompatible with MOST cars, comes a bit like a surprise.
