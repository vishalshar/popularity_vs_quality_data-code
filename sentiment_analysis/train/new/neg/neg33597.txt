I loved this stroller in store, it offers 10 positions for your little one to sit. The car seat clicks easily to the frame which is a plus. As my son outgrew the car seat we switch to the stroller seat. It strolls on smooth floors no problem the minute I get to pavement or the park it seems to be very jumpy. It's also getting very hard to push since the wheels are difficult to maneuver. it's very heavy and doesn't fold right I have to take out the seat for it to fold when it's backwards, forwards takes up space. It's very big and takes up a lot of space in my trunk.  Wish I would have gotten a light weight stroller that's more compact.
