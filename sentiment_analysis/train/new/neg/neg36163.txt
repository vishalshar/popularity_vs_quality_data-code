Bought as an easter basket stuffer for my 8 month old at the time. Thought it was adorable and it said it had a chime so it made noise. I was a bit dissapointed when I recieved it. It was made of very hard thick plastic, Very heavy, the feet moved from front to back and I still have no idea what the purpose of that was for. Does chime. But not something I can let my daughter play with. She still swings her arms aroound, I would be terrified of this thing nocking her out.
