bought this a couple weeks ago and so far with taking my 2 month old daughter out for walks and errands, it's very easy to pop open and place on the car seat. I have a chicco keyfit 30 and it fits very well over it. the shade that hides in a zippered pocket is very handy to pull out and snap in place on sunny days-although, i wish there were pull out shades for the side panels. walking with baby in the sun is ok but the light still bothers her coming through the side panel netting and the only way to block it out is still with a blanket. overall, it does do a nice job shading from the top and keeping bugs away (and it also keeps family/friends/strangers' dirty hands away when the come over and want to see the baby, which is an added bonus).
