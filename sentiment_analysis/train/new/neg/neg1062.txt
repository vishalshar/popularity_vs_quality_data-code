I purchased these replacement for the NUK cups we already have as the valves they come with sadly don't last as long as the cup itself.The valve design makes cleaning a tedious job and the rubber used is prone to white spots that resemble mold, even with prompt washing. After a few thorough cleanings, the rubber seems to weaken a bit and liquid can drip out of the child is less than gentle with the cup. Our toddler has perfected the art of finding the weak valves and tapping the cup upside-down to create a liquid-art project on the surface of his choosing.I would say that these are OK for the most part, but we've never used any other brands post bottle.Overall, I'm not unhappy with the quality and I'm grateful that replacement valves are available to consumers at a great price; it definitely helps with the bills.
