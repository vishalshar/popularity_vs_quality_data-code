First, I instantly found out the Part B and B1 cant not be assembled because the holes were mis-aligned holes.  I am contacting the customer service for solution right after I found out the defeat. Also, the order was delay for 3 days.The review will be updated after the issue is solved. I ordered this product because it has very high rating and price is very reasonable. However, there are many 1 star review on Amazon.Update - 12/21I received Email from their customer service. They tried to know more details of the issues. On the other hand, I felt they think I must do something wrong. I tried to explain the holes won't line up. I provided information they need and picture which is hard to illustrate holes won't line up.Update - 12/26They ask me provide more detail information showing which parts can't be assembled. I read the instruction and exactly follow steps on the instruction. Also, I checked all the parts and used the other part on the other side to exam the issue. The part A has issue too, but still can be assembled. The part B can't. At this moment, I feel very stressful because I want to return the item when I found out they can't be assemble, but it is very hard to put every single part into the box. I therefore contacted their customer service. However, it takes more steps to figures out issues for them. It is very annoying to do this during the holiday.
