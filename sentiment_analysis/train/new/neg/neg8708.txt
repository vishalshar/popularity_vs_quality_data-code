We bought this brush after the Dr. Brown's brush we were using died after 3 months of heavy bottle use. We use the brush on ComoTomo bottles and Medela bottles and breast pump parts.  This brush does not seem to clean the inside of the medela bottles that I use for pumping very well. We have to work much harder to get all of the nooks and crannies. It also doesn't do a great job cleaning the medela breast pump parts. It does not fit in the neck of the flanges. It does not come with a stand which is a feature I liked with the Dr. Brown's brush. Finally when you pull the brush out of the bottle you have to be careful which direction you hold the bottle/brush as the bristles will cause soapy water to spray everywhere. The only pro is that it LOOKS cool. All in all, I would probably buy the Dr. Brown's brush again, or buy the munchkin brush next. I mean it is only a $5 brush, but I will go elsewhere next time.
