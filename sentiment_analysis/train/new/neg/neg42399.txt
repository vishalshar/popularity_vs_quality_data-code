This monitor was given to us 2 years ago as a baby shower gift. We used it all day every day for these 2 years so I have to say that we definitely got our friends' money's worth out of it. We rarely used the second camera because we only had one child at the time. Now, we're expecting our second baby next week & we cannot get the 2nd camera to work. More importantly than that, the monitor itself has gone out. It started out several months ago with having a problem with the screen "rolling". Eventually, it would stop & we could see into our son's room again. Then, over time a black stripe down the right side appeared. Finally this morning the screen went entirely black after being on for about an hour. I called the Summer Infant Customer Service department & she said that they discontinued this particular model about a year ago & that Babies R Us wouldn't replace it since it's been 2 years.Save your money & don't get the dual camera feature on this monitor. I think you can buy one with just one camera. Or, find another brand if that's the main thing that you're needing. Other than that, we've been very pleased with the video quality (up until the problems started) and sound.
