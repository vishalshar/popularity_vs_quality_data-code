I bought these- because my son loves his Munchin Miracle 360 cups. I thought I would save a few bucks, and try these. Bad idea. You get what you pay for. Unfortunately these leak like crazy and are not user friendly. It is difficult to screw the lid on, and you have to try several times before making sure the cup "semi" doesn't leak. No matter how tight you screw on the lid- it still leaks. Either a lot, or a little. I say pay the extra money for the Miracle 360 and get a cup that you can put together fast, and doesn't leak.
