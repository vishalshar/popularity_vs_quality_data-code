OK here's the thing.  This is pretty solid for a concept.  I would have given it a 2 star rating, but in all fairness, it's sold as a finger guard and a close guard and not a slam guard so that would be a little unfair.My main contention with this product is that the foam-type material it is made of, is not very durable.  The first one I deployed lasted all of 1 slam before splitting in two.  I learnt quickly that these can only be used for doors not intended for ANY possibility of major slamming.  It begs the question what level of finger protection is this providing, but I guess if maybe you're thinking of toddlers there may be a small case.  The product page also marketed among the intended usages, preventing doors from closing.  If you are prone to get locked out because of auto-locks, etc.  this may help (providing it doesn't slam, break the foam and then lock anyway).The other thing I don't like about it, is that it gets dirty real easily and it's not that cleanable (after a while the pristine white, will look sorta grimy) and nobody likes that.Would I buy any more... ahhmm... jury's still out on that one, but right now I'm leaning towards no.
