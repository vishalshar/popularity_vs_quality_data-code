Vs EZPZ Mats: no comparisonEZPZ mats are much thicker, heavier & "clingier". I can't even find a use for this as the product does not make full contact on table. It has a nice high lip but I find this thin, lumpy placemat pretty useless. Tossed onto floor at 15 mo, 18mo and refused by 3 yr old. Both like EZPZ. I hope my mistake saves you money :-)
