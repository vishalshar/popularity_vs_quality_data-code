My son loved these sheets at first but soon the cool looks gave way to discomfort.  The feel of these sheets leaves something to be desired.  They are probably the most paper-like sheets I have ever felt.  If I had to describe them to a friend Id call them hospital like.  Perhaps there are some better feeling Cars sheets on the market but in the end we switched my son over to more traditional sheets and banished these to the closet.
