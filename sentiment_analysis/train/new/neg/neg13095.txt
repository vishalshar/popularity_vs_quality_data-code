I was really excited to use this with the Boon Naked Collapsible Baby bath tub, but this purchase ended up a disappointment. It fits great with the Boon bath tub and can also work alone in the tub. However,  it has a strong chemical smell to it and got moldy after use for a month. My newborn kept breaking out in rashes and once this was eliminated,  they went away. It's not worth the cost to replace it frequently and is not very hygienic. I would much rather get something I can wash in the washer.
