This is a simple design and it functions fine, but I don't get the feeling my kid is very safe while in it.  The extra seat belt doohickey to adjust the seat belt at the shoulder doesn't make sense and the instructions weren't straightforward, so I simply don't use it.  Also, when the kid's not in it, the seat slides where it wants to (during spirited driving) and I now wish I'd purchased a model that uses the LATCH system.  I was duped into thinking all Evenflo products are made in USA, but it says Made in China right on it and that kinda sucks.  Still, this booster appears as safe as any out there so I'll keep it until something better catches my eye.
