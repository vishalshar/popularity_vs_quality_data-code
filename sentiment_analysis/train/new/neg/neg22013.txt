The dimensions on these sheets (not listed in the ad!) are 14"x 31".  A standard portable/mini crib mattress is 24" x 38".  The sheet quality appears nice, but they are not made to fit my mattress. The caption needs to be corrected and the dimensions printed on the package should be clearly listed in the ad!
