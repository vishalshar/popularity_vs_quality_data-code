As many others have said, the seat belt guides on this seat are of a comically bad design.  The guides are essentially the exact width of a seat belt and the pathway is exactly perpendicular with the seat back.  If you plan to use this seat with a seat belt that is attached to the frame of the car, it will have no chance of working properly.  It took considerable effort to pull the seat belt through the guide and the seat belt retractor had no chance of pulling back in the slack when the seat belt was released.The seat appears to be good quality, but it will only work in newer cars with seat belts integrated into the seat backs.
