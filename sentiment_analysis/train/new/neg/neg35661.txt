I so wanted to like this highchair. I researched on Amazon and other retailer sites about highchairs.  I really liked the OXO Sprout and the Boon Flair but couldn't justify spending that much on a highchair.  Now I'm back to square 1.  For now I'm using my Mamas & Papas infant seat with tray for meal time - he just sits on top of the table with us.Here is what I do like about the highchair:* It was easy to put together* large 2 part tray that can go in dishwasher* 5 point harness* Swing out tray - this actually worked well on ours compared to some other reviews.Here is what I wanted to like about the highchair, but these features just don not function well* Padding* Adjustable reclining back* Adjustable base* Compact folding* Takes up a TON of space* Wheels in front swivel - back only forward/backwardThere is almost too much padding.  I immediately took off the head rest piece as this was not necessary, then I ended up taking off what seems to be an infant insert. The padding near the head is strange, it bubbles up near the head making our sons head always slide to one side.  The material is coated and is slippery - he can't seem to get comfortable and is always struggling to keep his head straight.Adjustable pieces:Reclining back - the positions almost seem to be if you wanted to use the highchair as a bouncy seat, when I put him more upright the head sliding thing becomes even worse.Adjustable base - This is just cumbersome - its hard to maneuver and you almost need 2 people to push the red buttons on either sideCompact folding - this part is just horrible - it is not at all compact and it is VERY unstable when it is folded.  Just walking past it or trying to move it slightly has caused the entire thing to topple over.Wheels - The front wheels move in all directions and the back only move forward/backward.  With the shear size of this the wheels just do not work well.
