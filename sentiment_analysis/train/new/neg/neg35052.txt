We needed to secure many cabinets, drawers, and other things around the house to keep our kids out of them.  These seemed to be rated well and seemed to have flexibility to be used in many areas as you can adjust the length.We used these to secure drawers and cabinets (kitchen & bath), anchor things like light standing toy shelves to the wall, and secure dresser drawers.The pros:- can adjust the length of the strap- the adhesive to secure the ends is very goodThe not so good:- the plastic strap becomes brittle and breaks on drawers that are used a lot- the plastic strap becomes brittle and breaks more often when the length between ends is shorter (securing something with a small gap)- when closed, the plastic strap allows some 'play' because it's plastic.  The longer the setup (larger gap), the more play it allows. It's easily possible to have some pinched fingers happen with the amount of play it allows in some setups.
