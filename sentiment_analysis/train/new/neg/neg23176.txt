I have been cursing this car seat since I bought it 4 years ago. It is very difficult to get tight enough with only one person. The strap tightens on only one side which is not as easy to get tight as others that tighten on both sides. I tried to use it for my 9 pound newborn, but his head was not supported even with the infant insert padding that was included. It is also very large to fit rear-facing in a regular sized car. I bought an infant car seat instead. I used this seat once my son was older and forward-facing but it was so frustrating to get in and out when occasionally changing cars that I bought two Britax seats and this one is just sitting in the garage now.
