We've run into the same problem that I'm seeing in other reviews-- I bought the rail conversion kit approx 1 1/2 yrs ago just to make sure it wasn't discontinued, but didn't think to open it at that time. Now, when we're ready to use it, we've discovered it's the wrong color to match the existing headboard/ footboard, dresser and nightstand (still white but too yellowish) and apparently (per the instructions) there are different rail designs depending on what country your crib was made in. I wasn't asked which country our crib came from when I was ordering the rails and what we received doesn't coordinate with the head/foot boards; the new rails don't have the metal hooks necessary to attach to the headboard.Our crib was made in China and the rails only had instructions and pieces for cribs made in Brazil or Italy :(  Any suggestions from Amazon will be greatly appreciated!
