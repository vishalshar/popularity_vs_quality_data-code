Here is my review of the First Years Ignite Stroller. I have only used it three times so far. It is a really hard adjustment going from the car seat stroller to an umbrella stroller (for both Nolan and I).  The stroller itself is fine, besides the major lack of sun protection. The sun visor only has a few positions, which I feel is a poor design. It is really hard to transition Nolan from his car seat to his stroller without waking him up. The seat doesn’t cradle them in and I feel as if the crotch belt is what is holding him in place. It’s as if the actually seat part where their bottom goes is too narrow, because when he sits, he uses his thighs mostly as his balancing point (not sure if this makes sense). He cannot put his feet on anything to balance out the weight. That is why I feel like the crotch belt is holding him up. He seems somewhat comfortable in the stroller, but I don’t think it is a comfortable as other strollers, mostly because of the seat part. Will I think Nolan grow into the stroller? Yes…when he’s two. Will I think I learn to like it? I hope so. If he was my only child and I knew we were not having more, I think I would invest in a bit bulkier stroller so he could be more comfortable. I also don’t like that I can’t hang my diaper bag easily on the handles. I really think this stroller is designed for a bigger toddler. Not an 8 month old, like we have. In the end, I am going to try and return it (success!) and find a bit bulkier stroller that suits Nolan’s needs.
