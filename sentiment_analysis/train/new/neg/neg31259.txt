This stroller has some ups to it: it folds like an umbrella stroller, it's light. But the down's outride it: the basket underneath is way too small and hard to access, the wheels don't turn right and it's become harder and harder to steer with use (especially bad on polished floors),and the sun visor is way too small to provide any protection at all. Overall, I am just very displeased with this stroller. For the money, I wish I would have looked into another stroller or just bucked up and been willing to spend more for a better stroller. I know that with my twin stroller purchase I did a lot more investigating before I purchased!
