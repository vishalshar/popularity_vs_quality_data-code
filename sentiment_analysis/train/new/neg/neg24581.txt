the top is a hard plastic, its got a small spot where you can drink out of it however its very hard for my little one to suck on to get anything out, he would get so mad that he would throw it so I tested it out and I couldn't get anything out, not wanting to return I just made the hole bigger but now my problem is its no longer  drip free like before
