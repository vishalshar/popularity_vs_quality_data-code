I bought this product a few years ago and loved it. However, I recently purchased my second one in preparation for baby 2 and I am not happy with it mostly because the bottom rack is fairly unstable and does not seem to stay in place without looking lopsided or wobbling- I remember the last drying rack seemed much sturdier.  Not sure if I'm missing something or if they changed the design but overall I am disappointed that it did not live up to my previous drying rack.UPDATE: Downgrading from 2 stars to 1. I ordered a replacement rack in the hope that it would solve the problem and maybe the first was just defective. Not the case. The second is even worse than the first and the top rack doesnt stand up at all on its own, even without anything on it it just slides down. The base also is unsturdy and the whole product is terrible.
