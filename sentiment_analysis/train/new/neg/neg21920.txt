I could not figure out how anyone uses this.  Maybe they wait until their baby's nail are very long?  I keep my baby's nails very short and cut them almost every day and could not even get close to her nail because of the thickness of the blades.  For those who love this, more power to them!  I just could not figure out how this is better than the nail clippers with a protective guard.  I've stored it away and will try with baby #2.
