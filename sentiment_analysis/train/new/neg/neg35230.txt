This product is HORRIBLE! I bought it to paint a basketball on my belly for Halloween, yet the orange barely even showed up. I was lucky my friend purchased a $5 paint kit from CVS on her way over, otherwise I would have been screwed. Terrible paint, I don't recommend it to anyone. This is my 1st baby and I was SO excited to be preggo for Halloween, I'm just lucky I have a good friend.Save yourself the money and the worry, buy one from your corner store :(
