I bought these because it seems local stores don't sell slow flow nipples anymore. Intended for my 2mo. At first glance they look well built. They have a thicker wall on the nipple part and have these little internal nubs that look like they would prevent nipple collapse. I put them into three different standard neck bottles. Evenflo nursers, nuby, and parent's choice. Slowest flowing was about 1 drop every two seconds, fastest was about 4 drops every second. I figured it wouldn't be a bad thing since I could keep the faster ones for when my son is 6+ mo. I was just about to feed my baby when I noticed it had a pool of expresses breastmilk coming from the side of the nipple at the connection with the ring. I inverted the bottle and didn't notice a leak but somehow I bent the nipple slightly as I was bringing upright and a stream of milk came from the top of the ring where I noticed the milk initially. Tried this with all the nipples and bottle types and the moment the nipple is pressed against, the same area leaks. Perhaps if there was a baby out there that didn't move AT ALL while bottle feeding these might work. Sadly these don't work for my baby.
