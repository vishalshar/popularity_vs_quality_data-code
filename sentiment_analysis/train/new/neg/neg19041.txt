Cute design and it matches the rest of the Sugar Plum set perfectly.  It is, however, very poorly made just like the other hampers like it (I have a Lambs & Ivy hamper in my other nursery and it's made the same way).  For the amount of money they charge there's no reason they can't use better materials to make a better, sturdier product.  It's flimsy and the wood seems like it will break easily.
