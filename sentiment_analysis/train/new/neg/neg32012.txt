I got this organizer for my Baby Jogger City Select. I bought a Baby Jogger parent console and returned it because the velcro folded in and interfere with the two holes. The Baby Jogger also has only one net pocket in the front while this Britax has three. The Baby Jogger is shorter making drinks stand up more and more chances of falling out. Seems like the Britax is a winner given all the deficiency to the Baby Jogger. But. The Baby Jogger velcro is much much stronger. It is really difficult to remove. The Britax velcro is too loose in comparison and when you put something in you hear the sound of the velcro coming undone.
