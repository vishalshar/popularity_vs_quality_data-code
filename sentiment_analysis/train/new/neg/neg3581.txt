I purchased these bibs as I thought they were similar to the bibs I purchased at a local target store. These bibs were supposedly made by the same company, and just had a different pattern. Upon receiving them I noticed the the fabric didn't feel as soft and "towel like" as the bibs I purchased from Target. I thought after washing them they would soften up. They did soften slightly, but I can still feel the difference (thinner, less soft, and the color appears less saturated). I will spend the extra few dollars and buy the Targets bibs!
