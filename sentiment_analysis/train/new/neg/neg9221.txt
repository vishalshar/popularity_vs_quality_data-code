The blanket is cute. But it is super thin, not even symmetrical.Destroyed in the washer after a "delicates" cycle, while other more "fragile" things were fine.(Pilled, seams loose, bleeding, etc.)Cute buy to complete the collection, but be prepared to use it as mere decoration unless you want a crying toddler, a frustrated mommy, or an expensive dust rag.
