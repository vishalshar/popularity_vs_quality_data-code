I bought these for my 18-month old and 3 year to share. The younger child has no problem with it, but the older one keeps telling me his is 'broken', so I tested it out. Its seems, in order to get liquid out, tou need to bite and suck the straw at the same time, something my 18-month old must just do naturally, but my 3-yr-old finds confusing. I try to give both my kids straw cups to decrease mess and since my little one only wants what her big brother has. I was hoping these would work for both kids, but for that purpose, they are just 'meh.'
