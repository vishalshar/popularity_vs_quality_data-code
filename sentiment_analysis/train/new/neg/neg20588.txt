This is a GOOD product. I do like the idea of containing the odor of toddler feces. That stuff can be pretty rank. It does help eliminate some odor. And some grossness.As a former cloth diaper-er and a current fan of saving the environment as much as possible, I cringe at this whole process. Bag the poo, put the poo in another bag, ship it off to the landfill. I highly recommend flushing solid poos, and then using the bags to contain odor. Sigh. If only my son were not so sensitive to wetness, we'd still be using cloth. Anyway, that's totally irrelevant. There is a biodegradable version of these bags -- I ended up getting those instead. Makes me feel ever so slightly better. It's still a total mess, all those diapers in landfills. I'm not hatin', I'm just sayin'.
