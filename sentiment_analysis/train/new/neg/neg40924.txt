I purchased these bottles because of great reviews seen on other websites. Needless to say they are a disappointment. The product did nothing to help with gas problems. It also as seen in previous reviews the paint washes off I have only has the bottles 2 wks and the paint has stated coming off. I have only hand washed the bottles. Also they state they are "leakproof" My bottles are also leaking on the lid where 1 of the 3 anti-colic methods the white squares on top. So I would not recomend these at all.
