I've used this stroller for 6 months so far.  I got it at my baby shower.  According to a bunch of reviews on another website that sells this item, there seems to be an issue with the wheels squeaking.  This problem seems to be the case with my stroller as well.  It's not crazy loud, but mildly aggravating.  I've done A LOT of walking on paved paths at my local park and this stroller has probably gone about 30 miles thus far (literally) and it's holding up nicely despite the minor on and off squeaking.  Overall, I really do like this stroller.  I think the wipe holder case and 2 cup holders are handy.  The main handle part is foam covered and comfy.  Works well with the Mommy Hook I got too for hanging extra bags o'stuff.  It fits well in the small trunk of my Hyundai Elantra sedan (altho' with minimal space left over).  I like the net peek hole on the top of the shade of the main part of the stroller versus the plastic options offered on other strollers.  It's annoying that it doesn't have little ties or velcros down when you want to keep it open and it's a little windy.  The storage basket underneath is roomy (but, then, I only have a smaller diaper bag).  It's okay - decent on manueverability.  I hate polka dots in general and they seem a smidge femme, but those parts / fabric are minimal.  The major medium-bright-green and black colors I did like and work for a boy or girl.  The break down and set-up are easy in terms of use.  I didn't really put any of it together in the beginning out of the box (my +1 did) so I can't speak for that.  For the price, and with the exception of the squeaking, I think you get a lot of useful features with this particular stroller system.
