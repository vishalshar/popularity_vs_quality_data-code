This thing is adorable, cute, soft, and warm. I got it as a sleep sack. I thought it had a zipper for diaper changes. It does, but ONLY along the bottom, not the side. So that means diaper changes are very inconvenient, you have to roll this thing up when it's only open on the bottom, and there's lots of fabric to deal with, and it gets in the way. So not very useful as a sleep sac. It's very cute for dressing your baby up though.
