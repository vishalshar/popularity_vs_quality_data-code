After reading the reviews, I bought it anyway because we had a good experience with this brand of monitors in the past.  I have come to believe it is hit or miss with this type of monitor.  Ours was a dud.  It must be the luck of the draw.  I tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions and nothing worked.
