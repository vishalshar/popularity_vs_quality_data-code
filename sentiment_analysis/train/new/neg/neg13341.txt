I thought this would have some kind of elastic strap to seal it around the edges of the playpen, but it does not. It fits loosely over the top of the playpen, a wind could easily just blow it right off. I would not recommend this product to anyone, unless it's your last resort, you could probably make it work. But it was very disappointing.
