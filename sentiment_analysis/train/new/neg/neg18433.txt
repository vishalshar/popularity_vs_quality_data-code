I bought this for my daughter who has been sucking on her bottom lip when she sleeps, ever since we took her pacifier away at about two years old. Yes, I know, we are kicking ourselves for that. We should have ignored what other parents thought. At any rate, I had heard that these chewy necklaces were great for kids that have sucking/chewing needs. She even knew about it and asked for one for Christmas the year she turned six. It was a bit pricier than most stocking stuffers, but I felt like if it helped her with her problem it would be a worthwhile investment.She was really excited to get it, but I soon discovered that she never used it. She would wear it around her neck, but she wouldn't suck or chew on it. When I asked her about it she would say that it wouldn't stay in her mouth. Apparently, while the color and texture were fine, the thickness and size were a problem because she could barely fit it into her small mouth, and unlike a pacifier, she couldn't just put it in and leave it because it just took too much sucking power to keep it in. Not really a relaxing thing. So we still have it, and maybe someday when she's bigger she'll like it, but it's been a year and I can't help feeling like it was really sort of a waste of money.
