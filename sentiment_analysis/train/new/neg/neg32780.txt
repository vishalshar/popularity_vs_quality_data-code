Very disappointed. First of all, this company is very deceiving, this is NOT a medela product! I think it serves it's purpose but I think it would be better to state that they are not made by medela.Anyway, the shields basically do what they are intended to do, however, they barely fit in the applicators and with the right amount of force could def break it. The price is definitely worth it I guess just to make sure that you have the right size, that alone should tell you that they aren't medela.
