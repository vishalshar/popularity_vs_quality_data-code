We thought the colors were gender neutral, we painted the ceiling blue, the walls yellow, both a shade darker than the border and all white furniture and figured we would add pink Pooh accesories if girl, blue if boy. ALAS, it took my husband 4 trys to get this border up. Following the directions didn't help, then spray adhesive and then finally roll on wall paper glue. Buy 1-2 extra rolls, you are going to need them. For the price we paid you would think it would go on easier. My husband only had 1 week vacation to get the room done and the majority of it was spent running to Home Depot and pasting on the border. If we had to choose again we would not get this border. It wasn't worth our time.
