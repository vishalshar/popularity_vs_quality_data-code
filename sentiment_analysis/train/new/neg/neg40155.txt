The purpose for what this item sets out to do is AMAZING but that being said--- do not buy these things if you have young kids that like touching different items. My 2 year old trying to mess around with this and ended up pulling the plastic part off and then touching the light (which was pretty warm). This item has a pretty bad safety hazard and will likely cause some child harm. If you would like to avoid the need to visit an ER or urgent care center, avoid buying them,
