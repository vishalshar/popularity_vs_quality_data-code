Lacking in customer service. Our tray snapped right at the base where it holds to the frame of the highchair. To replace it they wanted to charge around $49 which is a significant amount considering a brand new chair is around $119. I will be looking for another chair because I do not want to invest any money into a chair that is super cute but not as great as I had expected.Pros: Modern stylish design. Nice colors. Easy to wipe down.Cons:1. While it is easy to wipe down a deep cleaning (as pictured by many other customers) is difficult and requires the straps to be removed by a screwdriver. Deep cleaning is necessary as food gets down into the holes where the straps are attached.2. Large footprint. The legs stick out and are easy to trip over. Defiantly not for a small area. We have a lots of space around our table and I still occasionally trip on it.3. The strap design can definitely be improved. I only use the bottom straps because the top ones are pretty much useless.Unfortunately I would not recommend
