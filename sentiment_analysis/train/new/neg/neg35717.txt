Works as expected, but the tubing had this weird film on it.  It's hazy and not to ally clear like the Medela ones.  So these are definitely not from Medela, but rather some other tubing with a Medela connector.  It says to not steam, but I rinsed it completely and then covered it fully with pure water and steamed it anyway.  I didn't trust that it had this film on it.  For a few more cents, go with a real Medela one.
