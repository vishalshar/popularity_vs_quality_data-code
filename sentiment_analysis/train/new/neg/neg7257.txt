so i picked up a set of 2 pcs.i cleaned with alcohol and mounted on alcohol'd glass.  factory tape fell off in a month.  no harsh use.so my 2 complaints are, they should have better tape and also the pins in the unit creep out.  the wings have these pins to hold it and swivel.  every once in a while i see a little silver peeking out and all i do is push it back in.  may be they should make these with alittle tighter holes so it doesn't creep out as fast.trying these out with some spare 3m command hook tapes. i will report back on how that works.8-14-14 updatedso yea, i keep having problems with the pins creeping out.  i posted a picture of the problem on the page.  the 3m pads are holding great for me. super ugly, but they work.i did have one break because baby tried to slide it open and since i didn't see the pins that time, it was only holding on one side.  so, only 1 side working on 1 side of the pin... it snapped the one corner off and i had to take it off.  please be aware... there are 7 main pieces to this unit you need to gather if you have young baby who can find dangerous items in hidden corners:2 x silver pins2 x wings for the body1 x main mounting body2 x silver springsi am going to try a drop of thick super glue on the side that it backs out and see if that solves my creeping problem.for people installing... please make sure that when you install, the wings both hit the opposite sliding door evenly.  when the baby tries to push it open hard, you want both wings of the block to be supporting the weight.  1 wing only and it will snap off likely.
