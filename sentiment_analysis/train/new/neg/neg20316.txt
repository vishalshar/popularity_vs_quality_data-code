So this attaches fine to a table, folds flat, holds my kid in when buckled. But It's extremely easy for a baby to slide through the bottom unless you buckle them right away. Usually high chairs have some sort of little piece that comes up from the base of the seat so baby can't fall through. But in this one, all that holds them in is the buckles. So every time I popped my baby in, she would arch her back while I fished for the straps and almost shoot through the bottom. I don't use it much anymore because of that.
