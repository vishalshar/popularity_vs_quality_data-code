I really wanted to like this wet bag - it's cute, has a handle (something I wish the Planetwise medium bags had), and is the right size. I've been cloth diapering for over two years now and have had three wet bags in rotation for sending diapers back and forth to day care. I needed a replacement for one that was getting threadbare on the outer layer, so I ordered this one. It seemed to work well for the first two weeks. I like the gusset at the bottom, and it's a great size for transporting the 4-6 daily diapers to and from day care. I did notice that the single layer (as opposed to the layer of PUL and a layer of outer fabric that most other wet bags have) made it have a little less odor-control, and if there was a really wet diaper, the outside of the bag felt damp. But for the most part, we leave the dirty diaper bags in the laundry room until we wash them, so it wasn't that big of a deal. We used it twice a week for three weeks (with two washings per week) and the handle frayed and came off today. This is very frustrating for me, and coupled with the thin single layer of fabric that doesn't hold in wetness or odors, I've decided to contact Amazon to return it for a refund. The broken handle after only 6 uses/washes is unacceptable. And why have a wet bag that doesn't properly hold in wetness?  The other three brands that I've used for two years have not had any issues like this.
