PROS:Competitive priceBest (and biggest) design compared to competitorsLarge kneeling area with very soft cushioningRight storage pocket great for Shampoo/baby washThe top part that drapes over tub detaches with velcro so that you can throw it in the washerFolds easily to store in linen closetCONS:Contacted customer service about quality issues with no response whatsoeverAs many other reviewers have mentioned, this product gets moldy FAST, despite being hung to dry completely after every use. Mold persists even after washingCannot wash bottom kneeling area in washing machine effectively due to it's size and rigidityFabric around suction cups tears over time causing cups to pop outLeft storage pocket somewhat small and uselessI had to replace this due to moldEven given the cons above, I still purchased another one of these and will just replace again once it starts to get funky, since I've tried competitive products, such as the Oxo kneeling mat, and found them to be either too small (even for my petite size), or hard as bricks and hurt my shins.
