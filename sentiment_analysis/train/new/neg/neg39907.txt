They are pretty easy to pop frozen food out of, which I like. (Mainly useful if you want to mix foods or decide to store them in a separate container once they're frozen.)The threading is on the inside, so food ends up in the threading, which is annoying. (Yes, the squishy part of the cup pops out from the ring, but I'm not going to fill them up and then pop them into the rings and end up spilling food.)The biggest problem I have with these is that they make the food taste funky. Some foods seem worse than others, but I'm not sure if I'm going to keep using them. I'm certainly not buying more.You can only link two sets together. This isn't a problem for me but I figured it was worth mentioning.
