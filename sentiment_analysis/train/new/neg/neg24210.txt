Dont waist your money! baby's only 6 months old and the string that hold the rod into place breaks the first week and smacks my baby in the face .... velcro on the bottom shredded the sewing on the mat so now its all falling apart ... stick with the 20 dollar ones from walmart for some reason same company but the quality is much better on the cheaper mats (had one from my first child but sold it not thinking we would have more kids)... so glad the music acc. was not attached because if it smacked the baby in the face she could have really been hurt ... I have had to sew this thing up 3 times & shes only 6 months old & we only started using it at 3 months of age ..... Please dont waist your money .....
