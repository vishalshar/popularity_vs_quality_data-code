I bought this several months ago and am still using it. I really like the ease of setting the water temperature where I like it then being able to leave it while I get my daughter ready. However there are quality issues. It will slide off easily if even grazed, so we have to be careful when turning it on/off or using the shower. We also have to keep my daughter's hands from it, and of course she wants to touch it a lot! It is not easy to put back on either. Lately the on/off button has become very hard to depress which of course puts pressure on the unit. For the price I expected better.Update: the little rubber piece that helps hold the unit on the faucet has completely detached and the on/off button barely works so this is now garbage. Would not recommend as it didn't even last a year. Couldn't get my star rating to change but would now only give one star!
