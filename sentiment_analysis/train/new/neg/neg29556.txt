Not happy with this Carseat at all!! My 2 month old babies head isn't big enough to go comfortably in the head holder..so his head flops to one side..so I bought the foamy head support piece..but it barely fits! So my child's head is squished! It would be nice if the head support when in towards the head .vs up and down.
