I ordered this one after looking at several different brands because my old full size swing was a pain to carry up and down our steps and out onto our porch.  My 3 month old loves it!  From the minute I put him in it, he seems relaxed and loves to nap in it.  The only bad part of it is that it is not really like the product description says.  All the pictures and descriptions show the swing folding up easy (with a handle on the backrest) and the back and foot part snapping together with a small strap to keep everything together when storing or moving it.  It doesn't have that strap or handle.  When I called Kids II about it, the representative stated that that model had been changed to no longer contain the handle or snapping strap.  They just hadn't updated the instructions, box, or any product descriptions.  Given it does fold up and is lightweight and small enough to move, it's still very tough to move the swing without the seat unfolding.  I guess I'm going to have to make my own strap with buttons or something so that it folds up since Kids II said basically there was nothing they could do but they were sorry.  I'm just sorry there wasn't a strap or even a notice that the snapping feature had been removed so I'd have known to go with one that actually looked and did what the description stated it would.  Otherwise, it would have definitely gotten 5 stars.
