I have a very active 3 month old daughter. She loves swiping and rattling the toys on this. However, the toys are way too high for her to reach, so I have to remove the toy bar and hold it lower with my hand. Also, the toys hang sideways, so she can't even see the mirror unless I turn it around. Baby sits lower in the seat than the picture shows, and there's not enough padding near the bottom. When she stretches her legs out, they are constantly banging against the frame and music box. The butterfly wings do not lay flat like the picture either. They bump into the toy bar which causes them to bunch up awkwardly. They bunch up even more as baby moves her arms. There is Velcro to hold them in the swaddle position, but there should also be some to hold them down flat when not in use. When she bounces, her butt comes very close to hitting the floor. She's only about 13lbs, so I can't imagine a 25lb baby playing in this.Update: I was able to rig the toy bar using some ponytail elastic a to keep it in a lower position (see pics). However, I've discovered more issues with the butterfly wings. They are positioned high enough to cover baby's face and become a suffocation hazard. I would not recommend this for sleeping/swaddling as their picture suggests. They also cannot be removed for safety or washing.
