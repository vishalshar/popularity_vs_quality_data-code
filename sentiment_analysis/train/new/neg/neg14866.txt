I love the Kiddopotamus swaddles. I have bought several (8) for our twin girls. They really help them to go to sleep by keeping their flailing arms & legs wrapped up tight and warm. The slit in the back is perfect for keeping them wrapped up while transporting them in their carseats. The swaddles are soft, easy to use and clean up well.The reason I gave this one in particular only 3 stars is because this one (100% cotton knit yellow small) and only this one (not the green dot or circle bear pattern) had the velcro patch in a different, less convenient place. I don't know why because the other patterns that I mentioned were all the same.  But the yellow ones don't work as well.  Also, Kiddopotamus doesn't seem to make swaddles in size medium. The girls are now too big for the small size but the large size it just a bit too large. We still use them, but they're not as effective. Medium would be best at this stage.
