UPDATE July 2015:After only about half a year of normal use, the windup mechanism in the music box gave up on us. We didn't use it excessively, and we didn't misuse it either. It just didn't hold up. Very disappointed. Knocking the rating down to two stars.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original review:My son absolutely loves listening to and watching this mobile. We can lay him down in his crib, turn on the mobile and leave him in awe for minutes. Every time it slows down and then turns off, he lets us know in no uncertain terms that we need to turn it back on again STAT. It's a great way of keeping him entertained while I can do something around the house for a few minutes. My only complaint is that it doesn't run longer, for like, say 30 minutes or so. ;)
