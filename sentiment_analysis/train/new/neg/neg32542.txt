These are much larger than I expected them to be. I did not look at the measurements to check beforehand and that is on me however it does say "fits most standard lunch boxes".You may get it in there but you will not have room to send a separate drink for your child unless you use a compartment for a juice box. If you are like me and do not typically use juice boxes you are out of luck! (Some other reviews have said that a juice box does not fit inside though i don't have any to test that.) I may look for a juice box size/shape drink cup, though it would take considerable food space away.They seem nice enough quality to me, I really like the idea of adding a picture or a note.The little spoon/fork compartment is a nice touch however the way it sets into the largest compartment when closed greatly reduces the height space you have in that compartment. The picture shows a banana in the compartment with the lid open, I'd like to see the picture of the squashed banana they got after closing it!The dimensions are indeed listed, however the photos provide you with a false sense of the space available. These would be great if it fit. There is no way I will send my Kindergartener to school with this not in a lunch box! So disappointed! These will most likely end up storing legos now...
