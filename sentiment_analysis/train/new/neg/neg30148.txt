I bought this first (& other variations of it) while trying to both secure & save my infant daughter from the dangers & ickiness of shopping carts. Nothing covered up enough to keep her from sucking on the handlebars, side railing, backrest, safety belts, etc. I found the Clean Shopper online and am addicted! It covers the whole seat area and edges of even large carts. So my daughter couldn't touch or lick any gross surface. Plus, her toys/pacifiers didn't drop thru the bars and fall on the floor. It's not really padded but blankets/coats do that trick if need be. It also covers the part where I push and I like that too! I don't even use the safety belt b/c my daughter hasn't really been one to escape (yet). We've survived so many successful shopping trips with it! Everyone who sees it asks if I sewed it myself and you could but who has time if you have a kid?!?! I also used it for covering up those wooden high chairs for dining but now the company created a special one just for that use. I have that too but the Clean Shopper saved us so many times from sickening situations. Plus, you can wash it and it doesn't wear out. These things are only partly helpful. Save your money and get the Clean Shopper/Diner duo! You won't be disappointed! I don't go anywhere without mine!
