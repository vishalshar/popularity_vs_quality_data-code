On unpacking, I noticed that the seams had come apart and the filling is coming out. This is hazardous for the infant and the parent as they can easily breathe the fine fibers in. I am very disappointed as in principle the product seemed very useful for multiple child rearing purposes and I was so looking forward to use it with my baby.I am figuring out the way to get a replacement which went through proper quality control or to get my money back.Update: I got a refund and bought a boppy but that too has extremely fine fibers coming out of the pillow through the cover, everywhere. I have repacked and stored it as I can't put my baby on it after seeing those fibers on his skin.
