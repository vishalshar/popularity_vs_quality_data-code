I was very surprised when I got this blanket in the mail.... I was picturing something bigger and more sturdy. What arrived was a flimsy, very small receiving blanket. Had I known that this is what the product is like, I would not have ordered it. For what paid, I had thought this blanket would be much nice. It looked like something i could have picked up at the dollar store. Love the colors and Dr. Suess, but the product definitely did not match my expectations.
