Maybe it's me or maybe I just got a bad batch. Not sure. I ordered one of these blankets for my daughter and loved it. Just what I was looking for. It's super soft and the perfect size for her to carry around and cover up with. So I ordered a 2nd one for daycare. Washed it before use and it pilled up a lot. So now it's not so soft. Thought maybe I just got a bad one so I ordered a new one and it did the same thing after washing. Disappointed. I tossed the two new ones and still have the first one. I ended up buying different blankets for her to use instead.
