I bought this to try and keep pollen off my 5 month old, since you can't give an infant allergy medication. Didn't fit my Cybex Aton Q Plus the way I had hoped, but it fit. Unfortunately my son learned how to remove this within a few hours! So frustrating. I guess it served it's purpose for the short time I could use it. I wish it had more was to really secure it onto the car seat. The fabric is super slippery, and the elastic doesn't do much to keep it on. Other then that there is just one strap to keep it on the car seat. Would love to see them add more straps.
