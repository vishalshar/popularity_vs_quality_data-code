I really don't think these are true Medela products, or if they are perhaps they are "after market" as the pieces arrive in ziplock bags loose in a box.  Looking into it further, Medela does not list the accessory set as one of their products on the website and the tubing doesn't fit my pump.  I am sorry I didn't notice this beforehand as I sterilized them and mixed them with my originals, but don't know that the ones I purchased on Amazon are either used and/or BPA free.
