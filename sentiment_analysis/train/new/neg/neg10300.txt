I used these when bringing homemade baby food on the go.Pros:*dividers make it easy to bring 2 different foods. I often used these for my baby's lunches, putting fruit in one side and vegetable in the other side.*dishwasher safe - It's not practical for me if it's not dishwasher safe.*The finger hole (where the spoon is pictured) makes it easy to hold while feeding a baby.Cons:*The spoon is not so great. It bent in all sorts of weird shapes (maybe because of the dishwasher?). We used them only as a last resort.*The lid can be difficult to get and stay on. I had to double check that they were really clicked on before I brought it anywhere. You're best bet is to keep it as flat as possible just in case.
