I do not recommended buying this overpriced rain-shield.I bought it just because of the clean nice look and compatibleness to my Quinny Buzz but I regret it.  Material is not durable at all. After just third use the top part of the shield ripped right at the seam where the plastic meats the white seam that is sewed on to hold it together leaving a big whole at the top where it supposed to protect baby from the rain. Thus rendering it useless!. I had to resew it by hand to be able to use again. Even after I resewed it it still came apart after a while so I just threw it away and bough one in the 99$ dollar store which I still have and works even thought it looks ugly and doesn't fit nicely like this one I have no more heaches and my baby is not getting wet because of a broken seam! Please save yourself some money and don't buy this.
