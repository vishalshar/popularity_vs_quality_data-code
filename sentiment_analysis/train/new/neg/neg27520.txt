I purchased these because my son had every size imaginable hanging in his closet and I desperately needed something to organize it better. They're cute and fit well on a standard size closet bar. Unlike other closet dividers I have come across the image on these are printed directly on the plastic rather than just being a sticker on top. Makes them look much nicer! The plastic is quite thick & durable so they will last.You have the option to organize the dividers three different ways with the stickers included which makes these dividers wonderful for longtime use. The stickers included are as follows (note: you get two of each sticker to use for the front & back of the divider):Organize by Type of Clothing: Outerwear, Pants, Shorts, Shirts, Blouses,T-Shirts, Dresses, SkirtsOrganize by Size: Newborn, 3-6mos, 6-12mos, 12-18mos, 18-24mos, 2T, 3T,4TOrganize by Day of the Week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, FridayTwo things that would make these dividers perfect:* The stickers should really be removable/reusable. It sucks you can only use the stickers once.* The sticker sizing is strange for infant sizing. Typical infant clothing sizes go: newborn, 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12. The stickers given with these dividers don't match the typical sizing so my son's closet wasn't as organized as I had hoped. 6mos clothes compared to 12mos clothes is quite a big difference so it doesn't make sense to group 6/9&12 months clothing together.
