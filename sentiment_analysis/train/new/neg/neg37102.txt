This product certainly works as intended, but some of the details are a little off. 1) the level indicators rattlers incessantly when no car seat is present. It gets rather annoying after a block or two. I eventually taped them down after I knew I was level.  2) the attachment straps can be hard to get on the vehicle depending on the configuration of that vehicle. One reason is that the attachment strap release is located right where you need to hold when attempting attachment. That means that if your vehicle has its attachment loops way down deep between the cushions, it will be hard to put on because you're literally forced to push the release button just to hold on to it. Obviously, pressing the release makes attachment difficult.  3) the Britax system seems longer than other infant systems I've used in the past.  I'm under 6 foot tall, but I always have to move the drivers seat up if its in the  seat directly behind me, including in my Suburban.
