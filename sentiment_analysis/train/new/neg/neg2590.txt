I'm pretty mixed about this crib. I love the price, but I'm annoyed by how easily the soft wood scratches. It looks beautiful (but we will see how long it stays that way) and it feels sturdy enough for me to put our baby in it- so I'm satisfied but not thrilled. Just to comment on the assembly, it wasn't too bad. Just have a second set of hands and follow the directions. Lay out the pieces beforehand, and if you've done some Ikea furniture before, you'll be just fine!Pros:- The price is phenomenal! We had initially purchased a similar crib at Babies R Us, but this looks almost identical for the fraction of the price. I'm talking over $200 difference!- It's beautiful. Hands down, it exceeded my expectations with the general over all look. Really makes the nursery/ guest room look quite classy.Cons:- I agree with several of the comments that it scratches pretty easily. My cat used it as a jungle gym a little bit when we had it in the living room for installation, but she's declawed.... and there were still scratch marks all over it from just jumping in and out of the crib. (Again, she doesn't have claws, just paw pads!). Also, I can easy indent the soft wood with my fingernails with some light pressure.- It came with some small damages in the wood. I'm sure I could have gotten a replacement, but it ended up being a hidden piece of wood, so I didn't bother. Otherwise, the packaging was great.
