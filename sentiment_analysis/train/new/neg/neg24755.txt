Their description of being made from local hardwoods translates to being made from plywood. They do not even hid it either. The layers of ply are easily visible. The crocodile itself is rather cute, The three main issues with this item are; 1) The cord that attaches the mallet to the crocodile's face is short, very short. My 18 mo old son cannot walk this thing around unless he just wants to drag the rear legs and pull the front legs dangling up in the year. 2) the green Fa key is obnoxiously too sharp. If you are not tone deal then this will drive you crazy! 3) The crocodile's mouth is designed to close to hold the mallet handle in its mouth. This is done by a single gear with a knob protruding from the gear. Huge problem, when your child tries to pull the toy in reverse the gear locks against the bottom of the mouth resulting it its immobility. In my opinion as a consumer, a purchaser, as a parent, and as someone who sees a better world for our children, I could in no conscience recommend this shoddy toy.
