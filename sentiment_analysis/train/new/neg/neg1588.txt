This tether works great with my beloved Omron HJ-720ITC, but: I wear my pedometer all day, every day, and the metal clip on this tether is a tad aggresive on finer fabrics & doesn't open quite wide enough to prevent snagging. On the other hand, there is no way you will lose your pedometer with this grasping closure. I gave in & ordered new plastic clips @ $2.50 a pop on omron.com for a kinder-gentler grasp that I know will break eventually, but will save my clothing. But: if you wear your pedo on sturdy clothing (such as denim)  these tethers may just the ticket for you.
