I used these nursing pads for my first three children and loved them.  They were super absorbent and comfortable.  I was disappointed when I had my fourth to find them discontinued and very hard to find.  These have been nothing but trouble.  This listing is for the original but I have ordered two of them from different sellers which were both the advanced pads (which are terrible!!  Didn't absorb anything and very rough).  Finally I received the right ones but they are different than they used to be.  Now both sides feel the same and irritate my skin after only a few hours.  They still absorb ok but not as well as before.  I have since switched to Ameda pads which are very much like the original evenflos I loved but are triangular instead of round.
