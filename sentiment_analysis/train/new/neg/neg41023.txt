We found this wall border extremly difficult to put up even despite following the instructions provided in the package. The paint came off while we were using a wet sponge to put the border on the wall and the design got all ruined. The wall paper wouldn't stay on the wall either it would just peel off on its own after drying.We recommend you go with another brand.
