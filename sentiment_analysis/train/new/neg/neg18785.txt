This is the one Britax product that we purchased that I wasn't 100% satisfied with.  It's ok and seems to hold the infant safely and comfortably but I would have liked to have had separate adjustments for the shoulder straps and how closely the baby is held against the parent's chest.  On this carrier it's a single adjustment for both and it felt like I couldn't quite get the straps tight enough for myself without feeling like my son was going to get the air squeezed out of his lungs, so it never felt like if fit me right.  That said, it worked when we used it but I think the design could be improved.
