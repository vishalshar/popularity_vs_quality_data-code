I also ordered this sheet because I really liked the fit and quality of the pink dotted sheet of the same exact brand. This pink one requires alot of wrestling to put on the crib and today the elastic popped apart and the fabric tore. I called the company and they are sending me a return label for inspection. They said they will send a reimbursement check.
