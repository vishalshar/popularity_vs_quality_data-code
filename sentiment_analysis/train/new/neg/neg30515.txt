I needed a CD player for my daughter and this one is really expensive at $75 but it was cute and she LOVES Elmo so I got it for her.  However, it doesn't come with instructions, and it needs 6 C batteries (and it doesn't tell you that on the back of the device, which is screwed on - I bought only 4 batteries and had to go back out for more).  Also, it doesn't come with an adapter so I had to buy one separate - hope it works!  I wouldn't buy this.
