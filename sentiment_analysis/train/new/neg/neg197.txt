Spacious bag with plenty of pockets. I loved the stroller straps that were included but unfortunately lost one! I also like that it has a longer strap to attach to it and use more like a messenger bag. My biggest issue is with the gaudy inner color of the fabric. I hate it. It's a super bright yellowish-green and I feel like it cheapens the look of the bag. I wish I could've chosen my own color (the blue that comes with the brown bag is slightly less offensive) or that the inside matched the outside color.
