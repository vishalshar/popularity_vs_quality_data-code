The magnet is strong enough to pick up the fish, but they float upside down so you can't use it very easily in the tub at all. I even tried putting varying amounts of water in them to see if it changed the buoyancy any; it did not.I thought, no big deal, we'll use it in the living room. But as soon as my son figured out he could swing the bobber around like a mace, I quickly realized we would be replacing the TV and windows soon if I didn't take it away. The bobber itself is sturdy and hurts pretty dang bad if you get hit with it.Good idea, bad design.
