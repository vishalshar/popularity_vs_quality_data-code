I ordered it three years ago for my daughter when she was 6 months old, I have mixed feeling about this product, since she loved play in it everyday, but one day (when she was 9 months old ) she got bounced out of the seat and landed on the floor, I was devastated, I think the problem is there is no seat belt to hold her inside the seat when she bounced out, now I have second baby, I'm very hesitate to put her in this Jumper
