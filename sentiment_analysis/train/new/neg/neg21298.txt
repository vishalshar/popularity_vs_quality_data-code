I liked the concept behind this carrier, but I just couldn't handly the weight of my 12 pound baby on my stomach.  My back started hurting  after 15 minutes of walking around with him strapped on to me at the mall. It's okay to use for short period of time, but I definitely would rather use a stroller for longer walks at the mall or park.
