My mother ordered this play yard so my husband and I wouldn't have to lug our Evenflo Portable BabySuiteÂ® Deluxe Playard with us everytime we went to visit (our son currently sleeps in it).  It was super easy to set up, but the only down side is my son hates it.  The folding mattress it brings isn't exactly what I would consider a "mattress", even by Pack n play standards.  I could clearly feel the divisions of where it was meant to fold, as well as the bottom parts of the pack n play.  My month old baby boy would squirm in it all night and never truly fall asleep.  It got to the point where at 4:00am I gave up and simply put my son to sleep with me in my bed.  It was the only way he finally went to sleep.Perhaps for older children it works fine, but as a place for a newborn to sleep (even if he;s just visiting) this play pen is a no-go.
