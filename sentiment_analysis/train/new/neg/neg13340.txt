Unfortunately, this necklace does not work for my son. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is really cute and I keep it on him. It does not work for his teething pain though which is very unfortunate because I was really looking forward for something to use that is more natural. As of right now, the ONLY thing that seems to temporarily help his poor gums is ibuprofen. I don't know if it's something I did, or didn't do but it never helped him. I didn't bathe him with it and I never got any kind of lotions and such on it. I took care of it and even tried "activating" it by leaving it in direct sunlight for a few hours. It didn't do anything.
