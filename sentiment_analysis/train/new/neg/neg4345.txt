I loved this monitor...for the first few months. I rave to everyone about how much I love having a video monitor, since I didn't have one for my first baby. I really do recommend that all new moms have one. But after a few months, the picture started getting grainier and darker until I could no longer see anything. Then it was basically a $200 sound monitor that also read the temperature. It has a 1-year warranty, so Motorola did send me a free replacement a few months ago. Unfortunately, the replacement is now starting to go grainy and dark as well. I called Motorola again. At first they told me that I was past the original 1-year warranty (by two weeks) so they would not replace it again. After further discussion, they agreed to send me another replacement. I'm glad they are replacing it, but I know they won't do it again when I'm stuck with a dark screen again in a few months!Unless you are willing to deal with getting replacements, I wouldn't recommend this product.
