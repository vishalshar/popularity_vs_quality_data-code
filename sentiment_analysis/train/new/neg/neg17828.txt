I have the heaviest wetter for a son. He's 2.5 years old and significantly taller than his peers (generally in the 90th%). So finding not only a super soaker of a diaper, but one that is also large enough to fit somewhat comfortably is tricky. I've tried many different things including hemp fitted diapers with wool soakers, but I wanted to try this because he just doesn't seem to sleep as well when he feels the wet against his body (like he would with a fitted diaper) and the mixed reviews and low price convinced me it was worth a try. Unfortunately it let me down. Of course 2 microfiber inserts are not nearly enough to hold all of his nightly output, but also, the way it fit even on the largest snap setting wasn't exactly comfortable and was just a little too snug and kind of seemed to cut into his legs a little. Also, the quality of construction just doesn't measure up to the other diapers I have in my stash. All my other diapers (of a variety of brands) are made in the USA and the quality is distinctly superior. Additionally, when I got the diaper it had a funny odor to it. Almost like it needed to air for a while (like some furniture that you buy). Of course I washed it, but it still had a strange smell to it. I don't know if that is from the packaging (I've never had any other diapers smell this way upon receipt) or the materials.I'm glad it wasn't pricey, I don't feel like I've lost too much that way. Maybe my newborn will not be as heavy of a wetter and will be able to make use of it eventually.
