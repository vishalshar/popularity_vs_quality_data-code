So, I love everything (almost) about this high chair. The design is pretty, not like most baby designs that don't go with you house decor. I mean most things yes, they need to be bright and colorful for baby's entertainment but she can't see the seat of her high chair, so I'll pass on the bright orange giraffes and blue elephants....thanks. anyways, the seat is easy to snap together and feels sturdy. It has adjustable hieght so it goes with my island or dinner table just fine. I love all that. Problem is...and a BIG one...my baby gets her little arm stuck between. The side of the tray and the leg!!! This was originally 5 stars for me but she gets it stuck and hurts herself and starts screaming. Now, if I buckle her in tightly she can't more far enough to the side to slide her arm down, but I'd like to be able to sit in front of her and feed her without having to strap her in so tight. My baby is small and only 4.5 months but still this is scary! It's hard for me to get her arm out after its stuck. Poor baby is screaming and I'm trying to pull her arm out. I hate it! It happened 2 times. This is a safety issue and need to be addressed by graco, maybe they can start making them with just an extra piece of plastic so babies can't put thier little arms down in between and hurt themselves. I give 2 stars because other than that this high chair is perfect for us but I can't use it without this fear. :(
