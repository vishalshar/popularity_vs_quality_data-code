Obviously, I can't not like this product. It does the job and provides power to my pump since my original adaptor cracked. But WHAT IS THAT SMELL? The cord on this adaptor has the absolute worst smell (think the strongest bandaid/medical equipment smell you've ever experienced), and I find myself with a headache every time I have to pump. The smell on the cord is so strong that I have to move my pump to a different room when I'm not using it. I have tried wiping the entire thing down with alcohol, and it still has the strongest smell ever. This is not okay! I've had it a little over a week. I thought I would either get over it or the smell would get better. Since neither have happened, I may have to return it.
