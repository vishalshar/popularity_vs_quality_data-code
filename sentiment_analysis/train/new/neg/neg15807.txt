We originally bought these three years ago for our eldest daughter, and LOVED them. They were seriously an answer to our prayers, because we had been struggling with her ripping bibs off for months. The velcro sticks great, they're cute, waterproof, and I love that both arms go in.I couldn't wait to buy a few more when our twins were old enough to use them, but am so disappointed! The material is much, much thinner than the one we bought a few years ago (and we still have it to prove it!). I don't understand why companies have to change a product just because it's cheaper for them. It was GREAT as it was then, now it's okay. It still works well, but doesn't feel half as durable as it used to.
