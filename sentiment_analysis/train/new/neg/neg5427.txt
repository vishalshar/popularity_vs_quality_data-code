The blanket looks nice, the outer silky part could've been a little more vibrant I think. My only problem really is that it is for a baby so I've washed it probably about five times so far and the silky part is starting to get runs and the threads are hanging out. I like it but for a $25 blanket, I would honestly expect a better quality.
