I guess fool me once, shame on them, fool me twice, shame on me...still, here are the issues.PROSsimple to usedecent picture in light and darkgood soundbeeps when the power goes out to the monitorlightweight (we take it places)no bells and whistles - no 2 way talking-music making-heat sensor funny businessCONSblue light on camera is INCREDIBLY bright -- like other reviewers, on both we covered ours with tapeblue light on camera is blue...why not red, which doesn't disturb sleep as much?sound on second one was way too loud, even at lowest setting it blaresbeeps loudly when you adjust sound on monitor (we stuff it under a pillow while adjusting)cord to camera is very short"rechargeable" batteries NEVER worked on EITHER monitor -- we ALWAYS had to have it plugged in to the walland, finally...........BREAKS EASILY (both stopped powering up even when plugged in)
