If you can afford to just buy a recliner... get a recliner and skip this.  I do not like recliners or rocking chairs, but our newborn would only calm down when rocking, so we bought one of these.  Most of the reviews talked about how cheaply made and squeaky this chair is but we didn't want to invest in a recliner, so we purchased this.  I am about 130lbs, my husband is closer to 200 lbs.  If you weigh much more than this or are overweight, this chair is not for you.  It has a slim profile and it squeaks which is not good when you are trying to put a baby to sleep. Also, the cushions wear quickly and it is impossible to rest in this chair.  If you are just wanting something cute for a nursery and don't plan on using it much, this will work for you.  In the end, we bought a recliner for our living room.  We battled colic the first few months and sometimes napping in the recliner with him was all the rest we could get.  I also want to add that I breastfeed, so using a comfortable chair was very important.
