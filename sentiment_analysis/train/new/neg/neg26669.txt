We returned this carseat and kept the "Evenflo Maestro Booster Car Seat, Wesley" (Evenflo Maestro Booster Car Seat, Wesley), which we had ordered at the same time to compare. The two models are very similar, the main difference was the amount of padding â€” the Maestro is just so much more comfortable, while with the Chase seat you could feel the hard plastic through the thinner padding.Even though we did not end up keeping this particular model, here are the factors that bumped up this seat into our "finalists" list:- SAFETY: 5-point harness keeps our 3-year-old more securely in the seat for longer (plan to use until 5 years old)- LONGEVITY: converts to seatbelt booster- attaches to latch system, so it doesn't slide around and is easy for child to climb into- affordable at under 70 dollarsThe main consideration for us was keeping our 3-year-old in a 5-point harness seat for as long as possible, but not wanting to purchase a new seat in two years when she moves up to a seatbelt booster. We had to purchase a new seat for her now, because our second child is moving up into her old seat. Technically, our child meets the minimum requirements for a seatbelt booster now, but after reading a few discussion on this, it seems that with every seat "upgrade" (changing to forward-facing, then changing to seatbelt booster) you loose a layer of safety. In fact, even in our car manual it states that due to a child's anatomy, they recommend a 5-point harness until 5 years old (their skeleton isn't mature enough to "properly" handle a car accident if they are using a seatbelt booster this young).While we preferred the Maestro carseat for us, this is still a nice seat and I can see it working well for a family who takes mostly shorter trips or for occasional use (grandparents or caregiver car, plane travel etc.).
