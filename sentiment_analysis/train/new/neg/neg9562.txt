Got this decor about 3 weeks ago. Just stuck it to my bathroom wall. The details look nothing like the pictures and the assembly was very difficult and frustrating. Also, some stickers were missing(only a few) and I had to use from other pieces to compensate. Wish it looked as elegant as the picture. Plus, it was NOT made in USA. The package came with an original Chinese receipt.
