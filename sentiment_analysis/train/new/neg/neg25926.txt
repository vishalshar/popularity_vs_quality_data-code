These are nice since you aren't supposed to use baby wipes or any other soap like item on your breasts.  I use them after pumping but generally only if I've had a plugged duct recently.  Otherwise, I just use regular tissue.  I don't think they really "soothe" any better than a washcloth or other cold compress.
