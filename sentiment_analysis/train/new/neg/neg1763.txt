This foot muff is your best choice for your UPPAbaby Vista, but be warned that even though the "back" and "tushy" section will have holes for the harness, the feet section will be loose and dancing around. I guess it's for baby's comfort and it doesn't become a restraining jacket, but for parents to have to flip it over every time, and stretch it before the baby is put in, it's kind of uncomfortable.Easy to clean, easy to install, and won't add to the bulk when folded.
