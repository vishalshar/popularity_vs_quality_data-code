I am very disappointed in the new model for babies. We bought a few styles of slippy cups and drink bottles as we did not have a preference. We found faults with multiple styles, with the worse being anything plastic as a drop from 3 feet would eventually crack the plastic.We had one Thermos Foogo that worked really well. The top and yellow ring were separate, allowing full cleaning of the cup. The durable base on the bottom was the only thing that remained on the cup.We bought another online (this product), which looks like the same model, with the added benefit of a soft spout, but this design is horrible. The handle-ring piece does not detach from the cup and has a hidden surface underneath. This area is unable to be cleaned and thus PROMOTES bacteria growth..for a wee child! I will be returning and/or discarding this product.
