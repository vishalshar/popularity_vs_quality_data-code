We bought this stroller for my son's walks around the neighborhood and quick errands, because our I'coo stroller is just too bulky and not practical for quick trips. The mesh backing, once you roll up the fabric is great for summer days, and so is the shade which can be adjusted to block the sun really well. What I don't like about the stroller is how narrow it is. My baby is about to turn one and he's a little guy (20 lbs.), and yet his shoulders just barely fit in this thing. It's very disappointing to have to search for another stroller.
