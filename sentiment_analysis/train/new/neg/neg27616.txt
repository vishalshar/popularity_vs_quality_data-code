I did the burn test and the salt test to see if it was real amber, it floated but when I put a flame to it it caught fire and smelt of plastic. Gave me an incredibly bad headache just being near it. Very upset that it was a fake. Sending it back right away. I wouldn't trust it even though it says "genuine". Id get it from a different website. I just ordered another one from Kellyscloset.com so hopefully I get a real one so it'll help relieve my little ones pain.
