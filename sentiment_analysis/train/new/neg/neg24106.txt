This product can work but you need to accept it won't stick to brick. I would recommend buying a roll of a product you can also buy on Amazon. There is a carpet protector that people use when they move. It's a plastic roll, sticky on one side and not on the other. Cover the brick first with this and then apply this product and you are good to go. I came up with that because I had some extra after a move and read the reviews online. If they sold these together I would have given 5 stars.
