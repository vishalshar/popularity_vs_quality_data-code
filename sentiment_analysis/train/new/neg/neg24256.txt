I bought this bottle for my aunt who recently had a baby. I take care of her baby alot and wanted to find the right bottle for him. He tends to have gas so didnt' want a bottle that would possibly cause more. This bottle makes a sound while he is sucking that sounds like air being suck in. It sounds like he is swallowing air as he sucks. The positive thing is that it is a inexpensive bottle. It also did not leak at all. It was easy to clean. The only problem is the air I hear. I placed the bottle down after a feeding and I hear the air being sucked in.  So I'm going to continue my search in finding the right bottle.
