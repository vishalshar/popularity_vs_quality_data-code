I've had this booster for about a year now and I have to say that I wish I had gotten something else. It was fine at first, comfortable (my toddler is a big kid so we needed something big enough for him) and it stayed put in the chair. After about a month or so, it discolored the wooden dining chair it was sitting on - beyond repair. I'm not sure if this is true only of the green seat. Also, after about six months a crack formed in the side (my toddler is heavy, again, so it could have been due to his size) and it eventually widened to the point that a huge chunk of the seat came off altogether. This is only after 7-8 months of use. I simply cannot recommend this product and truly wish I gone with another seat.
