I bought several of these sheets to match my bedding set.  I loved the way the sheets feel, however, I am not impressed with the quality.After owning and washing the sheets I noticed that they did not hold up in the washing machine.  I pulled my sage color out of the dryer and the sheet has a few holes.  I am diappointed with the quality.
