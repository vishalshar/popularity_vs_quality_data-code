Bought this gate to cover a 9 foot span. Installation and set up was fairly easy, with the help of a laser level to keep everything straight. Operation of the gate is fairly easy, unless your hands are full. My very adventurous and strong 8 month old twins are able to easily bend and deform the whole structure though. I had to drill holes through the plastic feet and anchor the gate into the floor to make it strong enough to stay in place.
