So, I have to say that as a pillow between my legs and to grip during pregnancy, this pillow is perfect. That said, I didn't think through the fact that there is really no way to use this with a different type of pillow for your head. It really ONLY works if you nest your head in the smaller curve. Sadly, if you are like me and the angle isn't quite right (it is a little too high for my head), it will wrench your neck over the course of the night and cause immense pain. It's so sad! I'm actually contemplating chopping off the top of it so I can use my regular contour pillow that positions my head correctly and doesn't result in terrible neck pain.
