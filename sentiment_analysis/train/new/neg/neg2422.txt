I had another Cool Calm Press in a different Colour/Shape that lasted me for years. I used one of these three times and it already burst. I literally wrap it in a paper napkin and place it on the swelling and when I took it out of the napkin, there was blue gel on it. Very disappointed. Not the quality of my other one.
