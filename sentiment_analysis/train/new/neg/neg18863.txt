The high chair arrived today. We assembled it and tried it out with our 2 children, but it's already back in the box and ready to be returned. We have several Boon products, which we love but this high chair is not our style nor our favorite Boon product. It looks like a cross between the Boon Naked bathtub, a outdoor toddler swing and a beauty salon chair. The base is quite large, cumbersome and not that easy to maneuver the hydrologic lift, the white plastic is matte and looks like it will stain with certain foods, it wobbles, it is not comfortable and the tray is far too small. We could not fit a standard size sippy cup/bottle and a plate together on the tray. I supposed you could use the tray as the plate, but that is not practical as many of us serve our children food on plates. It baffles me that they would not have made the tray larger to accommodate a plate or bowl, cup and silverware. My 3 year old after awhile asked to get out because he was "not comfortable". He has sat in a Peg Perego high chair for hours a day for over 3 years and never once has complained. The high chair does not recline, which is fine but it's so upright and rigid that I can see why my son said it was not comfortable and his "bum" hurt. The chair is definitely sleek and modern, it's looks super easy to clean and I love that food can not get trapped anywhere, but because the issues we had with it listed above we had to return it.
