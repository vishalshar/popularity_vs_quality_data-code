We rarely used this becasue it was too advanced for our son while he was in his infant carseat with the handle strap for it to go on. He out grew that before he was old enough to push the buttons and spin the toys. However, the buttons are very sensitive and the sound is very annoying, and there is no way to turn it off after it turns on.
