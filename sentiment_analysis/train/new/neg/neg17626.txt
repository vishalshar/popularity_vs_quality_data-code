The extended handles are awesome for my 6'2" husband.  He can push the stroller without having to bend over.  The wheels, however, are cheaply made, and they wobble and don't always all touch the ground at the same time.  It can be hard to push around at times due to the wheels not working properly.  This stroller was not made with great materials.IMPORTANT NOTE: I asked for a replacement stroller due to the wheels not working correctly, and DK Innovations sent one without question.  I greatly appreciated the prompt, excellent customer service.  But even the replacement stroller, though better than the first, still seems to have wheels that don't work quite right.  This is a good stroller for quick trips or traveling, due to the small size, but if you are looking for a very sturdy stroller for longs walks, or over rough ground, this is not the one for you.  It will work for what we need it for, however.
