The mattress pad for this product is made from polyurethane, which is not eco-friendly at all. If the eco-friendly tag is important to you (and that was the only reason I was willing to pay $250 for a padded tray), then this might be useful for you to know. I suppose you could buy it and then buy something an eco-friendly diaper pad, but for the price, I think that's a lot of extra. I returned this (great return service!) and ended up with a naturepedic pad, alone, without the wood. . .
