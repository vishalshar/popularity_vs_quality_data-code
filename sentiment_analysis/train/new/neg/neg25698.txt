This is a nice medium-sized toy box to keep in a living room or bedroom.  It is big enough for several small to medium infant toys, and it is useful that there are two separate compartments.  It is a nice stylish color that blends in with any d√©cor and it is well-made; however, I wish the bottom was reinforced like the sides and top of the box are (the bottom is just a piece of fabric rather than having hard cardboard inserts).  I don't think the fabric would rip even if the box was full and lifted off the ground, but I wouldn't try to transport the box around that often either.  Overall this toy box fits my needs perfectly but I think it should be more reasonably priced at $25-30 rather than $40. I would give it more stars if the bottom improved and the price was lowered.
