I've been searching for a nice , affordable mobile for our the ballerina theme nursery and when I found this I was so happy. When I opened the box thought it was really pretty, I couldn't find a mobile in the store which I liked. Installing it was easy but when I put the music it was soooooooooooooo short.....I'm still keeping it... as it goes with my theme but for the price I paid I think I could have gotten something better.Update:I' m so pissed.....my husband tried to put the music and the thing just broke.... So we just ended with a beautiful mobile that doesn't twirl....so disappointed .... I'm definitely removing another star...not worth the money.
