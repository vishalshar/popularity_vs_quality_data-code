So I haven't needed a highchair in a while. From what I can remember from my other kids, they made them a lot stronger. This one does the job but is kind of rough when changing positions from recliner to straight back, etc. Times have changed and the products have gotten more expensive but the material has gotten cheaper. Got to love it.
