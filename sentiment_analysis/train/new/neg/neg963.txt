I ordered this in White, Pink and Lavendar. Sheets are soft but small.  My craddle mattress is the standard 18x36 (same as sheet measurements). I do have a padded mattress cover over the craddle mattress which may be why the sheets dont fit properly, however it would be nice if there was a little bit more room in the sheets to fit around mattress covers as well.  I havent washed these yet either, so i'm sure they will shrink and i'll have a harder time with putting the sheets on.
