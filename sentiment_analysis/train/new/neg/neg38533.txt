Having searched far and wide for a US made car seat for our first-born, we settled on the Britax Companion along with the Britax Vigour stroller.To say the least, we were deeply disappointing when we received the products. Both the stroller and car-seat are short on quality, clumsy and poorly designed. It is not worth the price being charged. As for safety, I hope we never have to find out.The product quality which one would expect from a child product is not there. It is heavy and if you are not well-built, it is going to be difficult to carry around. Neither does it operate smoothly and efficiently.If Britax is supposedly better than the other child product companies, I wonder about the quality of the products from other companies.Anyway, this would be the last Britax product we are ever going to purchase.
