We bought this as a second car toy for long rides in the car for my daughter. It has these clips that you can adjust to what you want to attach it to. It fits out chicco key fit carseat and I am hoping to also be able to use it at our chugging table to entertain my little one as we change her.The companies customer service is very nice and immediately sent me a new one after the first one we bought was broken- the music wouldn't start even after we changed the batteries.As a car toy- my daughter does like to play with it- it has a rattle, a musical part and a cord that pulls and turns a propeller. As people have mentioned- there is a cord and you do have to be careful- as with any toy. My daughter has never gotten caught up in it. The propeller is soft and I have stopped it with my hand to see if it hurts- it doesn't.  Because its attached by the clips- its not as sturdy and as she has gotten stronger I find that if she pulls at it, it will unclip and fall closer to her. My main gripe is that she will often fall asleep in the car for long car rides and the rattle makes a lot of noise so that i can only keep it clipped to her carseat en i want her to play. If i know she's going to fall asleep i have to remove it from the car seat so the rattle deosnt wake her up or i have to place a different car toy on it that doesn't make so much passive noise.I have seen people use this on their droller but it deosnt seem to fit well on our City mini stroller.
