I got this cover when my baby was born. It is of good quality and does the job. However, the eyelet fabric is lined what makes the cover less breathable and extremely hot. My baby sweats every time underneath and so do I. Perhaps this cover is good for chilli climates but definitely would not recommend for anyone who lives in a warmer place, like myself.
