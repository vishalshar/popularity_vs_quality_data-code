Maya Wrap seems to have changed the fabric that they use for their slings since the last time that I've purchased one. This particular sling is a lint trap- it clings to everything, and the material has a scratchy texture. I love the color, but I'm disappointed that I have to lint roll it every time I wear it out of my home.
