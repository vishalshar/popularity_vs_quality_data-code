My baby prefers another brand pacifier and this does not allow the pacifier to be changed. I would like this more if the pacifier could be removed for exchanging and also for easier sanitizing. I throw all the others in the sanitizer or dishwasher, this one requires being dipped in boiling water to get the paci clean but protect the monkey. Not the best design. Also my baby ended up being not a huge fan of pacifiers in general.I put effort into writing a helpful and thorough review, as I often use reviews to help make decisions on amazon purchases. That is one of my main reasons for shopping on amazon. If you found anything in my review helpful please click "Helpful" below. Happy shopping!
