We've had these spoons since March 2010. I can't believe we paid $15 for this set of four and they're $8 now! Anyways, considering we paid twice as much, they are definitely not worth it. One of them chipped the first week we had them. We still have that one and we use it to prop something up in the kitchen now. But when we compare the others to that chipped one, the others are significantly getting worn and cruddy. (Picture what your wooden kitchen utensils look like after a few years of use.) I don't know about you but I thought I wouldn't mind oiling these every now and then but with a baby, who wants to think about doing that? We wanted something that is safe for our baby so we will probably get a stainless steel one at this point, which will probably last a lot longer (through many more kids) and be more worth the money.
