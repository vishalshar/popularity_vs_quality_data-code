Would not recommend this product, not safe.  The locking mechanism design is poorly designed.  The straps are held in place by a pivoting metal bar that threads through the strap and is then turned to a locked position.  However the force of the bouncing causes this metal bar to flex slightly creating a little space between the bar and the plastic piece it is resting against.  This can lead to the strap making its way loose and the seat to tip over.  My child was bouncing in this when one of the straps made it's way loose causing him to fall over and hit his head on the ground.  My baby loved to play in this but after seeing how the locking mechanism works, there is no way I would ever put him back in this thing.
