Do not buy this cover! I bought it as a backup for the frequent times baby spits up on it and it gets soaked... While the feel of the velour-like fabric is nice, the velcro is very poor design. You can't adjust the tightness of the buckle without undoing the velcro, and that's SO loud, and if you're not a teeny tiny woman much of the velcro is exposed after you position it on you. Then you're dealing with exposed rough, scratchy material and that's no good for baby or mom. Make sure you buy the cover with the fabric buckle instead of the velcro buckle.
