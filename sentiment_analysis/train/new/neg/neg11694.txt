Firstly, Amazon handled this beautifully. I purchased one of these Giraffes and after noticing the "fake" complaints, I went out and purchased one from Barnes & Noble and did a compare. Even though the "quality" of the one I purchased from Amazon seemed "ok", there was clear issues & errors with the packaging and toy itself that were dead giveaways. The one I bought was actually SOLD by Amazon. When I called their customer service, they immediately refunded the money and opened an investigation on their distributor. Please - everyone BEWARE, though I love Amazon, I would not purchase this product online. You have no idea what type of paint and rubber is used on the fake ones and taking the chance is not worth the few extra bucks savings. See pictures below for example of the issues on the fake. Some key things to point out:1. On the real and fake one, the serial number and (c) SLG were on example the same spot2. The font and colors were "off" on the fake one's packaging3. There was spelling mistakes. My favorite is misspelling of Hevea tree.4. The font and coloring on the packaging is different5. On the bottom, I had a sticker that said "imported by Callison" vs. nothing on the fake6. Hooves are bigger and more "defined" on the real oneI hope this helps everyone looking to purchase one of these great toys.
