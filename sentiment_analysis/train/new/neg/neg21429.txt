Got these so when baby cries in middle of night and just needs the pacifier we can find easily because it glows. Baby often throws pacifier onto floor and it's hard to find in the dark (obviously). Was a great idea to get these glow in the dark ones, HOWEVER, they don't glow at all. They are just regular pacifiers.
