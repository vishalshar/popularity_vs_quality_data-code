This fork and spoon are super adorable, and I believe that is the downfall. I bought these to help my 1.5 year old become more independent eating on his own. He stabs the food great with the fork (yay!), however he then put Elmo's head into his mouth every time and it takes 30-60 seconds to get him to turn it around and eat the food. Durability is great with this set and you can tell its strongly made, but maybe Elmo should not be so big as Elmo is bigger than the fork/spoon portion and its very distracting to a little one at meal time. I am now looking for another metal utensil set that is less distracting as this is not doing what I was hoping it would for us.
