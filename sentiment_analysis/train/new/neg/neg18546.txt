Despite giving it 3 stars, I really didn't like this monitor. I thought the camera would provide a better resolution that what it did. I could see things around my kiddos room, but everything on the screen looks a little fuzzy. Not a huge issue, but I was hoping to see if my child's eyes were open or not. We did have the camera placed somewhat far away on a shelf vs. mounting it to the wall, so that may have played into that part of my frustration, and you might have better success with the camera being closer to the child.Also, the battery on the monitor dies really fast! Despite fully charging it, the battery dies within a few hours. Again, I'm sure it matters how often you turn the screen on to see baby, but I was hoping for a longer battery life.Overall, it was easy to use and put together, so that was a plus, and amazon was wonderful in the return process (I did return this product)! I think I've just been spoiled by the Angelcare brand. We don't have the video monitor from them, just the sensor pad monitor and I LOVE that it is quiet until baby makes a noise, so there is no white noise going all the time. I also love that the Angelcare tells me the temp in the room. This monitor does not do either of those things. So, I will be purchasing the Angelcare video version baby monitor instead of using this monitor from Summer.
