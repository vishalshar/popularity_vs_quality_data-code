I hate this thermometer.  The accuracy is absolutely terrible.  It always registers low.  There have been multiple times my child had a fever over 101 F (per rectal thermometer) and this thermometer registered 97-98 F.  In fact it has never registered a fever in the two years I have owned it, even when my daughter had pneumonia and her temp was 103 F.  Plus it is NOT a good thermometer for a sleeping baby (as other reviews have said.  First of all it beeps, which wakes my child.  Secondly, it's very tempormental and has to be positioned just so (not easy to do without moving the child).  Don't buy this thermometer unless you just like wasting money.
