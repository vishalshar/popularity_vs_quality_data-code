This was a really easy install.  It worked like a charm for about a month.  I had it on my metal screen security front door, to prevent my cat from getting out.  i think this would have worked much better on a door that wasnt used so often.its hard to explain what exactly is wrong with it if you dont understand how it works...how it works: the rod screws into various holes around the middle of the oblong shape; the end of the rod that sticks out slides against a plastic guard to close the door when you let go.to make the tension, you take another rod they give you, and use that as leverage to twist the center part with the holes around.  it is a very simple concept, but difficult to do, especially if you are on a stepladder.  you have to have strong hands, especially if the door has a bit of weight (like my screen door, but not that it is a heavy door in the first place) which will need more tension to close it.the problem came when the metal holes that the rod was screwed into began to strip (im assuming because of the tension).  the rod finally popped off and wasnt able to be screwed back in.  the metal it is made out of seems fairly soft.overall it is a nice concept, but for a door that is used constantly and for one that has any weight (real wood door or a security door) it just wont do the trick, unless it is a temporary solution.  i think it would be best for maybe an indoor room, like a guest room that isnt used often but needs to be kept closed.
