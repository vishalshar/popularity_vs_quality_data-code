I would probably give this more stars, except for one fault: the light display and projector only work for 5 minutes UNLESS you also are using the sound option on a timer. This would be fine if the instructions explained it at all. The instructions only say that the lights and projection only stay on for 5 minutes. Luckily, by trial and error, I discovered that this wasn't actually the case, and you can get the lights to stay on longer if you first turn on the sound option and set the timer, then turn on the lights and/or projection. Not sure why you can't just use the lights/projection feature for longer without using the sound.Silly design feature, bad instructions.
