Got these for my son who loves bath time. At 8 months he didn't pay much attention to them and at 1 year he still doesn't. Occasionally he'll hold them in his hands and shake them-esp the one with little colored pebbles inside the plastic. He really only enjoys them when I do things like toss them in the water and make splashes.  Otherwise, doesn't hold his interest much. Cute concept just for my son he didn't find them interesting.
