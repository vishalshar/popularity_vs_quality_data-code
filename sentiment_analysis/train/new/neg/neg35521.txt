I bought these diapers for my toddler (35 lbs) because I was looking for a trim diaper that did not fit too tight on her chubby legs. The design is great and they are much trimmer than my other diapers but the absorbency is just not there. I followed the prep instructions and used them with the included insert during the day. After only 2-3 hours, they were wet all the way through, onto her clothes. My other pocket diapers hold an average of 5 hours, if she hasn't pooped. The next day I decided to try them at night and added my trusted g-diaper hemp insert as a doubler. Within 6 hours, the diapers leaked throughout the cover and I had to change her, the pajamas and the bed sheets. I don't have this issue with my Charlie Bananas or my trusted nighttime routine of a Kissaluv fitted with a Flip cover. Both last from 10-12 hours (her usual sleep time). SO, overall, the diapers are trim, they fit nicely on a chunky toddler, but they just don't hold as long as my other pocket diapers. Disappointing!
