We've had our double city select for a little over a year now and the front wheels lose traction all the time. It might not sound like a big deal, but it's a huge safety concern. This typically happens when crossing the street or intersections, and when it loses traction, the front wheels "freak out" to the point you can't push the stroller. Very frightening when crossing an intersection! I do like how this stroller is narrow and works for shopping malls, but it is very heavy when you have a 16 month old and almost 3 year old in it. Great sun canopy's and the magnetic flap is very smart. I can't give it more then two stars simply for the fear it causes every time we leave the sidewalk.
