The belt is actually pretty good and it fits nice.The sound is pretty good when tested outside.The huge problem is that you don't know what volume to set it for a safe listening range for the baby.I know that they sell the extra version with that feature, but if it allows for unsafe listening, then THEY SHOULD NOT SELL it without the other part.It kind of feel like a bad gamble one does not know about.
