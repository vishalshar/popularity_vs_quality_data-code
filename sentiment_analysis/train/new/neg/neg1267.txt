Here are the pro's and con's I found about this item:Pro:It is extremely difficult to remove the cover from the backing. I would say it is beyond child proof, it is adult proof also. Both my husband and myself had difficulty getting them off. So I have no worries about my child getting them off. *This is the only reason I gave two stars.Cons:-The screws that came with them have just about no groove in the heads, making it next to impossible to screw them in. I took a picture that shows the screw from the original outlet cover on the left, you can see that there is a nice groove that makes it easy to get the screwdriver in and get the screw in/out. The one on the right is what came with the outlet covers. I just about electrocuted myself several times trying to install these things because the screwdriver kept slipping out of the screw and almost into the socket.-On that same note, yes, I could have gone to the hardware store and bought screws, but clearly I have a child, so a quick trip to the hardware store is anything but. I bought these ready to install for convenience and they were anything but convenient.-Also you cannot leave the plastic socket plugs in the socket (for added protection) with these on. The backing will not go on if there are plastic plugs in the actual socket.-You cannot have a plug that goes sideways or that is large at all.. Our router and modem and phone charger plugs will not fit underneath these. It has to be a standard small plug.-You have to bend the cord to get the cover on. There isn't much room in there so you end up bending the cord and I kind of wonder if it's good to have the cords bent like that?Overall I am not thrilled about these covers. They are hard to get off, which is good and bad, and they were a pain (and scary) to install. And we are limited to the things we can plug in underneath these.
