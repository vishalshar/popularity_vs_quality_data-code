This does the job intended. Can't say much for the leak protection as we haven't had a leak or accident yet but my daughters mattress is waterproof so it really doesn't matter. I mainly bought it to add some type of comfort layer between the mattress and her sheet. I wish it wasn't crinkly sounding. I prefer the waterproof ones that are more like material not plastic. The crinkling isn't terrible.. Just not silent like her old ones we passed down to the new baby.
