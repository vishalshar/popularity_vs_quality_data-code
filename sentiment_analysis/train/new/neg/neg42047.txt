Such a cute toy, but the suction cups do not work at all! They came defective! I bought this for my son's birthday. He is a 5 year old autistic boy who has trouble understanding language. He had to take a bath right away to play with this, but started crying when it would not stick. I could not get him to understand that the suction cups that came with this toy were flat and therefore would not stick. The worst part is this toy was not cheap and they were special suction cups made specifically for the toy so we could not run out and buy more. I should have listened to the reviews. If you buy this toy you will be disappointed and worst of all so will your child. Good luck
