I bought this stroller and like it. I wanted a good stroller for a reasonable price with back support and storage underneath. It folds up great, easy to use and very light. My 2 problems, I kick the stroller wheels frequently and I'm only 5'4", can't the manufacturer's test it for this problem before they make them? And I dislike that the wheels fold in on the canopy and get it dirty. Other than that, the construction is good and I hope to use it for my grandson for a long time.
