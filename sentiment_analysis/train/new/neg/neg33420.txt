I was expecting this to solve my baby's sleeping problems due to acid reflux. Well, it didn't. Like some other reviewers have mentioned, this product comes in two separate pieces of somewhat cheap-looking foam. Once you insert both pieces into the cover and zip it up, it becomes a single unit and works ok if your baby lies completely still. I think the foam insert is not dense enough to provide a substantial elevation. If your baby lies on this wedge, the weight of the head will definitely reduce the incline and the baby's head will "sink" in a little, much like a pillow. Also, the cover does not let any air out. Somehow the air comes in trough the zipper when your baby moves, which results in a puffing up effect of the wedge, since there is no way for the air to escape. Another problem is the way the zipper is designed. If you place your baby's head at the highest point of the wedge, the zipper will protrude and could possibly scratch your baby. Instead of purchasing this product, I would recommend visiting your local craft store or buying a piece of denser foam online. You can cut it yourself with a knife or boxcutters and use a regular pillowcase, which will yield much better results than this wedge.
