It isn't well made. The best thing is probably the floor mat which my son amazing didn't get ANY cake on. lol. I went to put the bib on him and he broke it in about 3 seconds, so that never got used. I would have thought the bib would have been made from something cloth, but it was actually plastic bag feeling. I kinda felt like I wasted my mommy here, but it is what it is.
