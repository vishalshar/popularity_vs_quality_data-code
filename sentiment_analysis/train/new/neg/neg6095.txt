The shape of the pads is very awkward. The pad (inside portion) is slightly larger than the outer, so that the pad actually curves away from you instead of cupping. If there were some darts sewn into the circle it could conform to the natural shape of a woman. Even in a sports bra you can see the raised edges of the pad. On top of the shape, the lining sticks to my skin and borders on pain when peeling it away from my skin. The idea of this pad is great, the execution not so much.
