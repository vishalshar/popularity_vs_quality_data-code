Ok I've been using this bag for about a month now and it has become my LEAST favorite wet bag. It leaks! The zipper area gets saturated and eventually starts dripping any wetness the bag holds all over the floor!  While it is a convenient feature, really, turning the bag inside out wouldn't be that much more work.Still don't like the material. The pul is just not very sturdy compared to the Planet Wise bags I have.I wish I had just bought a different bag instead of this one.___________________________________________________I bought this item to keep in our bathroom for storing poo dipes after rinsing. I really like how it hangs on the door because we have limited space in our bathroom, and I like that the top stays open since the airing helps keep odor down.  I also like the zip feature for easy dumping of dirties into the machine.  However, I am not impressed with the fabric.  It is one layer of PUL and while it's nice and waterproof, I also have a different brand wet bag for travel that has an outer layer which makes it much sturdier.  I am skeptical about how this will hold up for the long run.
