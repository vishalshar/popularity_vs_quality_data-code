The cotton velour is great and it never leaks. Best of all it is made in the US.  But the thing I don't like is that the inserts get really stiff when they get wet.  The whole diaper feels like it would be very uncomfortable.  If it cost $15, I could recommend it.  But not at nearly $30. Try bumGenius or Oh Katy instead.
