I will start out with the positives.  We like the appearance very much.  we love the colors and patterns and textures.  The handle is comfortable and at a good height for both of us (I'm 5'4" and my husband is 6'2").  The parking brakes are easy to use and effective.  The carseat and base are both very easy to install with the latch system and seatbelt.  Easy to click in and out of the base.  It's been 6 months and while the system has fared us well, I have never been in love with it.  The reasons I'm not thrilled with this purchase are some construction issues and bulk. The canopy on both the stroller and the carseat seem flimsy, as if the plastic ribbing wasn't sturdy enough for the thick fabric materials so you have sort of a floppy misshapen canopy.  Also the same issue with the storage basket beneath the stroller, one side of the plastic ribbing is misshapen and while it doesn't effect function much, it is ugly. Not a huge deal, but has kept me from loving the set.  The carseat is somewhat heavy and cumbersome to lift, I end up bumping the carseat against my legs and cannot carry it for longer distances than from my car to the door.  My husband can manage, but with our 21 lb baby it is not easy.
