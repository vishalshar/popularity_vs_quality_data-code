Although I was desperate to get this baby swing there is something that I really do not like about this it is a b attery drainer! Batteries won't last 2 days. So if your looking to purchase a lot of batteries by all means, however if not graco is the way to go. My vdaughter had a graco swing when she was a baby and the batteries never died on me and I used it a lot. Just letting you know to keep your options open.
