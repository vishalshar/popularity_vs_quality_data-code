My 5 1/2 month old daughter likes looking at these when I hold them up in front of her, but unfortunately they just reallydon't make that much noise, so they don't work in the way they're supposed to: baby moves arm, wrist rattle makes noise, baby notices arm movement led to noise. The baby would have to be thrashing around maniacally in order for these to make enough noise for her to notice them.Other parents have said that they are too small - these fit on my daughter at 5 and 1/2 months, and it looks like they will probably fit for another couple of months, I hope, but I have a long, lean baby. If your baby is on the chunkier side, they may not fit. If you have rudimentary sewing skills, it would be easy to lengthen the straps, but that's an extra step that most won't want to take. Not terrible, but could be better.
