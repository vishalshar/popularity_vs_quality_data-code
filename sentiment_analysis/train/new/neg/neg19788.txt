The graphics on this item were horrific.  The overlay that they used for the referee graphic was not centered properly and therefore had many wrinkles in the product which made it look broken.  They replaced it and the second one was WORSE than the first.  The graphic was so far off, that the bottom third of the tray had a huge black space with no stripes.  The collar graphic was way off on the shoulder section and the tray itself did not lay properly on the table.  it was warped.
