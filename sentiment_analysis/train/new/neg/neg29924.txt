We had a lot of different teethers. Some were a hit, others were not.  This one was not.  Aside from the fact that you need to know to coat it with wax or oil before letting your baby put it in his mouth, parts of it felt a little bit rough for baby's gums.  Aside from that, baby was just not interested in it with so many other more colorful interesting things to grab and teeth.  I was hopeful that this would be a hit since there were so many great reviews, but ultimately it was just another item in the crib.
