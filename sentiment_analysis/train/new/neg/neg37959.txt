Bummis is a fantastic prefold diaper. You can put it in pretty much any diaper cover. I have Thirsties and best bottoms. Honestly the inserts I have for best bottoms do not protect the shell enough from getting soiled. So I haven't been able to reuse the covers unless I do prefolds.The Bummis you need to wash a few times to get max absorbency but they work so well! And I like that they aren't bleached.Update-I changed the rating to 3 stars because they shrunk so much that it doesn't fit my 11 pound baby, even though it says to 20 pounds.
