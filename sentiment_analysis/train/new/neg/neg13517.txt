I thought this cup is absolutely adorable. We got it for our 3yr old daughter who was so excited when we got it.I opened the box, rinsed it and poured her juice in it.By the time I put the lid on it and and started walking to the table it was leaking all down the side of my arm and onto our floor and carpet.At first I thought I had not closed it improperly or maybe overfilled it but when I ran back to the sink and inspected it; I realized it was cracked down the side.After pouring the drink out I noticed the inside of the cup was cracking as well.ðŸ˜¢So sad because my daughter thought it was sooo cute and was really excited for her new "owl milk cup" - What we originally bought it for.I really liked the idea that it's super easy to clean, cute so we thought it would encourage her to drink her milk and it's small enough so not too much milk goes to waste; since she isn't too fond of milk anyway but we never even got the chance to use it. ðŸ˜¢Not sure if this happens to many of them or if we got a defective one period but it would be a good idea if you decide to order this cup after all; you check it throughly before filling or even handing to your child.I'm hoping we got a defective one and not that this happens regularly considering running my finger through the side crack feels a bit sharp! I wouldn't want my child drinking little cracked off pieces of this sharp glass like plastic because it cracks on its own out of the blue.Guess we'll keep looking for a really cute, small and easy to clean, carry and drink out of cup with an easy pour out lid but sadly this isn't it for us. ðŸ˜”
