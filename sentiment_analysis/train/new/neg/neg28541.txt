I like this mobile, the critters are cute and girly, the hedgehog's texture and little flower "hair bow" is a nice touch.  They're soft and pretty and I'll probably detach them after baby is older so she can keep them.  I took the fabric off the mobile's arm as it was a really in-your-face pink and distracting, especially since the arm is sooo long and tall.I timed the music and it plays for 3 minutes.  Not long at all.  View from baby's perspective is nice, see video to hear music and see view.One annoyance is because of the packaging the orange hoop refuses to round out, its a smushed oval.  Can't really see from the side but it bugs me.
