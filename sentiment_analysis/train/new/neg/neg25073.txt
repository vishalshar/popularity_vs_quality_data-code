- good quality -- knit cotton front & plush polyester back -- a little heftier than I thought- custom fitted to uppababy stroller; doesn't get in the way of the wheels- it's not that large; there's just enough fabric to cover (completely flat) a 1.5 y/o (50th percentile) from about chest to toes -- shoes may peek out- Iight cover, so if looking to keep baby real warm, this may not be the blanket for you- machine washable but line dry only -- not convenient at all- attached to bumper bar, the blanket will be 'lifted' so it won't lay directly on baby like a blanket typically would; if attached to crotch strap, it will lay on baby like a blanket. Either way, baby won't be able to kick it off- there are pockets on the top part of the blanket, and the blanket easily folds into the middle pocket -- nice and neat. Love this!Overall, nice blanket, but a bit spendy and not a necessity. I think it is more of a cover than a blanket
