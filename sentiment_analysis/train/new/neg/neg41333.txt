I love this toy because it is too cute but it is made of hard plastic. It's rated for babies as young as 3 month and my son is four months. Now he is trying to shove everything in his mouth and of course did with this toy too and ended up splitting his lip open on it.  For now I'll just stick to some other toys and wait to give it too him until he's a little older an has some better hand control.
