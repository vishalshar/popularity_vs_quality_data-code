This thing is quick (~1 second) but wildly inaccurate.  The instructions note how you're supposed to place it *just* right in the ear canal, by holding/pulling your ear back just so and inserting this into the ear canal so there is a good seal.Even if this is done I've gotten wildly different temperatures, even on my own ear multiple times using the same method of placement.  I took my wife's temperature (when we got this, to test it out) and according to this she had a fever of 101.3, 102.3, and 102-something in 3 different readings.  We went to a corner drug store and got a digital thermometer (placed in the mount, takes about 1 minute to work) and it read 97.6.We got this to use for a newborn but with the wildly different readings and no confidence that any of them are nearly close to being accurate, what's the point?I'll give it props for being 1.  safe and  2. really quick!  But it's about as useful as a random number generator.  Wish it weren't, it would be a lot easier to use than something that takes 30-60 seconds to get a reading.
