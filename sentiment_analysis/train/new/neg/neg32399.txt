I hardly ever give bad reviews. I really hate to unless it's such a big disappointment or issue. This binky clip is not built to last. For the price I expected a bit more. The metal piece on the end has completely rusted out. The elastic has split apart. The fabric has become rough.I paid $1 more for my haba pacifier chain (free shipping if you sign up as an amazon mom). I'd advise anyone to purchase that over this. This is just not worth the money. Pay three dollars more for something cute that will last! So sad that this is just falling apart...Rust = -1 starSplit elastic rendering usless = -1Fabric loosing it's softness = -1Price = -1I don't really think it deserves this one star, but Amazon made me give it one.
