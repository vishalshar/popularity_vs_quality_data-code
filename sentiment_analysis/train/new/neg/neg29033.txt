It worked great for 6 weeks and if I would have reviewed the item in that much time it would have been 5 stars for sure.  Our 3 year old daughter loved it and she loved being able to wash her hands on her own while potty training.  But after 6 weeks the handle broke.  It was used multiple times daily, but I think there are issues if it breaks in 6 weeks.Update: I was contacted by the seller and a new product was shipped.  We are using the replacement and it works great.  I must have gotten a lemon for the first one.Newer Update: After using the replacement for approximately two months, the new one broke in the exact same spot as the old one.  I believe this to be a design flaw.  If you are looking for a temporary product, then this one is okay.  I have become proficient in sanding the connection areas smooth and gluing them which gives me about two more months of use.
