These nipples resemble the ones that they give you in the hospital for your newborn with the instant formula. These are a good transition for picky babies from those to bottles. The down side is that they go bad fast and fade and distort after a few uses. But they are not pricey and its good to stall while the baby grows. I used these with the little plastic Gerber bottles for a simple solution to my picky babies habits.
