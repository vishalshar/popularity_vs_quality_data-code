After reading many reviews, I ordered this bib to try to get to a point where we don't have to change our 8-month-old baby's clothes after every meal. It's not a bad bib, but it does not achieve that goal. On the good side of things, the bib tightly closes around the neck to protect against drips down the neck, it is easy to clean, and the pocket does stay open to catch mess as advertised.Unfortunately, in using it over the last couple weeks, we have discovered a few downsides. Our baby is tall for his age, and there is a gap between the bottom of the bib and his tray, and it seems like food and stains always get in this gap and mess up his clothes. Worst of all, our son likes to chew on the silicone material of the bib, and often does so. This means that anything in the pocket dumps all over his clothes, resulting in a terrible mess! So far we have still had to change his clothes after every meal using this product. I will keep looking for something else.
