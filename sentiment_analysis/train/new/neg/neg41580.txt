I can not stress enough... DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR.Prior to buying this monitor I read the reviews and noticed that they weren't that favorable, but we were so pleased with the previous Summer monitor that we purchased (The Summer Day and Night Monitor), that when we had our second child we wanted to stick with a brand that we knew (and don't we all want to believe that we will be different). Since the reviews basically harped on the size of the picture we figured we could get past that in exchange for the multiple camera feature.To make a long story short... We wanted to purchase a monitor with 2 camera capacity because we were about to have a 2nd child, and we wanted to be able to monitor both bedrooms. The added feature of being able to use the handheld unit to speak through the camera was a nice added touch, that we wondered why other companies hand not thought about. 8 weeks after getting the product, the handheld unit stopped working unless it was actually plugged in. Which completely defeats the purpose of being able to see your child from anywhere.We wanted to give the company a break, so we called and they actually ended up sending me 2 handheld units (I think by accident) with no problem. A couple of months later the same problem happened with one of the new ones they sent me. The handheld would only work when it was plugged into the power source. Which tells me there must be an issue with the battery. Now my son is a whopping 4 months old and today the 3rd handheld has completely stopped working. Summer should be ashamed to put a product like this out. I never had any problems with the Day & Night monitor. I just wanted to easily monitor 2 rooms instead of just one.Needless to say I am feverishly looking for a new monitor (any recommendations???)
