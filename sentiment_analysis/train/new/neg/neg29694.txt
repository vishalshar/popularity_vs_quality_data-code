We've gone a long 14 months for our little boy getting his first cold. I got this for my shower and haven't had a need to use it until yesterday. I used it last night and after I worked out a few kinks of my own, it worked great! Sucked out all kinds of nasty stuff. I was excited to use this thing again! Used it this morning and in the afternoon and all was good. Used it before bedtime and on my last suck, I saw snot creeping rapidly up the tube...just as I stopped sucking, I started to taste the salty snot on the tip of my tongue. Gross. As another reviewer mentioned, there is no filter so nothing there to stop the snot from coming up the tubing. Additionally, you're essentially sucking air from your kids nose straight into your mouth (not to mention snot) so if you weren't already on the road to sickness, you surely are now. I'm throwing this useless piece of plastic away and ordering the nosefrida.
