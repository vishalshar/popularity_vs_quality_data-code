I am happy for the most part with this bag. I have had only one incident where it leaked and did not stay waterproof. I used to rinse my childrens' cloth diapers in cold water before putting them in the bag. However, the last time I did that the bag majorly leaked. It was soaking wet and smelly on the outside. So I changed my strategy and now I put them in there wet, but I don't rinse them until wash day. Unfortunately I don't have a machine that will do a cold rinse, so I have to do it by hand. Also, I thought this bag would be slightly bigger than it actually is. I only use cloth for overnight, so I have one in hemp/cotton diapers with the waterproof pants you pull over it, and another child in superundies. So between the two types of diapers, they are rather bulkey and I really have to squish them down to have enough room for 3 cloth diapers, 2 superundies and inserts. I do like the strap to hang the bag. I would recommend this bag, but if you are concerned size I would order the larger size. Overall, I have been happy with this bag. With my new cleaning system, it keeps the wet and odors in the bag. I would recommend this bag to others.
