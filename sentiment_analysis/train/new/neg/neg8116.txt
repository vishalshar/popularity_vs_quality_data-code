I bought this before having our third baby this past August. Having been through the discomfort that heralds the start of breastfeeding two other times, I was hoping I had found the miracle product that would make the first weeks comfortable. Unfortunately I did not find it to be any good at all really. It was no use for sore nipples, which is the biggest problem when you begin breastfeeding. It provided minimal relief for engorgement discomfort. Basically it felt great for about two minutes after application as long as you kept it in the fridge. The same can be said though for cold packs, frozen peas, or a myriad of other products that are much cheaper than this item. The cooling effects from those other things lasts longer also. The directions state to apply it liberally to your breast area, which is great until you realize that you can't really rub it in. So then you can either walk around topless for a while, or get gunk all over your bra/shirt. It also has some kind of graininess to it that leaves grit on your skin after it soaks in/dries up. Over all, I prefer the Medela lanolin for sore nipple relief, and cold washcloths for engorgement relief, and to keep my money by not buying this item.
