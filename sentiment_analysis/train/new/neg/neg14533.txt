Very cute bedding but I wasn't too happy. The sheets are very rough and stiff, even after washing and drying and softener. The white giraffe comforter is like a flannel/felt type material and it pilled very VERY easily. This set is not warm AT ALL! It is very light and flimsy. What I DID like about it was that the fitted sheet had elastic on the end so that it always stays on the mattress, and the idea is super cute. Overall I was disappointed, but I really really wanted to love this!
