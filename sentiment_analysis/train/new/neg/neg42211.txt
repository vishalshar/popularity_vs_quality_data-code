I guess it can hold a few lightweight items, but my toddler just pushes it down, spilling everything and/or dropping the cup on the pavement.  Also, they are so shallow that even if toddler does not push it down, the cup tips right out when you go over a bump.  Terrible design and pricey.  Why oh why can't this stroller have a tray?  We eat a lot of meals on the go.
