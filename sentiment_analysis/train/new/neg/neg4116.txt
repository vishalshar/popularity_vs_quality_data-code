I bought this for an older crib I inherited from my grandmother.  There were no mattresses that would fit it perfectly so this was the closest I could get.  I wanted a new mattress to replace the old original one because it was starting to smell "old".The mattress is waterproof and seems like it will hold up well.  It is not as thick as I was hoping and I hope it will provide enough support for my baby when she comes.  I might have to use a few blankets or the original (stinky) mattress wrapped underneath it.  It is a somewhat tight fit for my crib, but it will definitely work.  Because it was thinner than I was hoping, it is more bendable too.  I am happy that it still fits the nice sheets that my grandmother made for the original one though.I will update once my baby has had a chance to sleep on it for a little while.
