This bag is good. I love the color and the size is great. It contains the smell of a dirty diaper and has held up well for the past 5 months. My only problem with this bag is I don't feel it entirely contains the moisture. Maybe it is not meant to lock in all the moisture for 6-8 hours. While I am at work my daughter's wet diapers are in the wet bag and by the end of the day the rest of the fabric in her diaper bag is damp and has a light urine smell. This only happens with wet inserts not full or all in one diapers. It is a little frustrating to have to wash extra bibs and socks when they haven't been used. I think it should have a better waterproof layer to keep all the moisture inside.
