I have a 23 lb 11 month old boy, who has been walking for about 6 weeks. I bought this for an upcoming trip to use in the airport since he loves to walk around and doesn't like to be restrained in a stroller much these days. Luckily I tried it out with him before the trip to get him used to it. I used it twice, for about 30 minutes on two separate days and one of the arm straps broke the second time. WOW! We were in an area where he could have been hurt if his other arm slipped out before we caught him. The arm strap stitching just came undone in the bottom of the backpack. I do not recommend!! I'm going to try to find out if I can return.
