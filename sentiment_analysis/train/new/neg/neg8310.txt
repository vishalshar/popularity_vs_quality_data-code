It's a great idea and it has worked with some friends' babies which is why we got it. My little one is 10 weeks and isn't fooled for a minute that mom is putting him down. It does help him stay relaxed if he is already relaxed (for a short time), but it doesn't do the soothing for us nor will he fall asleep in it. I'm hoping that will change in a few weeks, it was too expensive not to work. Right now I wish I had purchased a regular swing.
