The fit of the cover is good--no issues since washing it either.  I read some other reviews that washing this product caused color or peeling of the fabric but we have not had any problem.  I can only rate this product 2 stars mainly because I felt that the color was not adequately described.  It appears and is stated to be a sage green but I felt that it was more neon green.  I did like that the product included two but again the disappointment came in the color scheme.
