The blanket is soft and just fine for a baby. But I'm very disappointed that 'American' Baby Co manufactures it's baby products in China. I'd hoped American Baby would be an exception and that I could get an Anerican baby a baby blanket made in America. They should at least state that their products are made in China in the product description.
