Needed a timer for my niece, she has a hard time with time limits (like giving a 5 minute warning for her to wrap up what she's doing), she hasn't learned yet how to pay attention to the time when she's busy or doing something fun.  She liked the idea of a timer like this, and specifically liked this egg one (because I refer to them as egg timers, and this one is actually shaped like an egg, oh the literal child)  A lot of reviews say that theirs didn't work out of the package.  So I bought two, hoping that if one of them didn't work, the back up would.  Turns out that was a safe bet and one was non functional.  Luckily they're cheap I didn't mind buying two and am not going to make a fuss about the broken one. You get what you pay for after all.  My advice is, don't get this if you need something reliable.  If it's just to be a novelty item that you want to work, buy more than you need just in case. I'm happy with it because I wasn't expecting much.
