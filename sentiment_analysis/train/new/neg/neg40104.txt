I think these would be best if you are a first time parent, worry about timing the feedings, and/or really want a particular schedule for your kiddos.  My twins were #5 & #6 in our family and I am very laid back.  I do feed my girls together, but am not insistent they eat at certain times or intervals.  I tried using them 2 different times & found them to be more hassle than help.  I wish I had not bought them, but do think they could be useful to some parents.
