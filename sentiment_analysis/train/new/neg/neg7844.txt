The gate is a nice way to fix a baby gate "semi-permanently" to the wall without using some tension screw device.  I selected this gate for the top of the stairs in a bi-level home, because of the permanent fixture setup, AND because it doesn't narrow your walking path by more than an inch or two, unlike gates that tension themselves in place, which also require you step over something.1.  The screws that come with this gate are garbage.  Throw them out.  Use 2.5 inch or longer wood or drywall screws to affix the gate and the latch to the wall.  You'll burn the heads off or strip the garbage screws that come with it.2.  The gate is held up by two threaded rods that have a hole on the end for a hinge.  You screw in or pull out the bolt from the nut that is inside the gate to adjust width.  The problem is, there is nothing clamping the nut to the gate but the flimsy wood that the gate is made of, and the corners will crack in a month of normal use.  Take the threaded pieces to the hardware store and get a nut for them to put on the outside of the gate and hold tension.  The gate is 100% better, and easier to use with this in place - AND it won't break.The latch sucks - multiplied times 10 if the gate is loose and the additional nuts I mentioned above aren't added.  After using real screws and adding the nuts, the latch is not bad to use, and tricky/strong enough no toddler or child can open.All in all, it's as nice a baby gate as I've seen - just obviously had some corners cut in the hardware department.  It will cost you an extra $2.00 at the hardware store to get good screws and the two additional nuts.
