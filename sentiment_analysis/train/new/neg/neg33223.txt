Since starting to use this product, my bags of breast milk continue to break. I have lost over 20 oz. already!!  I don't know if the storage container applies too much pressure or what the problem is.  I am not even going to donate the storage container, in order for other mothers to not lose any of their irreplaceable milk in the future.  I am going to throw it away!
