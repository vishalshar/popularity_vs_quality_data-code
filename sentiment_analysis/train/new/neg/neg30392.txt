These are my least favorite from my Grovia's, Bum Genius and AppleCheeks. They are a bit snug for a one size pocket diaper. My 7 month old is average size at 16 lbs so it makes me feel like these will be the first he will out grow. I will admit though that because they are on the slimmer side they fit nicely under his clothes right now (but so do my Grovia's). The leak protection is great and the inner gussets are my favorite part of this diaper. They also clean very nicely and the blackbird design is so pretty. The really nice part is the combination of inserts that can be used with this one size. I use the stay dry duo insert, 2 cotton velour doublers together as 1 insert or with the duo hemp prefold. The 2 lost stars are due to the fitting on my child, at first I made them too tight but once I got a proper fitting it still made marks on my baby's legs. I want to love this diaper because it's made in the US and so many recomend but I don't think I would get another since this is usually my last pick.
