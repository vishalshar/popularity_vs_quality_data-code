I dont like this car seat , It is not user friendly . the baby still needs to face rear facing and the car seat does not recline enough for him to lay back comfortably . the straps are a bear to adjust and trying to adjust the seat back is ridiculous. I had to take the car seat out of the car just to try and adjust it.The buckle unsnaps one side easy but the other side you have put extra pressure on it to get it to release.I would not recommend this car seat to anyone.
