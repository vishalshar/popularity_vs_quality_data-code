MAY 9, 2016The charging port does not charge. I have bought 3 brand new chargers thinking I had a defective charger.  But it is the monitor that is defective and does not charge.  Initially it charged only if I held the cord to the port but now nothing.  My return date has expired 6 days ago. I ordered it Feb 16, 2016 and now it is May 9, 2016.  I can't believe this thing died and I haven't even used it for 3 months!!!!!!!  What a waste of $268.00.*****UPDATE***** JULY 30,2016I wrote/called Infant Optics about the charging port built inside the monitor not charging and they sent me a new monitor in about 2 weeks time.  They wanted me to recant what I wrote here and write a good review for replacing the monitor.  HUH?  I have been using the new monitor for two months now and the same crap is happening again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The stupid monitor DOES NOT CHARGE!!!!!!  Can you tell how pissed off I am?!  I had the other monitor for 3 months until it crapped out and the second one is crapping out after 2months!  I haven't even used this monitor for even half a year and it is useless!  A $180 monitor and extra camera for $90, including tax and all it came out to $300.  (HEY, THE MONITOR LOOKS BRAND SPANKING NEW, BUT DOESN'T WORK)
