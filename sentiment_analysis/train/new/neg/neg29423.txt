The animals are very cute and match the bedding that I have.  However, they keep coming off the wall where they were folded in the packaging.  When I received these, I laid them out and put heavy books on them to them flatten them out.  I left them this way for a week and it apparently was not long enough!  Either the packaging should be bigger so that the sheets do not have to be folded or they should come rolled in a tube to avoid the major crease.
