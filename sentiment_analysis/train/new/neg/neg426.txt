The only two pieces my baby cares at all about is the orange plush toy on the end and the green rubber teether. He doesn't think it's nearly as cool as many of his other toys. This will probably be one of the first toys to send to Goodwill. It does seem safe, and the links can pull apart so the chain can be shortened, lengthened, and other links added. But for the price, I wish I would have spent my money elsewhere.
