My table measured 180" and this was very difficult to put on and not something I'd want to take off where my toddler sits for each meal 3 times a day. I honestly wouldn't want to take it off even once a year! I bought this in hopes I could leave on unless my toddler was eating as the description stated easy to put on and remove however with measurement of 180" it absolutely did not work for that purpose and I returned the product. Otherwise it was good for preventing injuries with the table edge I just disagree with the description of being easy to take on and off. Perhaps if they made other sizes it would suit my needs and fit their description.
