The infrared lighting doesn't work when this lens is in. If you only want to monitor a room  when there is plenty of light in the room then this product works great. But if you are like a majority of people who want to see what is happening in a room when the lights are off then you will be disappointed with this lens. I like the camera, and the regular (non wide angle) lens works great in the dark. But not with the fisheye lens.
