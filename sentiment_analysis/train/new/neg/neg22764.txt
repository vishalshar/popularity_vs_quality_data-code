After using this product successfully a dozen times, I put it on to sterilize some bottles and it caught fire in the microwave.  THANK GOD I had a fire extiguisher handy and was able to put it out before too much damage.  The smoke and fire extinguisher, however, meant my baby and I had to stay away for a few days (and the cat too!) while Daddy cleaned up and aired the place out.I followed the directions (I keep direction for all baby products on the fridge for easy reference), and had used this product a number of times before (baby was 3 weeks old at the time), with no problems.  I'm sticking to boiling the bottles/nipples/pacifiers on the stove and my dishwasher is being installed in the next 2 weeks.DO NOT use this product without a fire extinguisher handy.
