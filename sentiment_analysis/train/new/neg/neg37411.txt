I purchased this playmat because the one my daugher had didn't have a tummy pillow that was small or comfortable enough for her to enjoy and truly engage in tummy time effectively. I found while this one was simple, it was pefect for her and at 2 months old, she was able to tollerate tummy time a lot better because the pillow was small and comfortable enough for her to use. Within weeks, she really started to play with the "console" too. She would grab at the key and eventually found her way to the crinkle flap, which for my child, was the BEST part!With time, we transitioned over to her other playmat (Baby Einstien) but still used the tummy pillow from this play mat. While she would occasionally still find interest in playing with the Bright Starts playmat, it just didn't have the same wow factor and didn't engage her as long overall when compared to her other playmat, which had more color contrast and more toys to play with. So while the Bright Starts playmat was utitlized for about 2 months, I still found it to be a valuable asset to developing a good tummy time routine for my baby.Overall, this playmat suited my daughter better when she was a lot smaller. It was easy to fold up for travel, and the actual tummy pillow was the PERFECT size for her. While I wished it had more bells and whistles like her other playmat does, the price difference reflects that appropriately. If you are looking for a small, budget friendly playmat for your child, OR a simple alternative to a playmat you currently own, this one from Bright Starts is a great option.
