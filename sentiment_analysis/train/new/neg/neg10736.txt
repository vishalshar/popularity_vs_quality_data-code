I am so disappointed with this product. The material is very thin. After one use one of the pouch caps broke. These do not hold much food at all. NOT GOOD QUALITY AT ALL.I also have this same type of product called the SQUISHY SNACK PAK and they are awesome. The material on these is so much more durable, easier to put food in and hold more as well.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SQUISHY SNACK PAK OVER THESE!!!!
