I did a LOT of research before buying this stroller, I compared with the bugaboo cameleon and I decided to get this one instead. It is a great one, however now that my baby is 7 months old I don't think this is the best stroller for her...Pros:* Great size and very accessible basket (I even put my small dog in it when he gets tired walking)* Drives smooth and easy to handle with just one hand* Wheels don't go flat (which is something really bothered me about the bugaboo)* Adjustable handle for my tall husband* It is a high stroller so my baby can seat on the stroller and still be at the table's level when we are in a restaurant* Very sturdy and well madeCons:* It is WIDE, when I am in stores at the mall, I am always bumping into rack bases, clothes and all kinds of things. When walking with other moms I am always bumping into their strollers with my wheels* It is heavy and bulky when folded, I have a small SUV and it still does not leave a lot of space for groceries and other stuff.* The reclining does not go very straight or very flat (this is the worst part of all) being a new parent I thought that 3 seat positions were enough for my baby, I was sooo wrong!! I don't know about other babies but she wants to be either straighter to see everything, or very reclined to take naps. Since this stroller does not have any of those features,  she gets up very frustrated. I don't think she totally hates the stroller, but she does not like it either. Too much time in it, and she gets very fussy, especially if she is tired. I compared this stroller with the cameleon in every aspect but this one, and I really regret it.In conclusion, although it is a good stroller, because of the weight, the bulkiness  AND the reclining restrictions, I need another stroller now, which really bothers me because we are talking about a $600 stroller. Think twice about getting it, especially if you are first time parent.
