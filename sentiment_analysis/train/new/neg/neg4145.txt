For those of you using a Graco Pack N Play without any additional mattresses (that is, using just the padded board that it came with), know that this sheet fits *relatively* well, if a bit big.  I really had to pull it taut and tuck it underneath until I felt comfortable that it wouldn't bunch up on the edges.  The reason is that the sheet does NOT have elastic all the way around; only on the head and foot ends.  I think we will be able to use it, but I'm going to keep looking for something better.Also know that this sheet DOES fit a touch better (more snug) than the American Baby Company Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet.  That one seemed to be a tiny bit bigger.  Again, this is for fitting over the padded board ONLY.
