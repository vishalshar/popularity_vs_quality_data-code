Does not fit to all seats as well as the picture. Says that "the bottom fastens around the seat for a secure fit," but the bottom straps do not fit around a seat, and Diono product support says it's not supposed to. Had to hook to bottom, and that leaves the sides drooping out, since the straps don't come from the corners. Top straps are also too far apart to fit nicely around headrest with posts, it causes the organizer to buckle.
