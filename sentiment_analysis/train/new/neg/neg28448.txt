The LectraLock has a few design issues that make me regret having purchased more than one of them before testing it.(1) LectraLock only works for cords with bases that send the cord in a straight line from the outlet, like those in the seller's first photo of the product. Unfortunately, many cords these days--including the majority of surge protectors and power strips--are designed with the cord emerging sideways from the base that's plugged in to the outlet so as to minimize the chance of something bumping and unplugging the cord. If you plan to plug in anything with a cord that emerges from the plug in any direction but straight out, either (1) the base of the cord will protrude from where the edge of the LectraLock is designed to snap in to the outlet cover (i.e., you won't be able to use the cover at all), or (2) you'll have to plug the device into the farther socket, in which case the device's cord will block the second socket and you'll only be able to use one socket with the LectraLock in place over the outlet. In other words, the Lectralock does not leave enough space for a cord emerging at, say, a right angle to be plugged into the outlet while at the same time leaving the other outlet free. (See the photo I posted with the LectraLock cover off due to the brown cord, which is designed to emerge from the outlet at a 90-degree angle.)(2) Even for cords that do emerge straight from the outlet, the cover does require you to bend many cords--particularly thick ones--in a V shape, often with the part of the cord leaving the outlet touching the part of the cord headed back toward the LectraLock's side holes, which tugs enough at the plug such that it begins to come out of the outlet. (See the photo I posted with the LectraLock cover on.)Ultimately, this cover will work for some users, but make sure in advance that the outlet with which you plan to use it either only has one cord running to it or doesn't have a cord that emerges from its base downward, upward, or to the left or right.
