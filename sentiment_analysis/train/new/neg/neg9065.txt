This is our third cloud b toy. We have purchased the constellation turtle and tranquil turtle as well. ( the later went back because the sound would not work at all)  We had high hopes for this one, as we would use it to lull our 6month old to sleep.  The ocean waves did put her to sleep and kept her sleeping.  Unfortunately, the sensor that is suppose to pick up any noise or stirring from the baby is not very sensitive.  The music automatically shut off, as it was set to, however when our baby awoke and let out a cry the music did not turn on again.  I had to manually turn it on.  So much for paying extra for the one with the sensor.  We later tested it and it did respond to noise but it was a very loud adult voice right into the sensor. ( my husbands pretend  baby cry)  I am not sure if it is just not sensitive enough or just doesn't really work that well. We had it laying less than 6 inches from the baby with the sensor facing her.  Also when we got the sensor to turn the music on again, it was not the last sound we were playing as specified by the product insert.  We were last playing the ocean sound and when we got it to come on again it plays the whale noise.  Not sure if we got a dud.
