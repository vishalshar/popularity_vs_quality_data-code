This is horrible! It does not stay up and does not keep kids safe. My 22 Month old toddler can take it down. She pulls it right up from the bottom. Don't waste your money on this!!!!! It will not keep kids safe! Also it's impossible to get it to stand up and not fall over unless you pull it ridiculously tight. And then it's so tight it comes out of the tubes holding it in the ground. Horrible design, poor quality and just all around a bad product
