I had this unit filled with food on the car seat, it slid off without much force, and the whole thing came apart.  I got this in hopes of it being secure and leak proof in my briefcase, but when the sides snap down they do not form a strong seal.  I will keep it and use it for storage in the fridge, but not for applications where a durable and secure seal is essential.  Nice idea, though.  Good for gentle handling.
