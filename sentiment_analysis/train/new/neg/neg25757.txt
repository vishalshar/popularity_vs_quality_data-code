I bought this mattress cover because it was advertised as waterproof and eco-friendly.  We spent an obscene amount of money for our daughter's mattress, so we wanted to protect it.  In the past month, my daughter's diaper leaked three times in the night, and it went through to the matress every time.  Extremely disappointed and upset.
