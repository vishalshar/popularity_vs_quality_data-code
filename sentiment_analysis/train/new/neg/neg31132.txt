This stroller seems to be one of the more decent travel strollers. I love the print on it, and it collapses extremely easily and is very portable. The fold down canopy is also a plus. However, it's what you expect it to be for the price/type of stroller it is. It isn't the most sturdy of strollers, and the front wheels tend to stick a lot. However, if you're not looking to spend a lot of money on a stroller, or you just need one for traveling (which was the case for me), this is the way to go.
