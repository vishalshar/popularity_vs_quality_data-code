Horrible stroller for the price. The push is terrible with an 20 lbs infant and a 30 lbs toddler. It would hardly push and gravel and wouldn't even move in sand. The fold is far to complicated compared to other strollers. The seats are VERY narrow. My 3 year old is a tall slender girl and even she seemed squished. The all over mesh on the decline is great in theory but it also allows all of the sun to get in so it is nearly pointless unless you are in the shade. The ability to parent face on or both children was the appeal to me but all of the other cons did not make this stroller worth it. I returned this product immediately.
