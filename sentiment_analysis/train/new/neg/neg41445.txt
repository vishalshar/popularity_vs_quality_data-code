This is a dangerous item.  It has hurt my son thankfully nothing serious, but he got his hand stuck hit his feet he was able to pull out the items on tray.  My son at 6 moths is the size and probably strength of a 1 year old.  Maybe most kids are out before these issue arose but seriously your child will be hurt by this.  The mirror is said to be a film but what every the mount it on had sharp edges.  I reached out to safety frost and they showed me how little they cared.  Serious skip this.  I am a real shopper.  I don't care what you but I am just giving you the warming I wish I had from someone before I bought it
