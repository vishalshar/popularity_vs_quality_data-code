I purchased one of these in Sept 09 for my 8 month old and really liked it. But it didn't last long. By December, it didn't light up anymore, and the music was not playing right (sounded slow).I replaced the batteries, and it didn't work at all. I wrote Infantino and complained and to their credit, they mailed me a free replacement within a few weeks. But now, 4 months later again, it is starting to not light up and the music is slowing. I liked it to help soothe my son to sleep, but it doesn't speak well for the product for 2 of them to wear out so quickly.
