Note: I have not yet used this stroller for jogging as my daughter is still too little, I will update my review in a few months with that info.We have been using this stroller since our baby was born, first with the car seat adapter (sold separately) and now she is big enough to sit in the seat. This stroller has a very smooth ride and quiet, especially compared to the stroller that came with our car seat. As other reviewers have said, it does seem like it could easily tip over when not traveling down a flat surface. The fact that the back wheels are much wider than the child seat makes maneuvering around objects difficult and can contribute to tipping the stroller over. The major problem that I have is that when you fold the stroller you cannot store it standing up, you have to either lean it against something or lay it on the axle, which makes me nervous having that much pressure on the axle. Additionally it is difficult to release the foot brake with your foot, especially if you are in sandals.I like that it has a hand brake; however the cable for this brake rests too close to the handle for pushing so it rests against your hand while you are pushing the stroller. I do like that the stroller can fold with one hand (although it is heavy) and the awning is great! It can be extended to 3 different lengths and can cover most of the baby on a sunny day. Additionally it is easy to adjust the seat back from laying back to more upright.Pros:-great awning-smooth, quiet ride-seat back easy to adjustCons:-Does not stand up when folded-Brake difficult to disengage-Seems a little unstable at times
