I bought this since it's the one that I've used at hospital while my family was staying at women's hospital for new born children.Opened it and instantly smelled some kind of weird (latex?) thing from the nipples. The one I've brought from the hospital never had those issue.Opened several one, but it all has same issue.Decided to return it.
