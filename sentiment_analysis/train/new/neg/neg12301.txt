I believe others have mentioned this but the brush (the one that looks like a miniature basting brush) rusts, I'm talking about after the first use.  I don't leave it submerged but rather have it hanging to dry between uses and it rusted after the first contact with water. They really need to change the metal that clamps onto the bristles so this doesn't happen.The larger wire brush is great. It's quite sturdy, holds suds well and it is long enough that I'm able to just wash Baja Fresh straws with it. It works well on the sippy cups in the house as well.
