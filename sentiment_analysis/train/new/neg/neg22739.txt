This is a very soft velboa/fleece type blanket. The design is adorablt. And I love the colors. It's modern and gender neutral.The size is pretty standard for a baby blanket. It's about the same as my other blankets (not from Skip Hop). Two things I don't particularly like are:1. The all cotton border. It's kind of hard, stiff, and crinkly compared to the rest of the blanket. I would have prefered a much softer and silkier material or a nicer grade cotton like a sateen or something.2. The appliques are cute but they are of the same hard, stiff, and crinkly cotton material. Also, they are one sided so the blanket is not quite reversibl because obviously one side is much cuter than the other, which is the back side of an applique and you know how that looks. It's white with threads...etc.The blanket is warm and toasty. So if it matches your decor theme, I would recommend. But definitely consider the two points I mention about the border/applique. This not the "perfect" baby blanket by my standards. Which is why I give it three stars. I mean, it's not hard to make a good baby blanket, or so one would think.
