I just received this today and I am rather disappointed at how different this is from the existing one in our home...we bought an extra for daycare and the differences are so obvious it really does make me wonder how this could come from the same manufacturer.  If there is something going on where these products are being manufactured differently from the originals, Amazon should disclose this information, yet there is no mention of that in the description.  I am truly puzzled - the smaller Vulli is COMPLETELY different just by weight alone, there is no density to it and it is flimsy and most definitely NOT the same as the one we got originally from Nordstrom.  Subsequently our 6 month old daughter seems much less interested in chewing on this and kept throwing it on the floor whereas she absolutely loves the other one we have from Nordstrom.  I would caution any considering buying this on Amazon to NOT let the price make the decision, as you will end up with two useless tethers that are questionably made and makes me a little concerned about the materials going into my daughter's mouth.  I can't even return them because I washed them right out of the box and gave them to my daughter.  This is priced well compared to the price in stores, but it was definitely money wasted for us.
