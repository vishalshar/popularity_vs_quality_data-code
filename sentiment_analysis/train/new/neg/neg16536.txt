My wife dropped this 11 Oz bottle (empty) from table once, and it starts leaking.  it is made from stainless steel??!!! how can this happen?Liked the idea of metal bottle. But since there are not much alternative, still using it.we have 2 11 Oz  and 4 6Oz bottls.  others are okay.  the nipple comes with the bottle was not the greatest as well. they leak if you are not wash it gentally.
