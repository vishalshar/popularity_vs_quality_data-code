I don't mind receiving whatever color they have available if the colors are gender neutral. My grandson prefers latex pacifiers and nipples and we'll take what we can get since they are hard to find. He'll use these for around home as they are pink/purple and definitely for a girl. It's really a shame that today much of the baby equipment is gender specific. Just a generation ago when my kids were babies things were more neutral, usually primary colors. It was so much easier.
