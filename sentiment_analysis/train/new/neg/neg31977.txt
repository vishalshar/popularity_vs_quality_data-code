This device connects via a 6 ft cord and the unit has to be three feet away from crib. This did not work with our current set up so we have this cord hanging from our dresser where the patent unit is and it's super ghetto looking. The cord is just too short. Also, and more importantly, the unit makes a loud beep when you turn it on, and since you have to turn it off whenever you take baby to feed at night, then you have up turn it right back on when baby goes back down. The problem is the stupid loud beep wakes baby. It makes no sense they would design it like that. So we are returning and will try to find something else
