This is not the carseat you see in the Maxi Cosi Rodi AP Booster video (original video form Maxi Cosi web site.) It seams to be missing some of the cool features like the accessory in the back of the booster that attaches to the head rest of your car seat to hold the booster in place, and the reclining system. The back of this booster would recline about one inch (nothing) only if your car seat reclines. So what this means is that instead of having a super rigid strait back, this booster's back follows the inclination of your car seat with a wiggle room of about one inch. So this is still very uncomfortable when your kid wants to fall asleep.In its favor I can say that is super light weight, it has a good looking simple design and the cover fabric feels nice to the touch and it washes really good.Only 2 starts because is not what I was expecting at this price range. Only reasons I was expending ore were the attaching system and reclining features and I've got none of those...I would have returned it but life was kind of complicated at that moment and I couldn't deal with the return, so we kept it.
