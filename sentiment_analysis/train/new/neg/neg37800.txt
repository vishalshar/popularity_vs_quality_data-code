I saw other reviewers complain about this item, but I took the risk. It has been working perfectly, but last week the light bulb blew, and I replaced the bulb 5 times, and it does not come on. It is so disappointing because the light was the perfect amount of brightness, it would turn on and off, and the design is beautiful, but all of that is not worth anything now because it doesn't turn on. :(
