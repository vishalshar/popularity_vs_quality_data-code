This is a good quality product, but may be better suited for bigger kids. When my 2 year old tries to climb onto the potty alone from his step stool he is in danger of tipping over from grabbing only one handle on this potty seat. When he is a little bigger, I'm sure it will be fine. I had to buy a small potty chair for the floor to train my son because it is safer. A sturdy double step stool might go better than a single step stool if you use this seat.
