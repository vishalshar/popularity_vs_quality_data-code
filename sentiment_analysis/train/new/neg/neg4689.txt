We had a great video monitor for our son who is now 2.  We recently had another baby so wanted to buy a video monitor that would let us add additional cameras and monitor them both at once.The features we liked:  the VOX option of only coming on when the child makes a noise and the picture was good.The issues:1.  repeatedly, one of the cameras would just turn off randomly and in the middle of the night, I'd wake up to hearing screaming from across the house.  Or I'd realize ahead of time that one of the cameras had turned off but wouldn't want to risk waking a sleeping baby to go into the room and link the camera back again or whatever they call it.  Then, even if it was synched, sometimes it would just stop switching between the two monitors, so it would be telling you that it was on for both, but only one child was really being monitored.2.  a loud buzzing noise.  Even when on vox with volume turned pretty low, there was a buzzing/feedback-y noise that came from the speaker.  I am a light sleeper and this drove me nuts.  I'd have to put the monitor on the other side of the room to sleep.  My husband is a heavy sleeper and even he was noticing this problem, which sort of defeats the purpose of having a video monitor.3.  it's confusing to work.  I am by no means a technology expert, but I can normally work every gadget we get after my husband gives me the run-down.  I could not figure out this darn thing and things that you would think would be easy to do (like switch from viewing one child to viewing the other) are actually lengthy and complicated.4.  wall-mount is inflexible.  once mounted, it cannot really be adjusted left or right and all around.  you can only mount it inline with the child and just make it go up and down a bit.basically, just a cheap monitor.  we had no problem with that--our last monitor was a cheapee, as well.  but the thing's gotta work!  come on, mobicam!
