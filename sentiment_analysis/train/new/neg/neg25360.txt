Product quality is so-so (similar to the Jumping bean collection at Kohls).  The idea is really cute but the quality of the towel itself is not very good.  I originally saw this product on sale for over $20 - - definitely NOT worth that price!  I later saw it on amazon for considerably less (under $15) so the price varies quite a bit on this one.
