I was excited to try these since they are a lot less expensive than the other brands. I used them last night, and this morning when I went to feed my baby the top layer detached from the back and a TON of gel beads came tumbling out all over! Super gross, and I would hate for my baby to get that in her mouth. I would not buy these ever again and I am going to throw out the rest of the box.
