I really liked it for the first year, but then after 13 months, the wheels in front started getting stuck pointing inwards towards eachother all the time which made it impossible to move from a turn to going forward again without leaning down to manually turn a wheel.  It seemed like the joints holding the wheels may have warped or gained too much flexibility.  Then at 14 months one of the back wheels started clicking, like the brake wouldn't disengage properly.  We did not have an unusually high level of use; just shopping and occasional strolls.  I am hoping to figure out a way to repair these problems.  For the price, we were hoping for greater durability.  This was our first stroller.  Before these problems arose, it was very maneuverable. I would give it a 3 if it didn't break, pros and cons listed below:Our baby did not like the bassinet at all and refused to sleep in it, but that may just be personality-related.The car seat attachment was my favorite setting for a long time.  It made transferring a sleeping baby perfectly smooth! It was very sturdy.I also liked the size of the shade; it provided good coverage from the sun and rain.The seat itself seemed comfortable, but as one other reviewer noted, there was nothing padded on either side to lean against except an uncomfortable metal bar for the shade, which made naps less likely, and required your child to actively protect themselves from shocks and bumps.  On the other hand, this did make it fold up smaller.Storage: if you had anything draped over the handlebars, the shade would not open all the way, so you would definitely need stroller hooks to store anything.  The basket is big enough for a bag, but there are only a few inches between it and the seat, so hard to get anything like a diaper bag in or out.  This was not a problem if you didn't assemble the seat, and only used the car seat attachment, but once your baby outgrows the infant car seat, it's really annoying.
