I have to admit, I was thrilled when I found these. I've been using Young Living Essential Oils for almost a year now, absolutely love them. They have encouraged me to educate myself about the products I used & how they can be harmful to not only me but my family as well. I've been ridding our home of harmful products & one that had to go was the makeup remover wipes I was using at the time.(If interested in Young Living or have any questions please contact me at blhock12@gmail.com )These particular wipes peaked my interest not only because they are organic but all the Scents the brand offers are natural Scents as well, I mean who really wants their face smelling of clean cotton instead of lemon, right?The shipping/arrival was delayed. I'm not sure what the reason was but I did not receive these on or by the date that was promised. I was alright with waiting an extra day or two but when I received the package it was soaked! The product (both packs) were opened & the moisture from the wipes leaked put everywhere. It was to the point that where the company handling the shipping get had to bag it prior to delivering it to me.Now, my next issue may or may not be because the packs were opened & leaked everywhere but the wipes were extremely dry which made them difficult to use & when I did use them I had to use 2-3 wipes to get the job done. (Note, I am not the heavy makeup type so if you are you will most likely have to use a few more.) There were times where I added a bit of water, but that didn't help much.I will not purchase these again from this seller. I may try them from elsewhere though.
