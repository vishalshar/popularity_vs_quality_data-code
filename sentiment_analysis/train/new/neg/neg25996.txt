At first I really liked this diaper even though it has a ton of snaps. It is slim and fits under clothes easily, but after a few times it proved to be too much of a hassle with all the stinkin' snaps. (If I take it off for Pumpkin to potty I dread putting it back on.) Then it started leaking through the shell. That's it...it's the only one in the drawer right now while all the others are in the wash.Pros:1. The print is really cute.2. It's a slim diaper that fits under clothes without the bulk.3. I like the way the insert is attached and washes easily.Cons:1. Leaks *through* the shell. It is not waterproof at all.2. Has way too many snaps. I think three snaps would be adequate, five is ridiculous.3. Leaves imprints of snaps on Pumpkin's skin.4. The front flap for the insert is very loose moves out of place while being worn. Weird design and/or poor construction.
