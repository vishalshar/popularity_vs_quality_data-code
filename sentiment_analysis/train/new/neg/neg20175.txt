The thermometer that is stuck to the cushion is useful but the plastic is too sharp and pointy.  It's not completely flush with the cushion so when you lay your baby down on it, the thermometer will scratch your baby's bottom.  We have to use a wash cloth to cover the thermometer when we use it.  I wish they would have put the thermometer somewhere else on the cushion- like the side- that doesn't touch the baby.  Either that or make it so the edges are not sharp.  The cushion itself is nice and gives good support though.Update-- I have since pulled off the thermometer completely.  It's glued on and when I pulled it off a bit of the cushion came with it.  Not ideal but better than having a sharp edge scratching my baby's bottom.  We just use the thermometer separately to read the temp of the water.
