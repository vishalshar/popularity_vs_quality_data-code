We bought this and loved it until it broke. BUT, I found that it is easily fixed.1. unplug unit2. remove the small rubber feet on the bottom.3. remove the 3 screws behind them4. remove the screw in the projection portion5. remove the screw in the main body that is behind the projection unitnow you can pull it apart and get into the projection unit6. you will see a rubber band/belt going from the motor pulley to a larger pulley. Plug the unit back in, and turn the larger pulley until the motor frees itself. It will start turning on its own in after a few turns.7. unplug it, put it back together, and enjoy your functioning projector.
