This product gives a great light and my 3 year old son likes it, but the switch does not work consistently, must press it multiple times to get it on, then change colors and setting the timer is difficult because while pressing it, the colors just cycle around.As a note for other parents, my son would happily go to bed with it but when I would check on him in a few hours he would be under the covers with the glomate up to his nose, zoning out staring at it, not asleep! We have since taken to putting it across the room on a tall dresser, setting the timer and telling the boy to go to sleep when it turns off.All in all, a good idea for kids afraid of the dark. It is a good night light for walking around a dark house and would be great for those middle of the night feedings. Mine just has a faulty switch!
