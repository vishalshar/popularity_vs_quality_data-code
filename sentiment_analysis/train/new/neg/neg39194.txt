We bought this gate to help keep our one-year old from escaping out the front door.  The gate itself is fine, and generally easy to use, even to open. with one hand.  It even looks nice.  The problem is the width.  The website says it fits openings from "28.25-38.25."  However, it actually only accommodates the following widths using the included extension frames:w/o Extension Frame: 28.25 - 30.75"w/ One Extension Frame: 31.75 -34.25w/ Two Extension Frames: 35.75- 38.25"The width of our door frame was 35".  It was too narrow to use both extension frames.  We tried having it up using just one frame, but it was rather unstable and not safe.  In order to make the gate fit, we would have to install a small piece of wood to the frame.  That was not an option for us.The only other issue we had with the gate is that the swinging door is somewhat narrow, and we're fairly thin.  The opening doesn't accommodate carrying the baby in the car seat.  We have to lift her over it, which got harder and harder as she grew.
