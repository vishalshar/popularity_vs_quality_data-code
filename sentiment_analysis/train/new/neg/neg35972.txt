We've had this monitor since April of 2012. At first we were happy with it. This monitor has fine picture quality, comes on if noise is made in the room, and has some nice extra qualities like room temperature, ability to intercom baby, etc.  The problem is that the viewing monitor started acting up about six months ago.  We would have to wiggle the wire to get it to go on, it wouldn't work without being plugged in, it would randomly turn off.  Now it has finally bitten the dust.  It won't turn on at all no matter how much it's adjusted.  This monitor was pretty inexpensive and I guess you get what you pay for.  We are going to contact the manufacturer and see if they can do anything since we are out of our return window.  It would be such a waste if we just couldn't use it anymore.  I would suggest paying a little bit more for higher quality.
