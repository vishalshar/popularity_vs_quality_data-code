I have attached this to our CityMini - It is great because it is versatile and will adapt to any umbrella.  Terrible because it is a pain to get off and on and adds significant weight to the normally light baby jogger stroller.  Also it is large and cumbersome so gets in the way of the rain canopy. I think we will be trying to find an umbrella with a clamp rather than continue to use this.
