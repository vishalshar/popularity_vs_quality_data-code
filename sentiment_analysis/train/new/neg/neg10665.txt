I bought these washcloths to use as cloth wipes, thinking the colours looked attractive and would brighten up the wipe warmer's contents - boy was I wrong!These washcloths are rough, the textured side is like sandpaper and the more I wash them the rougher they become, the also pick up fluff and the edges have become tattered and pilled very quickly. I've resorted to folding them 'inside out' because the inside is at least smooth and less like sandpaper. Also, if you're thinking of using these as wipes - a word to the wise: darker colours, baby poo and diaper cream just don't go :)If you're looking for good cloth wipes, I highly recommend the Gerber 10 pack wash cloths (in neutral greens and yellows - for the above reason), they wash well and are nice and soft.
