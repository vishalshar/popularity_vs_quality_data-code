So, the britax strollers don't come with trays for the little ones to put their snacks and sippy cups. I bought this tray and I was very disappointed when I finally attached it to our stroller. It's easily attached to the stroller, just a couple of clicks, but it's doesn't serve it's purpose. The tray clicks in to where you would normally click your infant seat in, but the way the tray is shaped it sits SOO far from the stroller that your kid can't even reach it. I wanted a tray so that my daughter could reach her snacks and cup ON HER OWN when in the stroller. Even in the fully upright position (no reclining) she can't reach it...and my daughter is in the 100th percentile so I imagine there's no other kids her age that can reach their things as well. Also, the cup holder is NOT deep enough to keep a sippy cup (or any cup) in place when maneuvering around the mall or wherever you take your stroller. A tiny bump and it'll go flying or tip over. I just don't see the point of making a tray for a stroller that the child is not able to get to and that doesn't hold their things put. My daughter can't even hold on to it likes she likes to do in her other stroller (with built in tray). When you collapse the B-agile with the tray attached it makes the stroller a lot bulkier, and you run the risk of breaking the tray off while stowing it if you're not careful because it juts out so far. I'd recommend you ditch the Britax tray and just buy an attachable cup/snack holder from another brand. BabiesRus sells several attachable cup holder-like things that work great. I also bought the Diono Buggy Buddy Organizer so I can store my cups/key/phone since the B-agile doesn't have a place for those things as well. Hold the kid's cup too! And it blends in well with the stroller (I have the black B-agile). Don't get me wrong, I love the stroller itself, but this silly tray is a waste of money!
