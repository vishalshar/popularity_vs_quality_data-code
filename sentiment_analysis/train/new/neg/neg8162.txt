- Holds 5-6 pocket diapers. Any more and you would be shoving them in.-Good traveling size, but not for your daily diaper pail. Get a bigger one for your pail. :-)-Super cute!-Thin, but it holds the smell in.- I like that it had a snap so I can hang it off of my changing table, but I am concerned if the handle will break or come unstitched. Only time will tell.Edited 6 months after purchase:-I ordered 2, 1 of them is now having trouble with wicking. I cannot put anything I have sprayed off in them.- They no longer hold the smell of #2 diapers in.-The handle has not broken off yet, but the stitching has begun to fray a bit.
