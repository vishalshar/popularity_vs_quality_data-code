This is a scam. The product advertised is NOT what you receive. The product advertised is an out of production Carter's rabbit -- what you get instead is a current model of this rabbit that looks very different and does not rattle. Also, this person/company simply buys the current model of this rabbit (for half the price you pay) from TOYS R US and has them ship it to you.The rabbit I received was new and cute but not what I wanted. I wanted this particular one to replace one my child lost. Then I had to pay to ship back their mistake. Customer Service was automated and extremely unhelpful.
