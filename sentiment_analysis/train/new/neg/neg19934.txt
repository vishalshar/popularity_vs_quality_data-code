Incredible... The box the item came in was perfect and so was the shipping box. However the items themselves are of poor quality.The tutus are not properly sown and are coming apart at the seams. Truthfully I am very dissapointed. Mud pie usually sells very good products. This is not one of them. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
