Unfortunately only bottle my son will take. The bottles are not made well and do not hold up well even to gentle hand washing only. The bottle silicone will stretch out of circle shape, making screwing on the nipple impossible and milk leaks everywhere. The bottles are very sensitive to mold and the seal between the silicon bottle and the harder plastic circle to screw on the nipples, isn't perfect. Milk gets in the nooks & crannies and can not be removed. I had these bottles replaced, a month later same happened again. Such a shame because they are a very unique shape and stand out.
