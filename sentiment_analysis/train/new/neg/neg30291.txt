I really hate that I have to give this particular bottle 3 stars! I had the playtex drop in that was just like the one pictured here and loved it! Baby boy loved it also. I sat it on top of the car one day and forgot it :( So I decided to order this one. BUYER BEWARE: the product received is NOT the one pictured. Still an excellent bottle but the one I received is an older version than the one pictured. My son is exclusively breastfed and takes a bottle of expressed milk during the day while I'm working. I feel like the nipple on this bottle may not be the best for breastfed babies but it is certainly better than some others we have tried. The bottle I received also didn't have the ability to bend which is a disappointment as the bend made feeding him easier and more natural. Sorry playtex, but you really should show a picture of the actual product and make it more clear for the buyer.
