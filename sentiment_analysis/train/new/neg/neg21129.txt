I really wanted to love it. It's an expensive thing and I was expecting it to be what Apple computers are in the computer world. I am disappointed by how hard it is to actually do it yourself: meaning putting the baby in and strap it all safely. I did watch the DIY and all that...still not getting much better. My mom has actually purchased a much cheaper version to use it when my son is with her...she does not want to use the ERGObaby...It is a good quality product and has all these good solutions for the baby safety and health but the "user experience" side gets a C from me.
