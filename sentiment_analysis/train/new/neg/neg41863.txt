Revised -- took them to a theme park. With the weight of the kids...these things do not work at all. The strollers do not stay in synch, every few feet the strollers run into each other. Eventually, the clips came apart. The other problem is the clips are not long enough so it keeps them apart enough that the inside front wheels won't run into each other when turning. we're going to hopefully be able to return them.Old ReviewIt works fine if the stroller pipes are bigger and the connectors, when closed, wrap around the stroller pipes tightly. but overall, solves the problem...
