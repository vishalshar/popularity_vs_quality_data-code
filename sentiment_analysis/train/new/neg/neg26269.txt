Do yourself a favor and stick with Gerber spoons or another brand. These are NOT dishwasher safe!!!! I have used them for only a couple months (have a ten month-old who didn't start solids until 5 months). After just a month or so of use, the spoon color started to fade and bleed and change to a brownish yellow stain on each one. They are awful. I won't use them anymore because I'm worried about what could be getting into my baby's food. I highly recommend you avoid this item.
