We returned this product.  I didn't like the fact that you could never really get all the water out of it which led me to believe that over time, mold would grow inside.  Also, the plate part and suction base are not one piece so my child was able to easily pull on it to remove it from the highchair tray and spill all the contents all over herself and the floor.  Not good in my book :-(
