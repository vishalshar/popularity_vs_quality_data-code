I happen to love these which is why I ordered the set of 3.  They are the best clip ever and I have had no issue with them until I placed this order.  I actually have the design in black flourish already which is why I decided to order this set.  When I got them they had pink all over it.  The label and the part that connects to the pacifier is hot pink.  Nowhere on the description of the set does it state that.  I was buying this design fro someone who is having twins (boy and girl) and figured that these would work well.  So disappointed.  If there is a change in the design the consumer should be made aware.
