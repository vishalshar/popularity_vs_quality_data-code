While I love Nuk pacifiers, and would normally rate this 5 stars, I received the wrong pattern. I received something completely different, dark pink, orange and green butterflies, which is actually pretty ugly in person. I would usually rate this for the seller and not the product, but this came directly from Amazon. Wasn't worth returning, so we kept them, and we'll use them for around the house.Now, to rate the Nuk pacifiers themselves...like I said they get 5 stars! We're on our 3rd child now, ages range from 14 years, 6 years, to 2 weeks and we have always ended up with Nuk. Each of our babies have just preferred them over any others we've tried! They don't seem to mess up your bite or teeth, since my 14 year old and 6 year old both have beautiful teeth. But that might just be good genes! =)
