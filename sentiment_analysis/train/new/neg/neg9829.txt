I recently purchased 2 of these to fit my twins (1 yr olds) convertible car seats.  I was really excited about these since we are going on our first plane ride with the kids and they seem to fit all carseats...or at least some of the reviews said they did.  Unfortunately these did not fit my Graco My Ride convertible carseats.  I tried putting them in all sorts of ways trying to get them to fit.  Luckily I still have my infant seats that the kidos can still (barely) fit in or I would have had to send them back and use garbage bags to keep them from getting beat up at the airport.  So I just want to warn anyone else with convertible seats or large carseats that they may not fit so check the dimensions before you purchase!
