I rarely write reviews but I felt this one was particularly worthy of a review (a bad one). We got this stroller because we were happy with the full size bassinet stroller we had prior from the same company. Only this one is complete junk in every way I can think of. It squeaks, doesn't roll well, doesn't fold well but worst of all (and possible resulting in the other problems) is that it simple couldn't support the weight of our 2 year old who is not particularly big. After about 6 months of light use, the metal support rods started bending and collapsing the stroller. In the open position it would get narrower and narrower until it became unusable.
