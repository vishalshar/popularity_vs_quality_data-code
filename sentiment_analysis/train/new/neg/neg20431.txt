These are  now just expensive ice trays!Filled these after my wife pumped, couldn't get the top on. Not wanting to spill milk while struggling to get the top on I grabbed the empty tray to try and figure out these tops - No dice. I followed the seal around making sure the lid groove fit into the tray lip, then get to the last corner and it wouldn't go on. I can see the groove past the lip of the tray. No to give up too soon, I attached all 4 corners in to the lid groove then worked my way down the side - again, no dice, sides bend up because lid too big. There is no two ways about it, the lids are too big for the tray.The directions say that the heat of the dishwasher may shrink the lids..... I hope. That will be the only way they fit.Don't waste the money or risk loosing any of that hard earned (pumped) milk.
