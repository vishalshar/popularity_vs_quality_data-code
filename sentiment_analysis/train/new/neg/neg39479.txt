Parent side went bad within the first two months of use.  If you pick it up off the charging base it shuts off automatically no matter how long it has been charging.  At first we did not realize it which is very dangerous!!!  I also tried using the feed timer option on occasion but it failed to go off half the time as well.  The only thing I am looking for in  a baby monitor is to hear the baby for safety and my own sanity.  This monitor goes the opposite way for both those things.  Do not buy this if you are actually looking to monitor your baby.
