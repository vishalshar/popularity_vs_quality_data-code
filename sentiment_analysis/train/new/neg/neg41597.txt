My wife and I bought this dresser to complete our nursery.  After assembling this thing for a couple hours I can tell you this is the biggest piece of **** I have ever spent my money on.  The surface of the wood was perfect color but after that it is all down hill.  When you start assembling this monstrosity they call a dresser you will find that some of the drawers come already splitting that makes it impossible to screw the track into.  After this I noticed that the pre-drilled holes don't even line up for all the tracks.  I definitely feel we would have been better off with a cardboard dresser.  The dresser did come with equipment to use for wall mounting.  I can easily say that I wont use it because Id bet anyone the cost of this dresser that it doesn't last longer than a month or two of use.  I don't write many reviews but I believe that people need to know the truth and I just wish someone would of wrote this before I spent my money.  I hope this helps you who are debating this of amount of sawdust they are labeling as a dresser.
