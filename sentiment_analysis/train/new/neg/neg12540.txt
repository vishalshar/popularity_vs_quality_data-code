This is a cute product that my son likes.  We like the music, lights (stars projected on the ceiling) and nature sounds (except for the heartbeat) but my only problem with this product is the timing.  It turns itself off after only 30 minutes.  I read that before I purchased and thought it would be fine but after using it I realized that 30 minutes is sometimes not long enough.  It occasionally it wakes my son up if he's not in a deep enough sleep when it turns off.
