We received this mobile off of our registry. It is cute and sturdy. However being first time parents we were unaware that it's unsafe to allow baby to ride in the car with the handle of the infant seat in the upright position. We registered for this thinking it would entertain our daughter in the car, however since it hooks onto the handle we can't use it in the car. We have used it all of 3 times when we had her in her travel system walking. She didn't care for it because she either wanted to see us or things around her. She is now 4 1/2 months old and we will never use this again. Truly a waste of money in our opinion.
