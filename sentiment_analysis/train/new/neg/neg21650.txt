Crib arrived quickly but there were several areas on damage on the crib. The crib was easy to put together and looks nice, but you can tell it is not great quality and that it will be scratched and dented easily. There is even a bug stuck to it, they clearly painted the bug onto the crib. I would return if I could but its already together and it's too much trouble to take apart and return.
