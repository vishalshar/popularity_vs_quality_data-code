Great cups that don't normally leak but this is my second set that has warped in the dishwasher. I put them in the top rack and they come out looking like these photos. After this happens they don't close properly and will leak. Before this happens they are the best cups, but it's a bummer that after a few washes this has happened to me with two sets and they aren't cheap.
