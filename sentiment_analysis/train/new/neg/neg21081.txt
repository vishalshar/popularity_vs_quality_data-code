It is super cute, but I could only use it for a month after birth.  It is not adjustable as baby grows and the area between the head and shoulders is too short.  I had to keep pulling it up before I put the baby in her car seat.  I did not use the neck pillow because it squished my newborns face and she appeared too scrunched.
