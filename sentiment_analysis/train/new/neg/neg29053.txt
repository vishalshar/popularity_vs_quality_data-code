Was really happy with this stroller at first, but it stopped working correctly after only a few days.  I believe something is wrong with the  shocks in the front wheels because it's no longer easy to steer.  I'm returning!!  Way to expensive for a stroller that doesn't steer right.  Other than that...i would have loved it.
