Labeled as 4 1/4 x 6 1/4 inches.  These are actually A6 size which is 4 3/4 x 6 1/2 inches.  We are in a rush to mail out invitations and now we get these overly large envelopes because product is mislabeled and falsely advertised.  These are not meant for 4x6 pictures and they will swim inside the envelopes.  I don't see how other reviewers can give even 3 stars for false advertising.  It is not the product you bought!!  Returning immediately.  Now the invitations are going out that much later.
