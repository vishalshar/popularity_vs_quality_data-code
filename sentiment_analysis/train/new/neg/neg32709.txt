Not at all pleased with this purchase.Sure it looks cute in theory but it's too small to work with a standard crib.Out of the box the print was cute but the material was overly wrinkly. I ran it through a warm wash and dry to get the "factory ickies" off. I also washed the coordinating crib sheet and didn't experience any shrinkage there so I know I didn't shrink it in the wash.Put in place over the base of the crib (under the mattress) It's overall at least 1-2" too small width wise and lengthwise to the point where there is a noticeable gap on one end at least (if you line it up to the other end.It was so blatantly terrible that I ended up cutting off the two ends and just kept the sides in hopes of making it less awkward. Nope.There's a noticeable 2 inches gap as well as it's super wrinkly and doesn't just hang right. The box pleat in the centre of the two sides hangs weird. Perhaps I should have pressed it and starched it but I had just spent 20 minutes manhandling it to get it into place.Out of principle, given that I've spent good money on this, I'll keep it and use it as is (especially since I already had to cut it) but I'm deeply unhappy about it and get angry just looking at the gap.See my photo: this is a standard size Ikea crib with a standard sized Safety 1st mattress.
