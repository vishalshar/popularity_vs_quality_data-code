I ordered these pacifiers 18-36 months and they are not the same size as the ones I have purchased many times from the store. They are much smaller. Everything about them is different. I feel like these are knock offs. The size on the box said 18-36 months. Very disappointed that I can't even get pacifiers without getting scammed
