I searched and read every review trying to get an idea of what i wanted and i'm so glad women post reviews it is very helpful. I was recommended by a friend to get this pump. Its been great for what i need it for. Mine did stop sucking but medella's customer service was so kind and sent me a new one no problem. To be honest i wish i would have just gotten an expensive nice one to last me a while. To use for future babies. This one is quite loud and it takes a little while to pump. The one thing i love about it is it takes batteries and it plugs in.
