Had this stroller for around a year now. Has been great. Just recently the front wheels began to squeak so I oiled the inside with some WD40. Fine. About 2 weeks later, the front wheels started to wobble or shudder quite a lot. I contacted customer service and they are fine with sending replacement parts - my issue is that they won't ship outside of the US.We live in Vancouver but bought the stroller through Amazon.com and collected it from a friend's place but they cannot seem to offer a solution through a Canadian authorized seller or distributor.Please beware if you live outside the country of purchase. The warranty info in the brochure states this but nothing is mentioned anywhere else that I could see, so by then it was too late.
