When we first received these cups I was thrilled.  They have Elmo, whom my son adores, and the click lock top is wonderful and keeps my son from spilling his drink everywhere which is what happens with most other sippy cups.  However, after only a few uses and a few cycles in the dishwasher these cups started to trap water in the insulation window. Additionally, because the water is trapped, the pictures of Elmo began to disintegrate and they are now gross looking and unusable.  I will still give 2 stars because the click lock lid is really a great feature and truly creates a spill proof cup.  If you decide to purchase these, just don't put them in the dishwasher!
