I'm not sure why the same product is listed three times, but here's my review on the other listing:My son is ten weeks old as of this writing. We received this activity gym as a shower gift and began using it sparingly when he was a couple of weeks old (he wasn't too interested in it yet). The good news is that in the last few weeks, it's come to be his favorite thing. It's just about the only thing that gives me any ability to put him down during the day and, say, eat a snack. But I suppose I should be using the past tense, because as of yesterday, the music on the star stopped playing. Same story as the others. A few days ago, the music got raspy. Then it stopped. I changed the batteries. The music started again then quit after half a day. Now, after numerous battery changes, it's a no go. My son has almost no interest in the mat now without the music. I've emailed Baby Einstein, so I'm hoping to get a replacement star that will hopefully hold for a few more weeks until I'll probably have to write them again. I suppose in the meantime, I will keep my eyes out for a more durable activity gym.Bottom line is, I'm glad it was a gift and we didn't blow fifty bucks on this. I like the activity gym concept, since obviously - when working - my baby is entertained and stimulated by it, but I'm going to be scouring reviews carefully to find one that works for more than a few weeks.
