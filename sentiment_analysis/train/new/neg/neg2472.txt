I do wish I had known these would shrink so much. I can barely squeeze the little guy (4-ish months old when I got them) into them with a Snappi!I read a lot of reviews before I bought these--some people saying they use them only for burp cloths and spills, others saying they make great diapers, are absorbent enough, etc. I have gotten pretty serious with the whole cloth diapering thing. My own mom was old school, she taught me how to fold a cloth diaper and put it on a baby when I was about 5. I've made cloth diapers out of receiving blankets and such before, but I thought prefolds would be easier. I am a little disappointed. I'll have to get new ones very soon, and these are a bt thin compared to the flannel ones I've been using (and compared to a folded receiving blanket). I usually have to double them, or double them with a washcloth in the middle for absorbency. The nice thing about birdseye is that it washes up well, has a little bit of stretch, and works great with Snappis. If I'd gotten them when my baby was smaller I probably would have found them more practical.
