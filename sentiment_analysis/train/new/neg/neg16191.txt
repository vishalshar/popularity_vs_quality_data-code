We Bought this stroller on January 29, 2016 for our twins.  It's February 27, 2016.  We live on a military installation and like to walk to the post exchange or just around the normal every day stores.  When we received the stroller we realized this was not a stroller that could be taken off the sidewalk, so knowing that we have been very careful on where we take it.  During our normal walk around the neighborhood,  we hit one of the cracks in the sidewalk and the front right wheel completely snapped off. Very disappointed in the quality of this product. Worked great up until this unfortunate event happened.
