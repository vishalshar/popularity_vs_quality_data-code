After only a few uses, the inside is burnt and a brown looking color. I've tried cleaning it, but the brown never completely goes away and the burnt crud just builds up in only 1 day again. The amount of water recommended to heat the milk did not work for me. The milk was always still ice cold after it was done. It took a lot of experimenting to figure out how much water I needed to add to get varied amounts of milk warm. Milk storage bags and drop-ins heat very quickly (yay!), while Medela bottles and Avent bottles take longer (boo!).  We have been using this bottle warmer for 5 months now and it seems to taking longer and longer (almost 5 minutes) for bottles to warm. 5 minutes is a long time to wait when you have a screaming/crying baby.  I have it 3 stars because it does get milk warm in 5 minutes and under like advertised, but I feel like there could be a better product out there. I am currently looking for a replacement. Hopefully spending more money will yield a more efficient product.
