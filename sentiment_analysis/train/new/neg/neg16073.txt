I am very disappointed with this highchair. I love the Peg Perego brand and I love their strollers but I HATE this high chair. These are new colors so I couldn't find any other reviews on it but I had to share.The bad points: The chair is extremely hard to clean. You almost need to scrub it with a toothbrush daily. The cover is hard to get on and off too. There are so many cracks and crannies for crumbs and sticky stuff to hide. I take mine outside once a week and hose it off. The tray is WAY too high. My daughter is now 19 months old and it is still too high.When she was a baby it was near her chin. It also doesn't push in close enough making even more of a mess. You will use a highchair for almost 2 years and this one doesn't work for babies or toddlers.The good points: I love that is has the piece between her legs so she can't fall through. That's it.If I could do it all over again, being older and wiser!, I would buy a wooden highchair with the tray that goes up and over and stays behind it. You could put a towel down or cushion and clean it regulary. My friend has one and it's the best. No little cracks for food to hide. Easy to clean.Don't waste your money on this expensive chair. They have to keep coming out with different colors so people will keep buying them. Get a wooden one and get a cool pad for it!
