North States Superyard Colorplay Ultimate PlayardPlease be careful!! Last night our baby daughter ate a clinch from the landyard that comes with the playard for its transportation. It had to to be manufactured defectively because our daughter is only eight months old and she has not any teeth. The rivet was loose and came apart.Thanks lord the rivet stayed glued to her palate and we found it after noticing that the pacifier made her to have heaves. In our case we were lucky but if something would happen to our baby...There is not any warning stating that this piece should be kept off children. And definitely those rivets don't comply with the Quality Assurance standards to be placed along children gear.
