We were looking for an audio monitor since our son is going to be across the hall from us. We were not looking for anything fancy with bells and whistles. This monitor is a continuous audio monitor. Not something we were looking for in a monitor with our son to be across a hall way.The monitor picks up EVERYTHING in the room and outside of it too. We could hear ourselves faintly through the monitor when we were talking in our room.The downside to this is that it was so sensitive it was picking up things we didn't need to hear. As well, it is continously on. The low hiss would not allow me to sleep and it cannot be akin to white noise.We tried turning down the volume but the audio hiss (which comes with any monitor) was faintly there but it was then hard to hear anything in the room.If you are looking for a super sensitive, continuous monitor then this is the best bang for your buck! Yet, if you are looking for something that will only activate when the baby cries or is moving in the room then this is not for you. Due to this we returned the monitor.
