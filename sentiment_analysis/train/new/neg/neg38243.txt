After reading reviews I decided to buy this elephant to help my son fall asleep in his crib alone. We have only had it for a very short time and ee both already dislike it. The green/blue colors are great but the amber/red color is very dull and makes the room quite dark. The melodies are not anything most people would fall asleep too. I bought this product over the cloud b turtle because this one has a light show where it switches between the colors but the whole time mine clicked like and old wined up timer. I would spend the couple extra dollars and gdt the cloud b twilight turtle. Much better product.
