I purchased this nursing cover because of the rave reviews. There is nothing terribly wrong with it but I wasn't impressed either. It seems stiff even after washing it and there are loose threads around the seams. I like that it comes with a little carrying case but mine looks cheap. The zipper on the case is sewn unevenly it looks like something I would have tried to make myself.
