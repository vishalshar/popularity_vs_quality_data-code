I'm on the fence about this because I cannot express how much I LOVE my LILLEbaby carrier! After owning both a Baby Bjorn and an ERGO sport and being disappointed to loose fitting straps and supports, the LILLEbaby was an answer to prayers! It's comfortable for petite frames (5'2", 125 lbs), has lumbar support, straps are easy to access alone, and baby boy LOVES it. However, I had to return my first one after a support (shoulder blade support strap) unraveled after just having it one day. I suspected this is just a fluke so I returned it to Amazon and requested a replacement ASAP. Now I'm on my second carrier and after using it for a couple months, the same thing happened again; same strap...same location. This is definitely a manufacturing issue and I'm now at a cross-roads trying to figure out if they're worth another "go."
