I own the Sony NTM-910 and this model.  I much prefer the Sony, since it comes with rechargeable batteries in the receivers which automatically recharge, whereas the Graco won't even recharge batteries if you buy them yourself.  Also, the Sony is voice-activated, which means it is completely silent until the baby makes noise, even when turned all the way up.  The Graco on the otherhand, you have to turn almost all the way down to avoid a constant hum, which will make you an insomniac in no time quick if you turned it up.  I just assumed all monitors had this feature, and am sorely missing it on this one.  The Sony NTM-910 comes in a dual receiver model, which I would recommend over this.  I almost bought it but due the (...) price difference I opted for this model.  However, the (...) will quickly be eaten up in battery costs, so no real advantage there.
