I ordered this for my 11 month old for Christmas. It was a month from the time I ordered it until we actually opened it and tried to get it to work. The lights worked and the fishes move but the sound(s) don't work at all. I tried to contact the seller but its been over a week and still have not gotten a reply if they are willing to exchange. I'm sure my daughter would love it if it actually worked. I may try to buy from another retailer.
