can't really mess up a spoon and fork...but this review is for the packaging. do you seriously need to have plastic zip ties fastened to the utensils?? almost cut myself trying to cut them off.the utensils don't sit securely in the case it comes in...the picture shows a cardboard insert that is disposed upon opening
