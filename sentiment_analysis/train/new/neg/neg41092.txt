Looks good, frame is structurally sound, but platform where BABY lies for diaper changing is super cheap and flimsy. My table has a platform that's too narrow and doesn't reach across to be able to fit into the long support bars properly :(. Major safety concern since the baby can easily fall through the top (since there's no support structure under platform). See pictures. Also there are no holes for safety strap to attach- gotta drill your own holes.
