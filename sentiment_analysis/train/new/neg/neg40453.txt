The plastic used to construct the mixing mechanism broke the first time I used it.  Also, the assembly/disassembly is about as clear as mud.  I wrote to Dr. Brown's on their website in hope that they will somehow redeem themselves, since I have been a loyal user of their bottles...  Ah well.  In the meantime I will continue mixing formula in this busted pitcher with my Cuisinart immersion blender.  **AMMENDMENT**  I contacted "Handi-Craft", the company that manufactures the Dr. Brown products.  They quickly sent me a replacement stem, no hassle.  Very pleased with their customer service so I bumped up the rating one star.
