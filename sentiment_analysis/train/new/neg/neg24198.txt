My husband ordered these for me.PROS:EASY TO CLEANEASY TO FILL (I just use my breastpump shield as a funnel)REUASBLECONS:HARD TO SQUEEZECAN'T GET ALL THE FOOD OUT18 month old can't use this by himself, but he can use the regular squeeze packsThese are good and I understand that they can't collapse as well as the regular squeeze packs since they are reusable, but I do wish that they did collapse a little more so it is easier for toddlers to use by themselves without making a mess.
