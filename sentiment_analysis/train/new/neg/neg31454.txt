This seat is good for short trips. My daughter loves the colors on this seat, but complains about a sore rear end after about half an hour due to a lack of seat padding. She also has a hard time sleeping on trips due to the upright positioning of the seat- her head bobs forward and she gets a stiff neck. Since the seat needs to be flush against the back of the actual car seat, it's not adjustable for comfort. It's kind of a pain to move between cars too- the seat back releases very easily from the base and we keep dropping the base. It just feels flimsy. The stationary armrests make it difficult to buckle the seat belt and adjust it. It'd be great if they flipped up out of the way.
