We ordered this seat for our 5 month old son to use at his caregiver's house. It looked roomy and entertaining. However, when we assembled it and put him in there, he was able to yank out the toy bar with one yank. Every time I'd replace it and try to put it in tighter, he could still pull it out, sometimes knocking the toys in his face.  Our dog was even able to knock it out by just nudging the bar with her nose. Overall, it just didn't seem safe and didn't hold his attention for long. Plus it's overpriced. I much prefer his initial (and much cheaper) seat, the Fisher Price Infant to Toddler Rocker (you can hang other toys and links off the bar and it stays put).
