I bought this while looking for something quick and easy to use at the office that doesn't require me to be near an outlet. The big selling point for me was the portable carrying case that I could place in the office fridge during the day.The suction works very well and in my opinion simulates the suckling of the newborn. I had to remove the cushioned liner that comes on the funnel part of the pump so that I could fit comfortable into the pump. No biggie, quick fix.As I pumped I noticed that there is a significant amount of milk that gets trapped halfway down to reaching the bottle. It never quite makes it to the bottle and to get it out you have to disassemble the entire pump and pour your milk out of each working piece of the pump. That's time consuming and seems like it could be avoided. Also, as you finish pumping and pull the pump away from your chest there is milk that spills out onto you if you don't have the pump tilted back perfectly or have your down on the handle to allow this extra milk to spill back down rather than roll forward.If you've ever pumped for breast milk then you know how much time and effort goes into collecting a few ounces so in this case it's easy and understandable to cry over spilt milk. I'll use it for emergency only when I'm away from baby and in pain from the engorgement.
