This is just the right size for our 6mos old son. I originally got this bowl and spoon set for our son to take to daycare. I thought it would be great because everything is all together and won't get lost. However, on his first day when I took this bowl out of the bag to put into the fridge his daycare worker exclaimed "Oh I hate those!" when she saw the bowl.The main problem with the bowl is that the lid is hard to get on and off. It also leaks if it happens to fall on its side. The spoon is great though. It's soft and it changes color if the food is to warm.We'll keep on using it for the time being, however I'm looking for a new one.
