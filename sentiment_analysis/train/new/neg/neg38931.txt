I bought these for my daughter eight months ago.Pros:The chimes sound gentle and cheerful and machine washing/drying did not change the soundThey are cute and liquid messes wipe off easilyThe velcro loops are convenient and hold easilyCon:Lint sticks to them, especially the duck. It is nearly impossible to pick off, but comes off in baby's mouth. We have nicknamed them "Yucky Duck" and "Yucky Frog" because she wants nothing to do with them (she initially loved the sound, but they left a bad taste in her mouth).Recommended if baby loves jingling noises and you only expect to strap it to the car seat for them to bat at (which was what my son loved to do).
