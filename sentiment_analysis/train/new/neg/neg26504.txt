I was searching for a bedrail for a toddler bed, and this is one of the items that came up. Upon reading a few of the reviews, I saw that it could easily be used for just that purpose. Unfortunately, when I received it, it states right on the box that it should not, under any circumstances, be used on a toddler bed because it requires 9" of space between the siderail and the bedrail for the child to get out and not accidentally get lodged inbetween the two. If that had been included in the description here, I would not have purchased it. You also need to have both a box spring and mattress in order to use this bedrail (we do not), so it can't be used on platform beds either.
