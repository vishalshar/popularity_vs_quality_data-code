I love OXO and this product design, but the cup needs improvement. The very top of the clear plastic cup (where it screws onto the lid) is not only a pain to clean but also very, very thin and breaks only after a couple of weeks usage. I had two of them broke within past 3 months in exactly the same fashion-- the top edge starts splitting along the thread, causing leakage, small bits of plastic in the drink, and ultimately a failure to screw onto the lid. Otherwise the design is awesome.
