I got one of these for my daughter and loved it so much I bought another!  The first one was perfect...fuzzy outside, soft satin feeling on the inside and the vent concept at the bottom would put my new-mom worries at rest ("is she too hot/cold?").  The second one I got though had all that but with a faulty zipper.  We're talking almost impossible to latch/zip and when you do get it be careful trying to unzip it and not punch your baby in the face!  The first one's zipper worked just fine though.  I'd say buy it, but check the zipper and exchange it if you get a bad one.  Alternatively you could directly contact the manufacturer...I didn't with this product but on others they've been very helpful with wonderful customer service.
