The cup is very cute and the idea is a good one but.....  my granddaughter is 14 months and when she puts her chubby little hand in the top and pulls out a hand full of snacks, Cherrios or Puffs, they go flying all over the place. Hoping as she gets a little older, she'll have a little better hand control and the cup will serve its purpose.
