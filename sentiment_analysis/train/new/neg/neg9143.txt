We were visiting family on the east coast and ordered this to be delivered to a family members house. We travelled around staying with varying family members over 3 weeks.We own a Graco pack and play at home.This was slightly smaller length wise and height wise, which meant when it was folded up it took up a lot less room in the car, than the Graco.It was a little easier to put up and down compared to the Graco.But this was overall a lot flimsier than the Graco. The foot pegs and wheels were much cheaper and flimsier, and I worried about it scratching wood floors when moving it around.The base mattress was a little smaller than the size of the play yard so it slipped around slightly.I would say if you are using it for traveling and you are not going to use it too much then this would work well enough. But if you are using in your home as a crib or a play cage for your baby/toddler do not buy this. The Graco is sturdier and safer for your child. The taller height means your toddler is less likely to try and climb out, and the mattress part does not slide around and is safer for play and sleep. They also sell varying kinds at varying prices depending on your needs.I do not have any other experience with other brands of play yards/ pack n plays, so can not make other comparisons between Graco and other brands.
