This stroller has broken on more than five occasions within the first 3 months of use. It has been such a headache to figure out replacement parts with the third party seller and the manufacturer, and has caused me so much unnecessary stress on top of having to deal with a newborn baby! I can't count how many hours I've spent on the phone with customer service (Amazon, third party seller AND manufacturer) trying to get reimbursement and replacement parts. Very critical items have broken too that have endangered my baby: the frame wouldn't collapse, the safety harness wouldn't close shut, the snaps on the safety harness slip out, the recline got jammed, and a wheel is loose that I still don't know how to fix. This is the one purchase with my baby that I need to rely on the most and I 100% regret purchasing it.
