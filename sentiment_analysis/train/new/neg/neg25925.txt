From the description the Aria OH sounded like the perfect stroller for us & I thought Peg Perego were a quality make, however we are very disappointed.Pros;Nice colour scheme.Very lightweight.Will accept other manufacturers infant car seats.Child snack tray.Good coverage from the hood although only with the seat upright.Suspension on wheels.Cons;The Aria OH is supposed to fold with one hand, I need to use both hands & some 'jiggling' to get it to fold.It is compatible with many infant car seats however the cup holder on the childs tray makes our Graco Snugride sit at an angle & our baby is always flopping to one side.The cupholder & various trim pieces fell off & the handle plastic is coming apart after less than a month.The basket is a great size but very difficult to access with the seat upright & almost impossible to access with the seat reclined.Despite its light weight it is not very manoeuvrable.The seat is not well padded for baby's bottom.The 'floating' harness is a great concept but impractical in reality.Conclusion;Description sounds perfect but this stroller is not worth the sum of it's parts. Wish we'd bought a Maclaren!
