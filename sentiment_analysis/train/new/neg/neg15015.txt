I bought this for my nursery, and I'm not that thrilled with it. The wood sides are very discolored and look used. The fabric on the hamper is very thin. I can deal with the fabric being super thin, but the wood sides are very unattractive. For $40 I could have found something much nicer. I'm really disappointed. I plan on putting it in a corner where it's not very visible.
