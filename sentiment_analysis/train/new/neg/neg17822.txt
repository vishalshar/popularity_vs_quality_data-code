I have bought and instaleed many a toilet seat in my time.  And each time it is a five minute task due to the fact that any seat you buy in the U.S. is standard in regards to the size and placement of the mounting holes.  this is not the case with the Trendy Kid seat.  Apparently they tried to make a one size fits all for the international market.  To try and accomodate non-standard toilet rims they manufactured this flimsy system where the bolt receptacles on the seat swivel to fit any size hole spacing.  So when I finally got them lined up for my standard Home Depot toliet it pushed the sit past the toilet rim.  Now I have this overhang of seat over the front.  Furthermore they use a very small diameter bolt.  Toilets take a lot of torque during their lifetimes. It needs a stronger bolt. And they also use a cheap metal wingnut with a flat head.  Most toilets are porcelain.  This is why almost all modern toilets come with a synthetic plastic wingnut so as not to scrath up the porcelain.  The wingnut is also usually convex so as to screw snugly into the porcelain hole when tightened.  Lastly the seat will not stay in the up position even though mine is pushed more forward than a usual seat would.  The seat top is too thick because of the nestled kids potty seat.  Therefore it bumps up against the toilet tank top before it can reach a 90-degree angle.  Lastly, the latch that keeps the kiddie seat tucked inside the adult seat is a plastic tab that is very difficult if not impossible for a child to turn and unlock their little seat.  It is a pain in the thumb for me to undo it.This item was an all-around loser for us.  We are back to the potty seat that is simply placed on top of the existing seat.  At least it is cushioned where the Trendy seat is hard wood.
