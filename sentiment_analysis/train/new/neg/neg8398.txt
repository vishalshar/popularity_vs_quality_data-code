I bought this to use with my 2 1/2 year-old son. He normally gets up between 5:30 & 6am everyday. As a woman who slept until 9am or 10am on the weekends before his arrival, Momma wanted her sleep back. When the clock arrived he was SO EXCITED and wanted to open it immediately. We got the batteries in & I noticed that the nightlight didn't work. I wrote it off thinking maybe it didn't work until the alarm was turned on. So, at bedtime I set it up and told him the whole story about Momo going to sleep. I hit the alarm on/off button and...nothing. The eyes didn't close. He asked me what was wrong. I tried again. Nothing. So, now I was frustrated & went into the kitchen to get the directions. Was I missing something, some step? I even took the batteries out & did it all again. Again, the freakin' eyes didn't close. So, as it was now 20 minutes past his bedtime I told him the monkey was broken & it was time to go to sleep. Now I'm just p.o'ed. I set the alarm for 9:10 at 9pm. It's 9:30 & no jungle noises, no eyes, nothing. Just a ticked off mom.UPDATE!!! After taking the batteries out 2 more times and putting them back in I got it to work.  Now we will see how it actually works.  I'll report back soon.
