I don't recall if this item said it was new or used.  I have NEVER bought anything used so I doubt that I did this time and I don't remember the Amazon advertising of this product reading 'used'.  Much to my surprise, when I got the calendar, it was USED.  It had Scotch tape holding it together, almost like it had been re-gifted a few times before I got it from Amazon.  Because this was going to be a baby shower gift, I was very disappointed.  The calendar was nice but I could not get over the fact it was USED and/or re-gifted many times before I rec'd it.  I don't feel like I can give a new Mom a used calendar.  It reminded me of giving a used book that came from the library to the new Mother.  Nobody ever knows where a library book has been and the same for this used calender.  It was kind of creepy and a waste of money.
