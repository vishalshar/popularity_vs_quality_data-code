I spent big money on this pump. It stopped working after a month and the customer service was horrible...They basically treated me as if I was stupid...Asking me how I was turning it on and how I was using it?!  I told them I needed it replaced and they stopped responding to me! I've heard nothing since and have had to spend even more money to replace it!
