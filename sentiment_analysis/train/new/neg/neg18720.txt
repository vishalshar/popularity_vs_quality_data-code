After doing tons of searching for the prefect pacifiers I settled on the Ecopiggy. I loved the look of the pacifier and the natural rubber material. However, my little one did not like the shape of the nipple and never used it once. This pacifier must be boiled to clean, and our pacifier that we received had a very strong odor.
