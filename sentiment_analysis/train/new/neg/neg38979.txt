I purchased Danielle's Daisies Fabric Memory/Memo Photo Bulletin Board by Sweet Jojo Designs for my daughter's room so she could display her favorite photos.  Her room is purple so I went with this one to match her decor.  I was very happy with the quality of this product as a whole, but it is so small for the price I paid.  I personally have never seen a photo bulletin board this small.  I actually have a similar quality photo bulletin board that is much larger and was only half the price.  I would really like to know what size photo is supposed to be photoshopped onto the stock picture of this photo bulletin board.  The photo is somewhat deceiving in my opinion.  Enough whining, it is very well made and the color is very pretty.  Maybe these are available in a larger size that I'm not aware of.  I would love to know if so.
