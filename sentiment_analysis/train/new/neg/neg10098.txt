I purchased this mattress back in 2014 for my infant son.  I was happy with it then.  Its light weight for easy removal, waterproof, and easy to clean.  Fast forward, my son is now 2.5 years old, and the mattress is shot.  Completely sunk in the center, no matter which side I flip it to.  Its not like my son jumps on the bed or anything that would damage the mattress or cause this to happen.  Very disappointing that now I have to buy another one.  I was even more annoyed when I went back to find this order and write a review, and saw that I actually spent $170 on this thing, only to have to give it to the dog two years later.  Don't waste your money.
