This seemed great at first-- I even bought a second set because I could just slip it over the hinge and the door would stay open. But if you don't remember that it's there, and you try to close the door-- not even slamming it that hard, the guard is strong and rubbery enough that we wound up pulling the hinge screws out of the wall and door, ruining the door and the door jamb.Also, the wedge is narrow and rubbery enough that the door still swings quite a bit. So yes, it prevents the baby from getting his fingers caught in the hinge or getting slammed shut, but it doesn't lock the door open.We wound up just tying a looped rope to the door knob from inside the room to keep the door open.
