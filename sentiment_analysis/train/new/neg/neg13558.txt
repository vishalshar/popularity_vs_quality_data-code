Since my little one recently dropped and broke the matching plate on our tile floor, I thought that her breaking of one of these cups was no longer a coincidence.  After breaking one of the cups after having it for about a month (at a year of age), I had put the other away until she was older.  She just loved whooshing the cup filled with whatever up and down showering herself anyway.  It was quite entertaining, but really, she wasn't ready for this cup yet at a year and now 18 months when she broke the plate by tossing it during her daily cupboard emptying routine.  For an older toddler, this cup would be awesome.  The top pops off to a nicely smooth rim and a good portion size for little kiddos.  3 stars for the awesome style, vibrant colors, and overall construction.  Had to take 2 away due to the breakability.  I still have a few other SugarBooger plates and cups (now hidden).  I will pull them out when she learns about "breaking things".
