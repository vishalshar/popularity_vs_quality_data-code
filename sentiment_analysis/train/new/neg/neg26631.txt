I was so excited to receive a Baby Bjorn for a shower gift. Especially being a Swede myself. Anyhow, when our Baby came in November we used it a few times.. but b/c it was the winter and we were never really out and about .. we didn't use it as often as I thought I would. Sam also was 9lbs at birth. So it wasn't long before he was to heavy to carry. Maybe if he had been born in the spring or summer I would have gotten more use out of it. But now at 6 1/2 months he is 22lbs and way to heavy for me to carry in front. We prefer to carry him in a backpack.I have no doubt that the Baby Bjorn is great.. just remember to take in consideration the month you give birth and the size of your baby. Hopefully with the next one I will use it more often.
