I did a lot of research to find an organizer for my Peg Perego Stroller. As a universal organizer, this fits well across my stroller's handles. However, after having it for only a couple of weeks, the velcro connector that closes the mesh bag part is already half off and the mesh bag itself has a large rip in it. I have only used it it put a water bottle, a few small baby toys and my wallet into...nothing sharp or too heavy. In addition to these issues, the "cup holders" are tiny and barely fit a skinny Playtex bottle.Of course I  threw out the packaging right after I bought it so I won't be able to return it - but if I can prevent someone from making the same mistake in ordering it, then I'll feel better. Great idea for a product, but terribly made. Very disappointed I wasted the money on this.
