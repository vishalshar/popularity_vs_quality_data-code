I had high hopes for this bottle but was extremely disappointed after purchasing it. Although my son will take this bottle over any other, it leaked everywhere...leaking out the very little breastmilk I had stashed to offer him. I was on my way to see Bob Dylan perform and had to come back, missing the show. So it goes without saying just how unsatisfied I am.
