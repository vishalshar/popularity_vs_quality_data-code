It works great for us. No water in the eyes and face. Our toddler loves it and wants to wear it all the time. When you put it on make sure there are no gaps.Update:This is the second time we ordered this baby shower cap. The first cap we received was quite sturdy. By that I mean it kept its shape. It also had a push button to adjust the size accordingly. This time, the shower cap we received is super flimsy. It has no button so there is no way to adjust its size.
