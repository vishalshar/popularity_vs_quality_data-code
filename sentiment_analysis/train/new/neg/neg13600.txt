I guess these are kind of a gimmick anyway, right?  I mean, they keep the peepee from hosing down the wall, ceiling, and mommy, but it's not like the teepee is absorbent or anything, so the end result is a baby drenched in his pee.  And instead of washing the teepee, you may as well just throw it away.  Once washed, they're itty-bitty tiny, have no shape, and they're just garbage at that point.You're much better off laying a cloth diaper liner over your little boy's "peepee" than using a teepee.  The cloth diaper liner is washable, absorbent, much cheaper!  It might not be as funny, but it's going to do the job better and for less money!
