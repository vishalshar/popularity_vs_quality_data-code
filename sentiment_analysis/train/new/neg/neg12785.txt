I wish I liked these diapers more. I bought them as alternatives to a more expensive brand that I love, but I wish I had just spent the extra money. They are very bulky and I find that instead of soaking the liner into the back of the diaper, more often it soaks through the front and my daughters clothes get damp, I wouldn't even attempt to use these at night.
