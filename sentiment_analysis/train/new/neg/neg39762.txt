I give this product a 1 star rating is because the water resistant Boppy pillow protector I thought would be, water resistant. My lovely little girl leaks milk or spills it as she feeds and it soaked through the 'water resistant cover' when I took it off to clean it I expected the pillow to be dry but it was soaked as if I didn't even have it on. Really disappointed in this ' water resistant' Boppy cover.
