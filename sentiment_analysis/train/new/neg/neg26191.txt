I purchased a North States Industries Superyard 3 in 1 Wood Gate in April of 2015. Today, when I lifted one of the panels slightly, all the wooden poles came out from their respective holes (see pictures)...clearly not very safe for my baby who pulls up on everything. :(Needless to say, I am very disappointed with the purchase... On the bright side, it did look nice for the 2 months I had it where it was functional. Hoping the company can remedy the situation!
