I ordered this for a Christmas gift for a friend.  She just called to inform me that she opened it. While washing it a spider came out of it!! It has been in factory packaging since I received it and has also been in wrapping paper until today. I could not get a direct link from this order to write the company, but I hope this does not happen to others. My family has several Sofia's and loves them.
