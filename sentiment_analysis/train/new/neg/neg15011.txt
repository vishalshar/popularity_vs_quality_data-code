The only good thing about this dispenser is the single use dispenser/bottle. The other 3 compartment dispenser spills powder into neighboring compartments while being poured. Even though I was putting only 1 scoop of formula in each compartment, when I would pour the formula into my baby's bottle, some of the neighboring compartment's formula would also pour in, or vice versa. Need to find another dispenser. The single serve dispenser is awesome for nighttime feedings though. Fill it up and keep it on the bedside, and viola - you are set!
