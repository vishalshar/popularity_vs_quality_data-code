I like fuzzibunz sized so I though these would be great but they aren't the new elite diapers first off. They are the old style elastic no numbers on elastic and didn't come with any replacement elastic, but that didn't matter much to us. I liked the idea of being able to size the diaper down to my newborns size however it has been difficult to get the right fit compared to the diapers with the snap adjustments,. I have found these leak more on my 9lb one month old because I cant get the legs to fit right with out leaving red marks on his legs. They work and the diaper its self works nice on an older child but I haven't used these much because they are harder to get the right fit.
