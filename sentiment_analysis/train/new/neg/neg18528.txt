It's 4am, 30 degrees outside and I'm up with every window in my house open to air out the melted plastic smell from this little death trap. This little bundle of joy apparently turned itself on and kept heating up until it reduced the tray inside (with all the bottles on it) to a pile of melted plastic. Thankfully our new little ones like to eat every few hours so we noticed it at 3am in the morning, as opposed to say 7 or 8am when it likely would have turned all of it's contents into a molten mess of plastic. Not only will I be demanding my money back for this and the bottles it destroyed, I'll also be reporting this product to whatever organization (UL maybe?) said it's safe to be in my home.
