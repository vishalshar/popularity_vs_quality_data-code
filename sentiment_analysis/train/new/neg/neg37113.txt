While this is nice and thick, it is very big. Also, when you are trying to get into position quickly to feed a screaming baby, the last thing you want to do is make sure you grab the thicker end and place it under the boob you are nursing with.Not very fool-proof with the lack of sleep and forgetting you are putting one boob on double duty. Oh, and try flipping this behemoth while holding a flailing newborn.Lastly, baby does tend to sink between your belly and pillow.. And mine has rolled off once. For reference, 5' 4" and 120lbs postpartum.
