It's a cute toy but it's way too big and long to hang on an infant car seat as intended as it hits my daughter in the face (she's 3 months old).  Also, the mirror on it reflects light onto her which she doesn't like.  Other than that it seems sturdy but she doesn't have grasping skills yet to play with it.
