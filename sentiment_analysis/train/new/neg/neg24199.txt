We liked the plastic version ThinkBaby as a transition sippy for our son, but never felt right about using plastic. When I saw they made a stainless steel version I was so excited! However like other reviews state, it leaks :( I have found that it does not leak if you don't use the handles from the conversion kit. Unfortunately cold milk/water in stainless steel means cold hands! We are going to keep it and use it without handles, but disappointed that they pair it with the conversion kit and it doesn't work! I have not tried contacting the company directly but will do so and see where I get. Will update if anything positive.
