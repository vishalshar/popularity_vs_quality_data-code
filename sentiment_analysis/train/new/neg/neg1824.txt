Unfortunately, this dispenser is almost useless for us.  Our son takes heart medicine 4 times a day.  But, since he is a newborn, the quantities are very small.  It is very important for us that he takes every ml prescribed, but with the design of these dispensers, much of the medicine gets caught by the lid and doesn't make it into the nipple - despite our best efforts to wiggle it and shake it down.  We have found that there is a different brand of pacifier, medicine dispenser that does not have this problem and has made our lives much easier.  This one, however, does not help.  It might work okay if someone has an older child, or if the medicine quantities were larger such that several mls lost would not be a problem.
