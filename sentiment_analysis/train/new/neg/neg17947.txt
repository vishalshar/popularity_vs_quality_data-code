Boy, was I terribly disappointed when these valances arrived.  The design of the fabric is adorable & the colors are vibrant, but this is just a hemmed piece of bedsheet.  The valance isn't lined, so the sunlight will come right through the fabric - it might as well be a sheer.  For the quality, these valances are SEVERELY overpriced.  I can buy a piece of cotton fabric from a craft store for a couple of dollars & run a hem across the top & bottom and have the same effect.  If these weren't the exact colors & design I was looking for, I'd return them.  Instead, I'm adding a liner to them, even though I already blew sixty-six dollars on the pair.
