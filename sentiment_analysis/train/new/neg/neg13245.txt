I received these blankets today and I have mixed feelings about them... The blankets are very soft, thin but cozy, very soft colors (what I was looking for so if you are expecting something bolder-these are not it),but they are small...not 40x40 as advertized-I'd say more like 26x30. I think they will be good for a new born but not for swaddling....I'm keeping them because I have found other uses for them after my baby reaches month and a half...I'd say they were an okay buy...but if you are looking for thicker, bigger ones these are not for you.
