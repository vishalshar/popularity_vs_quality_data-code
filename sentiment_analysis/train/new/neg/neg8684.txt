I ordered 2 packs of 8 (16) and what I received aren't genuine Sassy diaper pins. They arrived loose in an envelope. They all aren't the same length, some are a bit bent out of shape, the plastic heads have a pointy piece attached, and the curled part isn't tight and fabric gets caught in it.One of my pics shows t-shirt fabric doubled and it still slid under the curled part.
