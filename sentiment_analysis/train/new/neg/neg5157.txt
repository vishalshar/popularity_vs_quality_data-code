Please make sure you have the 9oz bottle before buying this.  I was careless by not reading the detail on the description and trusted the Frequent Purchased with link.  My little one has the blue and yellow cups therefore I assumed this replacement will fit those bottles.  I am so sorry.  These are for the shorter bottle.  And the will be an inch shorter if paired with the suggested sip straw cups.I'm sure this straws works well as the original that came with the cups.
