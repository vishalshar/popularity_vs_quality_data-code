We had the red and black version of this for our older daughter so I bought the pink so my girls wouldn't confuse them.  It started off ok.  But now it will not hold a constant light.  It flashes on and off over and over again which I find to be annoying-  not soothing. I usually don't even use it anymore.  I was really disappointed.
