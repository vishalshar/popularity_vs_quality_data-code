I really liked this at first but after a couple times in the dryer on low (recommended on the package), it was ruined. The backing welds together in the dryer (I'm guess from the heat), and won't come apart for anything. Therefore it won't lay flat, making it useless.I ordered another one and air dry it instead. That works, but I wish I didn't have to waste money on the first one to figure it out.
