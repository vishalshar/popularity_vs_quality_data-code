I purchased this boppy cover in a pinch on Amazon when looking for an inexpensive, but cute printed cover. It is plush and soft, but doesn't necessarily wear very well under repeated washings. This seems are getting a bit worn but I think we'll still be able to get quite a bit of use out of it. I do love the fun black and white polka dot print.
