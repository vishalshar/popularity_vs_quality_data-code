i ordered this set of bottles because they're so easy to use and my son took to them immediately. they were more user friendly for him that the slim and long 8oz bottles from dr brown we were using until he was about 7months old. I also love not having to deal with so many parts, and it's very easy to assemble. Unlike the dr brown bottles, the caps on these bottles actually did not leak when the bottle fell or my diaper bag tipped over in the car. i had drowned my diaper bag a few times because of not a tight sealing cap and it's very inconvenient to clean as well as unsanitary. unfortunately i did not give this product 5 stars because one of the nipples did not have a hole in it so my son's formula cannot get through. at first i thought my son was just being fussy but then i realized nothing was moving through the nipple. i didn't try to make a hole in the nipple because the box from MAM said not to so I had emailed corporate and I'm hoping to have this issue resolved with either a replacement nipple shipped to me or sent a voucher to redeem a free nipple. I will change the rating when and if i get a positive result from MAM.
