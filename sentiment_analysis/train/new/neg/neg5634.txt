True, you can super strap your wiggly kid in with this thing.  AND, it has more support straps than all of the other major products of this type out there.However, it's not padded and it's a pain to put on the cart compared to all of the other major products of this type out there.So, you'll need to chose: padded and convenient but not very secure OR secure but inconvenient and not as padded.I wish we would have chosen something else.
