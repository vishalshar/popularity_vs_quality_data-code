It is very good teether and I like it because they are safe for my son.But I wish I had Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether by Vulli .Every time I go to my friends' house, he loved to play with the Giraffe.Yet I read the Giraffe review and found that the paint may comes off, that just unacceptable.So I will stick to this teether for now.
