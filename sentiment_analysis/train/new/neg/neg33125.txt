I opted not to buy a full bedding set for baby #3, so instead I purchased this blanket, a sheet and a few other items. Sadly this blanket is neither soft or cozy. It feels very rough, and my baby wants nothing to do with it. The only thing that's a plus is that it's cute, so it looks adorable folded over the side of his crib when he's not in it. Otherwise it was a waste of money. I have found several other blankets he loves to snuggle with, just not this one.
