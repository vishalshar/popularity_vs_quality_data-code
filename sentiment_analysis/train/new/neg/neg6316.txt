This is a VERY soft mattress and is too soft to be suitable for a newborn. Thankfully we were able to give this mattress to our toddler and use the toddler's mattress for the newborn. When our first was born we bought the Colgate Classica I Foam mattress and that is a perfect mattress for newborns - it is firm enough to keep them safe but still soft to lay on. We are using the Colgate for our newborn and gave our toddler this Serta Perfect Start. If you are buying for a newborn, I'd purchase another mattress and personally I'd recommend the Colgate Classica. It is more money but is well worth it. I'm giving it two starts because the dimensions were correct (even though other people complained the Serta didn't fit their crib) and it is a good mattress for older children but not for newborns.
