I am still waiting for my baby to arrive but I have pretty good idea about this. We got both mini and the original, and we thought we would keep the original. Ended up returning because it's bulky. We fly abroad a lot, and this one will not fit in any baggage.The baby likes it or not, that's another story. I am disappointed by this product as we had to return two items because they were defective. To unlock a stuck button both my husband and I, we spent more than an hour and ended up with numb hands. We expect more considering what it's worth. Folding and unfolding was way easier than what we expected tough.I don't know why people suffered that much.We are into safe co-sleeping, so ended up keeping the mini, thank god it was not defective. But be aware, convertible mini won't really serve as a playpen in the future, it's tiny. You can benefit maybe for a year or so. You can still use the bottom of the convertible mini as a storage, and put items you won't need immediately as it doesn't come with a zipper on the side.UPDATE AFTER A YEAR: We received a non defective one in the end, and we used it for approximately 4 months. Our son is huge, he outgrew it. Even at 4 months, he could barely fit. It's compact, we could carry it in a luggage to Europe. The concept is nice, the baby is within the arm's reach. However, it's not easy to go in and out of the bed. You can simply put a pack and play very close to the bed, it will be the same without the hassle. And accessories will be a lot cheaper. Although I had a good experience with this sleeper, I wouldn't buy it today.
