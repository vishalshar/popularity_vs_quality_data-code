I don't usually write reviews but I was very disappointed in this product. My son is well within the weight limit stated on the packaging (he is only about 28 pounds and thin), and the harness barely fits  around his chest.  If he is wearing anything bulkier than a thin t-shirt the harness doesn't fit at all. Although the product itself is cute snd my son likes just playing with the stuffed Elmo, this was basically a total waste of money for us because it doesn't fit as it should. I do not recommend this product at all.
