Wife and I read all the glowing reviews, bought it, and ended up really not liking this backpack. We've had it for 2 years. Our complaints was bag layout, and floppyness- we never used the built-in wipes pocket, it is easier to grab a bag of new wipes, than refill it- the top shallow pocket was useless. Items would fall out of it easily.- the bag is soft, it'd just fold on itself all the time. We prefer backpacks that are a bit more rigid. Everything would just pile up into a mess at the bottom.- the pockets aren't logically laid out. The smallest is in the front so you'd think the roomiest is in the back but it's actually the third pocket that holds the most. The final fourth pocket is a tiny one for keys and a cell phone but it took us a while to stop going into that one thinking it's the biggest.- the shoulder straps are pretty uncomfortable. They're scratchy, not padded, and when the bag gets heavy with clothes and water bottles it gets downright painful to wear after a while. They pull somewhat awkwardly and I'd slide the bag partway off my shoulders to relieve the discomfort.This is not one of my best reviews, but I wanted to put it out there because there is a big gap between what we expected, and what we got.
