My little boy likes this nap mat mostly because of what it has on it.  I only gave it three stars because it is much smaller than other nap mats he's had in the past. The blanket doesn't even cover him.  Would probably work well for a one or two year old, but I wouldn't purchase it if your child is any older than that.
