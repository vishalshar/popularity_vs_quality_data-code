We have been using them for about seven months now, and the system works great! Nevertheless, the pads have started to show wear and small holes on the hemp fabric. Because of the type of fabric it's really easy for the hole to get bigger with every wash, and so far we had to fix a handful of them by hand. On the warranty policy it says "...natural fiber wear holes" are not covered, so there is not much you can do.I totally recommend  the system, but I advise you to buy the completely synthetic liner and fleece types. The ones made of organic cotton are harder to wash and dry.
