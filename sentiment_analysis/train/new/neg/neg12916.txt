My 5-month-old son really enjoys looking at the animals on this mobile; they really seem to keep his attention. From time to time, he even seems to notice the motion on the soother. My little one, however, is not as discerning as I am.I love the music selections and the available nature sounds; they are all quite pleasant. I am also pleased with size and colors on the plush animals that dangle from the mobile--I think they are very appealing to my son. Finally, I think the remote feature is very convenient.However, there are a few features I would have like to have seen--especially at the, almost $60 original retail price. 1) This mobile seems to be made for a crib with high sides, you know, the ones that convert into a full-size bed later on. I have a traditional (non-convertible) crib, so the sides are lower and the mobile hangs a bit close to the mattress. 2) The music is a bit loud and can be distracting to my son when he's trying to fall asleep. The speaker seems to be internal, so I am not able to muffle the sound coming from the soother. 3) To that end, I would really liked to have had a feature that allows the mobile to run without music. 4) The packaging says you can have up to 20 minutes of movement and music. The instructions do not explain how to make the toy stay on for 20 minutes and I have yet to figure out the trick. 5) I would love to have seen some kind of lights on the soother; my son loves things that light up. 6) As I mentioned in #1, the mobile sits low on the rails. As a result, there have been nights when my son has been particularly squirmy in the crib and he has inadvertently kicked or hit the little birdie switch in his sleep. (I can not figure out how he managed to do this while swaddled!) One night, we were awakened 3 separate times because of this little convenience feature. I suppose alternate placement of that push-button would resolve the issue.
