I am surprise to say I was a bit disappointed in this product. I was really hoping it was no spill as promise but that was false. I bought this to transition my son off the bottle but it's basically another bottle. The sippy portion is a silicone material that is exactly the same as a bottle nipple just different shape. My son chews/sucks on the the sippy portion as he would a bottle so there's no change to help with the transition. The bottle leaked a great deal when leaned on the side for too long which I found out the hard way when I found half the bottle of milk on my carpet! Another disappointing thing about this item was the sippy portion easily comes off the plastic seal rim! I accidentally stepped on the top portion removing the nipple off the base causing the milk again to spill all over my carpet.The only positive things I can say about this product which is why I gave it two stars rather than the one is that it's easy to clean and the easy grip handles helps to train my son to hold it differently than he does with a bottle.Don't bother wasting your money on this product. You can probably get something similar for less.
