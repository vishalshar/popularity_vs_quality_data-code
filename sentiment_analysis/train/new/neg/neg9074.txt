I guess the car seats we buy depends heavily on the type of cars we drive. I drive a 2007 Acura TL. Rear facing, bad, really. its bulky inside my car so it cant lean far. My son looks uncomfortable. When finally front facing, positioning-wise, it got better, however, my complaint is now in the fabric its made. scratches easily. My son wears velcro shoes. I prefer them coz the fit can be adjusted better but it scratched the seat making it look old. Other than that, padded well. Head support is good too. Not too vision limiting like the newer ones. Reclines well, plus for that.
