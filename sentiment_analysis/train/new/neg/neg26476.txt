PLEASE DO NOT BUY ThIS PRODUCT. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY. We purchased this madela breastpump and it quit on us after only a few months. When we called customer service we talked with Cyndy (customer rep) and she was extremely rude and unprofessional at first. She told us that we will have to wait our turn in line until other pumps are fixed and repaired. She came across as extremely uncaring and lacked basic empathy as a customer service rep. We explained that we have triplets and we have to feed them several times a day, but she was unapologetic and said we will have to wait more than 2 weeks until the defective unit is repaired and sent back. What are we supposed to do in the meantime?????? At $2700 for a pump like this you would think they would work. Also please be advised that they WILL NOT REPLACE YOUR PUMP IF IT IS BROKEN. All they do is repair it, which is fine, but it will take FOREVER!!! They are trying to save money on postage so instead of sending your repair overnight they send it standard 7-10 business day one way and 7-10 business days the other way. Add to this wait the time in which the unit is actually repaired so you will have close to 3-6 weeks until you will have your Madela breastpump back. If you dont have a backup you are pretty much in big trouble. At the end of the conversation the rep did offer us a small temporary pump to use, but with triplets you have to pump a lots of milk and that small machine is inadequate. Save yourself the time and buy a different pump. Customer service is NON EXISTENT with this company. Their pump is overhyped and is made of cheap plastic materials. It is not worth $2700. Save that money and put it into a college fund for your kids instead of fattening some CEO's corner office. What a DESPICABLE company. Will never use them again.
