The problem I have with these spoons is that the handle is so much heavier then the part you eat off of that when I left it in the bowl, the weight of the handle caused the spoon the fall out of the bowl. I'm sorry to say I flung oatmeal all over my pants. Also read the description carefully, "colors vary" I missed that part. I thought I was getting blue and green which matches my kitchen but I received green and pink. Luckily I have a little girl so having received a pink spoon is not the end of the world just not what I wanted.
