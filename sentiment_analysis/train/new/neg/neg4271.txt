This was a huge disappointment!  The "U" shaped part that is supposed to reach the back of the baby's mouth is way too big to do any good.  Our daughter barely tried it before discarding it and moving on--and she puts ANYTHING and EVERYTHING into her mouth.  Plus, since they generally have a full mouth of teeth by the time the molars come in, the uniform thickness of the "U" that goes in the mouth just means the other teeth are chomping on this rather than the gums where the pain actually is located.  This was a great concept but not a great execution of design, unfortunately.
