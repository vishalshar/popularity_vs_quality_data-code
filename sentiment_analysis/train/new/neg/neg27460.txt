I love the crib sheets that are part of this product line Summer Infant Naturally Yours  Crib Sheet - Mineral but these changing pad covers are not terribly exciting. Even though I'm someone who prizes natural fibers, and even more so when they are organically grown, I am evaluating them from the perspective of having found a changing pad cover that, though synthetic (may be easier to wash clean) is so soft and sensual that it's sure to please baby -- and looks nice in the nursery as well (referring to Carters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Ecru ). Compared to that, this is thin terry cotton and the safer dyes that sometimes look a little washed out don't look great on the terry. It may look better once washed.This cover was also way too big - it may have fit if I washed it, dried it in the dryer, and shrunk it, but it looked quite a bit too big when I put it on. Obviously not really a safety issue, but it looked kinda ghetto.If you are trying to match the sheets, these may work once washed and dried, but I returned mine before washing because it just didn't look so hot.
