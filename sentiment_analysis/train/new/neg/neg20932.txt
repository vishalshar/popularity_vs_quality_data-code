This furniture is the right size and well made. It is heavy enough and so has never given us the fear of tipping or falling apart, however there is something that really bothers us. all the books fall forward. We have to costantly straighten it out and shift books around so that it all stacks up perfectly. If one rack is too full or starts to lean forward, it pushes all the books on the other shelves forward. This makes it impossible for the kids to put the books away (correctly) and a hassle for me. Maybe one of those other book racks that are wooden rows wouldn't have this problem. If I had known, I would have tried that out instead.
