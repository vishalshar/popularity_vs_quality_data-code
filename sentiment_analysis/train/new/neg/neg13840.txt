I e-mailed Fisher-Price to ask if this product contained BPA or Phthalates and this is all they could tell me:"I'm happy to answer your BPA and Phthalates questions. Although I do not have specific ingredients for individual toys I want to assure you that safety is our top priority and we manufacture our products to the strictest safety standards, both domestically and internationally. Our toys are some of the safest and most rigorously tested children's products in the world.Phthalates are plasticizers used to make hard plastic soft and pliable. There are currently Federal and European regulations that restrict the use of certain phthalates in childrenâ€™s products and we comply with those regulations. BPA is primarily used to make polycarbonate, where low levels of BPA remain after manufacture. Polycarbonate is an expensive material that is mainly used for its shatterproof properties. In toys, this type of plastic could be used in hard clear pieces, because it is especially strong. Mattel uses polycarbonate in a limited number of toys, and only when a substitute material would compromise safety or quality. The Fisher-Price Toddler Feeding Line and high chair trays are produced without using BPA."To other parents: please note that this product does contain hard clear pieces.
