I bought the Hygeia Enjoye after using an Ameda Purely Yours pump for several years (2 children).When I first got the product, it appeared nice. The pump and parts don't seem "cheap". When turning on, it seemed to be a bit quieter than the Purely Yours.  It is a bit awkward to hold when you are double pumping because of the angle of the flanges and the tubing coming straight out of the back. I really liked how versatile the suction is. I was really able to personalize, and easily change during my session, the speed and strength to suit my needs. My first impression was that this is a good product.There is, however, a big flaw in my eyes. If you have a forceful letdown, do NOT purchase this pump. The pump cannot accomodate a lot of milk at once, and it backs up into the tubing very easily. In just one week, I have gone through 2 filters and 2 sets of tubing. The customer service team sent me a free set of tubing, which I am grateful for, however this pump will not work for me. It was suggested to lean back or turn down the power on the pump. If you can sit reclined while pumping for 30 minutes or more while you lean back and S-L-O-W-L-Y drain your breats, this is a great pump. If you are a working mom, or one that needs something fast and effecient, this may not be for you. Until they can come up with a design that the milk can't back up (like the Purely Yours for example) or even move the tubing from the bottom of the flange to the top, the design is flawed and for many women including myself, useless.Overall, if you don't feel you have any kind of overactive or forceful letdown, this is a good pump. I would recommend you to be highly cautious, because it is no fun being stuck at work without a working pump while your tubing is full of milk.
