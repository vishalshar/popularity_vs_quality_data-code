Plates break easily. The first time I bought a plate and it broke, I thought it was just an accident. The second time it broke from falling off the counter, I knew it broke because it was not well made. The cup and silverware are good quality. The placemat  is a thin quality, but it does the job and lies flat; easy to clean. If you buy it, just be careful that it does not fall on the ground.
