The bed spread is OK. I only got this one because it was "10 peice". The 3 walll hangings it comes with are tiny, and not very cute. The "hamper bag" it lists...it is just the zip up bag it comes in. Very stupid. And I was looking forward to the bed skirt, but if your toddler bed has rails like mine does, the bed skirt is useless because it won't hang. The pillow is reversable though, it has a picture of Minnie Mouse on the other side. And the throw pillow is cute. I got another throw pillow from Walmart to complete it. Overall, it is a cute bedspread, but I think pink would be the better choice.
