We've been using this carrier for six months, and are fairly pleased with it.  It is comfortable to wear and the lumbar support is nice.  It's a little convoluted to set up and adjust - we actually used a silver sharpie to note on the black straps my settings versus my husband's settings to make sizing adjustments faster.The biggest disadvantage is all of the straps - 4 different straps to tighten/loosen depending on who's wearing it.  Each strap has a large number in white to supposedly help in adjusting, and the straps don't have a loop to tuck the ends into.  (Imagine wearing a watch without the little circular loop to tuck the excess strap into - it would just flop around and look really silly, right?  Now imagine you were wearing FOUR watches without loops - you'd look a little ridiculous.)  The combination of four straps flapping in the wind with large white numbers makes me feel SPECIAL (and not in the unique sense).Overall, this is great for wearing around the house or long walks because of the lumbar support, but you'll feel how a soccer mom driving a conversion van must feel when she pulls up at a stoplight next to a sleek, two-door convertible: bulky, frumpy, and un-cool.
