My son became too big for the regular swaddle, so I was happy to find that Kiddopotamus made a big baby size. Our son would not fall asleep without a swaddle until he was 4 1/2 months old. The Kiddopotamus makes swaddling much easier. Trying to do it yourself with a blanket is just too hard, and neither my husband nor I ever did it correctly. But, I am only giving this product 3 stars (I was close to giving it 4) because - 1) the placement pad (for the velcro tabs) ripped, but it was still usable torn 2) the thing worried me a bit because on occasion he was able to kick the bottom part of the swaddle off, and then he attempted to shimmy out of the top part. This resulted in finding him with the top part of the swaddle up around his neck and dangerously close to over his face 3) also, the first time we used it, he had chaffing on his neck. We remedied this by pulling the swaddle down and across instead of straight across. As I am typing this, I realize these criticisms sounds really bad! But 99% of the time, there was no problem, and as stated, our child had to be swaddled to sleep. Just be aware that you must be careful about how to wrap your baby in this product.
