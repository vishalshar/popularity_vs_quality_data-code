After searching far and wide for a low frequency analogue baby monitor, I decided to try this model. Unfortunately when it arrived, one of the parent units didn't work (it would power on, but could never connect to the baby unit), so I only had one left to try (for me, having only one was still ok since these units can be so hard to come by).So far I haven't gotten the remaining parent unit to work in a way I'm completely satisfied with. There is slight buzzing when the parent unit is engaged, and although the voice activation helps reduce this by only turning on the volume when something makes noise near the baby unit, each time the voice activation turns on or off it makes a click/squawk noise, like an old school walkie talkie. Also, the sound quality is not very good. My husband couldn't hear what I was saying even when I was standing very close to the monitor. He could hear that there was some noise generally, and the lights illuminated to confirm this, but I doubt we will be able to tell the difference between a crying baby who needs to attention and one that is just talking to itself and will go back to sleep if we leave it alone.For many parents, these reasons would be more than sufficient to return the product and get something else, but since I am really trying to avoid digital monitors and low frequency analogue models are so few and far between, I'm going to see if I can play around with these a bit more to reduce the buzzing and squawking and improve the sound detection. If I can't, I'm going to have to return them.
