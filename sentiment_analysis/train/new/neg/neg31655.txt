The description of the product doesn't show how this product works so allow me to inform you that it has a strap that goes around your neck. You can see it if you look very closely at the pictures of the people wearing it. It does not attach to the carrier itself like other products out there so back carries are out of the question. The product is good if you don't mind having a strap around your neck. The fleece lining and the outer nylon lining are of good quality so they work well at keeping the child warm and dry. I had a friend alter this product by cutting the strap, and making it into two loop straps with snaps to attach to my BabyHawk Oh Snap's straps (much like the Ergo cover). I found that this didn't workout as well as I had wanted it to so now I just use this product on my toddler's convertible carseat. It is a well-made product, but for serious babywearers with real baby carriers like Ergo, Boba, BabyHawk, Beco, etc. carriers, this product isn't your best choice. Look for the Kowali cover. Happy Babywearing!
