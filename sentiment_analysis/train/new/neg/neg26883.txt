The construction and materials are decent enough for the price, maybe a step above IKEA type furnishings.  Instructions were adequate to get the job done, but I have put together many of these type of things so someone with less experience may get a little frustrated at times.  I added wood glue to all the joints during assembly to make it hold up longer, especially at the edges of the drawer bottoms as these thin sheets are famous for sagging and pulling out of their slots. The finish looks good new and it matched the crib and changing station well, time will tell how it holds up.  Overall I think it is worth what I paid, not a Henredon but not a piece of diaper filler either.  As part of a set it was a quick way to get the baby's room ready to go.
