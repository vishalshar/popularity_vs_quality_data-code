When they say mini co sleeper... They are not joking. My baby was 22.25 inches when born. We got this when he was 3 months. After putting it together I placed him in it. I was surprised at the lack of space. There was maybe an inch or two left for him. That was when his his legs was slightly bent. If you have a tall baby, do not get this one because you won't get much use out of it. We returned it abd got the arms reach ideal original co sleeper. Yes it is more money but so much more worth it in the long run.
