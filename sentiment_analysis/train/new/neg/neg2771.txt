Looks perfect.  Issue is that you cannot find anywhere to purchase more valances or sheets.  Have even looked on DK Leigh website.  When you have a large window and a standard 30 in window, one set of valances is not enough.  If anyone knows where I can get these, please let me know!  Not being able to find these is my only reason for 3 stars.Also, it would be great to list or provide links for items such as the rug, etc., or at least suggested items to accessorize similarly to the picture...some of us need help when we are expecting! :-)
