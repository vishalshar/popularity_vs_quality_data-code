This is the secong time i purchase this fan. The first one I order didnt even work and had a burnt smell inside. So i returned it and decided to order a new one. I just received the package today and its not even what i ordered. I paid so much to receive a FLEX ON THE GO accessories. I ordered the fan not the accessories. I really needed the fan and its not even in stock anymore. Very disappointed. The box has two different labels. One says flex on the go and the other says its the actual rechargeable fan.
