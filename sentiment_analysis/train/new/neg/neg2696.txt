Maybe it doesn't matter to you but it did to me. I was hoping to get another smile man for my 10 month old grandson who loves this teether.  How ever I received the hedgehog.  Since others had raved about it too, I kept it and gave it to my grandson.  He tried it and tossed it aside.  It seems too large for his mouth.  He really chews on the bristles of the head and arms of the smile man but the hedgehog is a different shape with no bristles on the smaller areas such as the head or feet. I wish there had been a way of specifying which teether I was ordering.  I don't like to waste the money but to send it back would cost even more money.  Instead I have found a smile man on ebay and now have ordered it.
