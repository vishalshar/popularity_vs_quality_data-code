I bought this for my 1 year old at the time as we were going to be travelling for 19 hrs with several lay overs. This item was meant to help me out in keeping track of baby while letting her stretch her legs at airports. I put this on her and off she went and right away she fell flat on her belly...i thought oww she must have tripped she still working on the legs. Second go round she falls flat again but now the buckle by her shoulder came between her chin and the floor, next thing big yell followed by blood! Its odd that she fell same why both times i tried. Upon analyzing this item i realized when she runs the tail part pushes her hips back while her torso still is in motion so obviously she falls. I hate this thing, never ever used it again. I would not recommend this item for any kid under 4, you need a kid that doesnt run around too much. Ohh and one more thing, the pocket in back can barely fit much, its as small as her side pockets in her 12month pants!! CAREFULL. (I am a product designer and i give this an F-redo for functional design).
