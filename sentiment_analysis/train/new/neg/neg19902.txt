The pillow case was fine, and I was able to exchange it for a color that was more appropriate.  But I felt that the cost to ship a 2 oz package from Brooklyn to Manhattan was exorbitant.  I am now limiting myself to purchasing products where the shipping costs are either free or much more reasonable.  Too many merchants see shipping as another profit center, but they will not get my business any more,
