Pros:Super adorable and kid friendly character. The material it's made of is perfect for covering the hard bath spout. Not too hard, not too soft, a little texture to it makes it a bit grippy. The blowhole is perfect for the drain diverter (we don't have one, but if we did it would be great!).Cons:Since we don't have a drain diverter, this little guy has a hard time staying on the spout. the adjustable strap on the inside can only be adjusted a few notches or one of the whale's fins gets pulled through. It's too cute - my boys are more interested in it as a bath toy and like to pull it off the spout (okay, not exactly a con, but it's definitely amusing!).As I looked for a spout cover for tub time, I think this is the best one out there, if only I had a drain diverter...
