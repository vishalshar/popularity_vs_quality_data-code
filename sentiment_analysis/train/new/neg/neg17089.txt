I was soooo annoyed by all of the diaper bags I found.  No, I don't want to carry a bag with turtles or frogs or blue paisley.  I am carrying the bag, not my son.  This is a great looking bag and it hold EVERYTHING I need to get through the day.  I love the little wallet bag that comes with it.  If I need to run out real quick without the baby, I just grab it and go.  The only draw back is that it is a little deep and my husband has a hard time finding stuff from time to time.  But there are so many pockets and compartments and I know exactly where everything is so it's not an issue for me.  I feel soooo organized.QUICK UPDATEMy love affair has faded...along with the stitches in the bag. Within two months the stitches started to come out and the seams started to crack. The materials scratches really easily so it started to look pretty shabby pretty fast. I still love the way it looks, I just expected better quality for the price.
