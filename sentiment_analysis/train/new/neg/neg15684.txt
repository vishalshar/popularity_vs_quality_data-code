Overall this works for its intended purchase need.  I have a piece of metal that I still don't have any idea where it belongs but am glad that everything is still together.  I love the changing table addition and use it multiple times per day as a downstairs changing area away from my child's room.  I like that side compartments off the outside of the pack in play but do not like how it is attached to the side. For some reason it just sides in there and should hold but it doesn't on one side and is constantly falling down to the point that we cannot store much in there for fear of it falling down.  The base is durable and made well.  The product appears just as it does on the website and the colors have not faded at this point.  I like that I am able to order multiple products from graco that somewhat all blend together in colors that match other items from graco.
