We had a Summer video monitor in the past and it worked for three years.  We loved it - and when we had our second child, ordered a second one.  I have been disappointed in it since it arrived in January.  Within a month, the battery would not hold a charge beyond an hour - and this is with the video window being shut off and only sound being used.  We constantly had to keep it plugged in to work or could only unplug it for short periods of time.Within a couple of months of mild use, we haven't been able to use the handheld part of it without having it plugged into the wall - this is so disappointing, for as expensive as the system is and as well as our previous one worked!  The video part of it is very clear - as is the sound.  We loved this product and it works wonderfully with the exception of actually being a 'hand held device'.  At this point, I would not recommend this product.
