We started transitioning my little one to a sippy when he was about 8 months old. I love Nuk bottles and found it quite nice that you can continue to use the bottles with these spouts instead of a nipple. My little one felt it was more fun to chew open the spout holes instead of drinking out of them. They are very easily ripped by little teeth. That is my only complaint. Otherwise, these served their purpose for transitioning to a hard spout sippy cup.
