I've purchased a few of these cups on Amazon and find them great for toddlers who are just starting to drink out of regular cups. However, recently I purchased cups that turned out to be counterfeit and defective. I contacted the company and they were very helpful, the real cups have a laser printed serial number, the counterfeit ones do not. Below are pictures showing a fake purple one and a real pink one. I'm not happy not knowing what material these cups are made out of and they are definitely not as durable.
