We have had the stroller for less than four months and the plastic part of the front swivel wheel is broken.  This happened just from going over a curb while walking pushing a 30 lb child.  The tubes in both back tires had to replaced over a month ago because both back tires kept going flat.  Cannot find manufacturer and have contacted Exacme with no response on replacement part.  Cannot find replacement part anywhere, so now the stoller can only be used as a trailer until we can find a way to fix the front swivel wheel.
