These would not work at all- I tried on 2 different types of strollers...I have a set of basic umbrella strollers and a set of summer 3d lite strollers (both are exactly the same and should have worked). It wouldn't work for either. I thought I FINALLY got the umbrella strollers connected and then when I got just far enough away from my car that it was a problem they came apart. Save your money on these and just buy a double stroller...
