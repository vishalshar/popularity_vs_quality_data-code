I bought these labels back in November, and have been using them since then to label bottles, cups, snack bowls, etc., for my DD to take to daycare. At first, I really liked these labels. They stuck to everything I used them on, and lasted through several washes in the dishwasher. I used a thin Sharpie marker to write on the label, & it didn't smear. They are also very clean-looking. I just recently started using the Munchkin Latch sippy cup for my DD, and these labels do not stick at all! The cup has a curved shape, and the edge of the label comes right up. If it weren't for this issue, I would give these labels a 5-star rating instead,
