It looked so cute in the photo.  However, it was dirty when I unwrapped it.  There was a sticker on one of the polka dots that, when removed, tore off part of the dot. There was also some sticky substance on another dot that I couldn't get off.  I rec'd this a couple of weeks ago, but just got it out yesterday to look at. Threw away the original box, etc., or I would have returned it.  Quite disappointed, it was to be a Valentine's Day gift for my grandson, I will give it to him with apologies to his momma.  Cheap.
