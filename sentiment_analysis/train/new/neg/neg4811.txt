This wall decal is SO cute!! It looks absolutely amazing on baby girl's nursery wall but unfortunately about a handful of the leaves, a flower, two branches and a part of the round owl circle keep trying to unstick themselves and fall off. I'm going to try using some craft glue to get them to stick back up because it really is a stunning look. The tips of the entire decal comes right above my head (I'm 5'2") and it was pretty simply to apply. When I received the package I laid it out flat and put heavy books on it for a week to flatten it out from being rolled up in shipment.
