We ordered a few of these sheets. Within a couple weeks of use, one of the 3 sheets we purchased started to shred at the corner. We contacted Amazon and requested a replacement. Unfortunately, not to long after, the other sheets we purchased originally started to shred at the corner.  The replacement sheet also has since shredded at the corner.
