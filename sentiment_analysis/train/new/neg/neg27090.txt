I purchased this for my daughter who was at the time a few months old. It is firm; however, the smell of plastic never went away. She used it for over a year and the sheets, her hair and the general area always had a sweet plastic smell. New to Amazon at the time, I did not realize that Amazon has such a great returns policy or I would have taken advantage. We have since moved on to a softer mattress for toddlers. I always felt bad when I smelled plastic on her hair and at the time we were not in a position to get anything else.
