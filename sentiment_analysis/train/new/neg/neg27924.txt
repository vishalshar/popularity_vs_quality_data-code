Liked the bag, except the metal stroller strap snapped off today after only using it for a month! I'm returning it and debating on whether to get another, or will this happen again? I admittedly put a lot of stuff in it, but not like bricks or anything that heavy, is there a weight limit? If I get a new one, maybe I will put the shoulder strap over the stroller handle as well as the two side straps to try to ease the burden on the metal buckles. The only other thing I don't like is that the side zippers often come all the way down, again when the bag is fairly full, spilling things out while walking. And I wish the outside zipper pocket had two zippers so it could be closed from either side. I like how it looks, the stroller straps (before they broke), the outside zipper for keys & cell phone (with the above caveat).
