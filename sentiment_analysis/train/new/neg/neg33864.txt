I got this bib because it seemed like a great idea to cover the shirt collar but after using it a bunch of times I realize is poorly made Why the heck didn't they put a waterproof backing to the bib? If my son eats anything that is a bit wet it just soaks through and it totally defeats the purpose of a bib. Any water he drinks just soaks right through also. Would not buy again.
