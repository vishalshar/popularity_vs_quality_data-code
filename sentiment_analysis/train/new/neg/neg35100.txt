Pros:- Allows the use of a car seat in the stroller- Stroller can still fold upCons:- Installation takes 3 different tools, glue, at least 31 steps, and a lot of attention to detail.  There are multiple screws to remove and replace.  Expect to make mistakes.  They should pay us to install this thing.- The car set fit for our Graco Snugride is mediocre at best. Even when clipped, the seat wobbles.  The foot end of the car seat bends the stroller frame to fit properly.  Even when fitted, the car seat is in an extremely upright position - much more so than when placed in the seat base in our car.- The styrofoam block used to stabilize the car seat is just that - a snow white styrofoam block.  I'm sure this will get dingy and gross after a while of jogging with a 2 year old in the next seat.- The cup holders are way too for all but the smallest sippy cups.  The other compartments in the tray are also too small to fit anything useful.- There is no way to flip up the adapter to allow toddlers to crawl in the seat by themselves - a real problem for people with bad backs, or in our case, a wife with a recent c-section.  There really isn't adequate space for a child to squeeze in - you have to lift them up and place them in the seat.I'm not going to return this (because I destroyed the box), but if I had known these things from the beginning, I would NOT have purchased it.
