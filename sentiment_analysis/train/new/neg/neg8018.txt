I have twin girls. One has more sensory issues, and I bought her a chew necklace (different brand) a couple weeks ago that has been a godsend. Her sister has been asking for one ever since, so we decided to try a different style and I ordered this in two colors, one for each, assuming they were pretty much the same. They are not. I was disappointed that the strands tie rather than have a safety clasp.... No easy on/off, also choking hazard. Still, two little girls were anxious to wear their chew necklaces this morning. I arrived to pick them up from PreK to find one sobbing because the necklace had snapped and the pendant was gone. Very first day. This cost more than the original we purchased, poorly constructed, unsafe, and simply subpar. I will add that I have shopped heavily with Amazon since becoming pregnant with my twins six years ago and this is the first time I've made myself make the time to write a review. I've returned maybe two items in all that time, but this is the first time I've felt completely disappointed and even fooled by a product. The only good thing I can say is the pendant itself seems quality, but much too heavy for a thin strand with no clasp. One star for the pendant.
