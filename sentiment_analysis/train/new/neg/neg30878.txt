The double gussets are great  at holding in the blow outs that my three month old is so know for but for some reason they always leak pee. Better than some of the other cheaper brands but come on I shouldn't have to change a wet onesie with every diaper change. I only keep the diaper on for about two hours. They have a return guarantee if your not happy with them but not sure how to get that, I haven't had any response to emails.
