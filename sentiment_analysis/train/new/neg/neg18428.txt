I have been using this monitor for a year and a half now and I'm ready to replace it! To turn it on you have to hold the power button down for 8-10 seconds (sometimes it seems like even longer).  The signal is choppy too.  My room and my children's rooms are not far apart but I need the monitor because my baby doesn't cry very loud.  I can hear the hum of the computer through the monitor, then it will go silent for a few seconds before the hum sound begins again.  The volume up and down is weird too. It beeps to let you know you have made an adjustment but the beep does not get louder or softer to indicate exactly how loud or soft it will be.  The monitor does not stand up very well which makes if very easy to knock off the table in the middle of the night. The directions tell you not to leave its rechargeable battery in the monitor when your not using it but it is very difficult to get in and out. I'd rather just be able to use regular batteries. My biggest complaint is the plug!  It is boxy and sticks out almost 2 1/2 inches from the wall which makes it difficult to plug in behind a dresser.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.
