I was so prepared to love this.  We bought the crib a few months ago... received this for a shower gift and were sorely disappointed.  When I opened the package, screws and parts fell out.  Nothing was bagged.  Additionally, there were NO instructions.  The changing table is NOT made by the same company that the crib is.  The lack of quality in the materials is glaring once the package is opened.  Secondly, I received 2 of the same ends. Hard to explain, but basically its like having 2 left shoes.  I could have put this together, but holes would have been exposed to the outside, being unslightly. I did finally, _almost_ get this together, without instructions, just to have a wood piece pull apart and splinter, damaging the wood beyond repair.  Needless to say, I returned this.  I didn't bother getting a changing table!  Hope you have better luck!
