Seemed like an ideal plane companion.  We've taken a few plane rides now, and it just doesn't stay on long.  I'm sure different kids will react differently to it, but it seems like it's a little big for our 2 year old.  She seems to find it uncomfortable after a little while.  On the upside, it does make a decent pillow against the wall of the airplane.
