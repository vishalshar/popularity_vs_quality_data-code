I like this swing for the most part.  It's colorful & it has plenty of animals for my three month old baby to look at.  I didn't want to get a dull-looking swing.  She also seems to like the music, although the vocals in some of the songs get annoying to me after awhile.  So, I'm glad it has two volume levels.  It swings about the same speed no matter how high you adjust the level.  I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have a lot of room because the legs do spread out quite a bit (good for stability of course) and we have a somewhat spacious apartment.  For that, I would go with a travel swing.  My baby usually falls asleep in it & other times, she fusses & wants to get out.  It depends on each baby on how they will like it.
