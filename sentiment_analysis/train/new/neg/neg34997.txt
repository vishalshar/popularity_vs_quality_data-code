This product, while cute, isn't the best cup out there in my opinion. It's very hard to use because of the removable "cork" sipper that sits inside the top. The edges leak if it's not screwed on in exactly the correct way and the child can't finish all of the liquid in the cup due to a deep set top, where all the remaining liquid ends up sitting when the cup is turned to a drinking postion.
