Purchased this to protect my B-agile stroller on the plane. I am very glad I did since the bag came back FILTHY. I tell everyone who is going to check or gate-check their baby accessories to make sure they are in bags so they are protected.The bag is VERY hard to get on and I wouldn't be able to do it with a baby in my arms, even if the baby was in a carrier. Its hard enough to do it with one person and 2 hands. It only goes in one direction and then you have to STRETCH it to get it around the stroller and I feel like the zippers are not going to last. Its cheaply made and reflects that. I also have the B-safe seat and love it. I use this bag JL Childress Ultimate Car Seat Travel Bag, Black to cover it and I think its working well.Update 8/12/12We used this on SEVERAL recent trips and I am glad I had it. I can't believe how dirty everyone else's strollers come back from gate checking. if you flip the stroller over (wheels up) and put the bottom on the bag on first, then flip it over and zip it up, its A LOT easier to put on and will fit better in the bag. That being said, on a trip to puerto rico on Jetblue, something must have gotten caught and someone just pulled instead of figured out what the problem was and the bag AND the stroller grip ripped. I knew the bag wasn't that sturdy and I think it would have been fine if it wasn't handled so poorly. Just FYI- JetBlue (and most other airlines) consider strollers a delicate item and do not cover damage. WTF?! I would never have taken my stroller with me if I knew they wouldn't take care of it AND THEN not cover the damage they caused. The car seat and car seat bag are still doing well.
