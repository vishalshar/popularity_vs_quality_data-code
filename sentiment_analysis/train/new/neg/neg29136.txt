This was great for a while...lasted for 6-8 months until it faded out and broke.I got 2 of these for both of my cars. First one lasted about 5 months? Before it broke. 2nd one about the 7 months before it broke off. The suction keep falling off even though I put water in the center.Before it broke and fell off the color and shape of the banana wrapped and faded off even in a tinted rear window...I will not be buying anymore of this...definitely not recommended if you're looking for a long term one. If you're looking for a good one I recommend the Bear Baby on Board Car Decal / Sticker - Yellow...by World Design.As always thank you for reading my review.
