Love the design except it doesn't close well and the wipes dry out in a few days. Solution: put wipes inside a Zip-loc bag with a hole cut it, then put the bag in the dispenser. I've been using the same Zip-loc bag inside for months and the wipes stay moist. It's a little bit of a pain to refill because my Costco Kirkland wipes are a tad too wide for the bag and bunch up, but Pampers wipes fit perfectly and are easy to put inside. I put up with this extra step because I love the design. The dispenser is attached to a D-ring on the outside of my messenger bag-style diaper bag, tucked into an outside pocket when not in use. When using a public changing table, I just wear my diaper bag, pull the wipes dispenser out so that it hangs free, and I can access the wipes one-handed. This sure beats putting the diaper bag/wipes container on the scuzzy bathroom floor or visibly yucky changing table if there is even room.
