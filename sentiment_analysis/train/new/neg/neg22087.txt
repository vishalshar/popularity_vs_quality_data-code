My son loves looking at that picture on this potty and playing with the flush handle, but of his potty choices  (he has 2 stand alone potties and 3 potty seats) this one is the least used. Even sitting all the way back there is barely enough room for his penis to fit in before the guard.  The seat has no cushioning or shaping to make it more comfortable, and is entirely too narrow to allow him to sit comfortably in any position other than a straddle (and he is very small for his age).  Although he can use it, to effectively get all his pee in it he needs to see it in a straddle around the widest part of the rim and lean forward to grasp the splash guard as if were a saddle horn.  The shallowness of the yellow bowl can also cause some "messy situations".I am giving this potty two stars because the flush handle definitely attracts his attention, and he continues to show interest in it because of the "Elmo fishy" picture on the back, but as a parent it feels like the designers paid far more attention to the design of the back portion than the functional needs.
