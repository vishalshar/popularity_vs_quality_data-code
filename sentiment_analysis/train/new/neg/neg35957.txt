UPDATE: So an update...still love the chair and the look. However if you are breastfeeding-beware. The arms are WAY to high to breastfeed comfortably. I have to stuff a pillow in the side to let my arm rest comfortably. Also at 2 months my baby is already WAY to long to fit in the chair with me across my lap. The grandparents use it way more than I do to rock baby to sleep. But if you plan on doing any sort of feeding-bottle or otherwise-your arms will thank you if you get a chair that supports them and are down lower. So I'm taking this review from 4 to 2.I have had this glider on my wish list from the minute I found out I was pregnant! So happy to finally have it after sending one back to Amazon for it being totally filthy and ripped in the back-I'm glad to have one in good shape. I haven't had any of the rocking issues other's have seemed to have-ours glides and swivels very smoothly.The biggest con though: Shipping. The box is not NEARLY sturdy enough nor the chair protected enough in shipping to prevent damage. Be prepared to have to ship one or two back to get one that isn't damaged. It came just in a not sturdy box (that looked like lions had gotten at it before we opened it up) and a simple plastic bag over the chair. No padding, no bubble wrap, nothing.The one other thing that really really bothered us is we watched it for months and bought it when the price finally dropped to $435 (I think they were discontinuing some colors) and then 2 days later the price dropped to $370! And amazon will not refund your money which I think is outrageous for a drop within such a short period of time.Overall, compared to how expensive gliders for Nursery's are, this is a great deal. It's not the worlds most nicely made piece of furniture, but for the price, it's really great if you get a good one.
