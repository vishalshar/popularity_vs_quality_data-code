I love that these fit Dr. Brown's glass bottles so well.  So many other silicone sleeves for other glass bottles don't fit them well.  However, I have to say, Dr. Brown:  if you are going to custom make silicone sleeves, make the cutouts match the measurements on the bottles.  Yes, you can see some of the measurements if you line them up in a specific way, and you can see a bit through the sleeve if you hold it up to a light to see the measurements, but again, if you are custom making something for your brand and bottles, make them line up.
