I have to seriously use all of my strength to loosen or tighten the harness. Yes I am pushing the button, yes I got out the manual just to make sure everything was proper. Still same issue. We called and received a brand new, step up from other one car seat and its the SAME issue if not WORSE!! Its been over 90 days so I guess we will use our older handme down warn in but still safe Britax. That car seat is amazing. SKIP this seat!!!
