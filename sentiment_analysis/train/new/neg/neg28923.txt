I just received this and it installed in just a few minutes.  Anyone else reviewing this that claimed it was too hard to open with one hand probably has it tightened too far.  There is a fine balance between too tight to open easily and too loose to be stable.  But it only took a couple twists of the pressure mounts for me to determine the right balance.I read the other reviews before purchasing and carefully measured the opening I planned to block with this gate to make sure it would work.  Because, as other reviewers have stated, this is not a gate that fits openings 29" - 52" like the product description lists.  This gate will fit in an opening that is approximately 29-32", roughly 35-38" with just the 6" extension, approximately 42-45" with just the 12" extension, and roughly 48-51" with both extensions.  Unfortunately, if your opening falls in those in between sizes, you're going to find that you can't get a good fit.  Either it's too big with the extension(s) added that you can't get it in place or w/o the extensions it's not very sturdy because you have to push the pressure mounts to the extreme end of their length.My biggest issue with this gate is that it seems really flimsy and cheap compared to the Northstates, Evenflo & KidCo gates we have in other doorways thru-out the house.  The overall construction is made of poorly done welds against the thin metal tubes.  Since I put this in an area that gets high traffic, I'm concerned about how long it will hold up.  But I guess that's what you get when you buy the cheaper option.We're going to try it for awhile and see how it goes.
