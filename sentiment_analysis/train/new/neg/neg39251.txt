This is such a cute hat. But it seems to be cut too deep/long. We bought the 6-12 month size for our daughter. Our kids are bigger than average age. At 3 months it fit her but was just too deep and would slip over her head. The way this hat is made, you cannot roll up the rim. When she got big enough to fit the length, the hat was too small circumference wise.Same thing is happening to our son. It fits on his head but is too deep. And now his head's getting bigger and I'm afraid he also won't be able to wear it.
