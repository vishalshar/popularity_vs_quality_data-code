This is definitely not a five star product but it holds a good strong four. Out of the box comes several pieces that take about twenty minutes to set up. Instructions are fairly thorough. The unit's electronic wiring is threaded through the support legs so it is obscure and hidden. So far it has worked perfect and we have had no issues (1 month now). If things change so will this review. My one major grief with this which can be viewed as a plus is that the seat material seems very flimsy and doesnt secure very well to the plastic base. This makes for easy removal and cleaning but in my opinion looks less pleasing. We paid about $80 for it so I can't complain when comparing it to other more expensive models that do the exact same thing.
