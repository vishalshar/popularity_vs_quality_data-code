I love flowers and wanted to get a toy for my baby girl that would involve flowers.  In other words, I wanted to like this toy.  Unfortunately the music plays only when the blue flower is pressed.  It does not play when other flowers are touched.  The toy can only play 2 songs and repeats them over and over.  I think Lamaze could have done much better than that.  Not worth the ~$20 price I paid.  I'm disappointed.
