I measured out the room and figured I needed 2 rolls.  Turns out I need 3.. The rolls are shorter than what they are listed as, but the pre-paste absolutely sucks.  It sticks wonderfully in the middle of the paper, but the edges do not stick for anything.  I followed the directions to a T, and wound up buying some wall paper adhesive to make it stick.  We went with the sugar plum theme, with the top half of the room pink and the bottom half plum, so this was the obvious choice to seperate the colors.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone going with the sugar plum theme, but I would recommend just getting the wall paper adhesive and using it to begin with.  That stuff is like $5 for a small tub of it(and unless you are doing your entire house with the border, this is all you will need).
