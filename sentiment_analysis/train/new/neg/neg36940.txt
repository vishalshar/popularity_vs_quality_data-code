It didn't register for me that of course these don't come with a cover. Without a cover they can't easily be 'made up' in advance, or packed for an outing. As well, the clasp is difficult to open. We used them once then threw them out as soon as the "Sassy" teething feeder ones arrived.  Plus the Sassy polka dot ones came with spare net bags.(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HZ3JKG0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_42)
