We bought two of these bibs and enjoyed them for a couple months.  We would wash Crocodile Creek bibs using a rag and dish soap and let them dry (took at least four hours), so it was good to have two in rotation.  The velcro held up and didn't scratch him and he didn't mind them.  The pocket worked marginally well.  But then my son started eat regular table food and these bibs started to smell from being used too many times--like wet fabric.  So I tried a Baby Bjorn bib (hard plastic with open pouch) and fell in love.  Only need one of those because it can be easily wiped dry and it's only a couple more dollars than this one.  Too bad about the CC bibs since they are so cute.
