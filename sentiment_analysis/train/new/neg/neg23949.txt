Awful pillow! This pillow is travel sized,basically what you would get on an airplane. This is not  big enough for a toddler to sleep on comfortably. Very disappointed this pillow is made with a hard stiff foam and not made of memory foam like the previous one we had bought from this brand a couple of yrs ago. Another draw back is that the company will not accept any returns on there pillows. I would not recommend buying this pillow!
