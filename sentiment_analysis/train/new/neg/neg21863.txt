I don't know how anyone can use the scissors over the clippers!  All the reviews I read made it sound like clipping was infinitely harder than using the scissors.  I beg to differ.  The clippers work great, even when my son is awake and squirming around.  I feel like I could cut him with the scissors.  Anyway, the emory boards are average quality and actually coarser than I'd like them to be.  I always end up rubbing his skin and irritating it.
