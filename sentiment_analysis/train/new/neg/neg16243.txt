I've had this stroller for a little over a year, and during that time I've noticed a few annoying things about it that make me wish I didn't pay so much for it. It works great with an infant carseat, but you have to buy the adapter for it. I wish it came with a cup holder because I had to order that too. And eventually when I have a second child, I will have to spend $80 for the extra seat. All in all I will have spent more than $600 for a mediocre stroller. I love how the sun shade can be moved all the way forward to keep the sun out of my little's eyes, but I wish it were actually attached to the stroller. When I move it forward it comes completely off and it's really annoying to have to push it back on whenever I change the position. The stroller is also finicky about how you open it up. There's a small red button to push when you open it, but it has to be in just the right position to release. With a stroller this heavy, you want it to open easier. And lastly, I just used it today and the bar that you press to fold the stroller up came completely off. Save yourself the trouble and buy a Bugaboo or Uppa Baby.
