I bought the Milk Bands Breastfeeding Bracelet soon after my first baby was born. This looked like a great product to track her feeding. The band is numbered to match the hours on one side and every five minutes on the other. Tiny sliding plastic pieces snap onto the bracelet to mark the time of baby's last feeding. The first sliding piece broke off with a few days. Thankfully, it came with a spare. But the second one broke, too. So I made due with just the hour tracker. Then that one broke. I love the idea, but the execution is flawed. I would not buy this for my expecting friends until the company made some changes.
