I bought the green one for my son, wanting a non-plastic water bottle.  After only using the bottle for several weeks, and only washing it by hand, the paint started chipping and I would find the paint stuck to the mouthpiece!  I was disappointed, 1) because I had spent almost $20 on a water bottle for my son that was bad quality, and 2) because I wanted a non-plastic option that was safe for my son.I emailed the Pura company asking for a replacement bottle (not the lid, but just the bottle) to replace the paint chipped one I had.  First, I had to send them pictures of the bottle, along with a list of other information.  I did all of that, but they required that I mail back the faulty bottle before they would send me a replacement.  The amount of time and money they were requiring of me to make right what was their defect was more than I was willing to pay.  The message to me was that they don't stand by their products.  Buy a Camelbak- they are great when it comes to standing by their products!
