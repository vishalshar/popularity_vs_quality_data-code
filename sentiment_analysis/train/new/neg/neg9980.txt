I was so hopeful after reading so many great reviews that our little one would sleep. He is four months old and was not sleeping well in a swaddle - we thought this would be the answer. He doesn't sleep any better in this than he did the swaddle - perhaps even worse. I'm not sure why this is so expensive. The fabric feels cheap to me. The suit is so thick and rides up into my baby's moth that it makes night time nursing and burping very difficult. The arms and legs seem to fit and yet the top front of the suit rides up into his mouth - there are two unprotected zippers right there which rub on his face/chin and he tries to suck/teeth on them. Unless something major happens in the next few days ill be transitioning him to a yummy/cozy sleep sac from (babyinabag.com) that I used w my other four kids. Not worth the money so far:(
