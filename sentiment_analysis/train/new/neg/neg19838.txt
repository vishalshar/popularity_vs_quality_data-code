This box comes with the planets and the stars, which are REALLY cool.  However, it is missing the sun, (I had to use one of the largest stars as a substitute), the stickers that have to be placed on the back are difficult to work with, and they don't stick worth a hoot. Everything I put up fell off within a couple of hours, and no matter how many stickers I put on the back, they wouldn't stay. I ended up having to use duct tape. It's still really cool to look at when the lights go out, but I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.On a side note, I bought this from 'Friendly Company' and they were terrific. Customer service was outstanding. This purchase in no way reflects on them as a company, and I would definately purchase from them again.Added note - 03-06-09 - ended up using a hot glue gun. that worked PERFECTLY, but MAN was it time-consuming.
