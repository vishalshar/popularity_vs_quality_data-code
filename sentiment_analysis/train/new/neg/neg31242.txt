I decided to try these out since the positive reviews out-weighed the negative and I really need an outlet in each room where I don't have to deal with the plastic plugs for things like the vacuum and iron. I faced several issues and will be returning these.1) The width and height are smaller than the standard outlet cover. While they covered the hole in the wall, they did not cover marks from the prior cover and missing paint so the wall around each outlet cover I replaced would require touch up. I took a chance since other reviewers had already mentioned this and unfortunately I had the same issue.2) they didn't lay flat against the wall so they could be twisted left and right and it looked bad. while little fingers couldn't get into the space between the plate and the wall, little hands could try to shove stuff down there. Or if they did twist the cover they could turn it enough to create an opening.3) when trying out a few plugs in the outlet when I'd remove the plug the cover didn't always slide back into place leaving the plug holes exposed. I tried 5 times and 2x the cover didn't fully retract.
