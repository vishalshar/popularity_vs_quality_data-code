I wish I could give these 3.5 stars. They are the only re-useable product out there that I could find for this purpose, and the price is very reasonable, but they could still stand to use some improvement. Please keep in mind that these are not doublers...so they absolutely don't do much in adding extra absorbancy.Pros:-Make cleanup of poopy diapers MUCH easier--even to the point that Daddy will do it!-Minimize staining on expensive cloth diapers (the liners themselves are likely to stain however)Cons:-They shrink--quite a bit--after washing, to the point where they are definitely still useable, but not always wide enough to contain the mess.-After just a couple of washings, they become quite a bit rougher (my daughter doesn't seem to mind though)-Before I toss them in the dryer, I have to "straighten" each one out individually, otherwise they come out of the dryer all crumpled and won't lay flat in the diaper. As a busy mom of a newborn and a toddler, the few minutes it takes to do this are often minutes I can't spare.As I mentioned, I'm overall pleased with this product--it does what I purchased it to do. I even came back and purchased another pack. However, I would have happily paid a bit more for something of a bit better quality that addresses the issues above.
