As much as I wanted my little to love this toy, she doesn't. She prefers gnawing on her soft blanket, even though it doesn't make awesome crackling sounds like this one does. It entertains her only for a little bit. She can't seem to get the hang of putting the rubber end in her mouth, so it doesn't satisfy her teething desires. After one wash (I know, I know, you aren't supposed to put it in the washer - but I put it on delicates, I swear), the squeaker went out, so that was also disappointing. It was probably her favorite part about the blanket. I do also wish the green material was softer.
