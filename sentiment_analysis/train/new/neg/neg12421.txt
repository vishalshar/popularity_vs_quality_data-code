Just bought this for my son.  He LOVES it.My only 'problem' with this is that there are hinges on each end so that you can angle the arch away or towards your child - but the hinges aren't very strong. They don't lock into place very well so often it falls forward onto my baby's face. He doesn't mind at all; it is not a heavy toy so this never hurts him in anyway. I just feel bad for him when I look back and see that they toy is in his face.Also, if you have a car seat with thick sides... the clasps might not fit. We have an Eddie Bauer XRS car seat. The cushioning on the sides is pretty thick. The clasps barely fit.
