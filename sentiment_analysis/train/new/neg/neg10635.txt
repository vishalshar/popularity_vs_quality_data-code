I both this bag for taking care of the third child, I thought it 'll be much more practical for me. I know what I need, but the trouth is that it's not so comfortable, like it seems to be, to  travel with the baby and only this pouch, without carring bag.It too small for the ergent needs for you&baby. when you planing to go for an hour or two. It can place only my pirse and phone- and there is no enougth space for keys or/and for diper&snack. I using  this with my ergo baby carrier, the carrier much more comfortable&practicle.
