The cleaning is a hassle, but I could have dealt with that.The real issue I had with this product is that it felt clunky, and it was irritating to pump. It actually hurt to use it. I give it two stars because I've liked everything else I've tried with NUK (sippy cups, milk bags etc). Save your money, really not worth it.
