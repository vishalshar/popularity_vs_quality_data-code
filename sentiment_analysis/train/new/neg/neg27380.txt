I wear bra size 40I. I have proportional sized aerials and nipples. All three of these sizes are huge. They do not offer a small and I wouldn't buy it if they did. I am an exclusive pumper (not by choice) and these were the only shields I used from the time my son was born. After 1.5 months I thought something must be seriously wrong with me because the extreme amount of pain I was experiencing during pumping and an hour after had not subsided. Thank god my ob asked me to bring them with me so she could see the fit. They caused so much damage I am still recovering two weeks later. Perhaps for someone with very large nipples they would work. I experienced less output, incredible lasting pain, tearing, blistering and all around discomfort with these shields. I have had so much luck with the medela shield built for my pump and my breasts I am so regretful of the time and money wasted on these. P.S. They don't change your posture at all.
