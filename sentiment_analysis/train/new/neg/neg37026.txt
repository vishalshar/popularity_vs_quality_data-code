We're happy with this laundry basket. It's sturdy, the perfect size, easy to carry when full, and cute. It's a little darker pink than the picture shows, but that fine for us. We've had it for months now and it's held up well. One handle fell off (um... or my kids pulled it off?), but I was able to pop it back on. No real complaints!UPDATE: I've had this less than a year and both handles have now fallen apart and off (not fixable). Granted, we are fairly rough with it (my kids drag their laundry basket to the laundry room alone) and it was inexpensive, but I'm disappointed it didn't hold up better and longer.
