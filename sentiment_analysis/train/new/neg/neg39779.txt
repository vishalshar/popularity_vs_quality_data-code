It's a cute-looking item to have for the tub. It works pretty well and does what it's suppose to do. No complain in that regard.We keep our item near the tub where it stays dry most of the time, but after about a month it became moldy. It just turned black, which makes it unusable. I tried different product to get rid of the mold, nothing worked. So, take our lesson and make sure you store it somewhere absolutely dry all the time.
