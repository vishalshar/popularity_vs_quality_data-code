I don't normally write reviews; however, I was recommended to purchase one of these "Udder Covers" by a lactation consultant after I had my first baby, who is now just over a month old, and it is not as I expected. The "rigid" neckline, is well, not so rigid. Kind of awkward actually if you ask me. It is quite flimsy as well. Not sure what could be done to fix this, but it just isn't the greatest. The material seems nice, soft and breathable, but the whole concept that makes this nursing cover different from others is the rigid neckline so you can maintain eye contact with your baby. Although it is possible, I really wasn't impressed with the design. Great concept, poor design, especially for the price. With some improvement it could be a great nursing cover, but as it stands, it just isn't worth the money. I actually purchased one of the cute little neck straps for a third of the price, which you can attach to ANY cover, blanket, etc., and I love it! Plus, it serves multiple purposes!
