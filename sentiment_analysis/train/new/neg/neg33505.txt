I purchased this changing pad because of its great price. I mean, how intricate could a 3 inch piece of stuffed plastic be. My child is only resting on it for a matter of minutes a handful of times a day while being changed, so it was low on my priority list of baby items. After putting a soft cover on it, and placing it on my rather expensive and new dresser, it looked just fine. I was pleasantly surprised with the comfortable feel the pad provided, and the surface is rather easy to clean.However, about 2 months after I purchased the item I was cleaning the furniture and noticed that something on the underside of the pad was causing small scratches in the surface of my dresser. The scratches hadn't penetrated passed the poly coat of the finish, but were very evident when the light shined on the surface. After noticing this, I spoke with my sister, who also purchased this item for her newborn upon my recommendation. She, too, had scratches underneath the changing pad. Hers were far worse, scratching off the stained coat and showing bare wood. The only area I can attribute the scratching too is the rough stitching on the back of the changing pad to hold the straps in place. I have now placed additional cushion underneath the pad to act as a barrier between it and my furniture. My sister and I have both contacted the company regarding the problem and are awaiting their reply. I will update with a review of their customer service.
