I thought this seat cover was a great idea to stop my toddlers dirty shoes from grinding into the back of my carseats.  Concern #1 was when I had to really stretch it to get the elastic loop to fit over and around the seat.  It did eventually fit without repercussion, though I believe the too-snug fit creates concern #2, which is that the mat doesn't cover high enough.  If you have forward-facing toddlers still in relatively high-sitting carseats, the limiting stretch of the elastic loop around the lower bend of the seat pulls the mat down too far.  This outcome leaves a gap of about 4-5 inches at the top of the seat, which is exactly where their little feet kick.  That was the whole reason I got this mat.  It would be better constructed if the elastic loop was adjustable, giving enough slack to place it higher on the seat, which would allow tightening of the head rest connecting straps to close the gap.  Not so.  I've pulled the velcro head rest straps as tightly as possible to keep the mat held high, but it's still not the coverage I thought I was buying.My verdict is, when they're older and in booster seats these mats will be fine.  While they are still in carseats, it just doesn't cover the area that's most vulnerable.
