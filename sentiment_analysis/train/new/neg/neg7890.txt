We have a red dog WubbaNub that has lasted since infancy. This one got a crack/hole in the pacifier on the mouth area almost immediately, rendering it useless because I don't want him to choke. Please note that he did not bite it.I'm disappointed in this one because the bull is super cute and like, I said, we have had the red dog one for a while without issues.
