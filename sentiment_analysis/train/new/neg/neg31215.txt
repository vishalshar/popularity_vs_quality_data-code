So it's comfortable, pretty, soft and easy to use, but I was told at the babywearing international meeting that it isn't safe because the fabric is too thin and not doubled. But since I only use it for short hip carries I always have an arm around him and he's only in it for a short time. It's great for what I use it for, getting from car to library  (where he crawls around) or grocery store  (he prefers to ride in the cart). Plus it's small and easy to bring even when you think you don't need a carrier.
