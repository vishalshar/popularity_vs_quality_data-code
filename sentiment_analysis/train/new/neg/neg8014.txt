The pros: The color is great! It is very comfortable for the baby - he actually smiles really big every single time I put him in here. It has a very narrow profile so it helped me get three seats in the back seat of a sedan. I love the strap height adjuster in the back. It makes it super easy to raise the strap height as they grow without having to take the straps apart. The canopy is nice and large and provides a lot of coverage from the sun.The cons: The handle is very difficult to adjust. The buttons are super hard to push down in order to tip it into a different position. I struggle with it every single time, and my wrists and hands were really sore when we first got the seat. The seat is heavy and awkward to carry a baby around in - though I think all bucket seats are like this, which is why I don't often carry them around in the seat. The buckle is a puzzle piece, so you have to piece it together before putting both pieces into the crotch part of the buckle. This is really ridiculous as the only reason for it I can figure out is that it is preventing the child from being able to buckle themselves into the seat - it still releases just as easily. I'm not sure why we would want to prevent baby's from buckling themselves in, and none I know of would ever master this skill while still in this seat anyway, so every time I have to do the annoying puzzle piece buckle I wonder what they were thinking with that one. Also, the base doesn't fit in my car very well. It seems to sit not level from left to right and I try adjusting it all the time with no success. Without a pool noodle it sits very upright and there wasn't enough room to adjust the base so that didn't happen. With a pool noodle it sits at a better angle, but I'm having the off level issue then. This is probably specific to my car (a Saturn L300) and the fact that I have to have the seat outboard instead of in the middle.
