While, yes, its a pretty print, the sheets themselves are very thin and scratchy. Not worth the money I paid for them at all. They feel super cheap. I can only hope they get softer with time and washing. As is, I wouldn't lay by newborn on these rough sheets. I also don't think they will hold up long either, as they don't look very well made at all.
