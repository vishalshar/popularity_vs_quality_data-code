I have ordered this product twice, both times received the multi-purpose scissor, which is a much cheaper product. Not sure if ToysNGames or whoever sent it is hoping people don't notice it is the wrong item or if it is a general mixup, but it happened TWICE in a row, despite me sending them a message with my order number and explaining to please send me the nail scissor. Be cautious, I have order this twice and have still to receive the correct item.
