I got this because our old single stroller broke, and i'm expecting another baby; have a girl who will be 14 months when the next one comes.  I wanted something light, easy to fold (to take on trolley or bus when needed, and also get up and down the steps to our house), and easy to push with 2 kids.  This is fine to fold up and unfold.  But that's the main good thing.  It's heavier than i'd like; I find it pretty difficult to get up the steps, but maybe that's partly because I'm pregnant.  The thing that annoys me about it most so far is that it does not push well on the sidewalk: it's always veering off to one side, and my wrists ache after even a fairly short time of trying to push it.  Also, I've tried pushing it both with just the little one in front, and with both little one and 43 pounds of 5 year old in back; both pretty difficult, tho' the latter is near-impossible these days (maybe would be ok for a non-pregnant person on flat ground).  Another concern is that hte jump seat requires a fairly sturdy and tall child; I don't think my middle daughter will be ready for it by the time the new one is here, her legs nowhere near hit the ground and it doesn't seem safe at all; not sure what the ideal age gap is for this stroller, and wish they had posted some guidelines about height and age for each of the two seats.  So: overall, not very happy with this purchase.  Hope to get some use out of it, but I suspect I'll end up getting some kind of jogging stroller instead, for pushability.UPDATE: MY KIDS ARE NOW two and a half, and almost four.  Our other stroller, a city mini, broke, so we have been using this.  The kids argue about who gets to sit nearer to the pushing adult.  I find it a total nightmare to push on sidewalks.  Pretty much still hate pushing it.  Trying to decide if I can afford a new stroller.  This one really really hurts my wrists, back, everything.
