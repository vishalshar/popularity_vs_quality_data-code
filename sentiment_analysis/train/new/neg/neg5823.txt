We bought this rain cover for our Baby Trend Deluxe Tandem stroller because we were going to Disneyworld and knew we would get rained on at some point during the trip. It didn't fit exactly right-had to pull it pretty hard to get it over the handle on the back and it ripped at the seam. It served its purpose though-it kept the stroller and the boys dry.It was also next to impossible to fold up into a small space again-I folded and squished it into a canvas bag that I strapped onto the back of the stroller. I have since kept it hanging there on the back of our stroller for days when we are caught out in unpredictable weather.The shield works great to keep high wind off the boys' faces, but in serious wind, it catches air from underneath and takes flight. The straps that supposedly secure it to the stroller do not fit the Baby Trend Deluxe that I have.Overall, we have gotten our money's worth from it, even though it doesn't fit perfectly.
