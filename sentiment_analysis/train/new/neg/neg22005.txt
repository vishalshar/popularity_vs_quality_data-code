I like Eddie the Elephant less than several of the other animals in the Lamaze Play and Grow line. Most of them have an array of wonderful, bright colors that really capture infants' attention. Eddie's big pale purple face is a lot more muted and less compelling, except for his creepily enormous eyes (much larger than the other animals' eyes). The toy has interesting doo-dads hanging from the soft body. Hence, like other members of the family, it is huggable while having harder plastic pieces dangling off that the child can grab or chew on. The family is great for an infant, but this particular member is so-so.
