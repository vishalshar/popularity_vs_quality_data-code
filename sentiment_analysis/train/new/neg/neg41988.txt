I don't know the brand anymore but our original mattress protector was organic and from BRU.  It is very thick and works great.  It was starting to rip at the corners from over 2 years of use so I wanted an extra.  This one is decent.  Its VERY thin and also don't seem to absorb/protect the mattress as well as my original one but we plan on upgrading to a twin bed in the near future so it will for now as a backup.
