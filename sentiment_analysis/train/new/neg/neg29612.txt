I have been using these breastshield for 3 months now with poor results and I just realized why they do not work as the original medela ones, the reason is theyhave the hole where you attach the tube on top of the cylinder, instead all of the original one them on the bottom. The suction seems weeker due to this and also the neck of this breastshield is almost 3/4 inch longer. Picture on the right is an original 21 mm medela breastshield, picture on the left is the 19mm sold by Maymom.
