Love the various textures on this lovey as well as the size. We received one of these as a gift, and I purchased a second one via Amazon so that tragedy doesn't happen if the other one is lost. However, the one I received doesn't look just as pictured. It is similar, but has blue cord around the edges rather than the blue fabric on the front. So, it's not going to pass as the original lovey we wanted, which is disappointing.
