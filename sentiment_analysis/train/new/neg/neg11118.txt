This holds a lot of stuff but ripped when I put it on and tightened it. Perhaps I tightened it too much. I safety-pinned it back together and it's working. I wish it had another support strap in the middle as it gaps away from the back of the seat encroaching on my children's foot/knee/getting into the car space. I might add another strap to rectify this. I will have to keep an eye on the ripped strap too and make sure the safety pin holds until I have time to sew it back and reinforce it. I still like the product and it's helpful. I would recommend that if you get this, leave the bottom strap loose so it won't rip.
