These were rated well in a magazine. so I got them recently for my son.  They are cute, and definitely well made/durable.  However, they are difficult to grip and there are only 2 different rattle sounds, not 3 as advertised or expected.  My 5 month old is not able to grip these and play with them independently.  Also, the colors are a bit blah, so they don't attract his attention just yet.  I see them becoming a great imaginative play toy down the road, but for right now, our cat is more interested in them than the baby.
