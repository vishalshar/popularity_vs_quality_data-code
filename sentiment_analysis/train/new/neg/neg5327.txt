We have purchased 2 sets of this playmat. The first set was wonderful and I have no complaints as to the quality of the product. My complaint is that in the second set we purchased, the number of each of the colored center circles is not consistent with the picture so I cannot match the pattern of the new one and the old one to combine them. There should be 4 pieces of piece, in each color (4 outer squares, 4 large circles, 4 medium circles and 4 inner circles, in dark brown, light brown, yellow and blue). The second set I received has 2 yellow medium circles, 6 yellow inner circles, 6 light brown medium circles and 2 light brown inner circles. I would like to get the other 2 yellow medium circles and the other 2 light brown inner circles so that I can combine the two sets that I have.
