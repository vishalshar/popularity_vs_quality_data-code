I'm giving this set 3 stars because the carseat isn't bad.  The stroller is nothing but a nuisance.  For starters, getting the carseat locked into the stroller is a giant pain in the butt.  Both my husband and I have broken out into sweats trying to get the seat perfectly aligned with the brackets, and then once it's in, most of the time you don't know it's together because it doesn't make any kind of click to indicate success.  Taking the carseat out of the stroller requires you to use BOTH thumbs on each side of the seat, pressing down on the buttons, and then lift.  Seems unnecessary to us, and often you don't have both hands free.  You have to drop whatever you're holding, including keys, to release the seat.  The stroller has no shock absorption whatsoever.  Our baby became motion sick during our first walks in this stroller.  Finally we switched to a baby carrier and wore her on our walks instead (until buying a new stroller).  This stroller can't roll over a simple crack in the sidewalk without making a THUD.  So for a normal sidewalk in a neighborhood, that's a lot of thuds!  Heaven forbid there would be a raised slab of cement - the stroller can't get over it at all and the handle bar would ram right into my gut.  That was pleasant when I was recovering for a c-section.  The basket opening is in the front of the stroller, which isn't a huge deal, but it's annoying.  All of these issues combined add up to it being a really crappy stroller.  For the money, I'd advise buying the City Mini, which is what we recently purchased and love, and buying the carseat of your choice and the attachment brackets for the Mini.
