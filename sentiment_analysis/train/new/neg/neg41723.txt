I loved the spoon. All bendy. One of my twins would sometimes sleep off while eating, and because of the material the spoon is made from, i had no qualms getting food into his mouth. Its so soft , so i prod his mouth and teeth open with it.It was really lovely at first.However, we are down to our last spoon out of 5, and its just been 4 months of use ie each spoon was useful to us for about 2 months. The back gets all scaly n begins to peel off. Quite annoying. So definately wont get this again. Sad
