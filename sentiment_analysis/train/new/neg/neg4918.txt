I am glad I got this deal on the be all bag, which I think is discontinued by Ju Ju Be.Pros:Nice looking, material is great, love the shoulder strap which is made from the same material as the bag, unlike almost every other diaper bag out there with the straps that ruin your clothes. Not heavy.Cons: 1- does not hold much which is a pro and con at the same time, basically it holds everything I need for one baby except a thick blanket, which we definitely need. 2-The mommy pocket is unusable, if you put stuff in it other than things like napkins and coupons, it will bulk up and if its too stuffed the magnet will not close properly. 3- what annoyed me the most is that it is not easy to clean as they claim it to be, I got a light color and after one quick trip in the car I found a small stain, no problem right ? Jujube claim their bags to be wipe-able with baby wipes. Not in my case ! I used every baby wipe and boogie wipe I have, then ended up rubbing it with sponge and soap, still, its there, and the fabric around it is not the same ! Needless to say, no wipe has worked on any other stain I got on it so far !Overall I do not regret it, I would from now on get jujube bags whenever they are in sale, and in a dark color ! Yet I plan on getting more jujube bags because I love the material its made of. You need a bigger bag if you have more than one kid and/or if you are going on a plane or a long trip.
