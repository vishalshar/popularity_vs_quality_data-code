Worked for about two measurements (one of which was in warning level), then promptly got itself into a state where it no longer responded to changing settings or taking temperatures. Spent an hour reading and re-reading directions, desperately trying anything. We had a regular thermometer as well, thank goodness.Promptly returned for refund, Amazon obliged w/ gift cards which I'm okay with.
