It's cute and it doesn't have that smell a lot of people have been stating; but it doesn't stick to the bottom of my son's tub. It just floats. We tried wetting the tub before trying to get the suction cups to stick, we've drained it and dried it --still no success. But since it's a pretty big mat, he manages to sit on it the whole time so that it doesn't continue to float.
