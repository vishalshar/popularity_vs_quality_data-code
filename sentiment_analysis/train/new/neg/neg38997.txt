I loved this system at first. Good for about the first 3 months. It doesn't read ounces correctly as you can see from the pictures, 2 oz in it reads as almost 3 oz in a solid container. And don't you dare ever drop it, the nipple will pop off and all your precious liquid gold will go everywhere. Not for infants feeding themselves that might throw the bottle. Also the bottle warmer takes for ever, 12+ minutes for a frozen 4 oz bag, not the amount of time you want to deal with a screaming hungry infant.
