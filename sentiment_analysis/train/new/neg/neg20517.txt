This swing is flat, so your baby is laying down, looking straight up. This works for our 7 week old, but when she's a few months old, she'll want to look out at the world, out up at the ceiling. Also, the mobile is very difficult to attach and the little toys face the opposite way from baby. This is very strange to me and my husband and I both tried to fit it the opposite way, but it only attaches with the toys facing away from the baby.
