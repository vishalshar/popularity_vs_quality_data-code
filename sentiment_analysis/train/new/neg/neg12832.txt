For an "Eco-friendly" product, I expected 100% eco-friendly materials.  The tag states "Made in the USA of imported and domestic fabric" and says the shell is 70% Viscose from Bamboo and 30% Organic Cotton, BUT it also lists the lining as being "100% PUL (Polyurethane Laminate)."  On Amazon, the description states the bib "grows with your baby into toddler stages."  For a tiny toddler, perhaps that is possible, but the neck area seems rather small and does not have any give / elasticity, so I'm not sure how much room to grow is there.  There are arm holes, but then the back is open, and the material basically only covers the shoulder blades and the neck where the snaps are.  There are only two snaps spaced about a centimeter apart, giving the bib its limited amount of adjustability.  The bib feels very thick (probably the polyurethane lining packed inside the cotton shell), and the seams and overall design seem to be quite sturdy.  If for some reason you wanted to hide the picture on the front, the bib would work as a "reversible" bib, with no design on the inside and a tag sticking out (in addition to the tiny side tag seen in the Amazon picture).
