I bought this thinking I would definitely need it to separate babies' socks...but it's really unnecessary. It just hangs next to his changing table and could probably be more useful if I remembered to separate his socks in it. Use your money on more important items. If you're preparing for a baby, I created a comprehensive list of must have baby registry items for the first three months. Just search for "All Moms Are Perfect" in google. It's in the preparing for baby section.
