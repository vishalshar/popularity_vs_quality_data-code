I bought this product along with a Ju Ju Be BFF and the Be Quick. After spending hours looking through the many, many wallets on here, I picked this one off of the youtube video by littledudesanddivas.com. I needed something that could fit easily in both the BFF mommy pocket and the be quick. It had to me more organized with more space while not bulky. The video portrayed this wallet being THE wallet, it even could fit a phone!Not so much.Pros:Lots of storage/slots- I have 9 cards and 7 buisness cards in there with no overlappingHolds it shape for the most partClear ID windowFits into mommy pouch and quick very wellI can clip a pen nicely inside the creaseCons:Very slick (Slides right out of hand with no place I could put a wristlet)Some slots are TOO snugChange part can get very bulky.I would not be able to close it with one hand (baby in the other)Even with not that much in there, I could not fit my iphone 4 into it.Overall, it will due, but not what I was expecting from the hype about it.
