Its a great idea but that back pack in the picture is not a regular size back pack, its like a toy 6" long back pack, those clips would never hold a real back pack.  This is for really light duty toys.  If you even are wondering, "Will it hold this I wonder?"  the answer is no.  It sucks at holding anything large, even if its light and nothing heavy...I repeat, it will not hold an average sized stuffed teddy bear.  Once a person is able to finesse it on, it will probably fall and your kid surely wont be able to hang it up again after it took you five minutes of beggin it to stay.  Of the 20 or so items I wished to hang it is securing maybe half of that...stuff that really could have just as easily been put in the closet...but whatever...
