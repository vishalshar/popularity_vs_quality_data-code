This pillow is  worth it for the price. This pillow is not a really Boppy pillow.  I owned real one years ago when I had my first child. It work the same way, but the only thing different is  it very hard from the  original pillow. I initially bought this for surgery for my butt to help not sitting on anything except the edge of the pillow for my flight and driving needs. This pillow did not even fit in the seat flying home. It very big and hard compare to the Boppy. I don't even use it for sitting. Even though I'm a very small person. This pillow wasn't working for my needs. I just use it now to side sleep as a regular huggable pillow. I will  use  it if I have another child to help  support the baby when feeding time. It definitely a good pillow if you are using it for baby purposes.
