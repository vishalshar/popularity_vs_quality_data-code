I just received this diaper bag today and I'm a little disappointed. I ordered the bag in slate/citron because it looked so cute online but after seeing it in person, I'm not as in love with it as when I ordered it. I'll start out by saying that I love the color combination, the size seems great, and I really like the shape of the bag. It looks more like a nice handbag instead of a diaper bag and that's really what I was going for. The buckles and zippers seem fine and I like all the pockets. I love that the handles are adjustable as it' will be nice hooking it to the stroller if I need to. Now, finally with my disappointment.... It's the lining! The fabric that I thought was so cute and contemporary is super cheap looking. It's practically see-through because it's so thin. In fact, they attached the top magnetic snap by sewing it into the lining with another sturdier fabric underneath and the lining is so thin that you can see the sturdier fabric through the lining because it's RED. They didn't even use something light colored. It sort of makes it look discolored, like there's already this orangish colored stain in the fabric or something.Overall, I am so happy with all the other features I might decide to just keep it but the tag on the bag says "high-quality" and I just don't agree with that.
