I bought this toy for my 6 month old. There were a few problems with it. 1) The plastic is hard! He has clunked himself in the face a few times and it left a mark! 2) The keys don't stay on the link very well and 3) My son likes to teeth and bite on the white part that the music comes from. Problem is is that when the saliva goes into the holes where the music comes out from, it warps the music. At first I thought it needed new batteries, but the toy was wet on the inside and it speeds up the music and singing and sounds like Minnie Mouse on helium!All in all, not a very well thought out plan for a toy! :-(
