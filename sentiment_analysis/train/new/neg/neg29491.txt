The concept of the pads are great.  However, product execution was not done very well.  While it varies from pad to pad, the amount of lanolin seemed decent.  Even the main material of the pad, the portion that contains the lanolin, feels comfortable.  The problem for me was that the size of the pads and/or the material around the outer edges.  The material around the edges of the pads was very uncomfortable in that it's too scratchy.  It feels like paper and would have been better if it was the same as the material of the pad.  The size of the pads also seem small (I'm ~42DD) because of the scratchiness.  Perhaps if the pads were larger it wouldn't be as much of a problem of it a different material was used all together. I stopped using them and instead use another disposable brand all together & just add lanolin myself as needed.
