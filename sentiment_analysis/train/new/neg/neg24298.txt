This is a horribly annoying monitor. It has an amazing amount of static. The only way to hear my child is to turn the volume high and only then I might be able hear her through the static interference. The red lights are always illuminated, no matter if my child is talking or not, so clearly they are not doing their job either. My 8 year old Graco works much better.
