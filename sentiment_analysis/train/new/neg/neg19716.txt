I bought this pump in addition to my Medela instyle so that I could have a pump I leave at work.  I LOVE my instyle so I wanted to stay with the same brand but not splurge for a second instyle and felt confident with the large amount of rave reviews on this pump.  ...I can not WAIT to throw this thing in the trash.  It its not nearly as powerful as the instyle.  I have to crank it all the way up every time and still have to work hard with hand manipulation to get anything worthwhile out.  With all the same factors considered, i get about half the volume in a pumping session as I do with my instyle.  This pump also has the most irritating vibration to it.  With every pump it vibrates like a slow torturous tickle.  Some days I just can not handle the feeling of this pump and get by with hand expression alone.  To top everything off, after 5 months of weekday use, this pump has lost all suction.  I've tried troubleshooting everything, replacing parts, membranes, valves, tubes... It just doesn't work anymore.  Now I get to throw this torture device in the trash and purchase a second instyle like I should have done from the start.  So much frustration and wasted money...
