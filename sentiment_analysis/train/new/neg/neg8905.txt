there was no size dimentions listed in product details.....the scale is.. really way too small for a clock you would want to put nest to the bed and use everyday.......,but the main problem I had with it was that the manufacturer didn't tell you it is necessary to ALSO purchase an adapter so that the plug can be used in a us outlet....this adapter cost $20.00 at Radio Shack....the whole clock was only $9.99.....so this I found totally unacceptable
