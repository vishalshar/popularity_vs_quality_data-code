I recently headed off to Europe with my pump and original ac adapter.  While in France, my original died (how convenient!).  My husband sent this adapter over since it would work with the European outlets (voltage).  I have to say, it did get the job done while I was gone for the month.  It did not, however, compare in power to the original 9v Medela that came with the pump.  So, if you use this one... yes, it will run the pump and work, just don't be ready for it to work like the original that came with the pump if you owned one of those previously.  Maybe it doesn't always happen.  I see mixed reviews here.  I, however, have to agree with those that mentioned the awkward power cycles and the voltage differences.
