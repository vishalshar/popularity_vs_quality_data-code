Like other reviews have said the item does not lay flush against the wall. Screwed in all the way it wiggles a lot. Also, you can kind of see it in the picture, but tow maters back end is superimposed on his face. Whoever printed these was not paying attention. You wouldn't really notice it unless someone pointed it out so I'm still giving a second star. It will do for now I guess but I would not recommend it
