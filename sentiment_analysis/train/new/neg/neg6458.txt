As soon as I opened the package, I got an extremely strong chemical smell.  But, I still cleaned my tub properly and let the tub dry completely before installing these stickers.  I waited the 8 hour period to allow the sticker to dry and my bathroom still had a chemical smell.  So then I filled the tub with hot water and soap to hopefully get rid of the smell, and drained and filled it again.  I tested out the slip protection before giving my child a bath and I almost slipped immediately.  These stickers do not provide any slip protection and they smell very strongly of plastic/glue.  It's a really cute concept and I was hopeful they would work, but I'm incredibly disappointed.  I wish I read the 1-star reviews before purchasing this product.
