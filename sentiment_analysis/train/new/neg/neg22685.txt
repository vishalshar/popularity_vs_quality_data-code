My wife and I are parents of 2 twin newborns who suffer from acid reflux. It was suggested to try this product - looking at it, we were skeptical about initially purchasing it.  As any good parent would, we washed it upon arrival before trying it out.  We put our baby on it. Immediately, we could see her discomfort, and the straps on it and the look on her face on this hard "pillow" made it look more like she was going to execution on death row than have a good nights sleep.  We tried to repackage, and being working executives, tried twice to return this product at the post office (if you want to return, you have to pay$40 in postage) and get it back to them in a short amount of time.  They know they have an inferior product that does not work, discouraging returns by having you pay for postage and limiting the time to return it.  I did return it, accused of using the product (which was used for 3 minutes at best) and they kept the product and my money and probably resold it.  What worked best was the Fisher Price snugabunny - they slept well.  Buy the Fisher Price snugabunny - don't buy this - you'll be stuck with junk, which they do not stand by and clearly know does not work discouraging you from sending it back by offering a small window and charging a restock fee, and paying for postage."
