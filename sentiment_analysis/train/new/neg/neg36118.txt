Gave as a Baby Shower gift and "visited it" less than a year later.  One of the layers of plywood base that touches the floor had separated (~one inch).  If the house had been flood with water, I would have understood, but there were no envirnomental reasons why that should have happened.  I went out and bought wood glue and a clamp and fixed it; allowing it to dry overnight.  The plastic tray did not sit in it's position as I had hoped, I couldn't tell if it were part of the design or a defect.The recipient loved it, I did not feel the same way.
