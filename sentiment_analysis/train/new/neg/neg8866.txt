These bibs are worth the peace of mind in that the aren't made of PVC but they definitely are expensive and I find that they get mildewed easily.  I had previously bought some non-pvc bibs at my local HEB and these were cheaper and outlasted two sets of these bibs....haven't been able to find any since then, which is why I bought these Bumkins again.
