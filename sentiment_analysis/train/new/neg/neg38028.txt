We bought this last May, son was born in June, so been using it for about 8 months, and about 2 months ago, the screen started getting glitchy/flickering. It got progressively worse, and now the screen suddenly goes white. It comes and goes, but the longer the have the video "on", the quicker the screen lightens then whites out.The batteries are horrible, also. Over time, it's gotten to where it holds a charge for less and less time.I have noticed about the lag like people are saying, I mean, it got the job done, while it worked properly. But now it is failing. I feel like after 8 months of use, this should NOT be happening, seems ridiculous, especially since we paid almost $100!  I have an email to summer infant company, but I'm not sure if they can help me or if I need to contact amazon. Maybe if they read this review, someone will contact me...? We shall see.
