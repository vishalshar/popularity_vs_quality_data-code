I read probably 40 reviews on this stroller before buying, and ultimately chose it over the twin Combi and twin Maclaren because of the good price and good reviews. Unfortunately I had to return it because of some major flaws that I had not anticipated (having never owned a double stroller before). I would definitely save your money on this one and pay a little more for a better quality stroller.PROS:--The 5-point harness is AWESOME. No arms to pull through loops--just unhook baby and pull out!--Good colors, good quality materials. Overall this stroller is very cute.--The storage baskets underneath are really easy to get stuff in and out of. Very convenient.CONS:--The biggest problem is the stroller handle bars. It is too close to the frame of the stroller, so if you are tall you have to walk closer to the stroller to hold it, which means that your long legs are going to step on the center wheels every time you take a step. SO ANNOYING.--You can NOT push this one-handed. If you want to talk on your cell phone, take a picture, or send a text, good luck doing it without having to pull over and stop. I just hate that!--The awnings are completely worthless, but you probably already know that if you've read other reviews. Don't even bother to attach them onto the frame because you get the same sun shade without them on.--The wheels are wobbly on pavement and sidewalks, definitely feels "cheap" when I'm pushing it. NOT an easy gliding stroller unless you are on hardwood store floors (inside). If you are in a store, then I agree with the review below that it "turns on a dime"--on all other surfaces you have to work hard to push/turn it.
