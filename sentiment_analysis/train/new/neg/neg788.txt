Upon recieving this frame everything appeard fine until you put the picture and and realized it had a discrepency.  The frame was made upside down from the only way your were allowed to put the picture in.I contacted the seller, who said they would credit me the $ paid and send me another frame.  Which would have been nice except I never recived either the credit or the new frame.  Very disappointing.
