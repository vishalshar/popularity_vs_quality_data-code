Like many other parents, I was excited about the moving waves appearance for my child. The first night everything worked great, but every night since has been a disappointing static image. For about half the cost I could have purchased an item like that, but I spent more for the motion. After reading the reviews from other parents I took the risk assuming lumitusi would stand behind its product. Before making this review I had emailed the company but I never received a response, disappointed I have to give this product a three star review. It projects a nice room filling image, but does not live up to its claims.
