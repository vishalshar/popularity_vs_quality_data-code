My son shows little interest in this. He has another "chewy" bracelet that he likes, but he lost interest in this one quickly. Also, it made a TERRIBLE squeaking sound the few times that he did use it. I was hoping that this would help us stop him from chewing on his sleeves, but this was not the answer.
