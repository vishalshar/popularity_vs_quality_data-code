After using the ISIS manual for a few months, I was quite confident that the ISIS IQ Duo would be a better product for me to use when I'm pumping at work. It does sounds very attractive to have an electric-powered pump that also functions as a manual pump when you just can't find power options. However when I opened up the box, I couldn't locate the parts for the manual pump! and there were obviously no spare parts included at all! what the...?It would have been 5-stars if Philips Avent delivers what they promised. Cos when I flipped through the instruction manual, they conveniently REMOVED the part where it says the pump can be used as a manual pump therefore they don't even include the manual parts anymore without telling anyone! I wished I could have known this earlier and I would have went ahead with purchasing a Medela PIS instead.. Such a big disappointment.UPDATE on 1st June 2010:I was able to get the manual parts from the Philips Avent guys at my local area after I probe them about these parts that was listed on their website. Even so, it was after I pressed them hard and kept askng them for an answer on why they lst these parts on their website and then didnt include it in the box.
