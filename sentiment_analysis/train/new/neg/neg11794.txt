I was thrilled when I first found these diapers - all in ones are easy to use, and the bumGenius newborn is adorable on those tiny bottoms.Pros: - The ease of an all-in-one, especially if you are newbie to cloth diapers, or if your little one has other caregivers. - Nice snug fit for those tiny bodies.Cons: - My daughter outgrew the absorbency capability before she outgrew the size.  Since it's an all-in-one and it's so tiny, it's difficult to add inserts for extra absorbency. - No newborn cord cut-out.  My daughter's cord fell off very early (4 days) so this wasn't a huge issue, but these diapers still irritated her belly button for several days after the cord fell off.Overall?I only had three of these, and they were my go-to diaper the first month when I wanted something "cute" if we were going to be somewhere where people would see her diapers.  But she outgrew the absorbency quickly, and there are better options out there for sizing and newborn cord issues.  I would buy these again for the cute factor if money weren't an issue, but if you're trying to be penny-wise, keep looking!  (My favorites are the Softbums Echo).
