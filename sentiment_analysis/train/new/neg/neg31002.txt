It's cute but the whole Velcro system is just weird. It doesn't Velcro evenly since it's thin and at least 12" long on each side. The Velcro comes apart immediately as soon as the kid sits in it, making it useless to keep your car seat actually clean. I have to safety pin it all along the Velcro just to hold it together, which makes it a royal pain to take off and clean. The Velcro doesn't lay flat and bunches up and makes my daughter uncomfortable. They should have used zippers or snaps, anything but that Velcro. Save yourself the headache of trying to bribe this thing to fit and get a different kind.
