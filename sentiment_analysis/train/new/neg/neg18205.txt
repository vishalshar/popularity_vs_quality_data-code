This is a very cute necklace and I get compliments every time I wear it. No one realizes it is a teething necklace. The problem with it though is as soon as my baby started chewing on it she was getting pieces off of it. She hasn't gotten a splinter from it but she is definitely chewing the tail off. I'm sad that its coming apart because she really likes it. She is 11 months old and has 8 teeth, I know she is a pretty hard biter (she has gotten my fingers pretty good) This might be better for a baby that doesn't have as many teeth or is just starting to teeth.
