My son loved the mobile--he was squealing with delight when I first got it put on his crib.  The fun didn't last, though, as the motor stopped working after just a couple of uses.  The music and lights still worked, but the mobile top would not turn.  So disappointing.  I am hoping they will help me or send a replacement.  It's a good concept--especially for object permanence, but it is poorly made.
