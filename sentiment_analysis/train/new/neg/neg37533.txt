The mattress is very supportive with the high coil count. However, the shipping carton is very thin and flimsy cardboard that is not acceptable. The mattress was delivered with one corner damaged and a hole in one facing. After removing the mattress from the carton I discovered that one corner of the mattress is damaged and distorted. The mattress facing where the hole was is also damaged.
