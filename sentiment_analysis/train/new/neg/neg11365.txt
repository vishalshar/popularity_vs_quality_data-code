This product is amazing and so addictively useful, they are not just for toddlers anymore.  Ok, so we need them, BUT...The product is great, BUT kids at school lose them.  Then it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to find the lids (lid top covers-- "snap-over lid") because they call the mid-level trap the "covers", so to replace the real covers call it the "snap-over lid". Good luck.And don't expect to find Mossworld.  All sorts of places sell their stuff as if they are the real place.  (See sale of only one lid by one vendor for $18+ on Amazon.) You can end up spending a lot of money and time.THEN, when you finally find a place to buy the actual covers, you have to buy through some company purporting to be the company that makes them, but to do so, you have to join their Facebook page.  Really?  Ok, in the end, I did it as a guest and paid $7 to ship 3 light pieces of plastic.  It gets COSTLY.Can't I just get the covers from Mossworld?  And get them reasonably.  Or can't they market something that joins the over-lid to the base so the schools don't keep throwing out the top lids which look, though have a different size than a take-out cover?
