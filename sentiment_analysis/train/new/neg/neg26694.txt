two ways zipper is a very good design while you have to change diaper for the baby. However, it would be better if they make the blanket bigger.  my girl is 7  months old and 65cm tall, and the blanket is designed for babies from 9-12 months, i don't think she will fit into it when she reaches 9 months old base on the rate she's growing.  so that means i have to get a bigger after just two months.  another thing is when the baby is moving during sleep, the blanket will easily move up, that may make the baby's neck sweat
