November 25, 2011 update:I have dropped my review from the original 5-star last January, to today's 2-star.  After 10 months of use, things about the monitor are horribly wrong.  First, the battery included with the monitor quit on us about 4 months ago.  Won't hold a charge anymore.  The instruction manual said to contact Motorola for replacement.  So I did.  THE BATTERY IS UNAVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE.  So Motorola sells a baby monitor with a rechargeable, replaceable battery but they no longer carry the actual battery.  I even Googled the battery and I can't find even a 3rd Party selling it.Second, I commented originally that the parents' monitor needed a larger footprint.  This has become such a annoyance.  Even in the light, even with us awake, the monitor is nearly impossible to stand.  It invariably will back onto its front or back.  It is nearly impossible to stand upright.Why still 2-stars instead of one?  While it has to remain plugged in, the monitor is an awesome monitor.  Clear, no snaps or pops.  We get incredible range within our home.  It still is very handy and used daily.January 2011 reviewI was surprised to find Motorola making a monitor.  You just don't see them in stores.  But knowing Motorola's rep with regards to handheld radios, I figured if Motorola was making a monitor, it must be pretty good.  It is.  We get good distance with the unit and more importantly get loud operation with no annoying blinky lights going off in the master bedroom as we sleep.Good looking monitor too.  My only drawback and it is minor, is that the parents' monitor needs a larger footprint.  It is a very tall unit for the size of its base.
