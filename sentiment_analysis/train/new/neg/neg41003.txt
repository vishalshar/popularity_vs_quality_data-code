Descent gate for our irregular space between the wall and banister. Like that it is adjustable and that it is mounted to the wall instead of held by pressure as with most child gates that our 2yr old has busted through. Enjoy that it swings open and can be placed out of the way, if needed, left opened against the wall. The latching system if using both eye hooks will definitely keep a young child from figuring it out (meaning that to open they have to push down on the top locking lever but then lift up to unhinge from the bottom eye hook, I doubt a toddle could do both pushing down and lifting to open gate). Over all satisfied with the purchase. Only giving a middle of the road rating due to the material. I wonder if it will stand the test of time since the top & bottom slats seem to be made of pine (a soft wood) with the vertical slats seem to be a sturdier material, but should last long enough for our purpose of deterring a toddler. I seen some people post about splintering but it's a unfinished wood, wood can splinter so finishing it should help with that.
