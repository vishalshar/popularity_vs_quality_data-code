I purchased the Sealy Sweet Pea 2-in-1 Maternity and Nursing Pillow after doing A LOT of research. I didn't want a pillow that would force my husband off the bed, but I wanted something that offered support, cushioned between my legs, and kept me on my side. I was so excited to try it out the first night. After staring at the picture and trying to position myself like the model, I grew frustrated.The pillow was WAY too big for my body. In fact, the between-the-legs support and tummy support were so hard and overstuffed, I kept falling onto my back. I am 15 weeks, 5'6" and about 138lbs, average sized. Bottom line, the pillow was tossed on the floor halfway through the night.I've been able to use it behind my back to prop myself up in bed or on the couch while watching tv. Maybe I'll be able to use it as a nursing pillow, although the inner "C" shape seems way too big to cradle an infant or fit snug around my tummy while breastfeeding.This pillow would probably so it's job better if they removed some of the stuffing between the legs to allow you to hug it closer.
