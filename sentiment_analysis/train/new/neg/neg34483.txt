We were giving this monitor as a gift since we have a two story house, with the thought that we can have one parent unit in our room and one downstairs for when the baby is sleeping. Well, it is great for downstairs, because I can hear him all the way in the kitchen at the lowest volume setting (the unit is in the livingroom), but the one that is in our bedroom is SOOOO loud that even on the lowest setting, we still have to wrap it in several towels to keep it from not rattling us from a dead sleep everytime the baby rolled over! Even after we put several towels on top of the child's unit, it is still excessively loud. I contacted the company and they said there is nothing that can be done to adjust the sound levels.
