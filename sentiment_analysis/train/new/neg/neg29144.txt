I have a love/hate relationship with these bottles.  I'm on the second baby now that I've used these bottles for.  On one hand, they really do simulate the breast, so I never had any problems with "nipple confusion" or whatever they call it when I went back to work.  And that was a big deal for me, especially with the second baby because my first baby got lazy with bottles and stopped wanting to nurse because the milk was harder to get out.  So in that respect, I think they're the best bottles for somebody who has a hard time nursing or who has trouble with their baby not wanting to stay at the breast.  However, these bottles have extra components that you have to clean and I've had a few of them start to leak and drip on me, which wastes my milk!  When I'm at work I work hard to pump my milk and the last thing I want is for a bunch of it to be dripping out the rim or be wasted by not getting squeezed back into the bottle properly.  Anyway, I'm still using these bottles for my 6 mo old (so clearly I've found good value in them), but I'm thinking it might be time to switch it up.
