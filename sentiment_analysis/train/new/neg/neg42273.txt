I saw these and I liked them so much that I bought 2, one for my daughter (2 years old) and my neice (3 years old). They were both so excited to see the seats and to take them out and fold and unfold them. I sent one home with my niece and I kept one in my daughter's diaper bag. The next time we were in public, I was excited to pull out my toilet seat! That is, until I tried to set her up on it.. the "nonslip pads" did not work, the seat when sliding around and ended up in the toilet! We tried it again on the toilet at home with the same results! Arggg she won't even sit on it anymore! I called to ask my sister how she liked hers and she said that her daughter won't sit on it because it slides around too much and it scares her. After spending almost $30 on 2, I would say skip it!
