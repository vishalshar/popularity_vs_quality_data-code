I received the clutch quickly but when I opened it I was kinda disappointing in the quality. The large black jewel was all scratched and dull looking, the  little rhinestones on the skull where covered in globs of clear glue so there was no shine or anything. It looks like someone did it fast and sloppy. As for the rest of the purse the shape and size is nice, I like the grain in the faux leather. I wear a ring size of 9 or 10 and the finger holes fit me comfortably. I am a crafty person so instead of returning it I ended up fixing the large jewel, by gluing smaller shiny jewels on it, completely covering it. Now it looks Awesome and Edgy and I get lots of compliments on it. I posted a picture in customer images. But honestly if I'm gonna buy something new, I shouldn't have to fix it.
