This bag seems to be durable(will see though, as I just started using it). But what is the point of using a bag if you need to take the wheels off to fit the stroller into the bag??? If travelling alone, you have to put the stroller into the bag long before coming to the aircraft otherwise you will hold a line behind you struggling with the bag and the stroller that fit snuggly!
