Like most parents, I researched car seats for ages before choosing the Safety First onBoard35 for my 3rd daughter. I wanted something that most importantly would be safe, have an extended rear facing limit, be comfortable for the baby, and comfortable to carry.Safety: as far as safety, this car seat has been brilliant.  It is not difficult to install and has an easy to read indicator to insure it s fitted properly.  I do find the car seat rides more upright than others we have used but it don't seem to bother my daughter.35 pound limit: my daughter fit in this well as an 8 pound 13 oz newborn and fits just as well with room to grow as a 24 pound 14 month old.Comfort for baby:  my daughter gets rather sweaty riding in this seat and seems to get uncomfortable on long journeys.  The padding is thin and she is quick to get indentations on her bottom and legs after a 30 minute journey.Comfort for parents:  Ths seat is more awkward to carry than other infant seats I have used.  There is no shape to the handle whatsoever and also no padding or grip.  This part although frivolous I found especially odd as the handle seems like it should have some type of grip which is missing. However, I contacted the company who say there never has been any grip.To summarise, if I could give this seat 3.9 stars I would, but it just isn't worth that 4th star to me. Safety wise it has proven a good seat which is the most important aspect.  The limited comfort for both child and parent is what I really dislike about this seat.  I would not go out of my way to recommend this seat to parents but I also would not recommend against it.
