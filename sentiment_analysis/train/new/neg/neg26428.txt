I purchased this potty chair for my 18 month old grandson. I am a caregiver to my grandson and it was time to start potty training. I thought this was a very cute potty chair, and I thought it would catch his interest since he has become very interested in animals. The potty chair itself was made very well, and it was sturdy, and it did get the attention of my grandson. BUT when he sat on it the pee guard was just so short and small. We didn't end up using this because I knew he would end up peeing right over the top of the guard. So we ended up returning it. I was disappointed because this was so cute. But I have discovered that many of the potty chairs we tried all had the same issue, has a short pee guard. It took us a while but we finally found one that worked for him. But the quality of this potty chair was very good.
