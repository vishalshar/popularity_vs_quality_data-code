We bought the Magic Moments Learning Seat for our 2 1/2 month-old son because he loves his Kick and Play Bouncer so much, and spends so much time in it.  We thought he may be in need of some variety.  Well, it IS a really cool toy, but not the toy wonder that the 4 1/2 stars it has been given would imply.  Don't get me wrong--he really loves to be in it, BUT:1) We had to exchange it once because of a faulty kick pad--the thing just wasn't working.  I know this is just the luck of the draw, but it does effect one's opinion of the quality of a toy.2) Even after getting a properly functioning seat, the kick pad is still not as sensitive as I would like it to be.  My son is a big-time kicker, and it seems as though the kick pad function works only right after the baby pulls at one of the toys.  It took him awhile to get this and frustrated him, as he was used to the super-sensitive Kick and Play.  I think he's finally getting it, though.  The good thing is that it has REALLY improved his ability to reach for things, 'cause he really wants to see that Magic Mirror light up!So, all in all, a good toy.  However, if you have a kicker like I have, I would recommend the Kick and Play first, and this to improve your baby's dexterity.
