Absolutely terrible  completely leaks out of the bottom of the bottle. The bottom and top both twist off and the bottom has open air holes to help vent the bottle for a good ventilation although the problem is the milk leaks right out even with the rubber cover over the bottom of it! Absolutely horrible does not keep milk in at all and  when I say it leaks out I don't mean a tiny leak hear and there I mean a whole bunch of milk comes out the bottom of it and before you know it within 30min to a hour the whole bottle is emptied out in your diaper bag or on your table or wherever you have the bottle at and caused tons of messes!!! I would not recommend this bottle to anybody EVER!!! It is the worst bottle I have ever bought although the nipple and top part seem to be very nice, but what good is it if it doesn't hold your milk!!
