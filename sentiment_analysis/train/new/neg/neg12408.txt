Pros:It is very attractive for boys and girls. I always got compliments when I had it on my son.The soothing effect was just OK which is why I gave it a 3 star.The first few days, my son would yank on it with all his might to try to get it off. I thought he was going to break it but he never succeeded.Cons:It slips off easily.  My son, who is 15 months old and on the chunky side, kept losing it. I think that a child who is skinny would not be able to keep this on.  It is the color of carpets and dirt so it is almost impossible to find.
