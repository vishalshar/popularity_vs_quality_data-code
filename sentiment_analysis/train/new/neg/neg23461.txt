My 1 year old got these for Christmas and they have already stopped going forward and they certainly go nowhere on carpet. They also feel really cheap, but strangely they were not cheap. Granted, he has pulled them back a few times in the last week and he has done the typical one year old banging, but what kid doesn't do this to toys, and what kind of company doesn't make toys to withstand this type of playing. I'd say if your kid is past the banging, abusing toys phase and you have only hard wood floors in your home, then these are the cars for you, but if not check out K's cars. He also got those for Christmas, and those are much better quality.
