Both brushes ripped on the first use. The big brush kept popping open to release the sponge. I have the same set that came in a six-bottle Born Free starter set and they lasted for 11 months. I was only replacing the original set because they were looking a little ragged. This set looks the same, but the quality is awful. Very very disappointing.
