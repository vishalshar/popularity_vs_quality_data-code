Purchased and received just before the holidays of 2011-2012. My husband did a good job of  putting it together. There are three problems I found when he completed.Although the design and size of the dresser/changing table is what I was looking for design wise, the materials used were subpar.They used woodlike material for the wood face material which covers the plywood.  This was the first and biggest issue. The wood face material scratches like tissue paper tears, contact paper is better than what they used. It's almost as if the wood design was spray painted on. If you nick it then instead of being a small scratch it's a white gash. I guess that's why they give you the wood fill pen because they know you will need it to touch them all up.The second problem was the knobs for the drawer, the screw hole on both the drawer and the knobs are too big. The screw comes out one of the knobs hole and also wriggles around in the drawers hole so it constantly comes off. I have to fill the hole with some wood filler.The third problem; the same top drawer that the messed up knob is on won't stay on the track, so everytime I pull the drawer open it falls off the track!This definitely was not worth me spending $260 on. I could have bought a cubby hole unit with canvas baskets from Walmart or plastic bins that were better quality.  At least then I know I would have gotten my moneys worth for what I spent. It just seems flimsy for the cost.  If it were regulary priced around $150 to $175 then I could feel that I got what I paid for and I would have expected the quality to be as cheap as it turned out to be.
