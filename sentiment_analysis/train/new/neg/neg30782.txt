In theory, this is a wonderful product.  However, I had two problems.To start, the product came with only one set of sheets, and Babies-R-Us did not sell the sheets.  I ordered some additional sheets from Arm's Reach, and they sent my order confirmation, containing my complete credit card number and expiration date, to me in an unencrypted e-mail.  I had to cancel the credit card.  I explained this to Arm's Reach and used a different credit card to purchase the sheets.The mattress was very firm and my son did not like to sleep on it.  If I could get him to fall asleep, sometimes I could transfer him to the co-sleeper without waking him, but I would frequently fall asleep before he would.When my son did fall asleep in the co-sleeper, he would scoot around, and sometimes his nose ended up pressed against the padded edge that was next to my bed.  This made me uncomfortable, but I figured that it was safer than having my son in the bed with me.Other than these three problems, I liked the co-sleeper.
