I like that the chair can be converted to a table and chair, however, I really do not think it was worth the price I paid, which was a bit higher than the price showing now. Chair is made of cheap plastic and the cover is a flimsy piece of fabric that fits over the back and does not attach anywhere else on the chair. This may actually be a good thing though considering that the tray is not adjustable and there is a large gap between the child and the tray. Much of the food falls in the gap and ends up in the child's lap, all over the restraint belts and the buckle, into the hole where the center piece goes and eventually ends up under the fabric seat part of the chair. It's nice that the cover can be washed and the belts can be also (If you can detach them from the chair), but I find that the cover and the belts end up needing to be washed after almost every use because all the food just falls onto the belts, the child and the chair cover. It would be a much better chair if the tray were adjustable so that the gap could be eliminated.
