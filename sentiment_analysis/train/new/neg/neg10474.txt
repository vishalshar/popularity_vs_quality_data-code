I already owned baby spoons, but I wanted a set with forks/sporks for my 13 month old daughter to practice with.Pro:Size of spoon/fork is perfect for her mouth. It gives her the right amount of food.The handle is easy for her to hold (the white sections are textured so there is extra grip).Cons:The handles are heavier than the spoon section, so if you set it down in a bowl, it will flip over and spill food.
