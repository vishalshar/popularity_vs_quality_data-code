Not very useful. Doesn't fit on my fisher price rainforest high chair - too small. Also, the corners curl up, so my 18-month toddler likes to flip up the entire mat. Gets food all over the place. The residue holder on the side doesn't quite do its job either. My son gets food everywhere. I find what works is the Jeep protective floor mat. I put it on my carpet and place my toddler in the middle with bowls of food. Because that mat is so large, it catches everything.
