I love Halo sleep sacks, but something has changed with the sizing since I purchased them for my first child in 2011.  Baby number two has been wearing two size mediums that I purchased in 2011 but never used (I took them out of the package and began using them about a month ago.  I asked for two more size mediums for Christmas, and the neck hole is gigantic.  Fully zipped, it easily slides over my son's head.  I worry it is a suffocation hazard.  Very disappointed.
