I thought this would be big enough to at least fit a book into. It is very small I'd say about the size of a womans hand outstretched in any direction. It is more for a younger child or some one who maybe only gives a small amount of candy. I could only fit one stuffed animal in here. Although I'm hoping to add more gifts on top maybe with some cellophane!! The look of the bunny is very accurate to the picture and is soft although I did see a few plush baskets at rite aid for half the price. Overall I will use this this year and see how the cellophane holds up.
