Not sure why this item got 4 stars. It's a sound machine, but the sound quality is terrible! No matter which sound effect you choose, the sound is fuzzy/muffled sounding. There's no clarity. Also, I noticed that it was rather quiet. It really doesn't turn up very loud. This unit needs better speakers and greater volume capacity.
