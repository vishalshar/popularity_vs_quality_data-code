This product caused our 5 month old to have her first allergic reaction.  We have used other diaper rash products, and they cause only minor improvement.  This caused huge red welts and screaming until we got her into a bath to get most of it washed off.  It was absorbed really quickly, so we've still got a pretty bad allergic reaction on our hands.
