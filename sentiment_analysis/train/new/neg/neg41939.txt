I make my daughter's baby food in batches and store the cubes in the freezer in ziploc bags, so for my purposes these little containers required more work on my part.  Here's how it breaks down:LIKES:-food cubes are super easy to pop out once frozen-price is good compared to other similar productsDISLIKES:-16 pieces to wash (bowls and lids), and you must use a basket to wash them in the dishwasher (otherwise they fly everywhere and the bowls upturn and collect dishwasher water and food bits)-the lids are a *pain* to deal with both to snap on, but especially to take off-you'll need a ton of these if you work in large batches like I do making clean-up a painI bought these containers thinking my daughter could barely eat 1 oz. of baby food in a sitting, so anything bigger would result in food waste.  Well, she was eating 4 oz. of food at every feeding after the second week of solid foods (and my baby is in the bottom 5th percentile for weight for her age).  I used the pots twice and then moved on to a container that froze food in 2 oz. portions.  The one I use is a silicone tray with a cover that holds 9 portions of food.  While popping the food out is much more of a struggle (squeeze, pull, twist, push for several minutes), the clean-up of two pieces is so much easier.
