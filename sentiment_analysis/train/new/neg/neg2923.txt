this is not the first time it happened to me, so i guess i am not learning my lesson. but, the one complaint i heard about this tricycle was that it squeaks. And, man, does it. it is so annoying...the bike is so cute otherwise and my son loves it. he doesnt mind the squeak, he probably likes it too. that guys throws stuff onto hard surfaces, just so he can get some noise.I (and my wife) hate the squeak; it is so loud and so annoying. I guess I need to open it and see if I can fix it somehow. I am not happy though. Love the trike but hate the squeak.If you are planning to buy this, dont. I know its cute and looks just like the thing your kid would love (and he/she would) but dont put yourself through the trouble. 2 months and you will be cussing and wondering why you didnt listen to the other guys on the review. I know i am.
