We searched for months for the right stroller. I just couldn't commit to spending so much on a modes stroller or britax.I finally just went with this one because it had all the features I needed. Love: how easy it is to change the direction of the seat from facing you to facing outwards. Also love how it handles. Easy to push in thick grass and uneven pavement. Big basket underneath.Not so crazy about:  the seat doesn't seem to catch fully when I position it laying back or forward. So when I put baby in it sometimes jerks back an inch or two. Not  ideal for a sleeping baby.This is a heavy stroller I can't just get it in and out with 1 hand.The carseat frame said it would fit my graco snugride 40 seat and it doesn't latch to it. However I was skeptical it would since it's the newer click  connect seat.What I really hate: you need two hands to open or close it. My old chicco stroller was easy to fold up or let out while holding the baby in one arm. This stroller not so easy but I'm learning to adjust to it.After a year of owning this stroller the canopy broke and won't attach to the frame correctly. Thought replacing it wouldn't be too bad however shipping for contour parts is slightly outrageous. I was going to replace the wheels as well because they aren't rolling as smooth anymore but it adds up to we'll over 50$ in just shipping costs.Overall: Its a decent stroller for the price. If you are looking for a stroller with multiple positions, a smooth ride and you're on a budget I would say this is a great option. But not for heavy use.*I will note that a lot of other reviewers said it was too tall for them I am 5'4 and its the perfect height not too low or high. If you're like 5'2 and under then yes it might be too high and the handle doesn't adjust. Wouldn't recommend.
