The concept is there but I think it needs a redesign.  I started letting my son play w/these at about 8-9 months.  I think the spoon part of it is WAY too shallow -  you can hardly hold anything on it - it needs to be deeper - more scooped.  But the curve & double sides are great - it just needs alittle work.
