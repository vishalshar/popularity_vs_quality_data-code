I find this changing pad cover to be poorly made. It arrived with many strings hanging loose and the cut outs for the straps are in a weird place. The fit to our changing pad is okay, but I think some of the other cheaper options on Amazon would have looked nicer. The material is soft and the yellow is a nice pale color.  I am planning on ordering a different one to replace this soon.
