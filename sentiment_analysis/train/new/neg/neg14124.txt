I had the classica ii for my son, which worked great! I ordered this one for my dd, now 3. I couldn't tell which side was which. Also, the cover is a cloth one, and given her diaper leaks, has been retaining smells even after cleaning off. The cover cannot be removed in order to wash. If you're worried about diaper leaks, order the one with the non-cloth cover.
