I got this to put on my daughter's lunchbox for Kindergarten. But she did not like it because she said they are too small, they are for babies...They look good and strong, but the case is very hard to open, even I had a hard time trying. She could not do it without help (she does have low muscle tone, and doens't have very strong hands).
