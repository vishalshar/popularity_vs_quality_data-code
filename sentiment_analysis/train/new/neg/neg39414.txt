I ordered this changing pad for a baby shower gift basket I was putting together, but I decided NOT to include it. The changing pad itself is very basic, CUSHIONED in plastic (not 'quilted' or lined for warmth in any way), and is a comparable size with similar pads. It is a very drab white, and also looks like something that was a maternity ward hospital gift (new moms and dads out there, you know exactly what I mean).The downside is that this is plain, ugly, and outdated looking. The upside is that this makes an okay replacement to an older pad, an extra to keep in the car or at daycare, and it's a decent alternative to disposable changing pads. NOT GREAT, but usable and just okay.
