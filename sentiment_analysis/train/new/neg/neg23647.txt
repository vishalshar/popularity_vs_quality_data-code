I had to purchase a different style of harnesses.  The lead/leash was a little short for us.  My 25 lb girl, I think would have had some trouble getting in.  Didn't try her though.  Great value for price.  I'm 5'9"  and needed more length to stand straight and walk with my 1yr olds.  Orange dots look almost reflective.  Shipping from China, takes awhile to arrive.  Small, cute backpacks- could hold snacks for the road.  I'm not unhappy, just needed something more to work as safety harnesses I could walk with my twins!
