I did not like the spoons at all. The head of the spoon is quite thick for me to feed a bigger baby. Also, it is so shallow to really contain anything in there for a little toddler to feed themselves without having it all spilled out. It feels like a sticky plastic. Their fork version are way better than the spoon version. Cannot even return them now because i already opened it. I do not recommend this product at all.
