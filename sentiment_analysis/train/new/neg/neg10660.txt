My daughter is 14months old 30 inches long and about 23lbs. It's a great fit for her size. She loves it, its alot more comfortable then her other high chair from walmart. I as the mother think its a good high chair. couple of things I don't like is the tray sits up close to the baby so if you have a bigger baby there might be a slight problem. The seat does recline back but the tray is still up really close. Another thing is there is no bar in the front to protect the baby when your taking off the whole tray. There are ways you can work around that though, just got to be creative like I have been. The seat pad is easy to wipe down for a quick clean up.  Easy to put together. Over all its a good product.
