The backing is flat, which makes it easier to remove from an outlet.  The prongs of the plug seem reasonably thick.  The best plug I have come across is the Toys R Us brand, which has a domed backing to make it much more difficult for a little one to pull out of a socket.  I did not return these, but the next time I buy plugs they will be from Toys R Us.
