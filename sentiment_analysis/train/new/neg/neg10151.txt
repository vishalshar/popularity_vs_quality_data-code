I have to say something about this stroller, before I bought a stroller I watched a lot of custom reviews and this one was like the best, everyone says how good it is so I bought it.After a long long long time waiting (I'm in China so it's not easy to get it) , this stroller finally came to my house. Well, I have to say it does not meet my needs and my expectations.First, the seat cannot face the parent, so once my 4 months old baby girl lie in it she cried out, because she cannot see my face! I tried to use the peekaboo canopy to calm her down but there came another problem.Second, the peekaboo canopy is really not so good, if you cover it, you cannot see your baby, if you uncover it, the sunshine will make the baby unable to open her eyes!Third, the brake makes a loud noise that it almost scared her everytime.Fourth, not suitable for a baby to use, I can see her head shake a lot, and that's when we walk on a really flat road! Cannot imagine what will happen if the stroller meet a bumpy road.Fifth, one-hand-fold is not so easy, well, folding is ok but unfolding is a disaster, you need to put it upside down and then bend and then step on it and then justify the front wheel......How can a mommy do it using one arm when she hold her baby in another arm?Well, anyway it's not as heavy as other all terrian stroller, I guess that's the only advantage?At last, I won't recommend it to parents whose baby is under 1-year-old. My suggestion is that buy an all-terrian stroller when the baby is very young and buy an umbrella stroller when the baby is older, that would be the best option.I tried to return it to Amazon but only found that the international shipping charge is more expensive than the stroller itself, so I have to keep it now, so sad.......
