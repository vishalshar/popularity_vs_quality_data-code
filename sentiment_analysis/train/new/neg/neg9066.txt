My 9-month-old son loves the jingle-bells, and kind-of likes those little cymbals (?) in the pink shaker. He will sometimes play with the little yellow spinner, but not for very long The green one is his least favorite because it's all plastic and barely makes any noise.The jingle-bells are kind-of loud, so that is one we only play with at home. Even though my review is luke-warm, I'd still recommend this product. It's not too expensive, and my son does seem to enjoy them overall.
