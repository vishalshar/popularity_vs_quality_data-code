I was really disappointed in these!  First of all the elephants face left, not to the right as pictured.  It sounds small, but facing left meant they were walking towards a corner, which looked odd.  Also, "soft pink" is very bright - think Pepto-Bismol.  Definitely not the color I had in mind.  And I was expecting light-to-medium gray elephants, but they were such a dark shade of gray that they blend into my darkly painted walls.
