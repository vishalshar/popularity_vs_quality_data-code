I was not satisfied with this product at all.  First of all it arrived damaged in the box and I am still awaiting a response of how my chair will be replaced- it has been one month already.  Also, the chair is not safe since it was poorly designed and not sturdy.  A child cannot lean back too much while rocking because the chair will fall backwards very easily. The base is not sturdy enough and causes the chair to tip over back which may cause injury to the child.
