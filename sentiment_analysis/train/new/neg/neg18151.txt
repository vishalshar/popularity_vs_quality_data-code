I purchased this item thinking this was a very cute play pen. However, I purchaed the play pen a couple of weeks ago and just assembled it last weekend only to find out parts are missing such as the storage shelf, bassinet, and the removable toy bar. I definetly want to get what I paid for and hoping they mail me the missing parts or send me a replacement. Our baby will be here soon and I thought this play yrad was going to have the items we needed but we are disappointed.
