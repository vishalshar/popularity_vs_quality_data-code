My son is 4 1/2 months old and 16 pounds. 65th percentile - he's not huge by any means. We had an ok experience with the smaller size when he was younger, but after the velcro wore out and he no longer fit into them, we ordered two of these with the hope that they would perform the same - just in a larger size!Not so. Gabriel can break out of one of these with the least bit of effort; and, yes, he is dressed in them properly. Even though he is supposed to be within the weight/size limits listed by the company, when the top seam of the SwaddleMe is at his shoulder his hands are already at the bottom seam of the torso portion - nothing like the child pictured.Whether it's his size or the strength of the velcro - that, by the way, isn't really "Velcro" at all, it's very thin hook-and-loop - it's very easy for him to work his way out of these. The fact that he is able to do that also poses a strangulation hazard in my eyes, since the hook and loop closure doesn't always come completely undone and the portion that remains fastened slips up around his neck. I have also seen him, while he is wriggling out of the SwaddleMe, raise his arms and bring the fastened fabric up over his face - suffocation, anyone?This SwaddleMe worked for us for about a week. I feel much safer swaddling him using the DUDU method with a very large receiving blanket - if this swaddle comes undone, it just falls away and doesn't pose any type of hazard. (See: [...] or Google search DUDU swaddle)Bottom line: this worked at the beginning. My son still needs the security of swaddling, but is apparently too big or too strong and exceeds the working capacity of the SwaddleMe. If you have a hearty, healthy infant, try something else!
