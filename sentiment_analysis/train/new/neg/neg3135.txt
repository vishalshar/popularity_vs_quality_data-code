When we saw this set on amazon we were absolutely amazed at the number of items that we were getting especially at that price.Well, I must say they looked great in the pics, in reality the quality is not upto the mark. There is a lot of sheer and silk type material rather than the comfortable cotton that you will see in stores like babies-r-us or Burlington coat factory.However one should bear in mind that this set is available at a fraction of price from the above stores.The bottomline is that you are getting what you are paying for, nothing too fancy, keep your expectations to a minimum.Plus all the items were delivered as promised.
