Is what this product smells like upon opening. WOW!  It certainly brings back memories of my dad's '49 BUICK.  The oil/ petrolium smell is something fierce. It actually made our entire first floor smell after about 20 minutes. The product is clearly marked for baby, and I am shocked if anyone would put there child on this cot before seriously airing out the thing. So a few points, #1 the cot does ope in less than a minute. #2 Mine came as shown with the green cover. HOWEVER the cover was already placed over the canvas so the smell, which I think comes from the canvas, had seeped into the sheet. #3. It took thee washings (on its own) for the cover to be without the oil like smell. I ordered this for a "nap space" for our 16 month old for our holiday trip which will include numerous locations. I am not sure that the cot will air out in time.So if not for the smell this would be a five star product.. its easy to open, to store and transport. The kiddo did want to sit on it and put her "baby dolls" to sleep on it...But i am not sure how anyone can sleep with that smell by their face, and would not put my child on the bed without a lot of padding on the canvas and making sure that the canvas is thouroughly aired out. Also the bed does not SNAP open... it just kind of stays open.. no locking mechanism. Will have to see how it performs if the smell goes away.
