Well.....it was close, I'll give them that, but looks like unless I make the repairs myself then I have 2 useless shelves on this thing. It's big and heavy, 80% built, so in order to return it you can imagine the work that would take. I'll try contacting the seller but until they provide a solid resolution this review and the photos stay.
