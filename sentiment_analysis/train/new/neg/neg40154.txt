The cups measure about 2.75, 3.25, and 3.75 inches in diameter.  The colors are similar to the picture, but mixed up.  (My cups/lids are: lrg-pink/teal, med-green/yellow, sml-orange/yellow.)  I like the look and sizes, but...The medium and large flip tops snap in three places, so you have to push a couple times to get them closed flat.  Also, I'm afraid the "hinge" will crack before long, since it's white after one use.The small lid doesn't seem tight enough to stay on if it was rubbing against things in a diaper bag.These are fun, but you're probably better of using regular Tupperware or Take n Toss type containers.
