I ordered another set of Aden + Anais swaddling blankets and a dream blanket about four years ago, and was beyond thrilled with them. They have gotten softer and softer over time, washing beautifully each time. My four year old still sleeps with hers and refuses to give them up to the new baby.These were honestly a bit of a disappointment though - from the first wash they've been all pilly and have little balls of lint all over them. I have never had any of the swaddling blankets do this before! It's not necessarily a big deal, it just feels like they aren't as nice as the first set I purchased. Have they changed from four years ago? Or did I get a bad batch somehow? I'd be tempted to return them and try again, but I tossed the packaging and have now washed them three or four times trying to get rid of the lint.
