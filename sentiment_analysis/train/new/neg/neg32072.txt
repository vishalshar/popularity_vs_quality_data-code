This was a gift for my husband's birthday. He was so excited to receive it, but I was disappointed when we opened it up and two of the blades were crushed. Luckily, there were replacement blades in the box, so we swapped them out, but he felt this limited him if he wanted to change the blade arrangement in the future. It was just embarassing.However, we now have it fixed and hung in our living room, and we're both enjoying it very much.
