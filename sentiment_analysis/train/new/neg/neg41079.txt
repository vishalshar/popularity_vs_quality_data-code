Hi I own this seat for about 7 months now. The design is beautiful, the only thing in the design area I would change is to make the straps dark brown so the spinach and broccoli don't show up on it as much.As far as the design of the seat goes, I find that somehow my lovely 15mo daughter always find ways to collect large amounts of food under the pad. I took the beautiful pad (the reason I bought this chair) off, washed it and I'm storing in hope that one day she won't be as messy and will be able to sit on it. Until then I'm saving myself the extra chore of washing the pad every other day because it looks super filthy.One more complaint, it is virtually impossible for me to take the tray off using the middle latch. I always have to use both hands and use the side latches to take that bloody thing off. Wouldn't buy again despite how cute it looks.
