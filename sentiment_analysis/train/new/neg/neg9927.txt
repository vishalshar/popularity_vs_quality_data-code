My 3 year old is a big Dora fan, but I'm not a huge fan of this fork and spoon. The part with Dora is a molded plastic and bends when eating harder things like ice cream. The fork is really more like a spork, which is actually pretty good for eating rice and chopped up spaghetti, but not good for poking harder pieces of fruit. My 3 year old can use these utensils (or really any) just fine, but her one year old sister really struggles because of Dora's weird shape. I would only purchase these if your toddler is already very proficient with a spoon and fork.
