They're natural and that's nice. They're the same shape as the other Platex pacifiers we have that are not latex.I was disappointed to read on the packaging that these could only be boiled once upon receipt and shouldn't be boiled again. They also degrade over time, unlike silicone, which holds its shape through boiling and sucking alike. Had these details been on the items page I wouldn't have purchased the pacifiers.
