I tried these, PeeWee Multi Use Disposable Changing Pads - 48 Pack, Huggies Changing Pads - Disposable, Case of 40 (5 packs of 8 pads) & Munchkin A&H Disposable Changing Pad - 10 Pack, and these are my least favorite.Pros:They're inexpensive, so they may be good if you want to thow them out after every use (maybe for public changing tables)The waterproof layer works fine.Cons:They're thin, almost reminding me of toilet paper in public school bathrooms (a long time ago.)They're small, so if I didn't use two pads to cover the target area, my daughter's changing time poop squirts often ended up off the pad.When they stay clean, they hardly stay in place; kicking feet scoot them out of the way, and then they cling to baby's clothes when I pick her up.I ended up using these as disposable placemats for when my 3-year-old "helps" me stir dinner.
