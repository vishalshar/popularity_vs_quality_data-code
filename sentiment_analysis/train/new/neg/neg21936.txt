I should have listened to the other reviewers of this product. This is the only pump I've ever purchased so I didn't know what to expect from a pump, but this pump was painful to use. Apparently it doesn't have to be this way. Granted it could be my technique, but I was only able to get 2 1/2 ounces (both breasts combined) at a time. After no more than 6 tries, the motor lost power and I couldn't get anything. I'm now using the manual Medela pump that I got from the hospital and while my arms are tired, at least my nipples aren't sore. (Ironically, the lactation specialist in the hospital says that there are 4 brands of pumps that they tell all their patients not to waste money on, and "The First Years" is one of them. I have to say from this pump that I agree). I didn't think I'd be pumping often enough to spend a lot of money on an electric pump, but in retrospect I should have purchased the Medela Pump-In-Style. I will for my second child. I hope I can prevent other moms or soon-to-be-moms from making the same mistake.
