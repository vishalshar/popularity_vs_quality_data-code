My almost 2 year old loves this light. She holds on to it during our bedtime routine. It's a little too bright for her smaller room to sleep with all night. I just lay a light swaddle blanket over it to diffuse the light and it's perfect!UPDATE: I still love this light, but after 7 months it finally crapped out. After putting in brand new batteries it flickers like crazy. It has the perfect amount of light, but i think i'll switch to something that is plugin. Had to change the batteries quite often.
