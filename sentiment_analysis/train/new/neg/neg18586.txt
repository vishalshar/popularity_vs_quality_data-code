Not very happy with this pump.  It just doesn't seem to work properly.  It will suck milk up into the diaphragm.  I had an evenflo portable breast pump that I liked much better, and it was cheaper.  It had nipple adapters, and this one doesn't.  I feel like my nipples are being bruised when I use this.  Either way though,  It pumps, and I can use it.  Just don't like using it.
