This was a little disappointing of a purchase, my daughter did like the walker although it is a little bulky and too heavy for her to get around in as well as the bounce feature is not much of a bounce.We used it maybe 4 times tops, we for sure wouldn't recommend this product for someone.If you're trusting in Walkers, and have a safe enough environment for them, try a lighter weight one with less bulk.Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.Thanks for reading!
