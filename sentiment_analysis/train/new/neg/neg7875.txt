Exactly 10 months after purchasing this bag it BROKE. The shoulder strap tore from the seam where it connected to the bag.  I don't abuse the bag, I intended this bag to be used for many years and hopefully for numerous children. I'm incredibly disappointed because I loved this bag. I recommended this bag to many people and some did purchase this bag. I invested the $140 because I was under the impression that Ju Ju Be was a brand that made quality products. Since the brand is made by mom's I also expected a high caliber of customer service. Not only am I disheartened that my bag broke I am also dissatisfied with the customer service I received.I contacted Ju Ju Be and explained the situation. They asked me to provide them with proof of purchase and a photo of the bag. Once I did, they told me that their policy is that nothing can be done after 90 days. Why make me send photos, dig up my proof of purchase when I would receive a response that the company policy is 'after 90 days the bag can't be refunded or replace.'  They referred me to the "pink room" telling me a "pink lady" could probably mend my bag. There was no explanation of what the pink room was or who a pink lady was. Interested in having my bag fixed since it was expensive and in great condition aside from the broken strap I wanted to find out more. I found that the pink room is a discussion board where people post about their ju ju be products. The discussion board is hard to navigate and not intuitive. You need to make an account and post threads which may or may not be answered by other users. If you are reading this review and are interested in purchasing this bag go to the pink room ( http://thepinkroom.ju-ju-be.com  )  website because I found several posting including pictures about people's bags falling apart. I went to my local seamstress and she said she can't fix the bag because it needs to be fixed by a heavy duty sewing machine and referred me to a person who fixes luggage.  This is a lot of work for a diaper bag. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE and buy the skip hop diaper bag for $70. I know several people who have it and its really nice.  http://www.amazon.com/Skip-Hop-FORMA-Backpack-Black/dp/B00R4PXGQ4/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=baby-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1449592841&sr=1-1&keywords=skip+hop+diaper+bag+backpack
