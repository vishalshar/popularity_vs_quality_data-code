Our morning started with quite the scare.. I got this stupid bowl because it looked neat and I fell for the commercial. My one year old figured out how to take it apart very quickly on the first use.Anyways, we continued to use it but this morning he was using it and started gagging out of no where. I didn't know what the heck was going on. He had this orange piece lodged in the back of his mouth. I had to finger sweep it out. It was a terrifying minute and he was hysterical. I'm so mad. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. These should be recalled asap.
