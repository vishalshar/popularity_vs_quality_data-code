These are great but my grandson bites through the plastic piece and no one sells a replacement so you have to buy an entire new bottle which is ridiculous. I will not buy again and will find a different brand. They DO NOT LEAK unless there is an issue with the "nipple" piece. This is the only one I have found that doesn't leak but it is not cost effective.
