Update: these broke my daughter out in a horrible rash that took a while to clear up. The doctor said not to use these on her again. Unfortunately after they weren't catching the poop like they were supposed to if it was only a small bowel movement. If it was normal size, it didn't catch at all and it was bunched up inside her diaper. I really wanted to like these, but after the horrible experience with these I have to update my review as I feel it's important for anyone looking to put something on baby's skin or to catch anything more than a small bm. The first time I used them it was good, but maybe that's because she wasn't in her diaper long before she pooped. If worn more than an hour at most then it bunches and doesn't protect the diaper.Just got these yesterday and already put them to use and my daughter had a MASSIVE blow out in her cloth diaper this morning first thing, as soon as I put it on her and this liner caught all of it!!! I was sooo amazed! It is relatively soft and I am still in shock it caught all of that mess. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who cloth diapers and doesn't want to deal with scooping the poop out!! :)
