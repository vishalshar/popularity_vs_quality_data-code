My neighbors have the First Years 900 MHz monitors that have impressive range.  Not wanting cross talk, I ordered the First Years 2.4 GHz Ultra range monitor despite reading the reviews.  I speculated that the erroneous monitor locator issues were from people living in urban areas.  Since these were "ultra range" monitors it made sense that this issue was probably due to a neighbor having the same device.I WAS WRONG!I am fortunate enough to live on acreage and the monitor locator erroneously went off 3 times in the first hour!  It didn't matter if there were new batteries in the receiver or it was plugged into the AC adapter.  This monitor set picks up interference from my 2.4 GHz cordless phone and has a repetitive clicking sound unless the phone is unplugged.  With the phone unplugged the monitor locator function erroneously went off.When they work, they have a crystal clear sound and very good range.  It is unfortunate the manufacture still has some bugs to work out.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I recommend this product be pulled from the web site until the manufacture figures their problem out.BTW:  The Fisher Price Ultra Range 900 MHz monitor reception is decent at a good 250' from the house through dense trees.  There is some static but nothing as annoying as the repetitive clicking mentioned above.Thanks BabiesRus/Amazon for your great customer service and convenient return policy!Hope this helps,Kevin from Princeton MN
