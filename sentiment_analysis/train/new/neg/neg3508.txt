I purchased this item about a month ago. When I received it, it was missing a vital component, the safety strap! I contacted the seller twice about this missing item, since my baby was small and had to use the strap when in the carrier, however I NEVER heard back from the seller. My baby is now almost 3 months so I no longer need the strap, but needless to say I wasn't able to use the carrier since I bought it. To sell a baby carrier, and not include the most important piece for your child's safety is a serious crime! This seller should be removed from Amazon.
