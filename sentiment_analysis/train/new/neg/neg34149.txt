I got this bottle in order to give my grandson a little rice cereal.  The pediatrician wanted him to have more than he was able to with a spoon.  I followed directions and have used a cereal bottle in the past but this nipple hole is way too large!  I mean WAY too large.  He chokes on it since the cereal/formula combo pours out fast! The hole on the nipple is about the size of a toothpick at its largest size,  in the middle.I ended up taking a new nipple and making it a little larger with a pair of tiny embroidery scissors.  At the suggestion of the pediatrician i made a tiny x and it works great!
