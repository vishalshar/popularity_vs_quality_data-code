The pattern is adorable and this is a high quality item. It was only useful to us when it was pretty cold at night (less than 40-50 degrees outside). Baby seemed to get a little too hot in this one but we live in a mild climate so perhaps this would work in New England, the Midwest or the Northeast during the winter months.  Also, I thought the arm holes were a bit small and I have a petite baby. I got a lot more use out of the HALO sleep sack that was made of muslin cotton. I would buy this item again, but not in this fabric it's just too heavy duty for us.
