We bought this after having our 4th baby, giving us 2 kids under 2 and in diapers. We liked being able to use kitchen trash bags rather than having to purchase refills. The pail holds a lot of diapers, about 10 days worth of size 3 and size 1in our house. However the smell is not well contained. The deodorizing disc worked till the pail was about half full, then we tried some of the other reviewers suggestions. The laundry scent beads just fall thru the slits into the pail and we never noticed them helping with the smell. We also put a large bakingsoda disc, one for the fridge with a suction cup, on the inside wall of the pail,  helped a little but the nursery still smelled like dirty diapers. We also have always used trashbags with febreeze. Now that our baby is 6 weeks old and doesn't seem bothered by our airwick plug-ins in other parts of the house, we're putting one in the nursery. Our toddler only sleeps in there, never plays so the door is always shut keeping her from the temptation of a wall outlet.
