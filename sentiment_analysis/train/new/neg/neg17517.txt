The whole purpose of these is it make life easier but honestly they are really bulky and awkward. to put them on the crib you have to snap 10 pieces in to place. HELLO, not easy at three in the morning! I think changing the sheet is easier. We are using ours as waterproof mats for the floor. The other complaint is that they are a pain to wash. They take up the whole machine and even when you snap the pieces in place they still rip off in the machine
