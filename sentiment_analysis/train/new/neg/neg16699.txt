I got this when my daughter went through a hip carry phase, but neither of us were really crazy about it. (I think it actually prompted her to end the phase.) I'm just not a wrap person, I guess. I prefer soft structured carriers. I keep this in the van as an emergency wrap, but it really hasn't seen much use. If you like the idea of wraps, or maybe you've tried one and liked it, but can't take the financial plunge yet, this might be a good option. It just wasn't my thing.
