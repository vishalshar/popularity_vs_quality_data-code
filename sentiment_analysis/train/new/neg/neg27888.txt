I was looking for something that was vaguely asparagus-sized, or at least proportional to the other vegetables in the Under the Nile set. This toy is about the size of a small zucchini-- it's too big around for my 14-month-old to grasp with one hand. On top of that, the eggplant I bought at the same time is half the size-- about the size of a pear. Again, not at all proportional. I like most of the vegetables in the set, but this item was extremely disappointing.
