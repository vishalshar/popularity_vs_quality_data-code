I'm glad I received this item accidentally through an Amazon snafu and ended up getting reimbursed. If I had to eat that cost, I'd be pretty upset. This cup is very cute, very pretty, and I was looking forward to a stainless steel alternative to plastic. But please don't buy this for a kid under 3 or 4 years old. Or, actually, any child, no matter how careful. It dents very easily around the bottom. Not a big deal, but still annoying. It came with two straws to attach to the lid, thankfully, because one was already broken and cracked. Once I tried putting the remaining straw on the lid, I realized why. It was nerve wracking getting the straw on there because it seemed like it would split, too. Please heed the other reviewers about the worst part...this thing leaks like crazy. I'm pretty careful about keeping cups in bags upright (seen too many leaks and spills), but even I make mistakes. The cup had managed to tip and there was water everywhere. (Thankfully I'd only used it for water!) Last, but not least, my 18 month old thought I was taking too long getting dinner ready and threw the dang thing from her high chair. The lid broke right off.  Irreparable damage, now there's a tiny sharp piece of hard plastic poking off the lid. Darn you, dippy cup, you are beautiful, but not worth it.
