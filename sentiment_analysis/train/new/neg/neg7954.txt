I love the pattern, and the fabric on the inside of the diaper bag, but I wish that it wasn't vinyl on the outside! I know the vinyl fabric is so the bag is easier to clean, but it makes the bag very stiff and the straps slide off my shoulder very easily. Like I aside, I love the pattern and I didn't return it...I will continue to use it, maybe the vinyl will soften as I use the bag.
