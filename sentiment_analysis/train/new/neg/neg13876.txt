Let me start by saying we own TONS of HABA toys, and we love them. I consider them to be heirloom quality--they are made in Germany--NOT China, and they are so well made.Rosella The Clutching Toy is made very well--but--in my opinion with a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW. The arms are made of string, and at the end have small balls attached. The string may be thick, but I fear it could be a choking hazzard if a child bites through them, and in turn possibly choke on the small balls.At first I allowed my daughter to play with this, and sure enough, the first thing that went in her mouth were the little balls at the end.  After only a couple of days, and tons of worry, with that gnawing feeling of: this toy is not safe, I took it from her pile of toys. Now, it has become a decoration on a shelf!!Keep your piece of mind, and don't buy this!!By the way, a great toy made by HABA that my daughter loves is the "Flower Trio Clutching Toy" It's pretty and doesn't seem to have any possible choking hazzards.
