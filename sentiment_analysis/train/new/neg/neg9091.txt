The seat is comfortable and good quality, especially for the price! It's a cute print, too. I would recommend the seat.Installation was...not fun. We were installing in an older car (pre-LATCH) and I had to put my hand entirely inside the seat through a small opening on the side to pull the seat belt through to the buckle. It reminded me very much of a video I saw one time of a farmer palpating a cow to determine pregnancy, and since we have twins I got to think about that not once but twice as I bruised my hand up trying to fiddle the belt into the right place.
