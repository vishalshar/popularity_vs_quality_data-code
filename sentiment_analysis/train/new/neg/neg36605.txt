I got this after a few moms recommended it. It definitely works as a quick fix.Pros:You can adapt how close the ends are due to the strap, however,Cons:You can only latch on/off one side,Once you put the band in, it will not come out that side(!!) -- we thought it would be adjustableThe quality of the straps looks a little "cheap"I ended up liking the Munchkin one more because you can latch/unlatch both sides, but it's also not perfect -- bigger and more visible.At the price, I would recommend getting one of each and seeing for yourself what you like more.
