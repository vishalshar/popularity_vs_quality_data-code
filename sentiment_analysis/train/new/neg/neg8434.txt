I received this item in March 2011. As soon as I opened the package I could smell a very strong chemical-like smell that seemed to have permeated all of the contents. The smell reminded me a bit of a varnish-y type of smell, and was so strong that I could not imagine being able to wash it off. I returned this item as the scent was so strong that I was not comfortable giving it to my 14 month old to use in the bath.  The designer applique aspect of these toys only warrants it getting a rating of the (required) one star in my opinion, as the smell makes them unusable.
