I just rec'd these today--NOWHERE on the packaging do I see that they are BPA-free. I don't know if if I rec'd one that is an older model or different packaging than other buyers, but I am returning these. They are beautiful, sturdy, but I cannot imagine giving them to my grandson to chew on or even to attach things to his stroller or car seat.
