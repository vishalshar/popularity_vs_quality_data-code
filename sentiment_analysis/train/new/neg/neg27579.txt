UPDATE: I loved this seat for the 2-3 months it lasted before cracking. Both the blue and gray cracked and my son said they were "biting his butt". He's a really small kid, maybe 25 pounds at the time, so it wasn't a weight thing. I have fixed the seat many times with super glue, because it is otherwise perfect. More and more cracks have appeared and I'm ready to throw in the towel. We bought a Baby Bjorn and although that one is hard it holds up over time. I also bought the more expensive version of the weePOD seat and it seems like it will hold up better, but it is really hard for my son to get on the toilet himself because it is such a snug fit. He won't even use it, sigh.ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is the best toilet topper seat I have ever found, and I've seen them all working as a nanny for 10+ years! I was about to buy the Bjorn toilet trainer or the expensive WeePod when I came across this at Target for less than half the price of either of those seats (it's thirteen dollars there). It's soft without having annoying crevices that you can't clean, and it doesn't slide all over the place on the toilet while still being easy to remove. My petite 19 month old feels very secure on it since the hole isn't giant, and it doesn't leave indentation marks on him like the other soft seats do from the interior plastic rim that those seats have. I highly recommend this! Now I can get one for both bathrooms without breaking the bank.
