I really wanted this stroller to work out so I would have something light and portable for quick walks and for vacations. It's a really nice strep up from the $19 versions with the cute pattern, sunshade, cup holder, and small storage net. Unfortunately it had 2 flaws I had trouble overlooking. The first is that it is impossible to fold wearing sandals because you have to use the top of your foot and since I live in flip flops this is the main reason why I had to send it back. The other flaw is that when you close it, the front wheels are up against the canopy which would make it very dirty. And lastly, well not a flaw for most, I live in a condo and have a couple stairs here and there that I was not able to maneuver backwards up because the breaks on the wheels stick out further than the wheels. Considering it is $50 I couldn't justify keeping it.
