When i got them i noticed that cheap material was used to make them. I was desperate my baby was due in a week and we didn't know the sex so i thought "what the heck" we can always get gender specific towels after. I hand washed them no bleach just baby detergent and spun them on gentle dry the green towel dyed the other towels and some some white one's i had also hand washed.My thought was it was a good thing i washed them because all that dye would have ended up on my newborn instead.If you get these i recommend that you hang dry them.
