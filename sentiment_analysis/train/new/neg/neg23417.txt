I normally don't leave bad reviews but this one deserves it. After ordering it took two weeks for the item to arrive, when it did arrive it was the wrong color. We had ordered the white and the espresso style one showed up instead and from the little bit that i saw of the first one it was dinged and damaged pretty good. Less than a week later the correct style showed up and i started to put it together. The holes were not drilled completely, not that big of a deal. The deal breaker was the shelves were WAY to small, there was at least an inch gap between the shelf and the side of the changing table. I thought maybe because everything wasn't tightned down, so I did that but the middle bars were bowed pretty bad. Definitely not worth the $100, maybe $20 at best.
