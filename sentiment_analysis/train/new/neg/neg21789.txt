It's a good swaddler...until your baby grows out of it.  I purchased four small/medium swaddlers because the package indicates that it is good for 0 - 3 months (and up to 12 pounds), but my three week old is already too big for it (she weights 8 pounds).  I really don't understand.  She seems to be too tall for the bottom velcro that holds the hips in place and she is able to break out of the arms after 5 minutes of squirming.  Pretty disappointed overall; I don't think I would purchase these again (and certainly not four of them!)
