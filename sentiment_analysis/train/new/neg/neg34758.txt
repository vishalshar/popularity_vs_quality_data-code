Not fond of these, much prefer the freetime.  The attaching at both ends makes it difficult to not bunch weirdly for a snapped down rise as the organic fabric is not soft.  I also don't like that there isn't fabric lining the full inside of the cover.  It is a very well made diaper and I am hoping it will work better when my baby fits with the rise snaps undone.
