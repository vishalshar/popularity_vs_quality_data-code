The bottom is too round and doesn't lay flat, which doesn't seem very fun for my son that he always seems to be sitting at an angle. The product took a while to ship, but once it shipped it got here quickly and on time. Easy to put together. Takes a six triple A batteries. And I don't know whether or not it is just my son being so short...but it seem too tall to me.
