I bought this product for my active 5 month old son.  He loves his Jolly Jumper, so I figured a walker would be a great addition to our playing repetoire. The walker is excellent!  It has a safety stop that activates whenever your baby rolls to a stair edge (not that I would ever test this theory but it's good to know it's there just in case), the activities on the tray are fun (lights, noise included) and the trays move so you can put other toys or things of that nature on the tray.  However, my son is now 6 months old, 28 inches, and he still cannot touch the ground while on the lowest of the two height settings for this walker.  I feel like by the time he can touch the ground in it, he'll be walking anyways. It's good for a short period to sit him in it and have him play with the toys, but he grows tired of it quickly since he can't move in it. That is the only downside, otherwise it's a great product.  It would be absolutely perfect for an active baby who is extremely tall.
