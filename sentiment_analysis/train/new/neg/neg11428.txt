We were new parents and so didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. The baby car seat portion of this worked fine for the first 3 months, but our daughter grew pretty fast (top 100 percentile for height) and so was out of it after that so ended up buying a convertible car seat.The stroller worked really well for another 6 months or so, its been well used on many long walks and has lots of storage which was useful, however once you put much in their it does tend to drag and can tip backwards pretty easy with much weight at the back.Now at 11 months our daughter is quite uncomfortable in this as it doesn't support her legs well and the straps push to hard between her legs, so we are having to look around.So for the money it has done pretty well for 11 months or so, so I'm not unhappy, but I kind of wish I had just bit the bullet and paid more for a stroller that would last.I would also recommend to new parents not to get a 'travel system', buy two separate items. I know its a lot to invest when you are having to buy lots of stuff at the begging, but you'll end up having to buy another car seat anyway so that money goes to waste.Get a convertible car seat (we bought a Recaro which has been fantastic and would have worked right from the hospital) that works for newborns, pray you don't have a premi (all bets are off at that stage anyway!).Look for a lighter more compact stroller, I found that its just too heavy and bulky when getting it into the car, if you invest all this money into just a stroller you can get something better.If you really can't stretch to it, then you could do a lot worse, you are at least covered with an easy to use baby car seat for the first 3 months, a decent stroller for the first 12 months or so.
