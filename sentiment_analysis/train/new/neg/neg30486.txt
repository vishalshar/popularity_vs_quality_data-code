We bought the Triumph for our 1.5 year old son (to replace our Peg Perego Aria), partly because of the reassurance of the Sovereign Lifetime Warranty.  While I loved the lightweight and maneuverability of the Maclaren, within 6 months one of the wheels started to wear down profoundly, and the whole stroller started to feel loose and wonky.  One day while visiting London, the wheel just popped completely off and rolled away.  Maclaren was supremely unhelpful, and refused to pay for the replacement of the wheel or honor any warranty on the stroller at all (Sovereign Warranty, indeed).We are now expecting our 3rd baby and I was going to buy a Techno XLR because it's compatible with the Britax Chaperone infant seat we bought, but I think I'll give Maclaren a miss.
