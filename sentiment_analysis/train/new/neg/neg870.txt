I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old. I purchased this blanket at a retail store 2 years ago for my oldest, it was as described here..plush, soft and perfect! He loves it to this day!!! I purchased one off amazon that I thought was the same but is not. It is thin, not plush and already falling apart after only two months use. I guess it just depends on the seller...this one has the same print but not the same quality. I am ordering another off diapers.com to see if the quality is better. Very disappointed!
