Horrible design. Bought this bc my 2 yo girl is in LOVE with Dora and hoped it would help with the whole potty training process.Very disappointed. The seat portion is not attached at all to the bowl. it just rests on it so a wiggly 2 yo can easily collapse the whole thing. Also the back part is just pushed down in two small holes and keeps falling off. We've only had it a week and my daughter won't sit on it at all. Probably worried that it will break into pieces!!
