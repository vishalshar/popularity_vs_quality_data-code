This product is adequate but has a couple of significant drawbacks.  On the plus side, it keeps the front child dry.  On the negative side:1. It doesn't fit well if you have the extra seat attached at the rear and reclined.  If reclined, the rear part of the cover tends to ride up over the back of the seat allowing water to run into the rear seat.2. It is difficult to pass items to the child in the front seat, eg. drink, snack.  A front access zipper/panel would be a great improvement.3. It is cumbersome to put on which exaggerates the access problem: once on, it's easier to leave on and hence a roll up panel or zipper to access the front child would be a big help.These comments also apply for the double sun cover.  As someone who does a lot of walking/shopping with the stroller, I'm about to take the scissors to both my covers to do the mods myself...  For a company that has such a great stroller design, I expected more user friendly accessories.
