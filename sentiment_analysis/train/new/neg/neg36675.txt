I really wanted to like this. I watched the video, read up on it before purchasing. But when it came to actually using it, I didn't find it as practical. The height did work, it was too short much of the time and I would have to put a pillow underneath to get baby at the right level to nurse. I also found it be much more uncomfortable against a C-section scar than other, softer nursing pillows. I love the design, and the fabric, and am also willing to guess that some of my issues might have been specific to my body type/situation. But overall it just didn't work for me.
