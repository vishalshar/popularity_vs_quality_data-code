Baby monitors are all about peace of mind and security. They need to do their job and they need to be reliable.When it's working, the 3037W does a good job, nice picture and audio quality, nice screen, good features.The problem is in reliability.The 3037W suffers from multiple faults in reliability that make it undependable.1. "Out of Range" error. Out of no where the unit loses connection to the camera and starts beeping telling you it is "Out of Range". It notifies you with convenient beeping sound. The fix is easy also, put the unit into "pairing mode" then press the button under the camera to reconnect, what could be easier? The problem is when this happens at 3AM, your baby is asleep and the camera is ceiling mounted above the crib! At 3am, go an climd a ladder (above your baby) remove the camera, press a button and put it back without waking the baby. Thank you Samsung for making this so easy.2. Random freezing. Sometimes it just stops working and doesn't tell you at all. It just freezes the image and stops working. Imagine you're asleep and you hear a screaming baby. You look at your baby monitor and your child appears to be comfortably fast asleep. You turn it off and back on and WHAM your child is screaming their head off and you have no idea how long they may have been crying for since the *expletive* monitor just froze for no reason.3. Battery life. When it was new, the battery was good, now, after a long and arduous service life of 3 months, the battery life is down to ~30 minutes. We pretend that it doesn't have a battery and move the charger around with it wherever we go.I came to Amazon this morning to buy a new baby monitor and decided I better write a review to warn others of what they may experience with their units. I'm sure there are others who have had delightful heartwarming experiences with their monitor, but that's not us. Thank you Samsung for numerous sleepless night!
