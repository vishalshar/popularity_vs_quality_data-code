I bought this highchair because of the high review marks that it received.  It is OK.  It's wider than most highchairs and a little bulky (my husband always trips over the highchair legs).  I went to babies r us after I received this purchase and wish I bought another one.  The tray is also very big.  There is another tray that snaps on to the regular tray, so that you essentially have 2 trays you can use.  The regular tray is very large and doesn't fit in a standard dishwasher.  Plus, the harness is also really strange and none that i've seen before.
