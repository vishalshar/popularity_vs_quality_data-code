We purchased this piece shortly after we learned we were pregnant with our first child (March). Our baby was not born until September. After several months, it was apparent that the fasteners for the changer portion would not stay tight to hold all the pieces together. Months later, I discovered another piece that was doing the same thing. Unfortunately, I did not contact Storkcraft until we were past the 1 year manufacturer warranty period (March). I figured that they would not do anything, but I wanted to provide some concerned feedback about the quality of the product that was produced. The final response I got from them was actually fairly rude in my opinion. I had already stated that it sounded like they couldn't do anything for me, but that we didn't start using the piece until September, months after the original purchase and that I should have contacted them earlier. Following is the response that I received. No apology for the problems that I have with the product.You should have contacted us earlier when you are having problem with your change table. The warranty and parts replacement policy are clearly stated in the instructions manual. Once the unit is past warranty, replacement parts are available for purchase.
