Although this blanket is soft and cute, the shedding is terrible! I washed and dried this blanket three times, and used almost an entire lint roller on it, and it is still shedding everywhere.  It sheds all over everything it touches. Not sure how much more time I'm willing to spend washing and using the lint roller on it. Pretty disappointed.
