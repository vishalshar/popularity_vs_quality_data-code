I can't vouch for how well these work to hold accidents, since I never got to use them on my daughter.  I ordered the large size (which supposedly fits 26-31 pounds) because my daughter is right at 30lbs.  I think *I* could get these things on!  I took a photo of my daughter's size 2T/3T underwear on top of these to show that the waterproof pants are much bigger (the photo is in the customer images section).
