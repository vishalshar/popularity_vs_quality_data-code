Let me start by saying I'm not normally a comparison shopper.  This situation just presented itself to me in a strange internet-glitch type way.  When I do make a purchase, I do like to mildly compare before a purchase.  So when I was shopping for an outdoor blanket, after looking through various outdoor blankets, I was convinced that the Skip Hop blanket was the one for me.  However, according to Amazon, it would take several months for me to receive it because they were backordered.  I ended up making an order with Babies R Us.....which was later backordered.  It was close to soccer season and I needed one right away so I ordered the JJ Cole blanket because it could be delivered within a week.  I've been using the JJ Cole blanket for over a month now and I couldn't be happier with it.  It's very easy to roll out and when it's time to go, roll back up.  The quality is excellent.  Well, Monday afternoon, the Skip Hop outdoor blanket showed up on my doorstep and I took it to soccer practice to try it out.  Not too impressed.  The cooler bag that goes with it is teeny-tiny and you can't fit much in it.  The zipper makes it more difficult to lay out and fold back up and if you have a baby in your arms, it makes it that much more difficult.  The JJ Cole blanket is cheaper in price and better in quality and it's much easier to use.  I highly recommend it and I get tons of compliments on it.
