Well it worked great until it stopped working, conveniently 1 month after the return policy expired. We have adjusted the sensitivity to the highest setting, turned both units off and back on. They are linked and I can here tapping noises (when I tap on the base unit) but can only hear a voice when I am literally screaming at the TOP of my lungs and it comes in as a faint noise. This is maddening since this was a fairly expensive unit and I now have to toss it. :-( I will try to contact Philips but I'm sure it will be a royal pain in my arse.
