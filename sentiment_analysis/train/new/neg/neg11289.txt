I would avoid ordering this. Here's why. Maybe because it's "discontinued?" Mine arrived and does not have a latex nipple. The entire reason I ordered this was for the latex nipple. Also the bottle doesn't look like the one in the photo, but that doesn't matter. This clearly states that it has a latex nipple, and the product I received does not.
