I am giving it two stars mostly because one star means I hate it, and hate is such a strong word.If you are looking for an iPhone knockoff to give your toddler to play with so he/she can leave your real phone alone, this is NOT the item to get.  Any 18 months + toddler who have played with a real iPhone will not want to have anything to do with this.  I think the more suitable age for this toy is more the 9-12 months crowd.  My 19 months old, who's been using my iPhone since forever, looked at me like "are you kidding me" when I handed him this toy.  I am returning it.The biggest problem is, the photos are misleading.  It makes it appear as if the toy has a screen like the iPhone and icons on them when you push, something will show up on the screen.  That is NOT the case.  There is no screen, unless you count the little dot on the upper left corner that lights up when you hit those buttons.  The rest of the "screen" is just a sticker of icons, when you press "1", it just says "1".  That's it!  I realize $20 wasn't going to get me a real iPhone like toy, but still, this is maybe a $10 toy that's not even as good as some of the other toy phones on the market for the younger kids.  Very disappointed.
