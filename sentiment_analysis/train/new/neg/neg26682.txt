I ordered the Butterfly because I wanted the extra security of having baby buckled into the carrier separate from the waist band that buckles it to you, but have since changed my mind. I have since changed my mind because I can handle back carries just fine in the other type (if you've ever held you baby on your hip, you're already halfway there). Some still prefer to have the separate harness, though, so I won't deduct stars for that.What ended up killing the deal for me is that I am apparently too narrow for the Butterfly to fit properly. My bra band is 28 or 30 (depending on the brand), and, being so narrow, the main body panel bulges out considerably, leaving baby held not as close as I'd like. The buckles for the main body panel are supposed to adjust this, but it didn't work for me at even the smallest adjustment. Additionally, my husband is on the broad side, and those buckles are hard to adjust anyway, so even if they worked, it would have caused a problem for us.Finding out that this as one of the top suggested carriers for petite moms, I tried all sorts of other carriers with little hope. I ended up finding and loving the Action Baby Front and Back Carrier (Standard, Black Solid with Silver) directly from the manufacturer (you'll at least want to check the manufacturer's website for the right pictures. They're a little mixed up on the Amazon page). The straps on the ABC are cushier than others, so they don't cut in at the edges if they're not otherwise inclined to sit flat (a problem I had with the BOBA Classic Baby Carrier 3G - Glacier and similar carriers--again, as a result of being so narrow), and can be crossed. I can even wear the straps crossed in a back carry without boob squishage, but YMMV. If you're having trouble finding a carrier to fit your small/narrow frame, I heartily recommend trying that.
