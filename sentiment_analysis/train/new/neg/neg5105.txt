The nap mat is fine, and I have no problems with it other than the fact that in my case I recieved the package from walmart.com: http://www.walmart.com/ip/Yo-Gabba-Gabba-Nap-Mat/19720876. I guess now there is a benefit for this listing as it's currently out of stock, but at the time of purchase I wish I'd just researched the item better, as I could have saved 5 bucks or so.
