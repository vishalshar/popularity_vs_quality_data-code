I'll preface this review by writing, we've owned this bath mat for a little over a year now (purchased in Dec 2014).  We loved this mat up until yesterday when one of the cute buttons fell off and realized water had been seeping underneath the button!  It was dirty and moldy!  We pull the tub mat off and hang against the tub's tile wall after every bath and also spray and wipe it down weekly for a cleaning. For some reason, I was under the impression the mat was one continuous solid piece of rubber.  It's not and when the water seeps thru, it's dirty.  It just isn't something I want my toddler bathing in.  I thought this was a great price and was happy with the mat for over a year, but then this happened.
