We purchased this wall border and had nothing but problems. My husband and his father, who are both quite handy, put it up, but it would not stick on the bottom. Mind you that while they were doing this, I had cut up pieces of the leftover border for other various touches around the room. I put different frames of the border in picture frames, put some of the characters on the ceiling fan, ect, because the pattern itself is so cute. but even working with the smaller pieces on the fan, the border ripped a few times, I pushed them together and called it a day, but I don't know how long it will hold once it is in motion. Also, when they put it up in the room it ripped in several places. To try to get it to stick better, they even tried to superglue the bottom, which made it even more frustrating when we realized that It looked too bad to keep up. This is our first child and we would have a lot better places to waste over $40. I would not recommend this to anyone.
