I cannot recommend these sheets. I own a Graco pack n play playard and was looking for some sheets to use on the mattress. Even though these are sold by Graco, they do not fit snug on the mattress. The corners are not elastic. They are just folded in corners. I do not feel safe using these sheets on Graco's pack n play. Save your money and buy something else!
