God bless Amazon.  They have take FOUR of these back.  As other reviewers will tell you, the thing works well a week, or sometimes a month, and then out of nowhere, you hear clicks, beeps and other odd noises.  I've tried every channel combo possible.  It doesn't make a difference.  The odd thing is, the noises don't start right away.  I would think if there was some interference in my house, the noises would start right away.  Well, no.  The noises start at some random point and get worse and worse as the product ages.Honestly, pay for something nicer.  This thing is garbage.  Also, the range is awful.  Our cordless phone can at least go out to our back yard.  This thing beeps like crazy, the second you walk out the door.Keep in mind, Sony has made nearly no changes in this product for many years.  Check out the early review dates. There are MUCH better products out there.  I would tell you which ones, but our daughter is getting old enough that we won't need it much longer.
