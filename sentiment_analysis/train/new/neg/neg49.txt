I kind of feel like I overpaid for this. It's cute and I feel like it's soft enough but I don't think my 4 month old was quite ready for it as she sort of starts to lean over the side. It's hard to get her in and out of with the tray on and if you take the tray off it's hard to see what you're doing to get it back on. I don't hate it but I guess it wasn't quite what I expected. I bought it for this summer when we're traveling in our RV so she'll have a place to sit and eat and play. We'll see how it goes wen she gets a bit bigger!
