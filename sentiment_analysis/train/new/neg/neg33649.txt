I purchased this necklace for my grand-daughter because she was having such a hard time with teething, and because several people I know recommended it so highly.  However I think this baby must be the exception to the teething rule because she seemed to become more cranky when wearing it.  And after just a couple weeks one of the beads broke.  I've known babies who wear these and are truly helped by this product so I do not want to say that it doesn't work, but probably just not for my little one.
