I purchased this one some months ago before my baby was born and it cost me $70 aprox. I see now it is much more expensive (almost $100!!)Honestly I think the theme is beautiful and all but for being Hello Kitty (I've worked with this license in my country) the materials are not good enough!! It is most polyester than anything, the fabric is not nice, looks bad quality and is stiff. Would it had been 100% cotton things would be completely different. I don't think the material makes justice to this beautiful character and theme... Only if you are a great fan of Hello Kitty it might be ok to buy this but other than that I wouldn't recommend this set at all, worse for the price... I don't think it's worth it. I decorated my baby's room with the entire collection and everything looks so cute but the fabric is so bad I feel sorry I didn't choose something else on Amazon.Hope Sanrio takes note of this and choose another licensee to manufacture these stuff, and supervise the material is good enough for a baby. I myself wouldn't sleep in such a stiff material! :(
