These work with the Medela Symphony and Pump In Style units that I am currently using.  They are certainly a cheaper alternative than Medela 5 oz collection units.  Even though it is noted in reviews and elsewhere, the issue with these bottles is that the caps are not a single, solid plastic piece.  The caps function as a bottle collar and have a sealing disc that can be inserted in the collar's hole to keep milk inside.  I don't trust sealing discs and they are so easy to lose down the sink drain.  While I wash my bottle pieces in a little bucket rather than straight in the sink, the sealing discs are small and not brightly colored; this makes it is easy to just dump them out with the dirty bottle water.  I bought a couple of packs of Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack since I don't expect to have many sealing discs stick around.  The markings on these bottles are so-so.  I can't eyeball the bottles quickly to determine what I pumped.  All in all the bottles are adequate, but find some type of travel cap because the sealing discs will eye your sink drain never to be seen again.
