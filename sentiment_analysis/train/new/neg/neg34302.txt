I purchased these because my little seems to have a hole in her lip because she is getting to much to quickly.  I have the sizes that come in the starter kit (1 and 2). The size 1 is ok but 2 is way to much.I purchased these thinking it would be a slower flow  (you would think by the name). Unfortunately when and came it was the size 2. I was disappointed.The product itself is good.  Cleans and sterilize' well.
