I thought I'd found the perfect jumperoo for my second child! She used it starting around 3 months, and was just in love with the toys that came with it, and then with the bounce.I have to give this product one star, however, for safety, which comes first. Some people have mentioned that this bouncer comes off of the floor. That's true, if the setting is not correct for your child's height. My problem, though, as someone else mentioned, is the bar on the back with the sun mirror. My 6-month-old was bouncing away happily until she started whimpering because her head had become lodged under the bar with the sun. I was reading with my oldest not far away, so I was able to quickly respond. I had to pull the bounce seat forward, pull up on the bar, and push her head to get it out. It was frightening! She has a bump on her head where the bar is thicker to hold the teething toys, and I feel lucky that this is all that happened. My husband has since removed the bar, but we don't have anything to place over the holes--this doesn't matter right now because she is scared of it.When I emailed the company about this, I noticed that the product pictures on their website don't show the bar and mirror, only the teething toys. Find that one.
