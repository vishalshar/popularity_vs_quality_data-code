i hate these bottles with the fire of 1000 suns. I give them 2 stars only because the breastlike nipple is the only nipple my daughter will take. If it weren't for that, I would destroy every playtex bottle I came across. My daughter has only been taking bottles for 1 month and I have lost 5 bottles of breastmilk already. These are brand new bottles! The bottom pops off when you put it in hot water to heat up the milk. I need something more reliable with my liquid gold. And my daycare provider keeps getting stuck with a leaky bottle and not enough milk for my crying baby.I have some of the bottles that take the liners, but those liners are so wasteful and kind of a pain. Playtex needs to have a normal bottle that isn't made of 300 pieces where milk can come out of both sides. I understand the concept, but even if my child had gas issues, I can't imagine losing 15-20 oz of breastmilk in one month is worth it. I am trying to wean my daughter off these bottles as quickly as possible but until that happens, I am unfortunately stuck with terrible bottles. Well played, Playtex.
