Dont waste your money on this.  It looks gorgeous, but it's simply not functional and is poorly made.  We received this dresser in the mail last week, to complete our baby's bedroom.  It matches the crib and changing table.  However, the dresser is not made well, and is not functional.  The sides of the dresser seem to be too far apart for the drawers to comfortably glide, so one side or another is not connected.  We put it together and took it apart three different times, thinking we had done something wrong....no such luck.  My husband had to put wood shims on the sides to narrow the space.  It's a temporary fix, but not one that should have to be done for a $300 dresser.  Amazon is sending me a new one, and hopefully it will work better than the first.  Regardless, unless you have the time to send one back and get a replacement, find something else.  I hate to say that, because the furniture is beautiful, but not worth the hassle.
