The product itself was comparable to medela when I used it altogether but I rotate thru 3 sets throughout the day, 2 medela and 1 Maymom.  By rotate I mean I wash all my parts and just grab whatever regardless of brand connect it all and go.  When I used the Maymom valves on the medela shields the fit wasn't as snug.  SIde by side the maymom valves are ever so slightly bigger.  The maymom membrane on the medela valves seemed like they were slightly too big.  The tubing worked on the medela just fine.My one big piece of advice. PAY ATTENTION TO SIZE!  I figured 1 mm wouldn't make a difference but IT DOES! I ordered 25mm and my regular ones were 24mm.  Everytime I used the 25mm my output was lower.  I don't think using Maymom vs. medela was the culprit.  I also used an Ameda and those were 25mm.  I was getting the same output.  Only then I thought it was because of the pump.  Turns out it was the size of the shield.
