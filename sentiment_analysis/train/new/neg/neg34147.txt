I did not have a pleasant experience with this bath. My daughter is 3 month old and can not hold her head yet. I found this bucket inconvenient to use. The edges are high, it made it hard for me to help her support her head and after to access her bottom part for a wash. Maybe when she will have more strength in her neck...in the meantime I don't think I would recommend this product for anyone with a child who can not hold their head properly.
