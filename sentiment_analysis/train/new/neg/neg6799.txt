This is a cheaply made bag...but it's a cheap bag.  So I have mixed feelings about it, it looks nice and works ok, but it isn't holding up all that great.  One of the Velcro strips is pulling away from the lining and we've only been using it sparingly for about a month.  So the quality definitely could use an upgrade, but I am sure it would come with an upgraded price tag as well.  It's cute, the big bag is large enough for 2 kid's stuff, all the little coordinating accessories make a nice cute streamlined set...if only it held up a bit better it would be a 5 star product for sure.
