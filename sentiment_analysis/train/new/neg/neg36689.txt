We bought these for my daughter so that we have more options for her when she was eating. Overall these are a lot bigger than I would have expected. They are very bulky in her hands and she has a little trouble using these especially with the fork. She uses forks pretty well but this one is way to curved and is way too much like a spoon. We all find it a pain to use the fork to pick up food and windup using it as a spoon when frustrated. If your child is petite like our child I would recommend that you keep looking and pass on these. There are so many other options out there that would be better.
