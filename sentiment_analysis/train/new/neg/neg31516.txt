These are good pacifiers up until your child becomes a biter. Mine has successfully punctured his from 13 months, so watch out for that. I have gone through about 8 or 10 of these from the moment he was able to use them (at 5 months I think). Out of all the brands I let him try, this was the only thing that was shaped well for his mouth. Now at 15 months, since he's still chewing off the silicone part, I've decided to wean him off of it. Thanks for the good times, old friend. Hopefully you're still around if we ever decide to have another baby. :)
