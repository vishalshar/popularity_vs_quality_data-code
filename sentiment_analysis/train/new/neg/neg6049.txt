I am a cloth diaper mama, no disposables at my house. So when my lo got a little bigger and needed a doubler I thought these would be perfect.I should have shopped around more first. These were $30 and work just the same as the microfiber ones that I got for $12 (sold on Amazon by kiddlywinks). Each pack (this one and the $12 one I bought) has 6 inserts so your not paying for more product. If the price was the same I think I'd still only give these 4 stars because the microfiber inserts are softer (probably because I hang dry them). Not a big deal though because I stuff them in the diaper pocket anyway...Very cute colors though and seems to absorb well. They do take longer to hang dry than the microfiber ones I bought.These also have a front and back (or top/bottom?) side to them. They are not the same width the entire length of the insert. The part of the insert that covers the butt area is wider than the part that covers the baby's front side. Makes sense...
