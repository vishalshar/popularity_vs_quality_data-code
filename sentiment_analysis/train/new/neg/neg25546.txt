I bought this diaper because I used smart bottoms born smart newborns and I liked them. But for a $30 diaper it sure does leak a lot (even after a 6 wash prep). Maybe I'm putting it on improperly or perhaps it needs even more prepping but it seems like baby saturates and leaks each time he wears it. For $30 I would not expect this. I've only been using it when I know I'm going to be changing the diaper again shortly. I'm hoping it magically gets better..
