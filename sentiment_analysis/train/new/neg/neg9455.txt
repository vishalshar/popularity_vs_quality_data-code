I bought Lansinoh double electric breast pump. I used it on 3 babies (the first one is now 6 yrs old). I was extremely happy with it but its no longer available in the market. Yesterday, it died on me while in the middle of the session. I went to the store and debated for a while over what breast pump to buy. Cost was my major deciding factor, since I could not rate each breast pump without personal experience with it and pricey item does not immediately guarantee effectiveness of the product.I blindedly picked NUK easy flow single breast pump. I used it for the first time a few minutes ago and I was not happy with how slow it was, the vacuum pressure was ok, but my biggest problem was the milk backs up inside the area underneath the motor. I had to remove my nipple every after vacuum cycle in order to release the milk into the bottle. Time consuming! Also, I cannot see how much milk is being expressed because the tube where the nipple goes in is blocked by another part.Since the milk backs up into the system, the milk ends up leaking in the area where you connect the bottle to the machine.I won't recommend this product to anyone. I'd recommend the "Lansinoh Double Electric" (and battery operated as well) breast pump.
