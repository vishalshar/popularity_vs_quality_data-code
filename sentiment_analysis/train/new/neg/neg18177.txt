I have been using this diaper for over 2 months and I'm definitely not impressed. The laundry tabs don't stick and resulted in the Velcro snagging the stitching on the lining. I contacted the company and they said someone from the Tots Bots factory would respond but that was a month ago and I've never heard back. And overall I don't like the minky lining. It's not as stay-dry feeling as fleece or micro suede, and it holds stink MUCH worse. My son is one of those EFB babies who only poops once a week, so it's a massive stinky poop. I rinsed it multiple times before washing and it was still stinky. It took about 10 washes and extra rinses to get the stink out. I'm very disappointed because I expect more from a diaper this expensive. Plus the prints are super cute and I wanted to buy more.
