I like the pockets all around it. It holds enough for what I need. It seems durable but then again I have only had it for a little under a week. The caddy itself does not have any supportive sides or bottom so it does cave in when empty or less full. The handle makes it a little difficult to get diapers in and out of the caddy. The handle does not stay up and could of been a little longer or stood up. The pockets are big enough to fit diaper creams, lotions, wipes, changing mats, etc.
