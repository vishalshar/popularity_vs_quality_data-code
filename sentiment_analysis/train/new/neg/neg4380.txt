Literally the worst product I've bought in awhile.  I've been wrestling with this for a few hours now just trying to store applesauce.  If there is the smallest piece in the tube, it clogs.  I've had to dismantle it 4-6 times per pouch.  I've had to puree it to the point that it's WAY more water than necessary.  Plus if the system clogs (which it will, no doubt), and you push down, the food will spray all over you.  So after several hours, I've done 3 pouches and have a huge mess in my kitchen. This is going in the trash.  Don't waste your money.
