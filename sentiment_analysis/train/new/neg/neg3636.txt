I really thought the brand name of Gerber and or Birdseye would make quality products. Years ago when my child was young and I used cloth diapers instead of disposable ones, I could count on this brand, along with other brands. Cloth diapers were so much more comfortable for my baby, with no sweaty and painful rashes as many babies get from disposable diapers.However, when I received this order and opened it- I was amazed at how much sizing was in the fabric, how rough they were, and maybe most of all, how very thin they are. Some of them are hardly thicker than gauze. Parts of a diaper may be much thinner than other parts of the same diaper, although none was thick enough to be adequate. I kept them because I hate returning things and I hoped washing them over and over might make them softer so I could find some use for them. So far I've washed them many times, and put white vinegar in the last rinse of some of the washes. The vinegar helps to remove excess soap.  All that washing and rinsing, even in vinegar rinse, did not make the diapers any softer.  I can't think of anything to use them for now.  Perhaps as a 'rag' to wipe up excess paint or varnish? I could have made rags from old soft clothing that was ready to discard, and it would have been much cheaper than these diapers.I do not advise anyone buying these diapers to use on a baby or even to use as a burp cloth; they are not thick enough for a burp cloth, even folded over several times. And if you want to use them for other purposes, such as dusting, just think if it matters to you if tiny scratches are left behind when you dust with these diapers. I am very disappointed in a brand name such as Gerber putting out such a flimsy and sleazy product.
