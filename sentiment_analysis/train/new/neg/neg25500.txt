I ordered this mirror because my baby does not like being in the car and I thought this would help keep her more entertained. Though it is entertaining she still will only deal with the car for a short period of time. I don't give this 5 stars because there is no way to attach this to anything but a head rest and most cars do not have a center head rest. There is no way my baby will be seated on one of the sides of the car (Those are high impact zones for car accidents and it is highly recommended to put your baby and toddler in the middle of the car). I have jimmy rigged it o it will sit in the middle but I can't see my baby and she can't really see in the mirror. defeats the purpose.  Overall this mirror is entertaining and the lights really grab my daughters attention and the music is just loud enough. I like that it has a timer but it would be much better if there was a way to place it in the middle where it should be.
