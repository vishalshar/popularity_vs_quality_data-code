After using this chair for sixth months my opinion has gone from 5 stars to 1. Overall it is a very functional chair but there are a couple minor flaws and then one MAJOR design flaw.First, the cushions can only be wiped down with a wet cloth and the bottom side can't even get wet because it is an absorbent type material.Second, the velcro which is supposed to hold the seat cushion in place stops working properly after a few months and it is because of that fabric I mentioned on the bottom of the cushion.Lastly, the biggest and MAJOR problem with this chair is the tray design. It is constructed of two halves that screw together with a dozen screws and even if you run a little water on this tray to assist in washing it off, the water gets inside the tray and is near impossible to get out. I took it apart once because I could see pink mildew forming around the parting line. Luckily the first time that is all it was. The second time though was tonight before I wrote this review. I took the trays apart and I was in disbelief. There was pink mildew all over the inside of the tray and even food particles that had gotten in. It was absolutely disgusting and makes me furious. I had to completely take apart the tray (there are four other pieces inside the tray that have white grease all over them) and scrub in ever crevice. And let me tell you there are TONS of places for water to sit after looking at this thing. And only two very tiny drain holes for the entire tray.OXO should recall this in my opinion. The tray is a breeding ground for germs and mildew or mold. I will be contacting the company immediately.
