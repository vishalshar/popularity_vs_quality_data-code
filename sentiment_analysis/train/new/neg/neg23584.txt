B/C of how tightly it closes, milk that gets warm will start to come up out of the straw and that's a little annoying.  If you screw the lid on less tightly (b/f it clicks) you can relieve the pressure and have it not do that, but it might spill out of the cup then.  Kind of a small cup (I think it only holds 8 ounces but haven't measured) so I have to refill it a lot, but at least I clean it more often then.  Good value for the two-pack.  Kind of wish you could pick your colors so that you don't end up with girly colors if you have a boy, etc.  Good for water b/c it doesn't spill.
