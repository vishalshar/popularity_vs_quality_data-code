My baby was born a month early, and was too small for the car seat we had. I bought this to go with the Graco Snugride car seat I had to buy at the last minute. We're in an area where walking is more convenient than driving, so we've used it a lot.On the plus side, the infant seat fits just fine. The cargo basket is a decent size: I've fit a messenger bag, rain cover, and 2 grocery bags in it.On the minus side, it's hard to steer. Going forward is fine, but turns can be a challenge, especially on uneven pavement. When folded, it takes up a lot of space in my car's trunk (2005 Pontiac Vibe).
