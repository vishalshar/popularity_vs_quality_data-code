The description of this product is completely wrong. It says: "Can be used in any room of the house including over the bath tub" and " But with the 3 hooks (included) this is also a great product for getting toys and stuffed animals off the floor and out of the way in any room of the house" . I'm still looking for the hooks.Absolutely not what I expect. Very small doesn't hold but 3 animals. suction cups doesn't work... Next time dimensions should be listed in description! The hammock is very small and the netting doesn't stretch at all. I was looking for a hammock to put in the corner of my daughters room to hold all of her stuffed animals.Very disappointed.AMAZON... I live out of US... what can we do?? I need you return me the money i paid for this garbage please.
