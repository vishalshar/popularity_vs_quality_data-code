These liners work well for the price but be forewarned that you CANNOT put them in the dryer. I didnâ€™t think this would be that much of an issue until we brought the baby home and realized the amount of laundry that needed to be done could not be completed in the little free time we had available. I would recommend that if you purchase these, get a few packages to avoid the stress of constant washing and waiting for them to dry on their own. Otherwise spend a little more to purchase some that can go in the dryer such as Bamboo Changing Pad Liners-3 Pack XLarge 26"x12.5". Best for Machine Wash & Dryer. Waterproof, Breathable & Absorbent. Quilted Silky Soft. Antibacterial & Hypoallergenic. For Baby Gifts by iLuvBamboo which are awesome.
