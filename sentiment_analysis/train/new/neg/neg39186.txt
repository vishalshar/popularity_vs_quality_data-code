My 3-month old enjoys this. He usually dislikes tummy time but this interests him so he can tolerate it longer.My biggest complaint so far is that it stunk like death when I took it out of the box today. This may be BPA and Phtalate-free (although the box makes zero mention of either of these benefits), but judging by the smell I can almost guarantee you that it contains PVC. Which if you have researched environmental contaminants at all you would know PVC is frickin' poison. I will let it offgas for a while, but in the meantime and perhaps always, letting him put his hands all over it and then suck on his hands makes me extremely uncomfortable.Also, what is everyone talking about with the valve being hard to fill? They must have changed the design because my water valve is gigantic and couldn't be easier to fill. Please see picture.
