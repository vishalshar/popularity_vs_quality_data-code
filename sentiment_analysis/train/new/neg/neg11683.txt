This is really cute, and I really wanted to love it but I don't. The problem with it is that the top snaps onto the bottom and is super hard to get apart again, it takes me forever to pry it open and I almost pop off the feet every time. I was even cleaning it once and when I finally got it open I was pulling so hard that mushy crackers flew all over the counter and walls. The good part about this is that it is easy for the kids to get their snacks out of, but prevents spills, and it is east for them to carry by holding the arms. It is really cute, i just wish the lid would screw on or something easier.
