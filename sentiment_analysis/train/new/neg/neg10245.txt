I used this stroller pretty much exclusively for my son's first 6 months or so.  Then I started using a MacLaren that was given to me and all of the CitiMini's faults became glaring.CONSo  Stroller is really heavy.  Very difficult to lift when the baby is in it, especially a problem when you need to go down or up just a few stepso  Difficult to keep tracking straight - there's a reason that cars tend to have four wheels, because three wheels are inherently less stable. It always would veer towards the street if the sidewalk was angled. (locking the front wheel solves this problem, but then its very hard to turn). Does not support one handed pushing - veers significantly.o  Too big. Most of the stores in Brooklyn have small aisles.  This stroller takes up a lot of room and is hard to maneuver.  The wheels stick out a lot - significantly wider than my shoulders.  And virtually impossible to perform a u-turn in a tight space.  Also this stroller only barely fit through my building's front door. Also very top heavy, especially with a car seat, but even without.o  A few more minor things  o seems like there's a bit of a restricted view from the seat  o narrow handlebar - stroller is wide, but push bar isn't. Also slopes downwards right where you'd  like to put your hands.PROSo Folds really easily - but because its so big you actually need to fold it a lot where you can just lift and or just roll in with the maclareno The single handed recline is also goodo Holds a lot underneath, but hard to accesso The wheels come off - which makes it easier to fit in my car. Otherwise takes up the whole trunko big wheels make it possible to go through some sand or deeper gravel/dirto rolls very smoothly
