I'm so sad not to like this. I researched and researched, and thought this looked awesome. I tried to wear it a number of times, and both me and my kiddo found it uncomfortable. I bought the insert, but even at 19 pounds, his head still doesn't come up enough to see over the top.The Onya didn't fit my 5'5" 125 lb frame well - the shoulder straps were always twisted in awkwardly. I'm selling mine on craigslist. Wanted to love this so much!
