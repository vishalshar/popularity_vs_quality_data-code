I do love my super undies but be careful I've received 4 so far that the snaps are coming off. The company was very nice and replaced them but it got annoying. I didn't pay to have snaps come off on 4 of my trainers. I wouldn't be surprise if more came off. Which I'm sad about because these are great trainers. They are absorbent and have an extra slide through pocket for extra inserts. The pass through is nice because you don't have to remove the insert it comes out in the wash. They fit smaller so buy a size up.
