Like another reviewer, we REALLY wanted to love this stroller.  We have a Maclaren single stroller and had strongly considered the double, but bought the Peg Perego Twin Aria because it was significantly lighter and had a single handlebar to steer and a single basket.  I am regretting it now!Our problems with the Aria (not in any order of importance; I'm too sleep-deprived to do that right now!):1) The Aria stickers came off after about a week's worth of use.2) The handling is, in my husband's words, "squishy".  We have a 25-month-old and a 3-month old and the weight difference between them makes this challenging to push...because the plastic parts on the stroller have a LOT of give.3) It's REALLY hard to push around the neighborhood over bumps, holes and big cracks in the sidewalk (we live in Chicago).  Just too much give in the steering.4) The basket DOES drag on the ground (I admit that we overload it, but we use this around town and put a lot of stuff in it).5) It's very easy to open and close, as long as you use both hands (if you are holding a baby and trying to do it, it's much harder).  If you have garage space and don't need to open and close it all the time, this will benefit you!!Okay, the good:1) Love the look.2) Love the deep seats (and both recline).3) Love the food trays (and the option to NOT use them).4) Love that it stands up on its own when folded!  Genius.I just expected much more stability for the price.  If you are NOT hard on strollers and don't have to fold/unfold it all the time, you'll probably really like this stroller.  We are just heavy-duty users and need something with more staying power!
