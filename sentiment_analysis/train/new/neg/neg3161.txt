Had such high hopes. I feel in love with how soft and plush the blankets were. And then after 6 months they lost all their fluffiness and matte down despite me following their recommendations to wash either by hand or gentle cycle and hang dry.  I contacted the company and they took days to respond and the best they could do for me was recommend me to use a "pet brush" to help fluff it back up. I own 2 security blankets and the full size baby blanket, I am not spending any more money on these blankets or in this company.  Update: attempted to contact "A Baby Boutique" company - they never responded.  Amazon had to settle dispute.
