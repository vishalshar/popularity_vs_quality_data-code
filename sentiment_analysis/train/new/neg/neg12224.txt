At first I was happy to purchase a sprayer at such a bargain price. I paid about $35 compared to the name brand ones that sell for $50-70. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. The installation was easy, and the sprayer pretty much did what it was meant to do, which is probably why there are so many positive reviews. After two or three months of light use, the sprayer started sticking on. I had to pull the button outward to get it to stop. That worked for a few weeks, but now it keeps spraying regardless of whether it is stuck in the pressed position or not. It leaks really bad too. When you have a toilet full of poopy water, a sopping wet diaper in one hand, a sprayer stuck in full-pressure spray mode in the other, and a toddler desperately trying to dump mega blocks in the toilet, it kind of leaves you in a s***ty position. I probably should have just coughed up the extra money to begin with and gotten something I didn't have to replace. Another issue is that the hose material is not very flexible, so it's awkward and difficult to point in the right direction, and it never stays in place when I hang it back up. My 12-month-old is also obsessed with sucking on it, so now that I already need to buy a new one, I'm going to buy a nice one made in the U.S. that is certified lead free. If you are going to buy this, at least wait until baby is on solids so that if it starts to malfunction you might still have time to return it.
