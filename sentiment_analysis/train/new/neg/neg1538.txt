The product works for what it is supposed to do. However, with daily use the fasteners break off. They last about 6 months. It is the only thing I have found that my kid can't get the stove turned on. So the design is not great, but will still buy again because when it is not btoken it does the job.UPDATED...when I first bought these, they were only ones on the market. I found the safety 1st and bought those. They are far superior! No hinge issue and look nice and not cheep like these!
