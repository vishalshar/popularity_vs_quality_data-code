Faulty product was delivered. Bassinet knit did not have another opening to tuck it in place. The whole unit felt cheap quality. This will not survive a decent travel, disassembly takes a lot of time. Beware of SIDS on the shabby inclined bassinet clothing and stand. Wheel useless if u have carpet at home.
