I bought this to clean my cloth diapers better than my free and clear detergent that seemed to be working for a while since I was experiencing stink issues.  I did a hot rinse no detergent first. Then I added one pack to a small/medium size load in the washer after the detergent and before adding the diapers.  Hot wash, double rinse. Line dried some, tumble dried the rest.  And they still smell.  So either this product didn't work or I need to use more of it. But I thought one pack would do it.  I also switched to all natural fibers because the synthetic ones (microfiber, microsuede, etc) smelled even worse!
