They need to recall this Highchair. I was so excited when I bought this highchair, because of all the features. I have only had it one week and my sons arm has gotten caught twice. It gets so stuck that it is hard to get out. This is horrible. I called graco and I am going to send it back and get a full refund. I am going to stick with my fisher price booster seat.I never write reviews, but after this incident and all the other reviews about babies arms getting stuck. I felt that I had too. Also when I called graco they said they hadn't heard about this before, so I encourage all other users of this highchair, to call. This high chair is unsafe and I don't want any other babies to get hurt, trying to eat a meal.
