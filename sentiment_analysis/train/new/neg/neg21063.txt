The product is GREAT. Best inventions ever created four kids juice boxes.The only reason for 3star review is that it says "ships in random colors" so we told our daughter she was getting some new colors.... ALL three were blue. And she already HAD a blue one. She was not happy, and we though it was pretty lame getting all the same color
