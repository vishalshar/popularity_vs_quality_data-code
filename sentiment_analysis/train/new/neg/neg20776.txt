I ordered this hamper to match my baby's bedding.  Unfortunately it came missing a nut for the screw on one of the sides.  I checked the bow and couldn't find it, so I'm guessing it was missing during construction/ packaging.  Not a huge deal though - we can replace it.  But the wood was also a bit rough IMO too.  We may sand stain the wood dark on the hamper anyway.We have a Lambs & Ivy hamper (same style, etc) for my son's room and it was definitely of better construction.  All that said, visually it looks nice and goes well with the decor of her room/ matches her crib set.
