I do not have time to exchange or energy to discuss it with customer service, so here is the review.Its NOT 34x17. On the picture you see a perfect corner, but it's NOT the design of the cover that I received.The true measurements are 34x14, maybe I am one of those here who got a wrong package. So it will  shrink your mattress a lot, but with some efforts you can diminish shrinkage by trying to straighten it out making the corners very round. You have to release some material by doing ALTERATION in order for it to fit, which requires some skills. If you do not know how to correct this problem by alteration, then I do not recommend buying it. The material is soft and pleasant  to touch but I didn't wash it yet.In order to fit 34x17x1 or 34x17x2 the design must be different (on the picture you see a perfect corner, but mine has shrinked to an ugly rounded)
