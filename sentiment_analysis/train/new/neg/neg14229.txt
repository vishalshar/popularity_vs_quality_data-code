This stroller is great, when it's unfolded.  However, it is difficult to fold up with both baby seats attached.  Once it is folded up, it becomes an extremely cumbersome piece of equipment to lift, carry, and move around.  Purchase this stroller if you have a big vehicle or are not planning to do much travel with it.  When the stroller is being used for its intended purpose, its amazing.  It handles well and has many options, just hope you don't need to take it anywhere you can't push it.
