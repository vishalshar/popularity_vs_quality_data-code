It is cute, although like others have said, it is a cheap plastic case - nothing special. It is indeed the fabric and ribbon trim that are unique. I got quite a few compliments on it. The problem is the cheap plastic case doesn't seal very well. When I put the case in my diaper bag in the inside pocket, moisture was leaking out into the bag. The white part of the fabric started getting a yellow tinge to it because of the moisture. I ended up tossing it after a while as my diaper bag was starting to get a smell and the yellowish color on the white didn't look all that good. I guess I could have rubber banded it to close it tighter or put it in a ziplock, but felt that for the price I paid, I shouldn't have to do that and deal with the inconvenience.
