We bought it so that we could bring our bugaboo on our flights. In the end we never actually used it.  Travelling with a baby means taking a lot of stuff already. Since I am usually the mule on the trips (wife takes the baby and some small stuff) I dont have enough hands to carry the luggage let alone bring a bag that fills the trunk of many cars already.  So it ended up lying in the basement, collecting dust.. Don't get me wrong, its nicely designed with separate storage for the wheels etc. I tried packing it once but ended up taking an umbrella stroler. It may be useful for long trips where you stay with family on one spot but the mere size of it will likely prevent you from taking it on shorter trips.  We ended up using an umbrella stroller, ergo baby carier, deuter kid comfort III for all kinds of shorter trips where we needed to fly.  After going through the first year with a kid and having travelled various times with the plane I would recommend to take as little as you can as carry on cause the only thing you need is stuff to keep the baby happy...
