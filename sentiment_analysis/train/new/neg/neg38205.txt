This toy is somewhat heavy for a rattle, but since my baby is larger than average, he has no trouble lifting it and shaking it. However, he prefers his other toys. I think it's because the fruit shapes on this rattle have only a small space within which to move. Also, the tail on this monkey does nothing - it is rigid and does not move. I think the toy would be more fun if the tail was able to bend and/or move. Also, from a practicality standpoint, since this rattle is rather heavy, it could really hurt if your baby threw it at you, or at another baby.Here are the toys my baby prefers, all of whiche are available through Amazon:Ocean Wonder Seahorse Rattle by Fischer-PriceSophie the Giraffe Teether by VulliPlay and Grow Mortimer the Moose by Lamaze
