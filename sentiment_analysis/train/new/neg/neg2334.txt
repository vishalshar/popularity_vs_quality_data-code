Have had this stroller for 2 1/2 years and was bought after what I thought was careful consideration.  Despite allowing for its "lightweight" feature, it is very flimsy and wobbled when walking a more than a stroll.  Also accessory pieces broke off quickly with normal use.  Buckle is overtly complicated for a stroller.  Have had the opportunity to use other people's strollers since then and would recommend several over this one.  Perhaps at a higher price point these strollers are wonderful, but this version is not worth the money.  1 handed open/close feature is great and useful.
