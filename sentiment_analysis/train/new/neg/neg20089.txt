My toddler will only take the Binky that is pictured. The ones I received are ANGLED Binkys and she refuses to take them. I thought maybe I ordered the angled ones in error because I was so excited about the price (the ones pictured are selling for MUCH HIGHER because Playtex has discontinued them) but upon looking at the advertised photo once again, I see that it wasn't my error.  It was a major disappointment to receive the wrong Binkys.  I could purchase the angled ones anywhere, for less than what I paid for these. Nonetheless, it was a waste of money because they are just sitting in a container with the rest of the pacifiers my baby has rejected.
