You get what you pay for. My baby is 5.5 months old and I'm tired of washing a gazillion Dr. Brown's bottles and parts everyday. I felt that he was old enough to move to a simpler bottle. I really enjoyed the skinny streamlined look of the Dr. Brown's standard bottles and wanted something similar. I found these Evenflo bottles with decent reviews. A pack of 3 are only $6 so I shouldn't expect too much but the collars on these bottles are very flimsy and cheap. The nipples do not vent as per the description here, causing my baby to suck and suck until the nipple is collapsed making him work hard to drink. The bottle also drips like mad, I don't know how much milk has ended up on my baby's chest! And don't get me started on the bubbles!!! The milk bubbles up like it would if someone was blowing into a straw. Hey, I know my baby is smart but I don't think he knows how to blow yet!! I've tried this bottle with their classic nipples, the new + nipples, Dr. Brown's nipples, Parent's Choice nipples and collars, and they are all less than ideal. Here I go again, crawling back to Dr. Brown.
