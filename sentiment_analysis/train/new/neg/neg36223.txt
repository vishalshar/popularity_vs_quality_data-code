Cute as Elmo is, I can't get over how clunky this box is.  It's pretty heavy for a toddler to hold, especially with a full juice box.  The holder locking mechanism is somewhat difficult to work with and is pretty noisy.  Not all juice boxes fit, either.  It DOES help with preventing the box squishing, though.
