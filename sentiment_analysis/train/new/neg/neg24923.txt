I am fairly critical of design but this thing is just terrible.  First of all it's huge.  Then ends of your cords look like big cubes hanging from your windows with large orange warning stickers.  Second, they are not smooth and easy to use.  The switch that is used to extend the cord is very small and annoying to operate.  Finally, the cord never actually get permanently affixed to the device and if it ever comes loose without a safety pin put in place the device becomes permanently useless. (the pin you would most likely discard once you start using them).  I would ask for my money back if I thought I could get it.  If I could give it less than one star I would.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!
