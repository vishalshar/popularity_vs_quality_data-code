It's complicated like lingerie -- especially compared with something as straight ahead as the Bjorn.  And while the weight placement is the best of all the carriers I have tried, my son likes facing forward -- and prefers bjorn facing forward.  That being said, nothing beats carrying that 15-40 pounds on your back.  I can take a hike with him without a trip to the chiro.
