The product is cute, nice-to-the-touch soft material and just the perfect size for a newborn baby. I was very excited when I opened the package. Upon closer inspection, however, I noticed that the stitching was incredibly unprofessional and flimsy. The stitching was already coming apart where the neck was connection to the cozy and exposing the thread. Given that this is meant for babies who will be sticking anything they can find into their tiny mouths, this makes it potentially a choking threat to my baby. It is such a simple design and such basic stitching, I am surprised that they couldn't make it better.
