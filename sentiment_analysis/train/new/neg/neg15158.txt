The flower cup is pretty cute and VERY colorful.  The top flaps work well keeping cheerios in and are easy on baby hands.  However, the cup has a rim of petals that takes a lot of space.  The handles, which are in the shape of leaves, are on the smaller side, but is big enough to hook through a mommy hook carabiner.  The container is solid in color, so difficult to see content.  So, bottom line, it's a bulky snack cup that functions ok.  Takes up a lot of space with hard plastic.  Would use as a back up.
