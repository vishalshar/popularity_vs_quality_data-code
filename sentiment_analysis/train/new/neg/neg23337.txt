I really enjoyed this product when I received it. I loved that it was larger than the ones I find in the store and it blocked the sun from my infants face from many angles. However after only one short month  (ok. A month an a half) I started noticing the mesh on the bottom that connects the screen to the secure to the car window was ripping and it was exposing a sharp metal rod. I thought it was dangerous because now my 9 month son can reach towards it.. disappointed cuz I had enjoyed it's purpose
