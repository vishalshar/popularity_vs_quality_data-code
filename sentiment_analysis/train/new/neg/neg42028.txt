Here's the thing, the crotch strap is almost impossible to move.  So if you buy this when your kid is little and you don't need to move it than it should be fine.  I thought the quality of the materials seemed up to par, it was given top honors by iihs, it was attractive and seemed like it was comfortable, although we never actually installed it in the car.  I got my little guy all excited about it, let him sit in it on the floor of the family room and decided where the straps would need to go for optimum fit.  I easily moved the arm straps… and then I tried to adjust the crotch strap to the forward position for my tall, slender 4 year old, and let me tell you that it is nearly impossible.  I am a college educated adult and this is the 4th seat I have owned since having children, so it ain't the first crotch strap I have moved.  Actually, I moved the strap on my daughters seat just a week ago with no major crisis and they all operate on the same principle.  This monstrosity, however got thoroughly jammed.  So I told my darling boy to go get his father to see if he could tug it through.  We wiggled and yanked and grunted and groaned and succeeded in doing nothing but worsening the situation. In desperation I sought a tutorial on youtube and turns out I'm not the first person to have difficulty.  There was a video, it involved a hammer and a bit of luck and most importantly watching the video before you got the thing hopelessly stuck, too late for my seat.  So, having something adjustable that is really not adjustable made me start to doubt the engineering of the whole thing.  Don't they test this stuff?  The plastic on the underside of the seat had started to turn white with our herculean efforts, so I considered it broken and sent it back-- which of course meant I had to figure out how to carry the giant box, a baby and a 4 year old into a UPS store… but that's another story.
