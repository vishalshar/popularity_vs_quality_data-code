tl;dr: the new 2014 redesign of the Diaper Genie Elite works much more poorly than the previous design.We got a Diaper Genie Elite when our daughter was born in 2013 and it worked well  -- we'd recommended it to a few other new parents-to-be that we knew.  But after our original unit's trapdoor hinge snapped off, Playtex sent us a replacement under warranty, but this was not the same product we'd expected.  There was a little sticker on the box saying that this Diaper Genie Elite was redesigned to only use genuine Playtex refills (apparently the whole razor-and-blades model breaks for the manufacturer when people decide to buy third-party blades -- who knew?) -- other than the sticker, the packaging is exactly the same as previous models, and in fact for a time you could find both the older and newer models side by side on many store shelves in early-mid 2014 as the inventory turned over.Anyway, the redesigned diaper genie has a door that doesn't consistently close or seal well, even when using the Playtex refills that are supposed to work.  Sometimes the hatch door stays in the up position until you close it by hand. Since the hatch door does not close properly, it lets more of the smell of the diaper pail into the room.  The problem appears to be the interaction between the hatch hinge and the bag cartridge.  Seating and reseating the bag  cartridges does not seem to affect this behavior in any way on our unit.  In the subtle redesigning of the Diaper Genie shape, it has significantly degraded the satisfaction we'd previously had with this product... would have been a four star review, but this gets two stars.  We're looking to replace it.  You probably shouldn't buy this, or if you really like it, make sure you're getting an older unit (which may be hard to find by the time you read this)
