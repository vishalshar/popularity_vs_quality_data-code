I bought these for my 21-month old daughter, after she broke yet another Corelle plate by chucking it off her highchair tray. These Boon bowls might be hard for a younger baby to lift, but my daughter figured out how to pick this up in about three seconds. The "edgeless" design does make it harder for a child (or even a grownup) to pick it up or carry it with one hand. Because the underside of the bowl is hollow, the product has a cheap, flimsy feel, although I am sure that it would survive many drops from a highchair.I also purchased an OXO toddler plate for my daughter, and I am much more satisfied with it. So check that out before you buy these!
