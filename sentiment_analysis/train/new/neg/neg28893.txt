I've taken our RXT seat on 3 round trip flights.  Obviously it's heavy.  On flight 2 I purchased the padded shoulder strap and it works very well and is sturdy but on flight 3 I broke down and got this travel bag because of the backpack feature and the single strap was rough on my back and shoulder.  The pictures you've seen of broken strap clips are not from misuse.  One of mine broke on the first use.  It broke just like the others in the buyer pictures.  I was wearing both straps in a backpack fashion when it broke.  The clips on this travel bag are not as sturdy as the single shoulder strap I ordered.  I worried that the seams of the bag would tear under the stress of the weight, but the clips broke before the seams got the chance to tear.  Stick with the cheaper option of the single shoulder strap, it did it's job and this travel bag won't last long.
