This looks good, which is the only reason we bought it over a sturdier product with better reviews.  It won't hold up, though.  Luckily we only need it for another month or so.  As soon as my son stops spitting up, he can crawl around wherever he wants on the hardwood or rugs.  This was just to provide a cushioned surface where spitup could be easily wiped while he's learning to crawl.  If I were to do-over, I would buy a better product in a brown or other color to coordinate with the room, rather than this product.  I was busy and didn't have the energy to return.Negatives:-The wood grain is an image stuck to the surface (no surprise).  It scratches off easily in tiny pieces, letting the white underside show through.  Other reviewers said perhaps this was fixed.  It wasn't.-Within two days, the surface became rough instead of smooth.  From my baby crawling on it and the dog walking on it, the surface is rough.  I wouldn't let me son crawl on it without pants to cover his knees.-Pieces are too small.  The black version of this covers 16 sq ft and the pieces are larger.  We had to order 2 of these to cover 16 sq ft.  Also, each puzzle piece is only 1ft square.  too small and pieces come apart.-Not very cushion-ey. Only 1/4 in thick.-Pieces come apart easily.  Cheap product all around.  Better mats are thicker and provide more grip.  This is more foam than rubber.-Not a great surface for learning to crawl.  Too slippery compared to other rubber playmats.Positives:-It looks good in my great room (which also has butcher block that this matches).  We didn't want primary colors sticking out in the main space.
