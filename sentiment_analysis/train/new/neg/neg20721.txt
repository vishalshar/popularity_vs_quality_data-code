We bought this sheet set for my daughter a few years ago. We used it in rotation with her other sheets and we liked it (plain white so it went with whatever bedding we had).  When my son moved to the toddler bed we got another set.  Something happened with the quality in a matter of 2 years.  Within a few times of putting it on the bed it shrunk and when you try and stretch it to get it on the mattress the sheet rips!  We are hanging on by a thread (LITERALLY) before the whole set needs to get tossed.  Disappointing because our first set worked well for us.
