I like this product a lot except the nails on top were rusted... Baby is coming soon and I don't have time to return it. It's a bit disappointing and it's pretty gross when I tried cleaning it. And it seems like I'm not the only one with this issue. I don't know why they don't inspect the product before shipping it out.
