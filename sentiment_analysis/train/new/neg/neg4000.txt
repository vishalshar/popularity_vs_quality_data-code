I've really enjoyed Halo's sleep sacks in the past and decided to try the "Early Walker" model now that baby is getting bigger. However, I was very disappointed. After the initial (normal cycle) wash, much of the stitching has completely come undone. I figured if it was just the logo, I guess that's okay, so long as I cut off the loose threads so it's not a choking hazard or able to cut off circulation if wrapped around his fingers, but it's at the seams down in the legs too!Very poor quality work - very disappointed. They seriously need to do some production quality control. :(
