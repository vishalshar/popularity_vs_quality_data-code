This was the only set at Babies R Us that I remotely liked.  I read all of the wonderful reviews about the set on this website, and I'm sorry to say that the other parents must have written their reviews before attempting to wash the set.  I washed the bumper as instructed - cold water, delicate cycle and it fell apart.  For the amount of money that this set costs, I couldn't believe that it fell apart when washed once.  I don't think it will be very practical to have something in the crib that can't be washed without ripping apart.  Very disappointing.
