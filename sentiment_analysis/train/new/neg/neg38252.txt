I purchased this for my 20 month old granddaughter. It arrived on time and was what I expected. However my granddaughter did not seem very interested in it after playing just a few minutes. I played with it myself to encourage her to try stacking it.  She was able to stack it but did not continue to play with it much. I will try again in a few months.
