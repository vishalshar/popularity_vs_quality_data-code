I know some people who like this swaddler a lot, however my experience was better with the Miracle Blanket (It is pricey but worth the extra hours of sleep you will get).Oddly enough it is kinda hard to figure out the first time you use it. The velcro (the part that you stick the tab to) is hard to see on the fabric and you are limited to how big that area is as far as how tight you can make it.The small is probably the right size for most babies. Once ours hit about 12 lbs and 25 inches she was too big for it.
