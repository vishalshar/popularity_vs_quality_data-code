Purchased this cover because Amazon recommended it while I was purchasing a bassinet sheet. The sheet I bought was great, but I have no idea why Amazon is recommending this cover since it is NOT the same size. The cover is much bigger and the excess material poses a safety risk. Will be returning this item right away. The cover itself is probably fine, but make sure to carefully measure your mattress before purchasing. Do not rely on the advertiser's claim of fitting a "standard mattress".
