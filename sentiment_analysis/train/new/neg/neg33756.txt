I love the safety feature of this product but the size is rather small. I had a hard time trying to fit my medications, as well as my daughters, and husbands in one box so I ended up using the box for just the medications we take on a regular basis, that way if we ever have to travel I can just grab the box and go. I would recommend this product more for travel than to store all of the medications you have at home.
