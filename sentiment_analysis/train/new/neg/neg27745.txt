While we absolutely love the MAM pacifiers, I can't say that I'm a fan of the pacifier clip.  We've had some issues with getting these to stay put.  In addition, and this is due to user error, we have lost several plastic holders due to to melting.  We sanitize our pacifiers in the Medela quick clean bags and have forgotten to take the plastic holder off before putting in the microwave - easy to do with two little ones:)  The plastic melts around the pacifier - we've ended up losing a pacifier or two this.  We found some other pacifier clips that work great - Pacifier Clip - 5 Pack Pacifier Holder Set for Boy and Girl - Soothie/MAM Pacifiers - Teething Ring Toys.  So we definitely fans of the MAM pacifiers - 5 stars all the way, we will not be purchasing another set of the clips.
