I love this frame but was slightly dissapointed when it arrived with flaws/scratches on the silver plating (top center of frame). Me being the lazy person I am I do not feel it is worth the hassle of returning or complaining to the manufacturer. Regardless of the scratch, I still recommend the frame as it is very pretty and I do still plan to use it once my baby is baptized.
