REALLY do not understand all the fantastic reviews on this blanket.  It's just okay.  You do get what you pay for.  I have some other expensive blankets that REALLY are a dream.  I'm due with my second...and already bought her "special" blanket.  But thought I'd grab a few others too.  I got really excited after reading how "soft" this one was.  Ummm not really.  Anyway will do for a extra blanket to have around.  Don't be fooled.  I do love Carters though...huge fan!
