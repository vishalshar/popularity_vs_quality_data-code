This pumps works great for the first couple of uses then it starts to lose its suction.  You will go from getting a lot of milk quickly to taking over an an hour (per breast) to get even a few ounces.  As you need to use the pump longer to express enough milk it will not only eat up your entire day but cause a great deal of pain in the process.  After several days of very little suction I developed Mastitis in both breasts due to this pump. When I called to report the issue to Ameda they refused to accept it under warranty for repair or placement even though I had used it for less than 6 weeks! I ended up buying a cheap hand pump that worked 10X better and was more comfortable on my sore chest.  This was a very expensive piece of garbage that I wish I had not bought.  Will NEVER buy another Ameda pump again!!!
