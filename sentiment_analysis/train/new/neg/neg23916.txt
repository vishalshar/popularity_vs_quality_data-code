This was very cheaply and poorly made, I would give no stars if it was an option. I got them as gifts, I ordered one in a seperate order but immediately after an initial order of 3, because I forgot a relative that would also be able to get use out of it. I didn't get the separate or of 1 at all, ever! And the 3 I got with the first order were such a disappointment. It was embarrassing to give them to our family members. The baby doesn't sit confortably and the bar that you hold isn't strong enough, it doesn't feel safe at all.
