I sort of wish that I would have seen this in person before buying it.  I think it may be for children who are a little taller than my daughter.  My little one is 24 months old and she is 33.5" tall.  It's right around the 45th percentile in height.  While I realize she's young, I feel that she's around the age when quite a few parents begin toilet training.She has a difficult time sitting on this potty because the eyes on the frog are a little too tall and wide.  She's not quite coordinated enough to straddle over this to sit properly, so she has been trying to sit sideways on it.  She has also asked for some help standing up if she is sitting on it in the correct manner.  Really the only reason that she can sit on it in the correct way is because lately she has been wearing dresses or going without pants when we've been practicing.  The way that this potty is shaped wouldn't really allow a toddler (who is my daughter's size) sit on this if they had pants on because they couldn't keep their legs open wide enough to use it.  If your little one (and you) don't mind you helping him/her undress before going to the potty - it's not an issue though.  I'm also certain that these also won't be issues as my daughter grows taller.  My daughter has a few potty seats (don't ask) and this is the only one that she's had a hard time sitting on.The potty itself is just as adorable as the photo.  While my daughter knew right away that this was a frog, she also recognized that it was a toilet.  The base is nice and wide, so your little one won't tip over while sitting on it - even if he/she reaches to grab a book or toy.  The bowl is easy to remove and clean.  I think in a few months, it will be perfect.
