Totally disappointed in this product.  It was advertised as a toddler sheet and pillowcase but contained a standard size pillowcase, not toddler size.  The information provided for the product was inadequate.  Fabric for the sheet and pillowcase appears to be low quality. The crib sheet is only partially elasticized. If it wasn't so much trouble, I would return it. I've learned a lesson when it comes to dealing with small, individual sellers. I do not recommend this product.
