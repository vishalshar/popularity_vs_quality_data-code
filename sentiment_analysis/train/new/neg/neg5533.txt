Yeah, this does not work the way it's pictured. It has two velcro straps to attach it to a handle - so whatever angle your handle is will be the angle of the cupholder. I've tried a million times to figure out how to make those straps support a different angle, but they just don't. Our stroller, and most stroller, are at a 45° angle so the cupholder is 45°. You can use it for bottles or as a junk holder but not for actual cups with liquid in them. Pretty silly design and I wish I'd realized this when I first bought it.
