I bought this one because it was slightly oversized and was a better fit for the crib.  The advertised dimensions were spot on. The mattress quality isn't the best and it did compress to the point of needing replacement after a year of use.  It's firm enough for a newborn and didn't have any chemical smells, but our child never consistently slept through the night until we replaced the mattress with a more expensive one.
