I decided to buy this stroller because for its price it offers all the features of the expensive strollers (over $500). I went to the stores and try all the strollers I found where the seat can be taken out and put instead the car seat (with an adapter). Definitely this is the best option for its price and features but If I had the chance to return it and buy a lighter stroller I would do it! It weights a lot but I think the others brands have the same problem. I know I will finish with an umbrella stroller!
