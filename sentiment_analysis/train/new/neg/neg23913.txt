This toy box was so adorable and had great reviews so we ordered it for something stylish to match our daughters room. It came packaged very well, as everything we get from Amazon is. When I opened the door of the chest, I heard two popping sounds and the sound of what I saw where screws coming out of the particle board and falling. Other screws were already inside the chest. It then became almost impossible to close, as the hinge was also bent. Amazon was great with the return and within 2 days, this toy box was picked up and a replacement delivered. The replacement came packaged just as well, and we were able to open the chest with no problems, but every screw that connects the hinge to the door was loose. My husband grabbed a screwdriver to tighten them but they do not catch any of the particle board. It is the only thing I don't like about this, and we'll have to return this one too. I hate to do it because it's beautiful and made in the USA the product info says, but knowing it'll be opened and shut multiple times a day, this one won't last, and definitely don't need screws popping out (that can't be screwed in anyway) that are small enough for a child to put in their mouths and swallow. I agree with another positive reviewer that they wished they didn't skimp and use particle board. A stronger wood and longer screws would make it perfect.
