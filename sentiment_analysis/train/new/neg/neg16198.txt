We really want the pet sensor because we want to keep our cats out of the babies' room, and this appears to be the only choice.  The range is ok -- it works in the yard for the most part, and a tiny bit at the neighbors houses.  It is a little on the bulky side.  After two years, the battery is completely shot, and it just started not working well when plugged in either.  You can't turn off the pet sensor from the remote unit, just the one in the baby's room.  The motion alarm is very loud and annoying.  This is no good for young kids not in cribs who may get out of bed occasionally.  The unit now loses its connection and starts beeping loudly frequently throughout the night.  In the past it only did that occasionally.  I'd say this is a good purchase for the first year but no fun beyond that.
