Originally I gave this stroller great reviews, but since that time I moved to Ireland and now I use this stroller everyday.  It is definitely not made to handle walking on city streets and airport travel because it is basically falling apart on me.  The stroller no longer pushes straight and is hard to turn and the joints are very wiggly and there is no way to tighten them.  If you are using this stroller just around town and in and out of your car it is great for little ones but be advised that it can't handle all that much.
