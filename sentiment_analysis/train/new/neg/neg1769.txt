I think this is a very functional rail for my kiddo's bed but the one I received was not as pictured. It was quite easy to put together and install but the pockets for his personal belongings..my books etc are facing in toward the bed not out toward the room like in the picture.  Since he had already fell out of his captain's bed once I did not want to wait and go through the whole return process so I decided to keep it despite the problem.  Initially I thought that you might be able to swing the legs in the other direction, but they won't lock if you do.  I suppose, in a way, having the pockets inside at closer reach might actually be safer.  At least I don't have to worry about him leaning over the rail to reach things.  In short, it is functional and I will take functional over appearance any day when it comes to my child's safety.  I just couldn't give it a higher rating due to the strange turnaround.
