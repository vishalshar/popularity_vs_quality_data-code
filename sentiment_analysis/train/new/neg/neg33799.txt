I got this for our second seat.  My daughter (almost 4) has the belly bar and I was going to get them both the tray, as these days it helps to have snacks when they're contained and the tray has a place for food and drink.  My daughter was satisfied with the bar and the 'Brica Deluxe Snack Pod' setup and didn't want the tray (she doesn't like change) so I only ordered one.  Good thing, because when in tandem, and both seats facing the same way only one will allow the tray to open.  This is because the tray swings outward, while the bar swings upward.  When they are both facing forward, the tray won't open on the top seat (hits the front seat), when both facing backward, the bottom seat becomes difficult.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase because my son does like it and it's easier for him than the pod would be, but the design is limiting and I'm glad I only needed one.
