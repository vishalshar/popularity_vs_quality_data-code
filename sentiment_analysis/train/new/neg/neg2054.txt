Bought two of these seats about 2.5 years ago.  I loved it because it looked so safe in case of a side impact! This feature of the air cushions on the side of the head really is the best part of this seat.  The buckle which runs across the chest is so cheap my kids can open it themselves (6 & 4), plus it bent pretty much immediately.  Any lenght in this seat and my kids complain of back aches.  Then of course there is the belt, the flimsiest cheapest there is, the thing twists endlessly because it is so thin that it can easily turn over on itsefl in the noose of the buckles.  The seat itself does not have a locking mechanism where you lock the seat belt in place after having it run through the back of the seat. This does not make for a sturdy installation of the seat in the car and it easily moves around even after using both the latches and seat belt to secure it to the car.  After 2.5 years of use I am replacing these with another seat.  I would keep looking......
