The majority of my cloth diaper stash consists of BumGenius pockets with a few AIO.  Buying cloth diapers can get very expensive, but the Kushies were affordable so I wanted to give them a try.  From other reviews I knew the material would be different than the PUL on most other diapers, but I didn't expect it to be so "plastic-y".  I can deal with the material, but my main problem was the fit.  At the time of purchase, my daughter was 6 months and weighed approximately 13 lbs.  The diaper was very high waisted and I had a difficult time getting a good fit on top that also allowed her to sit comfortably.  The diaper is more trim between the legs than the pockets we're using, but the elastic wasn't snug against her skin and we had several leaks.  As other reviewers mentioned, these diapers can be thrown in the drier, but they took forever to dry.  I find that I only use these diapers when I have nothing else available and I won't be purchasing any more of them.
