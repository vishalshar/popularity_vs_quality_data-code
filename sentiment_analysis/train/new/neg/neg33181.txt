This pillow is ok, but I was having trouble positioning my babies for simultaneous feeds. I bought the TwinZ pillow and had better results with simultaneous feeds. The My Breast Friend wasn't good for double football hold after babies were about 2mo old, they hung off the pillow and one baby grew to just hate that. One cradle and one in football hold worked ok, but if one baby had to burp, it would distrupt the other baby and I would soon have two unhappy babies. The TwinZ pillow is better for double football hold as the babies get bigger, and one baby doesn't disrupt the other nearly as badly. The My Breast Friend also is not as comfortable for me to "wear" and the super hold velcro is really annoying when in snags on my clothes and babies clothes. To use on the couch, I sometimes would take off the belt around my back, but that would leave a huge patch of the scratchy side of velcro exposed. I also really love that the TwinZ can be used to prop babies up after eating, the My Breast Friend does not offer any dual uses. While it is cheaper than the TwinZ, it just wasn't good enough for me. My twins are 4 months old and I'm in for nursing for a long haul (babies at least a year old), the My Breast Friend was just not going to get me there.
