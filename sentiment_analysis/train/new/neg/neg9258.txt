I really like the concept of this feeding pad since I nursed.  The only thing is that it is so bulky and to have to remember to pack it everywhere you go was a hassle.  I found a blanket was just as good and much easier since you always carry blankets.  I stopped nursing at 4 mo's, but perhaps it would have been more usefull when she got older if I still nursed, since then she would be more active.  I have not used the bottle feeder attachment and I don't think I will use it either.I will say that it was very usefull when you had company at the house constantly and you wanted to nurse and stay with the group.erica
