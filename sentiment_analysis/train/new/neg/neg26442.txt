In the photo this looked like a good sling. But when it arrived it is one piece of thin fabric. It does have two little areas that are padded. But honestly I have no clue how it is supposed to go. I am not impressed.  It is very small for a larger or larger busted girl. It was murder on my back to carry my newborn in, and I do not use it.  It was cheap yes, but not worth the money. I ended up spending more money on another sling. For longer trips I use an Ergo which is a fantastic carrier.
