This is smaller than the one I had before.  My daughter is very small but every time I used it she still got water in her eyes.  The back part I think needs to be a bit taller so you can put it on their head then lift up the bottom so the water comes out. The water was already coming out before I got it to her head.  She now loves to play with it.
