There's nothing wrong with the product. My baby just hates them and by the way he screams when I try to use them, he seems to be personally offended by them.I thought the latex would be a good alternative to the smoothie which isn't quite as soft as my nipple. While it is softer, it just isn't the right shape I think.So, I'm still a human pacifier!
