Not a fan! Doesn't seem to help prevent the startle reflex. My 10 week old son's arms were still pretty mobile while wearing this and he would startle almost everytime I tried to lay him in his crib. His longest stretch of sleep was 4 hours or less while wearing this. He's sleeping 5 - 6 hours at night with the woombie! Those 1-2 extra hours of sleep make a huge difference to this sleep-deprived mama! To each their own but I've had much better success with the woombie.
