I ordered this item in a 6mo. for my 5 month old grandson who is of average weight and height for his age.  The top part fit him perfectly, but the legs came up to his knees!  Not only was is grossly short, but the center of the crotch has no button, thus it gaps open when he is sitting so that you can see his diaper.  Then, if you pick him up, the buttons pop open.  The button holes are too large for such a stretchy fabric. It also isn't the snow white that you see on line...more of a grayish white.This sucker is going back pronto!
