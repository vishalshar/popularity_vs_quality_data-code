I like this organizer and it hangs off our changing table, but it does need extra support. I tied a ribbon on the front and then tied it to the changing table by the velcro straps. Once I did this and gave it that extra support it has fit our needs perfectly. I found the product a bit frustrating (unstable and sagging) until I made this adjustment.
