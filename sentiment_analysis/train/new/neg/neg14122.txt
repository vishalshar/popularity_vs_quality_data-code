Purchased this to mount a (KidCo) gate to drywall ...On the one hand, you end up with all the parts you need in one package.  On the other hand, there are some very serious drawbacks:1) If your baseboard isn't the precise thickness of the small chunk of wood they include, you're going to need something else to brace the top with (I ended up using extra shims from the KidCo banister installation kit).2) The toggle bolt -- i.e., the hardware you need to attach this to drywall -- is crap.  Easily strips, and will not tighten enough to prevent the whole mess from wiggling from side to side.  A toggle bolt creates a larger hole than the bolt (on purpose), in order for the wings to pass through.  But for an installation like this where there will be stress from side to side (not just in one direction, as when you're just hanging something), you need hardware that plugs the hole to prevent lateral movement.  The good news is that there are dozens of products that will do this, but they're at the hardware store, not in this box.
