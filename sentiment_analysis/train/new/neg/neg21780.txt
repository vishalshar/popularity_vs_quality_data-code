I use the Medela Symphony pump.  I purchased these to replace the original tubing that cracked.  I find these tubes work, but I have to be careful not to pull them from the machine even a little bit because they will fall out.  They stay attached to my flanges well, but don't seem to connect to the machine as snugly.  They are also not as flexible as the Medela brand tubes, but that wouldn't be a problem if they didn't fall out so easily.  They do the job, and are an inexpensive, but less quality replacement.
