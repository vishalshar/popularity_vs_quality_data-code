OK, so this product DOES make transporting your carseat in the airport very convenient. It has wheels, so you can pull it, and a shoulder strap for carrying. BUT, after flying to our destination, we discovered a hole that had been worn in the bottom. This is after one-time use, and we carried it on, we didn't check it with our luggage. (This was before I discovered that my three year old didn't need a carseat on the plane. I would recommend checking your seat, it's so much easier). So on our return trip, we checked our seat, but because we had removed the base from the seat, we lost the connecting rod through the hole in the bottom of the bag. So, all in all, having a carseat bag is very useful, but I wouldn't recommend this one.
