I like the material, I like the colors and my son loves it, which is why I gave two stars.  However, it will not flatten out and remains curled up despite my best efforts and this is the second one I purchased (returned the first).  It is not just that it needs time to uncurl from being rolled up for storage and shipping; the edging is sewed on too tight and will make uncurling impossible.  Sending this one back unless the seller happens to read this and provides a magic fix.
