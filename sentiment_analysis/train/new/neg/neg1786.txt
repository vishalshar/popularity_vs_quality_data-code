This seems super warm and cozy.  I like the material and the feel of it.  However, not sure it works with our Quinny Moodd stroller - the hood is like a vast gaping chasm.  It would be too big for even the largest adult head.  Perhaps this works better with other strollers??  On ours, as you can see in the photos, the hood is so huge that it falls down on itself and completely blocks you he baby's face...I don't see anywhere to adjust the hood opening either.  In addition to the obvious problem of vision obstruction, it seems the huge hood opening would let in a bunch of cold air.  This is likely going to be returned.
