I was, sadly, really disspointed with this purchase. I have some other burpy bids from Aden and Anais and they have been fantastic (I used them for my first child and am now using them with my second). I loved the print on this one so thought I'd get it to add to the collection. However it is much thinner than the ones I already have and not as soft. It also doesn't wash at all well and the lovely pattern is already faded after just three washes. It now looks shabby. Although I understand that the Aden range is supposed to be a more affordable option, it is so far from the quality I would expect from this company that it's bordering on unacceptable. Any saving in the price is cancelled out as the item is not that nice to use and doesn't last. I would adivse spending the extra and buy the original ones or else you'll be dissapointed.
