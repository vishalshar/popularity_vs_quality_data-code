The style of the diaper is adorable but having said that my baby is only 12lbs/3mos and these diapers are too small for her. I suggest ordering the M/L size if your baby is not a newborn. Also, I used a Thirsties Fab Doubler every time with this diaper because the entire diaper gets completely saturated in a very short period of time which is why it might be better for a newborn. I prefer the traditional pre-folds myself and they are definitely more economical.
