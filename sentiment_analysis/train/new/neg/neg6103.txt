I ordered this sleeping bag and the Baby Deedee Sleep Nest Baby Sleeping Bag, Dream Blue, Medium for the winter months, and ended up returning this one and keeping the Baby Deedee.  It seemed really warm and of good quality, but it's just way too big for my son who was around 8 months at the time.  Since he was pulling himself up in the crib and cruising around, I was worried that he would just be tripping all over the place in this bag.
