I would give these 5 stars because they are the proper size and affordable but its hard to overlook the flaws. Number 1 they have 2 holes in the lid so if i move while im pumping my milk will and has spilled out and any pumping mom knows every drop counts. Number 2 the positioning of the wires at first seemed great they are at the back where as medelas are at the top only problem is its more likely to get milk in tubing if it bends to much i bought about 5 pairs since i exclusively pump and 2 sets are broken and do not allow my milk to make it into the bottle i changed the membranes and still no difference but they work perfectly on my other pair. They are also harder to clean because they are pretty much one piece and its difficult to remove the yellow part.
