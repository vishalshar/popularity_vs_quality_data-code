We were so happy to finally be putting together our son't toddler bed, we had no idea how long it would take and that a number of the parts WOULDN'T FIT!  It still doesn't have one of the side guards on it while we are waiting for a reasonable response from the manufacturer who's response was to disassemble the whole thing and send it back rather than them sending us another of the parts that does not fit.  I was sorely disappointed and I would not recommend this unless it came pre-assembled.Sadly, out toddler is in our bed because he can climb out of the crib and we can't get the nightmare on us elora toddler bed to assembled.
