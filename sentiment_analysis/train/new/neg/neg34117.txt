The buckles are a nuisance to operate, but once the child is installed into the 5-point harness, it is excellent (our child used it from 4 months, and was secure well before she could sit up on her own).  Wheels are not removeable and are not friendly to wood floors.  It is very handy to be able to remove the seat and convert to a high chair that can be strapped into a regular chair when at a restaurant or elsewhere.  More attractive than some plastic high chairs, but still ugly.  The clear plastic tray-cover is dishwasher safe but, probably like most of these, will barely fit in the dishwasher (lower rack only, and everything else has to be fit in around it).
