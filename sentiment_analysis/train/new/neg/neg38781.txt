This tub is ok. Size wise it fits my little smaller than average 2 year old and it's held up for a couple of weeks so far. The biggest downfall on this tub is there is no drain. My son likes bubbles in his bath so every night we have to use a cup to scoop water and bubbles out towards the end of the bath so we can properly rinse him off. It's really a pain in the butt. I also don't think that the pillow is necessary and it takes up valuable tub space. My kid isn't lounging in the bathtub like an adult would... he's playing with toys so that extra real estate would be better served for more toys!
