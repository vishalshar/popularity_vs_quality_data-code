My niece has this potty & I tried to get my son to use it while we were visiting on vacation. We were there 5 days & I couldn't get him to use it even once (although he has no problem using other pottys). While it certainly is cute, there are several major design flaws: (In no particular order)1. Even though my son never actually used it, I got curious & decided to take it apart to see how you would empty it - talk about a pain in the neck! There's no way a young child could figure this out in order to do it on their own.2. Several other reviews mentioned that the slash guard (I can't remember what it's actually called) comes off really easily. My son figured that out in no time & then I couldn't get him to leave it alone.3. Every time my son sat on it, he squirmed around & said "owie". Just looking at it - it doesn't look very comfortable.4. Several other reviews also mentioned how Elmo talks when you bump his hand (which is EVERY time your kid sits down on the potty) & it is extremely distracting for a toddler! There were a couple times when my son said "I need to potty", but as soon as I sat him down & Elmo started talking, he was too distracted to do anything. I guess you could always take the batteries out, but then you might as well buy a potty with a better design.My recommendation - the Baby Bjorn potty. Simple design, comfortable, easy to clean out (even for my 2-yr old), doesn't stick out like a sore thumb in your bathroom.
