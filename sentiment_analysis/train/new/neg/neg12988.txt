so, I insisted on purchasing this odorless diaper pail (not cheap) for our first.  I like it has a carbon filter.  I really like it has locking handles to keep walking baby hands out.  Unfortunately, the plastic absorbs the poop odors and starts to literally ooze poop smell.  I am not exaggerating. Our whole upstairs smelled of poop for months upon months. I tried baking soda.  I tried airing it.  I tried scrubbing it.  I tried essential oils (basically smelled like lime scented poop).  I tried odor bag with dry coffee grounds, smelled like coffee poop.  When breastfed poop, it didn't smell to my recollection.  But after solids, you couldn't stand it,  my husband commented regularly on it, and only brave people could add a diaper because of the mind numbing stench when the lid was opened. It would linger in air for five full minutes post opening it.  My extra bags I put at the bottom even absorbed the odor.  I hate this expensive stinky pail.  When my child toilet trained, happiest day of our lives.  We are expecting number two, and I started looking for another diaper pail solution. I saw this pop up in suggestions and had to post my review.
