After a month of baby rejecting bottle after bottle, I was at my wits end.  I thought she would never take a bottle and I had to return to work.  The very first time we I used these bottles she took to it as naturally as nursing from the  first sip.  It seemed like a miracle.After using these bottles for a week, she took any bottle without complaint.  These aren't my go-to, it's hard to get the last bit of milk to come out and there's no air valve, so every few sips she breaks her latch and the suction pulls in a ton of air.  Still, I will always be thankful for these bottles for getting baby started with bottles.
