Plastic deteriorates! Photos show wear after 4 months daily use. In short, we've had to stop using this.  But even when it was new, the gasket between the sliding parts did not prevent leaks very well since it moves out of position more than half the time we use it. When it moves out of position, the cylinder gets jammed up and makes it hard to slide for making food or cleaning. I used to have the white food mill by another maker that had none of these problems.
