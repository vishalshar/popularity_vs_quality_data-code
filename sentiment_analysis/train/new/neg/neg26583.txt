I bought this for use with the Phil & Teds dot buggy with doubles kit (baby on top, toddler in doubles seat) and Graco SnugRide 35.  I'm not sure if this attachment has a defect or if it is only supposed to have one button on the adapter, but it makes the carseat very wobbly and unstable.  I feel I have to hold the carseat constantly while walking so it doesn't shake too much or break off!  I think that kind of defeats the purpose of having the supposed "convenient" option of placing the carseat on the stroller.  You also have to remove the front seat in order to fit this adapter on, but that doesn't bother me much since the baby will be in the carseat for a while anyway.  Is mine defective?  Everyone else seems to have great reviews, but mine is so unstable it seems dangerous.  I can't imagine if the entire carseat and adapter fell to the ground while I was walking!  Please help!
