My son has been teething for what feels like forever, so I've purchased a pretty wide selection of teething toys.I really like the look and feel of this toy, but it doesn't seem to be one that my son picks first.  I think maybe it's not firm enough for him to sink his teeth into.  The bristles really do pick up anything and everything, so if you have pets (or you're a heavy shedder) you'll be washing this toy ALL.THE.TIME!  Granted, toys like this are all about personal preference, so your baby may love it!
