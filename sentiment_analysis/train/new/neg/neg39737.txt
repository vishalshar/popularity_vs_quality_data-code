I was hoping that previous reviewers were wrong, but they weren't. These aren't the same as the Gerber Birdseye pre-folds I bought back in 2010. These are thinner and very rough. I am considering washing them to see if they get any better, but I think returning them is probably the smart solution. So disappointing because I have told other new moms how great these were.** Update 1/3/2015I eventually figured out why these are different. I originally purchased 6-ply cloth diapers (not 3-ply), which are really hard to find and are increasingly expensive. The only place I ever find them is Target. These are ok as burp cloths (they DO soften after washing), but the 6-ply are so much softer, thicker and absorbent.
