The contoured pads in this variety pack do a passable job, but the ultra thin pads are entirely useless.  It's not so much that they don't absorb much liquid, it's that they absorb too slowly to catch the leaking milk before gravity pulls the drip down past the edge of the pad.All of the pads in this pack are also scratchier than other brands I've tried, including the generic ones that the nurses gave me at the hospital after I delivered.Out of all the brands I've used, the best so far have been the Phillips AVENT Disposable pads.  If you're buying from Amazon, the price is comparable to the Gerber pads for a box of 100 and the quality is WAY better.
