I love the Brest Friend pillow but this waterproof one is a total ripoff. It costs considerably more than the regular one and you're just paying for a waterproof cover that is uncomfortable for both baby and mama. I recommend getting the regular Brest Friend pillow and putting the plastic packaging it comes in beneath the cotton cover. Another Amazon reviewer suggested that and it was a brilliant hack which works better and is much cheaper than this one. The pillow itself is awesome. It makes feeding much easier on the arms.
