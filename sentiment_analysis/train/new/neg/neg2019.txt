I really wanted to like this item, since it had the potential to make life easier when traveling with my toddler or just whenever we need to use a public bathroom.  The space for your child to stand on is very narrow and if he/she doesn't stand exactly in the center to distribute weight evenly, it topples over very easily!  My poor son fell off the step stool this way three separate times, and hurt himself (luckily didn't hit his head), so I don't think it was a fluke.  My son is not especially clumsy for a 3-year-old and he is well under the weight limit for this product.  All in all, pretty disappointed as there doesn't appear to be any other product like this on the market. :(
