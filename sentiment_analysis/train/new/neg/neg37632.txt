The back of the seat on my stroller seems to be bending backwards so when we try to fold it with one hand, it gets caught and bends the wrong way. We have to use our other hand to push the back of the seat forward so that it with fold properly. This is also an issue because when my son sits in it, he is slouching because the whole back of the seat curves back instead of being straight.
