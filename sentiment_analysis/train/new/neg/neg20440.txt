This is not a bib, it just tucks into the baby's shirt, assuming the baby is wearing a shirt. I LOVED tuckaroo BIBs for my baby, they were actual bibs that wrapped around her neck and snapped and had the added protection of tucking into her shirt. You could jus tuck a burp cloth into your baby's top and achieve the same purpose of this thing. Plus mine arrived with some nasty gunk on it. I hope it was just jelly but I had no idea so I threw it away. Not sure if it was the seller or Amazon but I sent them a pic and was fully refunded.
