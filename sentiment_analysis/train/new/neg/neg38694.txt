I was so excited to get this as i have recently bought a new honda civic and have a 2 year old.  first, the ties don't line up well with my headrests, but i can live with that.  the main problem is how it says it velcros to the bottom of the seat.  sure it velcros, but to itself, you have to sticker half the velro to your seat.  now, i just got it today, mind you, and i am already unhappy.  it IS hot outside, but 30 minutes after i put it in the car, it has already become unstuck and won't stay.  now, how useful is that?  i'm sure the velcro works, but when you have to attach it like that and it doesn't stay, it's worthless.  i am going to have to find a way to rig it to stay in place because there is nothing else out there like this.
