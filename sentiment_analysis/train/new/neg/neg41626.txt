This has been such a frustrating product to use.  The concept is brilliant - if your baby responds to "shusing," he/she will very likely respond to this product.  The sound is remarkably accurate to the sound I make when soothing our baby, and she responds to it well.  If your baby doesn't respond to shushing, this isn't going to work for you.The frustration comes from the utterly horrible design:1.  The size - it's about the size of a can of soda.  This is a simple machine and I know how big an iPod Shuffle and small Bluetooth speaker would be, and there's no reason this can't be smaller.2.  INABILITY TO USE ONE-HANDED.  This drives me insane.  Think of the situation in which this will be used - you're holding your screaming child, probably getting a little desperate, and now you have to figure out how to use this stupid thing with one hand, or set down the kid.  There are only two controls - one for volume, and one for on/off (which includes two timer settings).  Both are controlled by twisting.  There is no reason the controls couldn't be buttons to allow you to turn it on/off with one hand.3.  You can't set it down.  The only flat surface is the bottom, which is also the speaker...  The designer should flat out be slapped for this.  So you set it down the only way it's stable, and you can't hear it.  Or you set it down on its side, and it rolls anywhere but where you want it to be.  Laughably poor design.4.  The silly lanyard is useless.  Make it a clip so I can affix it to the sleeve of my shirt.  Again, did they even ask a parent how this thing might be used in real life?Don't buy it.  Yet.  Wait six months until an intelligent product designer addresses these issues, and then buy what will be an amazing tool for soothing a fussy baby.
