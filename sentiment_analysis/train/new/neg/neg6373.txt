I should have listened to those that left reviews. It's pretty ridiculous and close to impossible to warm a bottle up with the sleeve on. Not to mention they so hard to put on/take off. Also, they practically cover the measurement of the bottle...not good at all. Bummer. I really wanted to like these!
