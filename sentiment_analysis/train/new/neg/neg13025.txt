I was really excited about these stacking cups as they had great reviews and sounded like a fun bath toy for a great price.I was disappointed with these stacking cups.  The only 2 cups that allow the water to pass through in a unique and entertaining way are the one with 2 holes (head) and then the one with a bunch of tiny holes.  The other ones don't do anything special and the water simply dumps through them.The colors of the cups are different than pictured, but that doesn't effect my review.The cups do connect as shown, but they easily come disconnected.  Overall I don't recommend these if you're looking for a bath toy that provides lasting entertainment.  There are other stacking type bath cups that are a better option.
