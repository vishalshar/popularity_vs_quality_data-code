These booties seem of fine quality and were cute but I can't really give any further information as the boots didn't fit the baby(even after measuring). The booties were also not the version on the booties that were pictured. Infantino likes to change the look of their products every so often, I assume that the boots I got were the previous "look" of this product with a bunny head and bear head. I recommend measuring your child's feet several times before buying and asking your seller exactly what the boots look like before buying.The seller did note that their child grew out of these VERY quickly, which I have heard on other reviews as well.
