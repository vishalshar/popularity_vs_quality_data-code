I bought this for my 2.5yr old. We loved it for the first 3 months, until the seam on the bottom left corner on busted. We use it only on Mondays and Fridays to take her blanket (skip hop owl or lady bug pillow) and a king size pillow case to and from school. It's never overloaded, the 2.5yr old occasionally carried it but it never dragged the ground. I bought this after I bought the matching lunch kit-- which is extremely durable and well made.It is spacious though, so I gave it 2 stars.
