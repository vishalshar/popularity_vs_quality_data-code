My son loves this thing.  I got it for him at about 4 months, so he's had it for a few now and he still likes to snuggle with it and he lights up when you press the head for the music to start playing.  The problem is that everything (EVERYTHING) goes straight into his month at this age, so after just a couple weeks, all the legs got soaked with slobber and as a result, now the internal sounds are all messed up.  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, the octopus will say a different color than the one you're pressing, and it will randomly go off with colors when you're nowhere near it.  The favorite one at the moment is blue.  It says blue about a million times in the course of a minute (blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue), until you go over and press the head or leg to try and get it out of "short circuit" mode.  It can be annoying, but my son still likes it and plays with it daily.  Just wish it wasn't so sensitive!
