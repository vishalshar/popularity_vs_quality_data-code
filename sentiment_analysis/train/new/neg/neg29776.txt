While not as sturdy as I'd have liked, this gate is serving well enough to keep our toddler out of our kitchen. It's also tall enough to prevent our 4 year old from ransacking the refrigerator constantly though we've had to warn him away from the gate several times because he thinks he could climb it and it's certainly not strong enough to bear 45lbs of preschooler weight (neither would I expect it to).We managed to get it together in just over an hour without the instructions since they were mislaid sometime between when we first opened the box and when we actually started to install the gate. All we had to go on were the pictures on the front of the box, so it took a little bit longer than it might have otherwise to get it put together.We bought one extra panel and this length closes off the open archway into the kitchen nicely. I like the fact that it swings both ways and that it's actually high enough off the ground that it clears the carpet in the dining area even though there's a lip between the linoleum kitchen floor and the carpet. The latching mechanism could be a bit less finicky but so far our 4 year old can't open it, so that's all to the good.One other drawback is that we couldn't use the steadying foot because of the carpet/linoleum division since the foot can only be turned one way and would need to cross that divide. It would be nice if they made the foot so that you could turn it in a different direction, because the gate does lose some stability with more than one extension panel attached without it.It's a very nice looking gate though, much more attractive than the white metal ones we've used at the top of stairs before and it fits in with the overall decor of our kitchen.
