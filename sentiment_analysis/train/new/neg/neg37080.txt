I purchased this pillow at the end of December 2010 but did not begin using it on a nightly basis until mid-February 2011. It's now April 2011...and the pillow is already flattening and losing its shape.That said, it is still useful, and I definitely still get some benefit from using it.  The part that goes between the knees is still fluffy enough to provide support and I can wedge the middle bit beneath my belly to get some support there.  Unfortunately, the portion for neck/head/shoulder support is just not holding up.  The filling is becoming lumpy (no, I haven't washed the pillow yet, so it's not from washer/dryer) and it's just not quite as comfortable as it was initially.I expect the pillow will last until the end of this pregnancy, but I won't be saving it for the next one...I doubt it will be able to hold up through another.  I'll probably look for a different body pillow the next time.
