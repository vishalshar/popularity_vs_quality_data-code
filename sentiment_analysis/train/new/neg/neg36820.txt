I feel like an odd ball because there are such good reviews about this bag. It's nice for the price, don't get me wrong. However, I found the shape of it uncomfortable to carry and I didn't want a bag constantly falling off my shoulders. The pockets inside are almost too much. They are small and deep, which doesn't allow for too many things to fit in them besides small odds and ends. I did like the pockets and zipper features on the outside though. Ultimately, I ended up returning this and getting a more functional name brand bag for the same price. One of my other reasons for returning this one was the material not he inside. I couldn't get past the "cheap feeling" of it. It seemed like one snag would rip the stitching.
