We already have a DaVinci furniture set for our 2 year old, so we decided to go with this manufacturer again since we were happy with this brand.  But we have been disappointed in this crib for several reasons:1. There were many blemishes in the finish that were clearly not from shipping.2. The wood is soft and easy to damage... not a good choice for baby furniture.3. This crib has a drawer underneath - a great idea.  But when you remove the crib side and install the toddler rail to convert to a toddler bed, the toddler rail is smaller and you get a 2 inch gap to the top of the drawer, which means you can see into the drawer. That screams "Pull all my stuff out" to a 2 year old. If you look at the third photo in the product listing you will see they have covered the gap with a crib skirt, which I cant imagine is very practical and is somewhat misleading.The crib was not particularly hard to assemble and the style is nice. We will have to live with this because it would be a giant PITA to disassemble this and ship back to Amazon.  The defects are just under that threshold and we will be converting to a full-size bed in a year or so anyway.  But if I had the choice again, I would choose a different product.
