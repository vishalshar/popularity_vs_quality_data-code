we bought this bag a while ago, enticed by the many compartments, the fact that it's cute, and that it's skip hop. within a month, the edges were frayed and the strap broke off. i emailed them, and the kindly sent me a new one. very nice and efficient costumer services department. long story short, we have now owned 4 of these! they keep braking, we complain, they send a new one: broken zipper, inside compartment sewing lose, straps break, etc. after 4 attempts, i stopped contacting them. i don't know what the deal is with these back packs, but they are not worth the effort (or the price tag). the idea is good: they snap on the stroller, they have the right number of compartments, size of compartments... lovely. but seriously, let's have some decent manufacturing please!!
