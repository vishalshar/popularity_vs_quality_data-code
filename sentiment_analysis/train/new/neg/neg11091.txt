I do like this for the reason being that we have a BOB stroller and it keeps my 1 month old steady while laying in the stroller.  HOWEVER, I gave this two stars because the headrest connects to the body-rest using velcro, and it won't connect perfectly.  I took a nice hour long walk with my son laying down, and when I picked him up, the back of his neck was raw from his neck rubbing against the tough velcro.  I stopped using itâ€¦ but I am out of the country so I can't return it.  In my opinion it was a waste of money.  I suppose I could use it with a receiving blanket on top to cover the velcro, but I was too angry about my baby getting hurt that I just threw it away.
