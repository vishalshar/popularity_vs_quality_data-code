I love how you can use it when the child is older and getting ready to walk. The light up part is really fun to watch to child play with.  Though one an two of the toys on it, the child really can't play with because its so tough to push down on or just to move it.  That and I guess i really didnt read it closely enough because it cant bounce or move around like on the ground.  All they can really do it just turn around.  So all in all it's an ok activity center.
