This is an awful product. The instructions are VERY confusing. Even if you're able to figure out the instructions and get it installed, the product is barely functional. The company cheaped out and only put the ratcheting mechanism on the top. This causes the bottom of the gate to be EXTREMELY loose to the point where any child or dog can easily slide under it. My Wife and I wanted to use this at the top of a staircase to keep our 11 mo old from accidentally falling down the stairs. After installing the product we allowed him to crawl up to it as a test and, big surprise, he slipped right under it immediately with no effort.Only putting the ratcheting mechanism on the top portion probably saved this company a couple bucks but made the product impossible to get tight enough to actually work in the process. We will be returning this ASAP and spending the money to get something better. Do not buy. You've been warned.
