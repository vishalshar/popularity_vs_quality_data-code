I bought several of these for my daughter.  First, she was too small, so I swaddled her using a traditional blanket.  Then, they fit, but the fabric would stretch out during the night and she'd get her arms up and wake herself up.  Finally we spent the extra money for an Amazing Miracle Blanket.  It is AMAZING and worth every penny--instead of buying several of these, buy ONE Amazing Miracle Blanket and test it out.  You'll see that I am right!
