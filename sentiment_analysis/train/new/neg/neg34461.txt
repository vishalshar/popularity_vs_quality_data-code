We intentionally bought this for travel as it is smaller than the one we have at home. But this thing broke after a few uses ,..such a nightmare and unbelievable and we were traveling at the time,  had to buy another one in a rush for use.  we  just didn't bother to bring it back and send for replacement even if there is warranty, totally unexpected it would happen when you are out of town. I can understand if it broke after 1 yr  But mine broke within a month,  waste of money!!
