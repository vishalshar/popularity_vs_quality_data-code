I had high hopes for this swaddle since it's made of lightweight fabric and I live in a warm climate.  However, as the other reviewers suggested, it's too stretchy, which makes it easy for a wiggler to get out of it.  Within 2 minutes, my little guy was out of it and not happy.  If your baby doesn't move too much, than maybe it's worth a try.  I have to stick with my Luna Lullaby blankets for now.  They're also lightweight, but it's just a lot of fabric and not everyone can get him in a tight swaddle with them.
