Not for toddlers with eczema. My daughter is 3yrs old and has eczema due to her dry skin. Her skin is usually fine during summer and gets pretty itchy in winter. I used this product during summer when her skin was doing fine, and the itchy red rashes appeared on her skin. When I stopped using this, the rashes disappeared. Hope this review helps for parents who have kids w eczema.
