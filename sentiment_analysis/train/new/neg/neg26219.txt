I bought this chair to go camping with my 15 month old. When the chair arrived there was a small hole in the fabric on the seat and around the stitching. After my son sat in it a few times the holes got a little bigger. It's very hard to get him out of the chair. I needed someone to hold the chair every time. The leg holes are a little small. The tray does not stay flat so the food would fall towards my son's lap. I requested a new product because of the holes in the fabric. When receiving the new chair it was the same only this time the stitching looked like it was done by an amateur. For a $60 folding chair I would expect not to see the stitch that goes to each letter and for a child's chair it should not be falling apart at the seams after a few uses.
