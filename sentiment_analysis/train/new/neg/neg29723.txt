They are a good idea, but not great in use because the milk has to travel too far and the baby doesn't like sucking air.  If the milk stayed up at the nipple it would work, but it drops back into the bottle instantly if suction is lost (from babies mouth).Our baby is accustomed to the regular bottles (where the milk comes out instantly), so when I tried this he couldn't do it.  Basically, he sucks it up but the first 3 sucks are pure air, then the milk finally gets to the nipple but he has lost interest (thinking it isn't giving him milk so why continue), he stops and the milk goes back into the bottle.  Second attempt, same thing.Basically, as soon as you stop sucking for even a millisecond the milk goes all back into the bottle and the lines fill with air that must be sucked out again prior to getting milk.Maybe with practice it could work, but our baby didn't like it, therefore neither do I.  Maybe an older child would have more luck, our baby is only 4-5 months old....and he expects milk on the first, second or third suck, not the fourth....so he quits after the third suck for just a second and then tries again but has to start over...Long story short he never got any milk from this bottle ever...we are saving it in case he can use it when he is older.
