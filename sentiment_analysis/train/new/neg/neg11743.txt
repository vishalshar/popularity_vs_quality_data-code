The technology is so old on this. It has the same technology as one of my old Motorola cell phones from 2007. Have you ever seen Skype where the person on it is moving very slowly, and it's choppy? Well it's like that. The night vision is mediocre. Small hard to view screen. It says color, but I don't see much color in the day light. Would not recommend.
