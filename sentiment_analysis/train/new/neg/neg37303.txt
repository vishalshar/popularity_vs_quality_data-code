These are fantastic, MUCH better than the Mommy Hook, because they are open. And swivel. So easy to use. Also much better than "O rings" that come with diaper bags -- I always lose those.However, I'm now on my second child and I've had THREE different hooks (I had multiple sets, one for each stroller) break recently. I definitely put more than a couple pounds on them, though.So I guess they have a lifespan of 2-3 years.
