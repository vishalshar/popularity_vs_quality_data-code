Not bad for a cheapy one size dipaer. I use it or bed time now since its baggy enough to double up prefolds. I luv the 2 rows of snaps, wish all diaps had em. Overall, no leaks but I'll fitting. There's a lot of extra fabric in the crotch so it looks very bunchy under clothes. I'm happy with it as a nighttime / back up diaper though. I recommend as a filler if your stash is light and its so cheap! Maybe it will fit better as my son grows...
