The purpose for this rail is excellent. It covers the crib in all the right areas so my daughter will not chew on the wood of her crib. However, I am very upset with the color of the crib wrap. I purchased 1 long gray wrap in August 2016 and quickly realized I need wraps for all 4 sides of the crib because my daughter chews on the wood when she is in her room alone. I purchased an additional long wrap and 2 side wraps in September 2016. The 1st long wrap I purchased is a completed different shade of gray (darkest color of all the wraps) and does not match the other wraps. The 2nd long wrap and the 2 side wraps are closer in color, but still are not matching. I have attached pictures below.
