I ordered this product two weeks ago and had to return it immediately. The unit leaks when shut off so much so that my floor was sopping wet. The tray in the bottom is not deep enough to keep the water contained so it leaks over the lip and onto the floor. It is also extremely noisy. I have two other Holmes humidifiers in my house which provide a nice white noise. However, this one sounds like a freight train even when on low.
