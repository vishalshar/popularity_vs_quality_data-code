I'm not sure which Snugride 30 this fits.  I had an older Snugride and needed a new base.  I ordered this due to Classic being in the name and mine was older, so I thought this would be the right one.  It did not fit.  I then ordered a new Snugride 30 and figured this would give me a base for both vehicles.  It did not fit that Snugride 30 neither.  I'm sure there is a way to tell if it will fit your Snugride 30, but I never figured it out.  I returned this base and ordered the one that had XL in the name, even though my new seat didn't have XL in the name, but Amazon Customer Service says it will work.  If anyone has any idea how to tell which Snugride 30 this will fit and how to tell, please put in the comments, to assist other shoppers.
