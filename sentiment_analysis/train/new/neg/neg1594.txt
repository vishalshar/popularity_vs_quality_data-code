What is shown in the picture is a Taller more slender option to the standard shorted and fatter munchkin or other brand dispenser. Bought this for the sole purpose of it being taller, so it would fit better in diaper bad. I have pictures below this one compared to other brands along with what they showed pictures that I was buying at time of purchase. Really frustrating as this item is completely different. Even the despensing cap is different. Ugh.
