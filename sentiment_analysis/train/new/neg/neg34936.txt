I think it's a little ridiculous to spend $20 on a child's towel, so I thought this one was a great compromise.  I just received it yesterday and washed it right away.  My daughter loves hooded towels and I was anxious to use it.It is soft, and like one reviewer said, the initial washing will leave a LOT of lint on the rest of the clothes. (I should have just done a batch of towels, oops.)  It is larger than the other hooded towels I own and lightweight. It is not flimsy, just less dense, but it seems like it would be absorbent.  Would have been the perfect towel for my 16 month old...until I noticed the craftsmanship of the towel is pretty shoddy.The stitching at the top of the hood is already undone.  There's a finger-sized hole at the top and the striped edge has pulled free from the towel itself.No one should buy any product, wash it BEFORE you use it, and then have it fall apart. Very disappointed.
