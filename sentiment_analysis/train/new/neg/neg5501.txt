This is a cute jumperoo but I did not feel like it was safe for my little one. The structure moved so much I felt he was not safe. Plus the sound would all of a sudden have static and the lights would stop lighting up. I would have to keep turning it off and then back on to get it to work correctly. But it would do it again. I don't feel like I should have to keep turning it off Then back on the whole time He's in it. I would not recommend this item unless they do some major updates with the item so everything works right and make the poles not as wobbly. I returned this product.
