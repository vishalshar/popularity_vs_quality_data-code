I bought this bathmat for a number of reasons.  I usually love Safety 1st products, I have the matching faucet cover in that bathroom, and my son's bathroom is froggie-themed.  It seemed like the perfect no-slip mat, but it was too good to be true.  It doesn't stick to the bottom of the tub at all.  Weirdly enough, it does stick to the walls of the tub, but not the bottom.  I could live with that, since my son would be sitting on it to keep it down, except that it came shipped all rolled up, and after two weeks of pressing it flat, it still will not stay unrolled.  The moment I put it in the tub (dry!) it begins to roll back up, and add water and there is no chance it will stay down.  I am very disappointed - I had to go out and buy another mat.  I have ended up using it as wall-art, stuck to the side of the tub, and is very cute.  But it serves no purpose besides appearance there.
