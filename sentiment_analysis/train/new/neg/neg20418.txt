This came rather quickly and it was super cute, my daughter loved it. I was concerned it would keep her up so I didn't turn it on at night for a few weeks. Meanwhile, I was randomly sent a SECOND one, it arrived about a week later, and I only ordered one. The second one didn't work. My husband managed to tweak the wires and sometimes it will come on, other times it won't. Yesterday I went to put the first one on for my daughter, which has been plugged in but turned off. It didn't turn on. Tried toggling the switch, nothing. While I had her on the changing table a few minutes later, it randomly turned on. Then off again. Then back on but poor lighting. Today it wouldn't turn on. Moral of the story, I was shipped double what I ordered and both were faulty, one straight from the box, one a few weeks later. Don't waste your money
