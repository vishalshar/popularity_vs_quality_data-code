I didn't use these much because they were kind of a pain (nice to be able to reuse them, but troublesome to store between uses).  If you're using 4 oz bottles, they fit enough stuff, but not 8 oz bottles.  I only used these while traveling.  They work fine, but so does the dishwasher, and for steam sterilizing, I prefer the hard plastic one.
