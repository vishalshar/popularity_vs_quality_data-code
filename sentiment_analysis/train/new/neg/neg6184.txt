This just didn't work for us. I was hoping for something secure enough to keep my two toddler boys from turning on their light after bedtime. Otherwise they are up all night and I am constantly running down to their room to turn off the light again. I installed it and had issues even being able to flip the switch when using it properly. I had to take it off and reinstall it but I also couldn't get it back off the switch. Eventually I got it adjusted where I could flip the switch while pushing the button down and exerting enough pressure. My 2.5 year old has an easier time turning on the light than I do with this on! The "Press" portion of the plate quickly wore out and it is too loose to keep a toddler from forcing the switch up. His little fingers and leverage from being below the switch allow him to easily turn the switch on without using the "Press" button, whereas I struggle to turn on the light properly using the button I temporarily remedied this by inserting a small piece of folded up cardboard underneath the "Press" portion of the switchplate. This kept it at the right angle where the toddlers couldn't push the switch up. However, after a few weeks my toddlers caught on and learned to remove that first before turning back on the light.It's still on the switchplate mostly because I don't feel like trying to take it off again and it is a mild deterrent on some nights. The design in theory should work but with toddlers in the house it doesn't. Would be great for other uses such as keeping adults from absent-mindedly turning on a switch.
