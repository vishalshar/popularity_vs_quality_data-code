A few weeks into owning this, while walking through the streets on vacation in Istanbul, a wheel snapped clear off. Broken plastic. After dodging cars to retrieve the wheel from the middle of te street, we stood on the road for five minutes trying to figure out what to do. Took it to a bike repair shop where they were able to weld together new parts. It worked to get us back to the U.S., but it's not really usable anymore.  Great concept. Shoddy construction and parts.
