I have had this pillow for a little over a month now.  Overall, I am disappointed in its quality of fill & length/design.  The fill is not moldable & soft, so it just keeps getting flatter and less supportive, week by week.  It wasn't that comfortable to begin with, so unlike a down or down alternative fill, you can not mold it to fit your body or baby bump.  I have to use at least 2 additional pillows to make up for the unsupportive pillow.I hoped this pillow would be superior to other maternity/body pillows on the market, supporting the back and proper alignment during sleep, relieving pressure. I expect a quality pillow to adjust to fit one's unique shape, curves, and sleeping position and alleviate any pressure points.While the increased price for the seamless pillow cover is ridiculous (they should all have a seamless cover for comfort), I'm glad I sprung for it.  Being 5' 8" tall, the pillow only goes to my mid-chin, with my shoulder snugly wedged under the pullow's top arch.  If there was a seam there, it would be even more uncomfortable (as mentioned in many other reviews).While I am someone who has some chronic nerve pain issues that increase while pregnant, I think all pregnant mamas deserve a solid night's rest, while they can still get it.  I expected this pillow to comfortably support my head, neck, shoulders, hips, and spine so I could ditch the 4 pillows I was using before (or the scroodle noodle-like pillow).  As I mentioned above, the whole point of buying this was to have 1 pillow to wrestle, not multiple pillows!  It still takes a wrestle to find any semblance of comfort.If it were longer on each side and filled with a more malleable fill that could support my neck, shoulders, & bump more, I'd be in heaven.
