This is confusing.  There is a pink one, a blue and brown one, and a dark blue with floral that says "colors may vary".  I chose the "colors may vary" option which was $1 more than the light blue with brown.  I was sent the light blue with brown.  I was under the impression that the colors would vary from the style I chose.  Now I have a very boyish diaper caddy for my daughter.  I'm just going to keep it and give it as a baby shower gift.  It's decent quality but I'm very annoyed with the confusion of the color selection process and the fact that I paid extra.
