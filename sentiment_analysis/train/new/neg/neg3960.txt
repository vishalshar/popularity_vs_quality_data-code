This stroller was "okay" for a few months. Other than it seems cheap. The reclining seat is very hard to use and it require two hands. The harness is useless because its about 5 sizes too big and doesn't get tight enough. My biggest complaint is that this stroller just collapsed when my son was in it. The rivot broke that holds the whole thing together and now it's broken. I haven't had any luck getting a refund or replacement. VERY FRUSTRATED. I will never buy from Dream on Me again!
