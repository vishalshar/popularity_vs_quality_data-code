Bought this on the off chance that the other reviewers were wrong....  but alas they were right.  The hooks were rusted leaving rust marks on my hands as i transferred the clothes to the closet.  The velvet was worn off in chunks before i even opened the plastic bags.  If you are looking for the bright blue color in the pic you will be disappointed.  I really didn't care about the color so much but the rust and wear of this item will make them my least favorite hangers.  I haven't broken any of them yet but then again i'm uber careful...  "Closet Complete Baby Size Ultra Thin No Slip Velvet Hangers, Set of 25" was the other brand i tried and they are MUCH better and only slightly more expensive... but i did find that there are similar hangers available at target for a pretty decent price too...
