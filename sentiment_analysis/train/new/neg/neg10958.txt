This seat is a terrible safety hazard. We used it for less than a year (Ours is the Flutter pattern.). I decided to wash the cover today (something I've done before). I loosened the cover, took the harness straps out of the fabric guides, and then eased the guides out of their slots. I guided the cover up over the headrest, and then sat the seat upright to finish taking it off. When I sat the seat up, there was a loud popping noise, and the assembly that attaches the harness to the seat suddenly let loose and FLEW off of the seat with so much force that if it had hit someone, they could have been seriously injured.I have no idea what happened. I was not trying to force the cover off, and in fact, there was nothing attached to the assembly at that time (except for the fabric harness guides, which were hanging loose). Everything had been loosened or removed as needed. It just broke.I'm horrified. This looks like a manufacturing defect. What if we'd been in an accident? My three-year-old daughter might have been thrown from her car seat!
