My daughter is 16 months old and took to the handrail immediately.  Much safer now that she wants to walk downstairs like mommy and daddy (instead of sliding down each step on her belly as I taught her when she could only crawl).Finding studs in our wonky walls was the only really hitch in installation.  I couldn't use the included brackets to attach the rail to the banister supports (as pictured) because mine were too thick.  I think this might be so with many staircases.  Other brackets were included to attach the rail to the wall.
