The first time I used this product for my granddaughter it was great; cleaning it was another issue. It's next to impossible to remove all the food that got stuck in the little holes.  I tried soaking, scrubbing and using a bottle brush, but it was difficult to remove all the food particles. So I checked it out on Amazon and found replacement bags for the self feeder.  I didn't expect them to be better and I was right.  I would like to see the Sassy Company make the replacement bags disposable (one time use) at a really hard-to-resist price with multiple bags in one package. It is a whole lot easier to mash the food i.e. bananas, carrots, potatoes, etc., than it was to try to clean these mesh bags.
