Tried this glider in the store on several occasions, but after purchasing it and sitting in it for any length of time, it hurts my back (and my hubby's, too.)  The wood looks a little cheap and the bottom foam cushion has an indention from our backsides already (only had it two weeks).  Better than most of the less expensive gliders, but if you're willing to spend this much (especially after adding the price of the ottoman, shipping, tax, etc.) consider investing in a better chair; I now wish I would have.  On the positive side, it is light and was very easy to assemble.  We're not totally disappointed, but not totally thrilled, either.
