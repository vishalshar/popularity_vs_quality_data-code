The look of this high chair and also the ease of use should earn it 5 stars but unfortunately it does not have a waterproof/spillproof material and for that reason, I have to give it 1 star. If it's the prettiest chair out there and daily spills and splatters will not wipe clean it does me no good. The first day we received it, we put our little girl inside with a frozen yogurt and discovered that it would not wash clean. It took a ton of work to get that yogurt off the black fabric and also the black clasp and belt!!! I would definitely purchase this brand again but not in this style of fabric. Look for waterproof/spillproof material and NOT IN BLACK.
