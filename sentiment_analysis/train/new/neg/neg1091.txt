The bumper is just okay. I don't like it, nor do I love it. It fits awkwardly and comes in FOUR pieces, causing you to have four ties on each crib rail that it ties onto. I don't know why they wouldn't just sell it in one or two pieces. Also, it doesn't look or feel like great quality. I'd rather have paid a little more for something much better quality.
