Could not see time markings very clearly. It took too much time to figure this bracelet out each time it was time to feed the baby. My older child made me a rubber band bracelet and I wore that, switching the bracelet between my wrists for whatever side I needed to start with for the next feeding. This bracelet came with the indicator rings not on.  It was very tedious to try to snap those into place. Very disappointing that it didn't work out after spending money on it when my older child could have made me a bracelet in the first place and it served the same purpose.
