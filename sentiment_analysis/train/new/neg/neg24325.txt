I read all the reviews and decided to purchase 2 of these for my twin grand kids 2nd birthday.  Since they were $50 each I thought that was an appropriate amount to spend and did not buy an accompanying gift. When I received them and saw how light weight and tiny they were I was disappointed.  They are VERY small!!  My grandson is a few inches taller than my granddaughter and it was really too small for him, the size was ok for my granddaughter. But for $50 I expected more. As far as the quality goes they remind me of the little scooter Easter bunny with wheels my folks got for my little sister 35+ years ago . They can steer this MOPIs which is different from the bunny but the price tag is far too high, I realize now I could have gotten a small big wheel that could grow with them for this price. I was embarrassed when the gifts were opened.
