I bought this slip cover and wish I had left it in the box so that I could return it.  It's better than the cotton slipcovers, but not nearly as nice as the Organic cover. I was at a baby store and felt the Organic slip cover.  It is soooo soft!  It's like wearing your favorite old t-shirt that's been washed a zillion times.  Thumbs up for the organic cover.  The one above is "okay" but not nearly as nice.
