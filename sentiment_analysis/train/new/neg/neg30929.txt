I rated Spike as 2** principally because my daughter only cares about one of Spike's features -- the claw with the little beads suspended in plastice.  As for the rest of Spike, she could care less, rather unlike the reviews from parents whose kids couldn't stand to be away from Spike.  I do like the durability and washability features though, because we throw Spike around the crib and on the floor all the time.
