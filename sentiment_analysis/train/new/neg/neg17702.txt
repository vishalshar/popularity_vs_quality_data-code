Good concept, but could be executed better. I started off using the Lanisoh bags. I bought some of the Ameda bags because I liked that I could pump directly into the bags, and I liked that it had the spout for pouring. I sit when I pump, and with the extenders to pump into the bags, the bags are on my thighs. I have to sit up very straight so that the bags don't bunch and let milk out. Also, the bags are pretty stiff, and the base is not sturdy. I would not suggest putting these bags down for any period of time without sealing them first. I also like to push all the air out of the milk bags before freezing it. Because the bags are stiff, this is hard to do. And the bags don't leave a lot of extra room if you fill it to the allowed 5 oz mark. I'm afraid to freeze milk in these bags because I feel like the milk will expand and break the seal. Do yourself a favor and go with the Lanisoh bags.
