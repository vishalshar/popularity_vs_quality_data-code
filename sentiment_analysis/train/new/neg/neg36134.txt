It's cute.  It lasted a few months before I replaced it.I took better care of it in the beginning and would spray it & hang dry it after every use to avoid mold.  As time went by I'd forget and the mold started to take over.  The squirt toys mold easily too from the inside where water gets trapped.  The other issue I had was that it was too short.  My little guy likes to walk from one end of the tub to the other so he needed a longer bath mat.It served its purpose for a short time, but I wouldn't recommend it.
