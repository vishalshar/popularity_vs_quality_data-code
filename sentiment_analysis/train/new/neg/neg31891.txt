I bought the car seat adaptor that everyone if reviewing for the Chicco car seat and it is not the right product for the Chicco Key Fit 30. I called Baby Jogger (maker of City Mini). The correct car seat adaptor for the Chicco Key Fit 30 is product # 51208. What is being sold on Amazon is not this product. The 51208 is made specially for the Chicco line of car seats. The manufacturer confirmed that the reason your car seats are not fitting is you have the incorrect care seat adaptor. Before you purchase, make sure you are ordering the right product! We are returning car seat adapator I just received to get the right one!!
