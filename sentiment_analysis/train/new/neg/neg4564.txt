After 3 years of use, my first timi & Leslie bag was looking worn and finally needed to be replaced when the shoulder straps started coming apart. I knew immediately I wanted another timi & Leslie diaper bag and purchased the same bag actually, just in a different color. I was extremely disappointed when after a couple weeks of light use it lost one of the side straps brads (which you can see on the top corners of the bag) Another week or so after, a second was lost. I take good care of my possessions and use the diaper bag only once or twice a week. I hope to contact them soon and see about a replacement. I'm just so disappointed after being so happy with my first diaper bag.
