The Summer Infant Sure and Secure gate was easy to install.  It is attractive and the gate itself is made of substantial metal that works smoothly.  I have two gripes, however:  the plastic pieces that allow the door to operate seem flimsy and likely to break.  Why make such a well-engineered gate and then put it together with such inadequate connectors?  Secondly, the gate arrived with small spots of rust at the bottom of each spoke -- clearly there was a glitch in the enameling.  Without these two problems, it would have been great.  Now, it is no more than okay.
