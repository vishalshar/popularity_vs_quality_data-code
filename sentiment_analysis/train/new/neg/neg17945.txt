I ordered the mattress despite size concerns and occasional comments about dipping. I thought, I'll take my chances. The mattress arrived... The description on Amazon says the mattress' size is 27.75 x 52 x 6. The tag on the mattress that arrived states 27 1/2 x 51 7/8. The actual mattress measures 27 1/2 x 51 2/8 to 51 4/8 x 5. I was thinking the sizing discrepancy is a manufacturing process defect but Naturepedic don't seem to think so. Of concern is the length (51 2/8 to 51 4/8). When I inquired with Naturepedic, the CS rep kept referring to what cribs might not work with this mattress and that unfortunately things are not standard when that's not the issue. The actual mattress size does not measure up to the stated measurements on the tag, let alone the Amazon description. And having tried it in two cribs (yes, I have two cribs at the moment), it comes up short anywhere from .5 to 1 inch short. But, ok let's the cribs are not standard. What about the actual measurement of the mattress!?I worry that if a few months old baby rolls, his limbs might get stuck in a wedge. After a few back and forths, the final response from the rep is: "This is not a defect. Crib mattresses are not used measuring with a tape measure. For mattresses that use organic materials we have a device that the mattress is inserted into. The sizing allows for the curves on the corners and sides, etc. I’m not sure which crib you have?  Typically our mattress does not fit Pottery Barn, DaVinci or Ikea. It will not always drop down in an Appleseed. I recommend is the gap is wider than 2” (the two finger rule) that you return the mattress."  Really? We don't measure mattresses with a tape measure? I'm left wondering what to do, as I don't have much time before baby arrives and don't know if I should take another stab at another Naturepedic mattress.
