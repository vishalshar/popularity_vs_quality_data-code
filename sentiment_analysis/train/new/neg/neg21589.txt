My 5 month old likes these. I wouldn't say he LOVES them, but 3rd kid and I have yet to find that magic product by way of toys to write rave review about. He can hold them easily and likes to knaw on the rubber part. The spinny part he tries to shove the whole thing in his mouth but it's big enough that I'm not worried he will succeed. They are cheap enough that I'm not worried if it gets lost. My only complaint is that the balls get water in them if submerged and its kind of hard to get all out. So that makes them a little hard to clean. I submerge them anyways though. Overall good inexpensive toy/tool to add the repertoire of making baby happy.
