There were highly disappointing.  There is nothing unique about these wire covers from a child safety standpoint.  In addition, they are much shorter, more expensive, and less aesthetically pleasing than the wire covers sold at places like Home Depot.  The wire covers at Home Depot also lock much tighter and have a spongy adhesive throughout the surface as opposed to the flat adhesive just on the ends of these.
