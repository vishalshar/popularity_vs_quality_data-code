We have owned this car seat for 10 months, and have used it moderately (maybe 3-4 times/week) for about 8 months. The plastic holding the harness strap adjustor has broken off, in the exact same place that I have seen in another critical review. It was always difficult to tighten the harness, but I was surprised that it broke. If you purchase this seat or already own one, I would periodically check the plastic for wear at this connection point. Our infant car seat and high chair were made by Graco and we have been very happy with these products so I didn’t think twice about buying this car seat. I contacted Graco customer service as the seat was still under warranty. They were professional, if not friendly. I was asked to email photos of the broken part, purchase receipt and sticker with model number on the car seat. My email was immediately sent back as “undeliverable” due to the recipient’s mailbox being full. I contacted them again, and they assured me that my email had been received. The next business day, I received further emails with instructions to return my car seat, postage paid. The cost of the seat was refunded just a few days after I returned the broken car seat.
