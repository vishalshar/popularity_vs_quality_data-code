Did not fit on my crib (orbelle sleigh style). Bumpers come in 4 pieces, one for each side of the crib. The instructions said to use only 2 of the bumpers if they didn't fit right. I didn't really like the idea of spending all this money on bumpers and only being able to use half of them. If the ties were a bit longer they would've fit on the crib. Returned.
