I initially started using these brushes on my baby's Dr. Brown's bottles, but quickly discovered that they are ideal for cleaning the small openings in my pump parts and bottle nipples. The brush that was included with the bottle set was great; the bristles were nice and full. Heavy use, however, prompted me to look for an equivalent replacement. Based on other reviews, I feared that the brushes would not be the same quality. Sure enough, these brushes are not as good as the original. To begin with, the bristles on the brushes I received are blue, which was a little weird but not that big of a deal.I'm giving two stars because having the brushes is better than nothing, and I'm at least still able to get into the small openings. The issue with the brushes is that the bristles are not full enough so it doesn't seem like they clean as well. The worst part, though, is that the lack of enough bristles and the really thick wire (especially problematic at the end where the wire curves to end the brush) cause the wire to scratch my pump parts each time I wash themðŸ˜–The low price of these brushes doesn't justify a return, but as soon as I find a better replacement (going to check out the ones at the store to see if they're better) these are going on the shelf to be used only in an extreme emergency (I hate wasting, so I don't see myself throwing them away!).
