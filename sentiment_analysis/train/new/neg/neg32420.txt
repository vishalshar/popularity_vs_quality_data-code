I ordered two of these monkeys for my boys. One came with the leg seam ripped. Amazon was great and shipped me another one right away, while I mailed the ripped one back. After 2 days, the monkey had holes in its tail and back. I've already had to sew it on 4 different occasions. The other monkey is fine. They need better QA.
