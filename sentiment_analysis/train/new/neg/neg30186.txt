Junk. I use the Munchkin Net feeders for cold bananas, bluebies, tomato, mango, peas etc. You can fit a lot in the munchkin nets. My daughter's teething pain is terrible right now so I've been giving her one of these very few hours with fruit pops, frozen yogurt etc to ease the pain. This Boon feeder is terrible. My daughter bit down and the top popped right off. It doesn't lock closed and there's a piece that sticks up like a spoons and makes filling it hard and also makes it easy for my daughter to bite it open.I am very disappointed in this.Buy Munchkin's instead. You can soak them overnight in equal parts automatic dish washing machine powder/liquid detergent mixed with water. By morning the pulpy stuff that gets stuck is dissolved by the enzymes in the detergent.  Just rinse and ring very well and you're good. So much easier!
