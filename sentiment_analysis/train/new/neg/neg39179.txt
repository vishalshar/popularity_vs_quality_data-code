In the search for the right diaper bag for me (new baby with 3 other kids age 4, 9 and 10), and hoping for a functional yet stylish option, I ordered four bags..this one, the timi and leslie Tag-a-long, and Skip Hop's Studio and Grand Central to compare.  See my detailed reviews on the others as well.  I was very hopeful this would be the bag as I wanted to find one that looked more purse-like and functioned as both a purse and diaper bag.  The brown synthetic material was fine, I didn't notice significant gold streaks as another reviewer did.  The changing pad is bigger than most and folds up nicely, but it is not as nice of material as the Tag-a-Long's pad.  The inclusion of a matching clutch was nice - inside it features 6 credit card slots and a zippered pocket.  The inside of the bag includes 4 elastic pockets, a large snap pocket and a large zippered pocket.  The bottle holder takes up a lot of space inside the bag.  Due to the shortness of the bag, there was no pocket tall enough to hold a pack of wipes upright.  Overall the bag didn't have as much room as I needed, but the real deal-breaker to me was the blingy gold hardware on the outside.  It's just not my style.
