I was looking forward to this diaper depot, but unfortunately, it doesn't fit my changing table as advertised. The description says it, "Hangs on the side of a changing table up to 1 inch in width", but this is not true. The side bar of my changing table is exactly one inch wide, and that makes it too wide to fit. I measured the diaper depot's lip/hanger, and it tapers off toward the bottom, which actually makes the bottom of the lip narrower than an inch (see pictures). The plastic is not flexible, and feels as though it'll snap (and scratch my table) if I force it.The description should be corrected to advertise that this actually fits tables that are less than an inch wide.
