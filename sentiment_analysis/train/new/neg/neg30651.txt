We ordered this recliner, and also own another child's recliner with a cupholder (similar to the Kidz World recliner).This Harmony kid's recliner came with pre-fab triangle-shaped feet that needed to be nailed or screwed on. These do not appear to be the ones in the photo, as the photo shows cylindrical feet. The triangular feet seemed to be larger than the wood area at the front part of the chair. It may have worked, but these weren't what we wanted or expected. Instead of returning the chair, we ordered and installed other cylindrical sofa feet with t-nuts, at a cost of $25 for the feet/nuts, and about 1.5 hours to install with drill & hammer.Because of the feet that now come with this Harmony chair, I do not highly recommend it. However, if you want to add height to fit a child around 6-9 years old (since all the kids' recliners seem to only fit up to about 5 years old), this could be the way to go, since this is one of the larger seats on a kid's chair, and you could order sofa feet in various lengths to make the chair taller.For a much easier install, and also what seems to be a somewhat cozier chair for a little kid, go for the recliner with a cupholder (which is also very useful), such as this one:[...]
