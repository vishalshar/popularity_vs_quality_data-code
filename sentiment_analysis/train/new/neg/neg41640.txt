We bought this for our daugher when she was a few months old since she loved to watch lights and colors.  It also seemed like a toy she could work herself somewhat. The toy is listed as appropriate for 3+ months but she didn't use it (without Mommy or Daddy pressing the buttons) until about 6 months or better for a couple reasons.  The kaleidoscope is heavy - too heavy for a 3-6 month old to lift with any control.  Also, the handles are very wide so tiny hands can't grasp and push the button on the inside to activate the music/lights.  The buttons on the inside are the same color as the handle so little babies can't tell what to do - there's no contrast.  She's 11 months now and after pressing the buttons a few times she's bored and moves on.  It's a cute toy but definately needs 6+ months to begin to enjoy it.
