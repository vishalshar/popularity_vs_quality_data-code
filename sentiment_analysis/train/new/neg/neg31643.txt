I purchased these training cups about a year ago when the spout had a "Y" shaped cut to allow the flow of liquid to pass through.  They were the best cups for transitioning my son from a bottle to a sippy because of the soft spout and the slow flow of liquid.  Recently the spouts on the 2 cups that I own became really worn out with one yellow spout turning black (at first i thought this was mold but I could not scrub/boil it off and realized it was the material itself changing color) and the blue spout finally being bitten through.  I purchased replacement spouts only to find that the cut in the tip was now a horizontal slit instead of the Y cut.  The material also seemed to be a lot firmer making the slit stay open instead of closing immediately once my son stopped sucking.  This allowed for liquids to spill out easily and also for too much liquid to flow out while my son was drinking.  After failing to find suitable replacement spouts I decided to call the manufacturer to see if they still made the Y cut spouts.  I was told they do not make them any longer and that they had changed manufacturers for the spouts.  When I asked if the materials were the same I was told they were.  However I doubt this to be true since the old spouts were much more pliable.  Overall the cup USE TO BE amazing but now with the new horizontal slitted spouts they are totally disappointing.  They leak everywhere!
