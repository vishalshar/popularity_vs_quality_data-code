I was really excited about this bib as it seemed like it would keep my little girl a lot cleaner.  It does, but it has a few flaws.  First of all, it is so big that it's difficult to wash and dry in the sink.  I usually just put it in the wash, but then I'm left without it most of the time since I don't want to invest in 3 or 4 more.  Secondly, my daughter figured out how to take off velcro bibs at about 9 months.  I was hoping this would have a snap as that slows her down, somewhat.  Instead, I have to secure it with a small binder clip, which works well, but is inconvenient because I have to store it out of my daughter's reach. Also, although it's big, I wish the sides came out about where the pocket starts.  It would catch more if they were just a bit higher. All in all, if this bib had a toddler-proof closure and was priced to make it possible to buy say, six, of them.  I'd love it.  It's definitely worth buying at least one to use when you just don't want to mess up an outfit or you're feeding something messy.
