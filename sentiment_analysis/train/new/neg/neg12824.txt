I bought this and after less than three months, it kept deflating. I was given one as a hand me down from my cousin and noticed that it too deflated when ever I tried to use it. It was broken when it was given to me, so I ordered one on Amazon to see how my twin girls would like it. They loved playing with it, but unfortunately, it isn't designed very well and will eventually deflate. Too bad, I would have given it a lot more stars if it didn't do that.
