There are 2 screws on the backside of these locks and they are not designed to be fully recessed into the case.  Unbeknownst to us, every time we unlocked and swiveled these off of the knobs on our cabinets, the screws were dragging along the cabinet door.  Our cabinets are white, so we didn't notice it at first, but soon the scratches were deep enough to be noticeable and beyond repair.  All our cabinet doors are now permanently scratched.  Very unhappy with theseSee pictures.
