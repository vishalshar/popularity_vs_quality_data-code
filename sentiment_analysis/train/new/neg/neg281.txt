These are just one of many cheap child safety products out there than may serve the intended purpose, but may be more trouble than they are worth to make work. It's not rocket science, but it's a total pain in the ass to get the cords lined up in the right direction, with an adequate length of cord, and to get it all wound up and snapped together. You think you finally got it, and then you pull the cord to adjust the blinds and the caps pop apart and now you've got a tangle of strings to untangle. Maybe 'm just missing the magic touch, but..I'm plenty happy rolling the cords into a ball and securing them with a hair clip. it's less work and plenty effective.
