I bought this for my 3 month old because people told me my son was teething.  He enjoys terry cloth toys so I thought he would enjoy these teethers.  He did not like them.  I tried them wet and frozen, wet and refrigerated, wet and room temperature, and dry.  He did not like any version.  I think they may be too thin, since he enjoys chewing on thick toys more.
