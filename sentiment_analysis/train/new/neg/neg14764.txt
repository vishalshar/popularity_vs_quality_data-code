We have the City Mini GT and the Chicco Keyfit 30. It took me over a week to figure out how the heck to get this adapter to work. We even went to the local Babies R Us and asked them to help us, but they said they had also tried for hours to make it work and it just wasn't possible.Here's the trick to make it work with the Keyfit 30 â€” remove the two support bars in the picture attached. Once you take those off the car seat will fit perfectly and snap in. Why don't they tell you this in the written instructions included with this product?It works fine now, and if it had been easy to get here I'd give it 5 stars. But it was a pain, so I'm dropping it to 2 stars.
