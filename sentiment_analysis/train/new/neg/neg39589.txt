I really wanted to like this carrier because it is really easy to put on and take off. I really like the color scheme, as it is not really masculine or feminine. But, it was really uncomfortable for me and my baby. I ordered the size small, based on the size chart and the sizing calculator on the Baby K'tan website. The K'tan hung on my body exactly where the company described it should. It was a cinch to put on and take off, and it was easy to get my son in it. The carrier was really snug though, and my back felt really sore between my shoulder blades while I was wearing it. I followed their instructions perfectly. Also, it was really hard to breath while I was carrying my baby. I couldn't expand my lungs fully. If it was that tight for me, I imagine it was too tight for him. He fussed the whole time he was in the K'tan.I tried wearing it with my baby several times a day for several days, for at least 20 minutes each go, but it never felt any better for either of us. Maybe a larger size would have been better, but the site really discourages you from ordering a size too big, and that a smaller size is better. My biggest beef with the product is that it's not one-size-fits-all. Even if it did fit me it absolutely wouldn't have fit my husband, so he would have needed to buy his own in another size. Then we would always have to carry around two of these things. That's not really practical. I went with the Mamaway Ring Sling Mamaway Unisex Baby Red Anchors Ring Sling instead and I'm so glad I did. It's much more comfortable on my back, though it requires a bit of practice to get on and baby in. But, after a few tries it's become like second hand to use, and my husband is able to wear it as well, so it's more practical.
