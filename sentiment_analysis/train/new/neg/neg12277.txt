I am so grateful for the idea of a nursing scarf because I hated the idea of a nursing cover. It has helped me a lot while nursing in public.That being said, this particular scarf is overpriced for the terrible construction it has. First of all, the edges are not finished, so they roll up. Second, only one side of the fabric is printed, they didn't even bother to put a second layer of this, which results on an uneven scarf unless you spend the time putting it right. Third, it's not long enough.The worst part is that if you go on etsy, there are way many more different scarves that have the finished edge, are longer and are just better quality... And they are not as overpriced as this one.
