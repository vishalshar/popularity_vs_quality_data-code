I like these. Well, I wanted to like them and I wanted my son to like them because they are the only silicone teethers I could find that were actually made in USA. I just don't trust anything from China that my baby will be putting in his mouth. However, my son never liked these because they are round and it wasn't easy for him to put in his mouth and actually chew. He prefers the end of silicone spoons and random wooden teethers because they had smaller ends that he could actually fit in his mouth and chew on. So, after several months of sitting on the shelf, my husband used a sharp knife to cut one of these, so it has two open ends that my son can chew on. He loves them now! I wish they made these in different shapes for that very reason.
