Though the dimensions were correct for my pad, after I washed this cover it was obviously too small.  My pad buckles and will not lay flat.  Part of the problem seems to be the elastic in the cover, which is tougher than a fitted sheet.  In order for any diaper pad to lay flat with this cover, it would have to have a solid wooden or plastic frame.
