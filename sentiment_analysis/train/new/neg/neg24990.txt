I bought this crib two years ago.  When we first received it I was thrilled with the color but a little dissapointed that it wasn't built a little sturdier.  I assume it's made of pine because it's very lightweight.  This is nice when it comes to moving but not so great in the wear and tear department.  Don't be dissapointed if your crib quickly acquires dents and scratches.  It also had some manufacturing defects in the wood like little abrasions.  Also I must warn parents, do not let your toddler jump on this bed.  Ours somehow managed to make the spring pop out of the wood frame.  We still have not been able to repair it, and opted for a much more abuse friendly toddler bed.Lastly, you may notice this crib sits lower than most standard cribs.  This is really great because it makes it much easier to remove a child from the crib, however if you plan on buying a bedding set, you may be hard pressed to find one that won't drag and bunch up on the floor.Although I love the style of this crib, I wouldn't be willing to pay so much in the future.
