I did so much research before I purchased a double stroller and perhaps I should have dug a little deeper. When my second son was first born, the stroller was great. If I had done a review then, it would have been 5 stars.  Fast forward 6 months- stroller ok. Fast forward another 8 months and I hate it. If I could return it, I would. I don't even take it to the zoo with me. I bring my single jogger and wear my youngest in a carrier.Cons:- hard to maneuver. It just doesn't steer very well and my wheels get caught up on ridiculous things like sweet gum balls and little curbs.- the handle is just not wide enough or comfortable to hold. It really should be about five inches bigger so you can have a wider grip and the handle should be round.- probably just a malfunction on my stroller, but one of the wheels locks all the time by itself and sends me off track into the grass.- it's heavy and with a 2.5 year old and a 15 month old it makes it nearly impossible to push up a hill, especially when the wheel locks on me!- the brake is in a spot that is perfect for a curious 2.5 year old to touch. I have been halted in my tracks numerous times because of my sons wandering fingers.- have to remove seats to fold the stroller, not a big deal, but enough to make it a hassle.Pros- all the amazing ways you can configure the seats. Brothers fighting? No problem,  turn 'em both around!For as expensive as the stroller was, I was hoping to love it forever. However, I plan on selling it for half of what I paid and getting something different. Makes me sad.
