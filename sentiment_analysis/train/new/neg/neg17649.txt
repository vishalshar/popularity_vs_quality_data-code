Great item.  I really wanted one w/ my first child.  I decided it was a necessity for my 2nd, especially since I'm short.  We are very much enjoying it.  My only gripe is that it really could stand to be a little wider.  I saw another one for a similar price advertised particuarly on the point of being wider.  Just something to consider.  Also, I now realize that the matching ottoman to go w/ your glider is worth it.  In comfort, this product pales in comparison.
