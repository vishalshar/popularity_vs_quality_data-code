Great idea - these panties work much better than pull-up diapers, which my toddler treated as just diapers, as some other reviewers noted. The problem though that these size 2T panties fit very tight on my skinny 2 year old daughter... I should have bought 3T maybe? I can't imagine a chunkier kid using these. My girl wears regular panties size 2T and those are not as tight as these Gerber's training pants.
