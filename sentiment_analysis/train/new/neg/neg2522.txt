We buy the toddler sized juice boxes. This cup is too big for those juice boxes. The juice box moves a lot and also there is very little portion of the straw that stands out of the cup making it difficult to sip. I have uploaded a picture.Note: The inner dimensions of the holder is 4"(H) x 2.6"(L) x 1.6"(W)
