Unless the edges you're trying to protect are the correct thickness (about 1.5 inches, maybe closer to 2 inches), these cushions won't work for you.  Also, to stay in place you have to use the adhesive strips -- and I cannot see using those on nice-looking furniture with polished surfaces.  We returned ours immediately.
