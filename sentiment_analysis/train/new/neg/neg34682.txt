Be warned, this is truly for kids only, small kids.  At 140+ lbs, it collapses dangerously...  My point is... It looks like a regular step-stool.  Anybody who doesn't realize it's not too strong could easily use it with disastrous results.  It happened in my house, I immediately tossed it.  It should be clearly labeled atop the stool for SMALL KIDS ONLY!
