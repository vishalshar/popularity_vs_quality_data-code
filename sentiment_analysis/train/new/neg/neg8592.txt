This might have been a useful item if I'd had more time to pump at work, but this this took so long to get set up every time I gave it up after a couple of tries. Same thing at home, really. I'd rather just hold the cups with one arm and multitask with the other.Also some weird fit issues. A lot of people recommended getting an extender; I am petite so I thought I would try it first. It was a snug fit, but fine. The problem is the openings for the cups are too wide set for me. I pretty much had to hold them on even with this thing because it was pulling them outward and off my breasts.
