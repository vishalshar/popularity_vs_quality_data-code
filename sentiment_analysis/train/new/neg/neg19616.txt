Buyer beware. Got one a few months ago and the locking handle on the left broke off. Amazon promptly sent a replacement and it worked well for about 45 days but just broke again today. Could be a design flaw. Love everything else about this glider. Tried getting a refund but I can't find a box big enough to send it back to Amazon. Very frustrating.
