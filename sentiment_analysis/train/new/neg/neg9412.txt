This changing pad is indeed larger than the average, infant-sized pad.  But unfortunately, I had to send it back right off the bat because of its strong chemical smell.  This product is advertised as being PVC-free, but whatever alternative it's made of smelled just as noxious as vinyl.  For now I'll go back to using the disposable paper changing pads (which are on the larger side), until my daughter is fully potty-trained.
