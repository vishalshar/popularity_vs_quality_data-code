Pros:  To be fair the stroller frame is nice quality as well as the fabric.  The viola color is pretty.  The hood coverage is awesome, the seat back is nicely structured and reclines in several positions.  There is a nice pocket on the back of the hood.  It is easy to unfold and fold and is light weight.  The handles are an awesome height.Cons:  The description says up to 55 pounds.  While the frame would probably hold the weight the seat back is not tall enough as well as the seat width and depth.  My Granddaughter is 2 years old weighs in at 26 pounds and 34" tall.  Her head was over the top and there was no growing room in the seat.  Also there was no head room between seat back and hood.  When folded the front wheels really stuck out probably making it hard to store.  The basket is made of like a net material which would probably tear easily.I am retruning it and buying the First Years Jet stroller.  The hood is not adequate but for the money it is okay for some outings with Grandma.
