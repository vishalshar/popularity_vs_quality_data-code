Shipping was super fast, even right before the holidays, but not that thrilled with the lambskin. Its very rough and not at all soft. I was hoping for a darker cream color like described and in the pictures, but ours is a pure bright white. The size is 34 inches long and varying from 21 inches wide at the widest area to 14 at the skinny part.  It was the only one I could find that was tanned in mimosa, and on the back there is a sticker that says it was tanned in Poland October 2012. I've seen and felt many other lamb/sheep skins that are out there, and this really is the roughest one I've ever felt! Don't know if this is from the mimosa tanning, but I really wanted to do the best and get something more natural for our little one. A good thing is that all the wool is staying in, vs. some others it can sometimes fall out. This was a gift for my 15 month old, something that I was hopping he would like to snuggle with, but its way too rough for cuddle time. So far he is pretty uninterested in it, and I don't blame him.
