I received these as a gift in the green dots/stripes. They are super cute and the quality seems fine. They are way too small to use as a swaddling blanket, though. My son is one week old and weighs under 8 pounds still and we aren't able to swaddle him with these. They work ok for adding an extra layer of warmth while he's in his bouncy chair or lying in your lap/arms. Also, they have these ridiculously large tags on them. I know that they probably have to have tags, but they are really big and I don't want to tear them off and risk tearing the stitching out.
