I really liked this bag, but I am very disappointed with its durability.  Since I travel with my baby back and forth between US and Tokyo a few times a year, I needed something to protect my baby's stroller.  I purchased this bag before, but it was too small for his Graco.  So I had to return it and go without a bag for a while.  When I bought a new smaller stroller for my son, I decided to try this bag again.  It fit perfectly, and it seemed very sturdy.  I was so excited to use this bag.  Well, the first time I used it, it came back with 12 holes, some quite big and some smaller.  Of course I always gate check my stroller thinking it is handled a bit nicer, but I must be wrong.  I talked to the airline (Delta) about replacing it, but they said since it is not completely ripped, the best they could do is to stich the holes up.  I do not know which company I am irritated more - Delta or Rover.  I would have bought a cheaper bag if I could only use it once.  I tried to contact Rover, but I cannot find its site...does anyone know?
