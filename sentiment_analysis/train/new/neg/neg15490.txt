I bought this to have around for when my 4 year old niece comes over for a sleep over. The cot itself was great, just what you'd expect from a cot. It folded out, mostly stayed folded down on it's own, and seemed pretty comfortable (especially to my cat who decided it was his once it was out there).The "washable" sheet did come with the cot as promised, however I must have missed washing instructions somewhere, because when I threw it in the wash the edges became frayed and the cordage around the edge (the part to help it stay over the corners) became exposed and unsightly.I should also mention that it did not end up working out well for my niece, because she ended up being quite a mover at night, so she wasn't comfortable at all, but that boils down to personal preference I guess. I hope it works for future nieces and nephews! :)
