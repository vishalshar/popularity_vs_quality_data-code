Loved it at first then two weeks in stopped working... I would have sucked it up and spent the enormous amounts of money it takes to keep batteries in this thing to make it work... But it no longer works so were returning it...Update: decided to try a replacement to see if it was a defective product but alas it never worked even once... My little one loves the concept but the defect is in the mechanism they need to look into this...
