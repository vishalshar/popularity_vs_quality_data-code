When my baby was born, the only bottle she took was the Breastflow bottle because all other bottles' nipples had too fast of a flow.  So we used the Stage 1 nipples until she was 2+ months and then I switched to these nipples because I thought they'd be faster.  Well, they are SLIGHTLY faster.  Really, the design of the nipple (the inner and outer nipple) really slows down the milk flow REGARDLESS of how big the holes are... so at 5 months, my baby was SO frustrated with this bottle.  It would take 40 minutes to give a 7-oz bottle.  I wish The First Years made a nipple and collar that transitioned to just one nipple so you could reuse the bottles, but we ended switching bottle entirely to the Avent Natural line.For comparison, my baby took 40 minutes for a 7 ounce bottle with this nipple.  With the Avent Natural line, a 1+month nipple and bottle resulted in a 10 minute feeding - BIG DIFFERENCE!Don't bother getting these nipples... if you're looking for faster flow, invest in a new bottle.
