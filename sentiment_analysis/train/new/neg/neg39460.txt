I ordered this for my best friends new baby thinking it was a small blanket. It even says Blankie really what it should say is Simply Organic dish towel with monkey head because that's the size that it is. A small dish towel. Definitely not worth the money. Loved the idea and concept especially the organic part but in the end I felt bamboozled. Lame.
