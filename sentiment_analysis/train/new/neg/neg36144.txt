For how much this stroller was, I was expecting a very nice sit and stand stroller.  I was very disappointed.Pros: Easy to expand and contact the frame for one or two children. Great sunshade. Large and easily accessible bottom basket.  The ability to switch around cup holders and tray from front and back was very nice.Cons: Opening and closing this stroller is a nightmare.  I carefully followed instructions and even called their customer service about the screeching noise and the difficulty with the open/close switch.  That's just the way it is. (At least the one I had.) If the wheels weren't lined up just right,  then the stroller would get stuck in this half way closed position and it was very difficult to get back open.  The first time it happened,  I got so frustrated that I just left it sitting in my garage for 2 weeks. Not to mention I hurt my hand trying to fix it.The padding on the seats doesn't stay in position and it feels thin and low quality. I was constantly having to reposition and reattach the coverings so my children could sit properly in their seats.When the stroller is fully extended to accommodate two children,  it's difficult to push and the wheels don't turn well at all.  This is also accompanied by a screeching protest from the frame.  Just to be clear, my children are 4 and 2. Both petite for their ages. I was not pushing the boundaries of the weight limit or anything at all.My last issue with this stroller is the length when it is folded up.  I drive a 2014 Subaru Outback and I couldn't fit this in my trunk unless I took off the canopy and tray every time.  That gets annoying when you are trying to get in and out of the car with two kids several times a week.Bottom line,  there are some nice features about this stroller but I wouldn't recommend it.  The design needs some work and it was the most frustrating stroller I have ever purchased by far. And yes I have bought a lot of strollers.  For the price I would buy something else.
