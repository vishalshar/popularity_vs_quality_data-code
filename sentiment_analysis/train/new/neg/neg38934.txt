I have very mixed feelings on these. On one hand, they fit my newborn (6 pounds 11 ounces at birth) better than any other newborn diaper we have. They were AWESOME for the first three weeks. We never, ever had a poop blowout in them, even with exclusively breastfed baby poop.And then they started leaking constantly. We tried all sorts of different ways to fit them on, however they just weren't absorbent enough. I also found that in the wash, I had to snap them so they were "inside out," otherwise it was very easy for poop to get stuck in the crevices of the inner gusset and not get washed clean. At the end of the day, I would still purchase them again because the fit for those first few weeks was amazing, but it was frustrating to see them get out-wet so quickly, especially with their price point.
