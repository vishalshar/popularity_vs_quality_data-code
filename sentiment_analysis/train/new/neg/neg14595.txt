It's now August and I've had this pack and play since May 2011.  It took my husband and I (first time parents) about half an hour to figure out how to put it together.  My son was just under 6 pounds when we brought him home from the hospital and we loved having this to use!  He was so tiny in the bassinet with plenty of room to grow and the changing table is so easy to clean -- great when he'd pee mid-diaper change!  I like how it has the 3 storage compartments on top -- we store wipes in the middle one, diapers in another and then rash cream & items in the 3rd pocket.  One of the things I didn't like about this was the music box died after a month of use.  It was great at first, we loved the sounds but we don't like having to replace things every month -- it gets expensive!  So we put it in storage and attached a cheap musical mobile we had laying around.  I don't care for the canopy because we only use this indoors but I'm sure once we use it as a play pen it'll be nice since we do live in Alabama and the sun is out most of the year.  Another part I didn't care for was the "mattress" (or lack there of).  My son is now almost 4 months & 12 pounds and for the past 1.5 months the middle has sagged.  It's now to the point where when I put him in it he squirms and screams.  It would have been nice if they included a thicker, sturdier mattress.  When he was only 9 pounds at 2 months he couldn't even lay in the changing table portion without it leaning toward the crib, so he'd roll and make diaper changes very difficult.  I was pretty bummed and ended up changing him in the bassinet area instead.  I do however love the neutral colors and the overall quality is very nice.  I know this will last us through future children and be great for traveling.  I just wish they could upgrade some of the "flaws".
