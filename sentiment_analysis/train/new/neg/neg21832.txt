I ordered 2 of these hoping to put 1 just inside my shower/bathtub wall & 1 on the bathroom wall (drywall). The 1 inside the bathtub/shower wall holds well; however it does not stay on the bathroom drywall. I need something secure in both places when getting in & out of the shower. Since the 1 I wanted on the drywall will have to used lower in the bathtub wall when bathing; however, I shower more than I bath. Additionally, they arrived in really poor condition. The outside shipment package was open when I received them & both boxes were crushed. It would be more of a hassle to return them than to just keep them.
