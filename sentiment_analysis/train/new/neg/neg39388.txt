This lock works great AFTER I drilled it directly into the oven.  The double sided tape on this lock is absolute garbage. I pulled it right off with little to no effort so for that reason I deducted two stars. The actual lock itself it great and sturdy and works like a charm.  I drilled 3 holes in the metal bracket and used self-tapping screws to drill it directly into the underside of the oven which is out of sight.If you would rather use double sided tape, I would strongly urge you to buy some "3M VHB double sided tape" which is capable of bonding metal parts stronger than rivets.  If you want a permanent solution, drill it in and never worry again.
