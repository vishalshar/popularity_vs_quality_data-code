Like I said, you get what you pay for. It's a great price but it's a thin material, minimally padded. It does keep my little one from touching the cart or having his skin against the cold metal, especially since it's January right now. It does the job but the toys are not interesting or fun. You have to take the time to use the velcro and strap it on to keep it in place unlike the expensive thick ones that have the elastic band that just pops on. No problems though and I've been using it for 6 months.
