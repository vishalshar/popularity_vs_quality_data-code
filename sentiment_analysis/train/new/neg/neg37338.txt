This does not fit securely. Unfortunately, if it its not from Amazon, you have to pay return shipping and they deduct the free shipping you earned. Thus, I can't use the product and I cannot earn but around a ten dollar refund. This fit is dangerous for baby. Choose to buy directly from Amazon and choose breathable bumpers instead.
