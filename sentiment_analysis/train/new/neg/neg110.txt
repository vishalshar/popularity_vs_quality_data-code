After buying a $10 piece of junk at a local store, my husband and I bought this bottle warmer online.  I must say that it is better than heating water in a pan in the middle of the night.  However, it is certainly not my favorite baby purchase.  The water turns brown after a few uses, which is a minor cosmetic concern.  My biggest problem with this warmer is that it does not heat consistently every time.  The amount of water that heats it perfectly one time may leave it too cool the next or even scalding the time after that.  My only solution is to stand there beside it the entire time it is heating and keep checking it every 20 seconds or so...not the best use of my time.  This is the same thing I had to do when heating it in the pan, but at least it makes me feel somewhat safer.  Overall, it's only average.
