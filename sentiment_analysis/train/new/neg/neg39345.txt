I gave these 3 starts because they were different than what I expected. I was so excited to find something that was not all blue for boys, that I quickly ordered these. Well, I can honestly say that I was really disappointed in these. For one based on the picture they look like they are all green, blue, or white with orange trim. Not the case. The hood is the only part of the towel that has color. Secondly, the green appears as a bright mint color and it is not. It is more of a lime green. Not a huge problem, but if you expected something else it is a bit disappointing. Other than that these towels are super cute!
