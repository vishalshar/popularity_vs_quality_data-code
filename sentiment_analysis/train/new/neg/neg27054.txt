I loved my baby jogger... i wont lie. It was super convenient with the car seat adapted to the top and my 2.5 year old in the front.But once the time came to put the little man in a second seat and have the bigger man in the other, all hell broke loose.The 8m old AND the 2.5 year old would do nothing but kick each other, and scream at each other, no matter which way they are facing. Forward, towards me, towards each other... whatever.Especially when both are facing the world, whoever is sitting in the rear seat literally has NO LEG ROOM what so ever. My 2.5 year old is only 26 lbs and TINY and he was so cramped.So unfortunately i sold my double baby jogger city select WITH the ride on board and bought a Valco Tri Mode EX with the joey seat and ride on board. He doesnt get the recline seat, but hes bigger, and i love the new stroller actually better.
