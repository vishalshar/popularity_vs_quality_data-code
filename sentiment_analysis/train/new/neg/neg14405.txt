I had high hopes for this.  It is really cute and it does what I intended which is keep the paci clean when it falls.  However, the little guy had a lot of trouble opening it and putting it back in his mouth.  He could spit it out just a little, and it would close.  It's really cute, it just became more of a hassle for us than it was worth.
