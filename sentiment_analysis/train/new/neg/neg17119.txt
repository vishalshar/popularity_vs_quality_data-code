The car seat looks great but it is clunky and flimsy...because the back is all one part when the child grows you extend it from the bottom.  The problem is that creates a gap and it is uncomfortable for my daughter.  Also the lights seem to be more a safety hazard than a convenience.  If ther ewas any side impact those lights would shatter right on your child's face.  Will return -not worth the money at all.
