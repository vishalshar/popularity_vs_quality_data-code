UPDATE: reduced to two stars. these diapers do not last. the interior pills badly, the elastic is wearing out after less than a year of weekly use. they leak still and while they are soft and pretty, they are not going to last for the next baby. I like how cute and soft they are but they do not work for skinny babies or any baby under ten lbs. I'll update the review once she's big enough to wear them, but they leaked horribly cuz they don't fit her tiny body
