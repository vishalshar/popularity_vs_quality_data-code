The lactation consultant at the hospital highly recommended a baby sling.  The was one of the three brands she recommended, and of the three was the only one on Amazon.  I bought it, figuring it was worth a try.She said that I'd have both hands free using the sling, and she showed me how to adjust it, so I know I'm doing it right.  The Dr. Sears sling is very bulky and puffy, and it feels almost like I'm wearing a sleeping bag wrapped around me.  I think some of the other brands look more streamlined, but I'm hesitant to throw away more money on slings sight unseen.Although I technically have both hands free, I feel like I'm reaching over the baby, like he's in the way.  Maybe I'm just not a sling person, since I imagine it would be like this for me with any sling.  I'm pretty short and have short arms.  I think it's more stable than the baby front pack, and a lot less awkward than carrying the car seat bucket.  I'll probably occasionally use the sling in cases where I need to carry my baby with both hands free, but I'll probably get more use out of the stroller, especially once he can sit up.
