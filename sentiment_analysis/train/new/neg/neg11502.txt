I layed my baby down in this thing and it BROKE at the end! DO NOT buy this hammock it's horrible. I tried to contact safety first and they told me too bad they can send me a replacement at a good price. Why would I ever want to fix it? I tried to get my money back. This is a horrible product please for the safety of your child don't buy this
