This is my second Snoogle, and I used the first one for just over two years.  I love the shape of it.  Here are the two flaws that I have found.  First, it gets squished within a couple months of use, so I go from needing only it, to needing an extra pillow under it at my head, and then an extra pillow under it at my knees.  The extra pillow also has to be pretty squished, or it makes it too high.  Secondly, it is too awkward to flip over to the other side when I want to flip, so I have to have another pillow alongside me.  When I lay on one side, I have the second pillow as back support and the Snoogle under my leg, and on the other side the Snoogle is back support and the second pillow is under my leg.
