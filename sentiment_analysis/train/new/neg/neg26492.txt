I don't understand. There are about a million fancy (and expensive) "natural breast-like" bottles on the market but they all have the same really long nipples. My baby has a bad gag reflex and gagged with every bottle attempt (and we tried many types!) This one sure looks like a boob, but it wasn't anything close to mama!I was hoping for this bottle to be the miracle it seemed to be for other babes according to the good reviews, but it was a (very expensive) flop!For anyone else with the "nipples too long" issue, try the Adiri bottles. They have the shortest nipples we've found and are the only ones we could get our baby to drink from.Good luck!
