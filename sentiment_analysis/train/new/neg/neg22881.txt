I bought this to replace an 'exact replica' that my son lost.  He knows it's a replacement, so I didn't have to sneak around about it.  This one doesn't have the red/white striping the original had, and the fabric is thinner.  After a couple of weeks, the bottom became frayed and I'm going to have to stich it up.  Of course, my son is a bit rough with it, but the old one had held up nicely for years without so much as a rip.  I am disappointed they diminished the quality.  But I can't return it.  Even with the flaws, my son won't part with it.  If we never find the original, I may shop around for one of the older models to get the quality I want.But if you've never had one to compare it to, I guess it would do just fine.  It's likely not to fray if your baby isn't pulling it like a rope and throwing it like a football.  My son loves the silky inside and the soft 'fur' of the puppy.
