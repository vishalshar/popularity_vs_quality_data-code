Pinzon is the amazon brand so they are not the actual aden and anais...I received four of them but two of them were the same print.  One of my blankets didn't make it in the wash either.  I have the actually aden and anais swaddle blankets and these are very similar, however why not spend the extra $$ for better quality?
