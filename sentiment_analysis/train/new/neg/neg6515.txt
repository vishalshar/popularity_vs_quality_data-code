While the diaper does function properly, I wonder how long it will last. It seems to have a layer of "plastic wrap" as the water proofing instead of traditional PUL. I guess when the plastic layer does deteriorate I can use it as a fitted diaper. Also, the way that the snaps come together is a bit odd. Because they are so close, when I snap my rather small baby into the diaper the tucked outer edges come untucked rather easily and then hang out underneath the waist. It is a little hard to explain. It will fit her better as she gets older and the snaps have to be snapped on the outer edges.
