The bottles and caps are great for pumping, but the nipples for feeding are poor quality. Out of the three pack one had fast flow, one slow flow, and one that was just right....only they were all supposed to be the same. It was a nightmare figuring this out...ended up tossing the nipples and just using this kit to pump and store milk.
