This would be great if you only wanted to put bottles or things of that size in it. But if you want to put little toys, pacifiers, etc in it, they would just get lost somewhere in the bottom. Then dividers aren't sewn into, or connected to the bottom in any way. So small items just get lost in the bottom, and not stay in its own little pouch.
