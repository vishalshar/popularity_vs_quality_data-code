Much easier to use than a cup as the yellow flexible lip on it prevents shampoo from rinsing down into the eyes/face. Update: We had to buy a second one because the handle cracked in 2 places. I think I could have gotten away with covering the broken handle with duct tape but I threw away a cracked piece so even crazy glue was not an option. Cheap plastic.
