Bought one for the first grandchild last year. It was great!  Bought a second one for the second grandchild.  It wobbles.  Tech service person had us take it all part and reassemble.  It still wobbles.  THEN we have to take a 60 second video documenting the wobbling and email it.  The service representative said they would evaluate it and send a part.  I would think for a $300 chair that (1) it would not wobble and (2) the defective chair would be replaced immediately.  My grandson is having heart surgery so we don't need it right away. If we did need it right now, I would really be annoyed at the delay.  But truth is we don't need the hassle at a time like this and like I said with a price tag as it is I was not expecting poor quality control.
