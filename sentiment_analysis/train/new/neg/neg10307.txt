These aren't my favorite, but they are fine.  They fit in the Flip diaper covers well.  They aren't as thin or soft as the Flip brand inserts, and they don't stay as dry to the touch, but they are absorbent, and they do an okay job of wicking moisture away from the baby's skin.  Pros are the color (no visible staining), and the price.  Overall, if say these are great for backup inserts or if you are cloth diapering on a limited budget.
