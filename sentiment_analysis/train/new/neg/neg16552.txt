I like this bag. It works well. If you use the pockets on the inside, it takes up ALLL the space on the inside of the bag. The fabric on the inside can come out of the bag to shake crumbs out but it makes the bag difficult to use because it's very loose on the inside of the bag. If you don't have it stuffed it feels weird and floppy and looks terrible. I've been using this for a little over a year now. I have decided to switch to a ju ju be bag which may fit our needs much better, since I am pregnant, I don't think I'll be able to use this bag another 2-3 years. Not a huge fan. It does do what it is supposed to and holds a good amount.
