I really like the idea of this diaper and it has some great features but, unfortunately, it irritated my son's skin and gave him a rash.  I will try it again with my next child and hopefully will have better success with it because the diaper really does absorb well; I think it's too expensive to have a huge stash of these but they would be good to use for a particularly long car ride or for nap time.
