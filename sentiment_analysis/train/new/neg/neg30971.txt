As many others have stated, this device frequently looses connection! We have SOLID WiFi coverage in our place, and its not uncommon for the Baby Ping monitor to disconnect. But...we we're willing to deal with it. And I got a response for a few support concerns I had...the responses have stopped, which is very concerning, because now it has failed completely! It's just over a year old...so it's just outside the warranty period (perfect!!). The sound has failed, as others have mentioned, rendering it nearly useless. I was relatively happy, and then it's just gotten worse and worse! I can't compare, because I haven't used any other products...but I've got to say...for $200, I expect better!! I'd spend your money on something else!!
