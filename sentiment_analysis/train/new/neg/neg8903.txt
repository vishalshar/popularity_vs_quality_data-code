This clock arrived with a bent second hand.  Now I have to go to the trouble to return the clock when they shipped me a damaged item.  Very annoying.Also, I thought the picture makes it look like the clock is made out of metal.  However, it's made out of cardboard and the clock hands are super flimsy.  I've now read through the reviews and realize that other people complained about this too.  I probably should have paid better attention.  But it's not clear from the item's description that it's made out of cardboard.  It's very cheap materials and I don't think the clock is worth more than $5.
