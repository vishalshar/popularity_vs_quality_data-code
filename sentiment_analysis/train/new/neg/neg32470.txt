I purchased this mobile along with the 6 piece crib set, however, discovered it to be of inferior quality compared to the rest of the crib set. The clamp is not very sturdy and the mobile could fall over very easily. Also, the music sounds very artificial and is not soothing at all. The 4 animals on the mobile do not provide a baby with as much visual stimulation as most other mobiles provide, especially for the price.
