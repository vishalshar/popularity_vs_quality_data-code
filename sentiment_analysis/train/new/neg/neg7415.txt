We bought this swaddler, along with the miracle blanket.  Even though the miracle blanket is more expensive, we believe it works better and we will be able to use it longer.  The Swaddle me cotton swaddler is very small and it does stretch, but our baby will outgrow it quickly.  It also is hard to get the swaddle just right, because if you make it super tight, it seems too tight, but otherwise the baby's hands come out of it easily.
