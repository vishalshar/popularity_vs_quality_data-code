I got this to prevent against my puppies tee pee-ing our bathroom. We have an accordian door on the master bathroom and the pups learned quickly how they could open it themselves. So they would let themselves in, then pull every bit of tp off of the roll and scatter it all over the bathroom and house. The first time it was cute, so I took a picture, but not so cute as it continued. So hence the roll stopper. We put this bad boy on and it immediately stopped the problem. It does make it a tad difficult to get the TP off to use if your dispenser is in a strange location (ours is on the same wall as the back of the toilet, so you have to turn around as it is to get it). But if our dispenser wasn't in a goofy place, I don't think it would be a problem. Anyways, does what it says and stopped my puppies' plans to tee pee the house. Once they were older and grew out of that stage, we were able to take it off without problem. :-)
