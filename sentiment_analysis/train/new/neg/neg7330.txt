Needed two play yards, one of us and one for inlaws, so I bought one of these, and the Delta Children Square Play Yard, Flare, 36" X 36". The two don't compare, at least for our needs. The named of the "Dream on Me" seems slightly ironic as it is a very hard contraption, compared to the Delta Children Square Play Yard. Other commenters noted this as well, and now I see what they mean. The plastic is hard, which might be good for some, but a kid who falls over and hits the plastic will not be a happy camper. Meanwhile, the Delta Children Square Play Yard has soft surfaces that give.My 9-month-old does like sticking his hands through the bars in the Dream on Me, and sometimes when outside of it to try to get one of his toys that is inside. But I ended up ordering another Delta Children Square Play Yard, and will likely use this to store toys or something. The only thing I can think about is the harder plastic will be better for my kid once he gets older, can stand, etc. But for younger kids who are still figuring out gravity, I prefer the Delta Square.
