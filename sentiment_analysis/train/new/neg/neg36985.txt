Blah- I really wanted to love this sippy cup! We had been using Born Free and Avent Sippy cups. Although I love the Born Free ones (we also use there glass bottles and they are awesome) I found I did not need all those parts for a water cup! It just takes too long to put together and wash. Unfortunately my one year did not figure this cup out. At first I just thought it was the shape of the spout that he wasn't use to and kept offering it to him thinking that he would get it. After a few tried I figure I would try it myself- and boy was I surprised...you really have to suck on the spout for anything to come out!! There is no way this would work for my one year old. I suppose this would work for an older toddler? Not sure but now its just sitting in our cabinet un-used.
