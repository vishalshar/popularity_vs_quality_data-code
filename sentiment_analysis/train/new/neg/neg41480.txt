I bought one of these and it worked magnificently. It closed easily, the plunger moved slowly and it was easy to clean. It had a star-shaped piece of plastic in the bottom.I purchased a second one which is a never-ending headache to use: hard to open, the plunger sticks and then shoves the entire contents through, and then it is hard to fill, so that the medicine spurts out while trying to snap it closed. When I try to administer the medicine, it causes choking!  It has a circular piece of plastic in the bottom.I  bought more, hoping to get another star, but got more circles and every one of them is useless! I recommend opening up the reservoir as soon as you get it and sending back any without the star shape. It's just not worth the stress!
