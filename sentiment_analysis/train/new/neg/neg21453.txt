I'm the babysitter, and I guess that I just assumed that all strollers would be good. I WAS WRONG! The car seat is very difficult to use. The release button to get the car seat out of the base and the stroller is at a very wrong location. There is not enough room to work it. When the car seat is in the stroller, it sits in too much of a vertical position. The poor baby's head falls forward. The same thing happens in just the car seat base, but not near as bad. The release buttons on the handles are terrible. There is no texture on the handles, so my hands slip nearly every time. I can't get a good grip, not to mention that they are much smaller than other brands. They don't work as easily or as smoothly as they should. It is the most awkward thing to fold up. There is not a window in the canopy to see into the stroller.  It's just like a vent thing...crazy .Also, I was putting sunscreen on the baby, and a little got on the car seat IT WILL NOT COME OUT! I don't normally rate items, but I felt that EVERYONE NEEDS FOREWARNED! One last thing, the storage is terrible. It does not hold a normal size diaper bag. SO ANNOYING!
