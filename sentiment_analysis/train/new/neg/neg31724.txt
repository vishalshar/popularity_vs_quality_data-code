This adapter is very sturdy and secure.  I do have 2 complaints with it however.  When I set my carseat (Britax B35 Elite) in I have to push down hard on both sides to make sure it clicks and then when I go to remove the seat to fold the stroller the carseat always gets stuck and I have to wiggle it back and forth for it to come loose. I have also noticed when I fold the stroller (Britax B Ready) up and the adapter is connected it doesn't want to fold properly and when it does the adapter gets caught on the strollers push in buttons and I have to push them in to get the adapter to release so I can open the stroller.
