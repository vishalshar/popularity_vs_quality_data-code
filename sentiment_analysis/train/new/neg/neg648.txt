It works okay, but it starts randomly flickering sometimes and then just shuts off. I have it permanently plugged in, so I can't speak to its battery life. I'd say if you just need something cheap for your desk to light up a corner or something (like what mine is for), it's fine, but if you need something reliable, maybe try something else. Also, the "off" position is in English, but the other two settings are in another language that I don't understand. It's pretty easy to tell that one's medium and one's high, but it's just a little quirky.
