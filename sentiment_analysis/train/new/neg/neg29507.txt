For some reason I thought green toys meant it was made from trees but it's actually a number 5 plastic. Not even a 1. So I'm guessing it's not bpa free. I don't know what green toy is then...just its recycled. But I thought all plastic was recycled anyway so I don't get it. Not too happy. Would choose another product next time.
