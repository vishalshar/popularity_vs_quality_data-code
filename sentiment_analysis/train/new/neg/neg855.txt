I have been using Charlie Banana One Size diapers. The diapers each came with a Medium/Large insert when I purchased them, but I needed extras, so I purchased these. i was very surprised when they arrived and these inserts were considerably larger than the inserts that came with the diapers, even though they are both supposedly "Medium/Large". Larger is not necessarily better - these don't fit the diapers quite as well. I'm not sure if these are specifically made for the sized diapers versus the One Size, but I would think "Medium/Large" is "Medium/Large". On the plus side, they do absorb well and seem to last.UPDATE: I do notice now that the description says "they will not fit charlie banana(tm) one size reusable diaper". I didn't notice that when I purchased this item, so I'm not sure if I missed that or if that was added more recently. Very unfortunate:(
