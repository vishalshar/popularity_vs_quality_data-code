When we first received the box we couldn't wait to give them to our kiddo (and his big brother) to play with together. Well we 1/2 inspected them as we handed them down. I am glad that we all were playing with them. Some of the blocks broke during the first play session. I have to admit I was not very happy about it, but we just stuck them off to the side and kept playing. So now we have less blocks, and I am annoyed, but my son still seems to enjoy playing with the ones that are left so I guess that is all that really matters in the end.
