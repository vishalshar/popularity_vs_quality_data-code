This is my second Ubbi pail liner.  After our son was born and we started cloth diapering we realized that we needed a second liner.  The first one was great.  It held up well in the laundry and dried very quickly however in the few months since we bought the first one, they must have changed the fabric or type of water proof material for the second one we ordered.  After a few weeks the plastic coating started to disintegrate and is no longer waterproof.  We still use it, but the outside now gets wet when filled with diapers and has contributed to an increase in odor.
