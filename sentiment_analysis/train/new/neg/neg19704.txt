I had high hopes for the Boon Catch Bowl. Love the modern, clean look and happy colors. It is well-sized at the "catcher" feature does help keep things a bit cleaner for messy eaters. But there a a few drawbacks that ultimately brought down my review to three stars:1) The description is "dishwasher safe." Be careful-- even in the top rack, with heat off, this bowl will warp.2) The "flexible" catcher can work to limit messes-- but the fact that is is so bouncy/flexible means that it sort of invites kiddos to play, flip food into the air, etc.3) The cather and bowl are two separate plastic pieces that are melded together. After a few washers (again, in top rack), I noticed some separation along the connection. This is an invitation for germs and looks very unattractive.4) The colors are BRIGHT. MUCH brigher than in the photos. Make sure you know what you are getting!5) The suction works well on a table, but not well on highchairs. It is very easy for most children to lift this bowl.Overall, its an okay bowl. Just okay.
