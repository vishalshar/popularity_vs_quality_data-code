I used to have to spend so much time wiping down every possible place my baby would touch. But this is truly a one-handed solution. With one hand I pop it into the cart, unzip, fold over front and back, and I'm good to go. I used to wish it was less cushiony so I could use it as a high chair cover too, but after several uses, I've seen how happy and comfy my 9mos old is, and I'm glad it is this comfortable. After all is said and done, fold the front and back flaps back in, zip it up (2 handed task), and throw it back into the trunk. I really cannot live without this item now.Update June 26, 2013:I've had it for a while now and I've noticed some uncomfortable issues with this product. My baby leaned forward and was sucking on the fabric. After a while she lifted her face and her mouth was covered in brown. The dye from the brown side leaked through the fabric and onto my baby's face. This really makes me uncomfortable about the safety of this product. I posted a photo of what the buggy bagg now looks like, where you can see the brown dye bleeding onto the front side.
