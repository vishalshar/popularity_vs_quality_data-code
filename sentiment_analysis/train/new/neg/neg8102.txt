We bought this for our four month old because she had recently started to roll over and we were worried she would roll over and suffocate during the night. I thought it was a little strange that it clipped to the diaper, but seemed to monitor her movement well this way. We had the Snuza for less than two weeks when it started blinking red- which meant that the battery life was low. We could not believe the batteries were dying in such a short time. We then found out that the replacement batteries were $10 each, so we decided to return it and just try the cheap ($50) Angelcare system. That has worked just as well for us, and was less than half of the price of the Snuza.
