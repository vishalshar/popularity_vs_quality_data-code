This is only a ONE-pack product. I returned it and explained that it is advertised as a 2-pack and that is what I expected to get. Amazon processed my return quickly and sent the 'replacement' pack, but it was also only a ONE-pack.I finally gave up and decided to write the main company to get my missing plug guard. I'll let you know what happens, but I have my doubts.If you order this product, you can expect to get only ONE plug guard instead of TWO!!!The product is cheaply made, but it is a useful safeguard for curious toddlers. However, when you compare the price to the quality it should really be a 4-pack!!!
