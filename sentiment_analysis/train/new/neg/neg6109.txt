I got these as a stocking stuffer for my 2 year old daughter who loves all things Dora.  They are very cute but they are quite hard and don't squeeze easily.  Therefore, they are hard to fill with water and hard to squirt with.  The second photo below shows the tiny squirt hole in Boots mouth. That is an odd location to squirt from and that one tiny hole doesn't work very well for filling it or squirting. It's impossible for my daughter to squirt with them and even I have trouble squeezing them.  They are pretty much pointless as bath squirters.  The third photo shows it in my hand so you can see how small these are.  They do float however, and she enjoys playing with them in the tub and pretending that she's swimming with Boots and Dora.
