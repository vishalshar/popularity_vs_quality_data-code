this product is very cheaply made and it looks like it too! the bag itself is made of cordoroy but then they put a heavy heavy film over it which makes it hard to open and close and the handle can't be adusted very well because it's so hard and stiff and sticks straight up (like in the picture). inside the bag barely had enough room for a few diapers, wipes and a bottle. i was so disappointed i paid the shipping to return it and then went to walmart and bought a really cute one that i could see and feel first. the print is very pretty but the bag is NOT very functional. please dont waste your money.
