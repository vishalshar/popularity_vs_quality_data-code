I bought two of these for my two daughters.  They graphic is cute, they are lightweight, and they fit in the water bottle pouch on the side of the girls' backpacks.  But, they leak.  Its hard to tell if the lid is on right--it doesn't always snap.  But even when I'm sure the lid is on right, it still leaks.  If the girls backpacks are thrown on their sides, they get a wet spot on their backpacks and find they are out of water.  They are easy enough to drink out of, though.
