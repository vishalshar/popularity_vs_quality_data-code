Unfortunately this is not one of those "I got a bargain for this product", you get what you pay for with it.  I figured it wouldn't be top of the line but would serve its purpose and would be ok with out washing in the dishwasher and putting in the microwave.  Didn't even get that far...the lid is very hard to fit on to the container, I literally gave up, I tried quite a few times (more than I care for but Im stubborn haha).  I had my husband try and he was able to do it. I had a VERY hard time opening it so there is no way the kids will be able to do it.I purchased two and its more hassle to return it than what its worth so its just money in the trash =0(
