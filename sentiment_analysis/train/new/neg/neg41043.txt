I had seen these online & in stores, so when my daughter started teething I ordered one. The necklace is made of a non-skid type material that is almost sticky I would say.  It is an awesome idea but this style tangles in my hair & sticks to it so bad, the only way to get it out is to pull my hair. And I am constantly pulling hair out of the necklace. I have very long hair but I think that even shoulder length or slightly shorter would cause a problem. So needless to say, this has been retired. I would recommend purchasing one of babe types that has string most of the way around, but a bead or beads at the middle.
