You are getting a good deal for the money, but I was incredibly disappointed with the mobile.  I sent this picture out to my friends in a group text offering $20 to the person who could correctly identify the figures hanging from the mobile.  One said "guitar".  Another friend said "octopus".  Let's face it, the mobile if horrible. Still,  the other components of the set are cute.
