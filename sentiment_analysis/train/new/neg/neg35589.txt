I bought these and the Potty Covers to try both. I liked the Potty Covers better but they are more expensive. These were ok and got the job done but they are supposed to have two little tape strips to peel off and stick them to the toilette seat to stop it from slipping. Some of the covers only had one strip and some had one on the correct side and one on the side you sit on. They were kind of all over the place. Other than that they were ok and they were pretty cheap. They came in a big bag that wasn't super convenient too. The Potty Covers come individually wrapped so you can just pop a couple in your bag at a time. In any case, these cover the seat well and my two year old was able to hold onto the potty without actually touching the seat.
