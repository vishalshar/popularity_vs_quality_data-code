My Husband wanted this high hair so we purchased it and it is so cheap and flimsy. We had Chicco high chairs for our others kids but he wanted this one because of the toy option. We should have just purchased the Chicco and used our own toys for our baby to play with. It's very flimsy and the crotch strap is the craziest thing ever. It doesn't come up between the legs, it's actually behind the back and then down the butt and then back up the front to latch it. It makes it really difficult to find the strap and the lead it into position to snap in. I would not recommend this high chair. Get the Chicco. It's super sturdy and if we had not given ours away 4 years ago we would still be able to use it.
