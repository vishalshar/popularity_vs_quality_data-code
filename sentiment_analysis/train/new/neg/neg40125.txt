I bought this for my daughter and within a week of her using it the top began to fray.  I assumed it was a bum one so I exchanged it with amazon for a new one.  Sadly that was not the case and these backpacks just are not durable and the woven threads of the backpack easily rip/tare and the backpack frays.The description says, "roomy main compartment large enough to fit standard size school folders" but that is exactly what turned this backpack into a frayed piece of junk.See the current state of the backpack here i.imgur.com/VUGw6kT.png
