The design of this bath tub is the best I have come across for newborns so far. My youngest son seems very comfortable in this and I am not constantly having to adjust him in it. He just sits perfectly. I have given him baths either with this sitting in the bathtub and a couple inches of water in the tub, and I have also given him sponge baths while big brother is using the tub by folding up a towel underneath where his booty would sit and sitting the entire thing on the bathroom sink counter. It comes with a little plastic hanger to hang this up in your bath tub when you are done too so it can dry out. Here comes the negative: Regardless of if I rinse it out and squeeze excess water and immediately hang it to dry, after a couple baths it smells like mildew. I read on the tag that it is machine washable and low dry, so I did this.... and it now after two washes looks OLD, as if I have had this for years. The fabric faded a few shades, and it has little balled up fuzzies all over it (I didn't wash it with anything else). I was disappointed to see that this just isn't going to hold up like I thought it would. My son is just over 3 months right now, so I am hoping that this will make it until he is sitting up, because like I said, I LOVE the design after trying two other ones with my first son that I hated. While I would recommend this for a newborn, I would try to find a different brand or one made of a different material, same design to see if these problems could be avoided. This is not something you would be able to save for another child.
