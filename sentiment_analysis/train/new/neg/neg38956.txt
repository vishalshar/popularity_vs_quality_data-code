I like two things about these nursing pads - they are cheap, and they are "individually packaged" two per pouch instead of one each like every other pad I've tried (cuts down on packaging - I'm not sure why I would ever need just one nursing pad). Otherwise, the Medela or Lansinoh pads are much better. These are not quite as absorbent as Medela/Lansinoh, although a bit more absorbent than the Gerber Nuk brand. However, these don't contour very well so they are more obvious under clothes. Also, because they are flat I have mistakenly put them in the wrong side out on a couple of occasions (sleep deprivation will do that to you :) ) with disastrous results - milk hits the waterproof layer first and then wicks onto your shirt, spreading everywhere. It's worth the extra couple bucks to buy the better pads.
