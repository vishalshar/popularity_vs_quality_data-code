This is a bag to consider if you want a cute, light-weight floppy bag and intend to use it chiefly as a shoulder bag. If you're planning to use it chiefly as a backpack, I don't recommend it because of the strap problem I'll mention below.I want to emphasize that this is a "floppy" bag, not a "stiff" bag that keeps its shape whether or not there's stuff inside. It is the kind of bag that things tumble around in unless it is presently over your shoulder.Pros:-No bad smell.-The khaki canvas fabric that makes up most of the bag is light-weight and a nice texture.-The PU part is well-made.Cons:-The straps are made of a slippery fabric. (i.e. not canvas or PU. I'm stating this as a con because I was expecting canvas for some reason. If you don't care what sort of fabric makes up the straps, then perhaps you can disregard this.)-When used regularly, the backpack straps constantly return to the longest possible strap length (i.e. the metal adjustors don't say in place).-The metal loops that hold the backpack straps onto the bag turn sideways and get stuck that way. This isn't a huge technical problem, but I find it slightly annoying.
