I would give the product its self a five. It was very cheap and good quality. However I could not use so had to return it. After I paid the first charge to receive the item which was $87 I had to turn around and pay another $19 to send it back and returns were supposed to be free. On top of that they only gave me a refund of $57 so I am out almost $50. Very unhappy costumer
