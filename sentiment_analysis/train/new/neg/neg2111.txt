I'm not a big fan of musical toys, but my daughter loves them. This one is particularly annoying though. It plays multiple songs which is better than hearing the same one over and over. However, it won't finish one song before swithching to another. So, when my daughter gets really excited and starts pulling the flower repeatedly, I get to hear the first 3 seconds of every song over and over again! Since this is meant to be a travel toy, that often occurs in the car. There is no way to lower the volume or turn off the music. You can take out the batteries if you happen to have a tiny screwdriver on hand. I will be doing that soon.It also hangs pretty low on our car seat (Evenflo Discovery 5). So, unless I take it off, my daughter gets a face full of rattle when I put the bar back to take her out of the seat. It doesn't hurt, but if she happens to be asleep, it wakes her.On the other hand, my daughter will play with this for hours without getting bored. She loves the lights and sounds. I haven't had any problems with it getting pulled down either.I honestly believe you're better off just hanging toys from the bar with links. At least that way, you can change them out when they get annoying.
