I ordered the Pacific Blue Coral changing pad cover and was HIGHLY disappointed by the misrepresentation of the color that is shown on the website (and ever other online retailer's website) and what is actually delivered. I was expecting a vibrant, rich sea blue and got a shade that is a couple steps brighter than a pastel/sky blue. I even verified that I got that right item by the UPC.
