I am a die hard Playtex insulator sippy cup fan.  I have used only these for my 2 kids since I trialed every brand out there early on.  Recently, I needed some replacements as our dog has taken to chewing the spouts off these cups at every chance she gets.  I was surprised to find a completely different product arrived! (On a side note, when Amazon says colors vary, they mean it!  I got lovely pink and purple butterflies for my 3 yo boy...not that I care, but he did!)The NEW! Product is completely inferior!  It is thin and cheap plastic. I don't believe it has any insulating ability.  The valves are a completely different shape.  If you have spare parts they will be useless.  The click top design is terrible!  4 of 5 times I assembled the cup it went on crooked.  Last, but perhaps most importantly, the cup leaked.I am completely disappointed and actually took the time to return this product.  Steer clear of this product!  I am on the hunt for a new sippy cup.  Boo!
