Granted we bought this crib in 2011 and our daughter slept in it till she was almost 3, but all that being said I would think the base wouldn't bow. It wasn't a big deal when my daughter was 2 but now my 6 month old is using it and she rolls to the sides. I have tried to even it out by placing things under the mattress but that of course isn't ideal. We got good use out of it for one child if you hope to use it again you might want to rethink this crib
