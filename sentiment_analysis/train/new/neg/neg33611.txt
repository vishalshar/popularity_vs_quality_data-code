I like that it spins. I like that the height can be changed. I like that it can be cleaned. It's piled high with caps and spoons and nebulizer parts and not the perfect organizer I planned on, but it does its job. My complaint is that, unless I pour half a bottle of water out, it really doesn't drain. The drop or two that hit the bottom surface just air dry where they land and the bottom trey gets groddy.
