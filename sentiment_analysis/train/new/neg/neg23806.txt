My baby was 6 months when we bought this toy. We took it out of the package and he LOVED it. However, after playing with it for 1 hour the wheel busted off. He was just pushing it and not leaning or standing on it. We tried to fix it since he loved it so much, but we were unable to. We sent it back and got refunded. Great idea for a toy but POORLY constructed.
