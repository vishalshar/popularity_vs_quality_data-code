Cute. Assembly took about as long as expected.  Can't get side clips to attach; not really room to get them between side and chair.  Cannot get elastic bands attached where they are supposed to.  Says it's for newborns but my daughter couldn't use it until over two months old and even then we had to use a car seat head support to hold her head straight.  Also for newborns, it should have five point restraint instead of three.  It does recline reasonably far back though which helps.  Rolls smoothly.
