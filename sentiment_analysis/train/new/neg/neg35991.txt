It's  hard to review something as simple as a spoon.Pros:They have thick, rubbery handles that are easy to grip.The "well" is deep enough so food doesn't slide out.Cons:The "well" is a little too deep...your kid isn't going to get all the food out of it which can frustrate them.I find it's good for things like rice that can normally just flop off a standard, flatter spoon but I wouldn't use this for liquids, you won't get anything out without practically sucking the spoon itself.
