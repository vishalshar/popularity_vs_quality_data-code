I got this bassinet because I purchased a badger Moses basket.  So many reviews mention they are a match and it's doesn't fit a britax Bassinet.  I put this thing together yesterday and took it apart this morning.The paint on the wood was chipped.  The rocking sensation is useless it only slightly rocks and you need to keep the motion going.  It doesn't self rock.  As for it fitting the bassinet.  Badger Moses is very loose in the stand about 3-4 front back and 2-3 on each side.  U can tighten the platic loops a little but still. My wife refused to use it.  It is very short and looks very cheap.  One review mentioned that a britax bassinet didn't fit.  I have one and it does fit more snug but still loose.  This thing is more practical for being a display and not for actual use.I would recommend not to buy this thing unless u want it as a display.  Very cheap not worth more than ten dollars.  Very very disappointed.  I usually never am but this product went to far.  How does amazon sell this?!
