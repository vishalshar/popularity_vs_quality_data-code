This set sounds ideal, but has several major shortcomings.  The way the infant carrier fits into the stroller, it sits VERY UPRIGHT, and does NOT recline enough for an infant.  This alone defeats the main purpose of the set - to be able to use a jogger stroller with an infant and not wait 6 months.  Additionally, the stroller body itself (where the child sits) is not near as nice as the regular Baby Trend Expedition LX (without travel system).  The seat and straps of the LE have absolutely no padding, and feel hard and uncomfortable, especially on a rough path.  And the clasp is very cheap and releases with substantial force that could pop your child in the face.  One more thing, the description says it includes the Flex-Loc car seat, but it actually is the EZ-Loc model - similar but not exactly the same.  So I decided to pay the $36 to ship it back, and get the better stoller and car seat separately, even if they don't fit together.I still give it 3 stars because it's a great idea to make a jogger travel system, and I don't know of any others.  The car seat is a good one, and the stroller is okay, but the car seat needs to lay down when it is clipped into the stroller.  The stroller folds and unfolds easiy and compactly, and is very easy to maneuver. They just got a few key details wrong.
