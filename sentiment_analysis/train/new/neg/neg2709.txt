I rarely write reviews, but have been so disappointed by these pouches that I wanted to love. they have had light use - all care instructions followed (in fact even though they state dishwasher safe we still chose to hand wash them). The zipper at the top of the pouches have all started to separate from the pouch so that they cannot be sealed, making a big mess. Even before the zippers pulled away, I wasn't impressed with the difficulty of sealing the small zipper after putting applesauce in the pouch - the food gets into the zipper and its hard to clear it away from the zipper enoigh so it can fully seal without tiny bits of food inhibiting a tight seal. We have gone back to using the beaba reusable pouch, which isn't perfect either, but still easy to seal and doesn't make such a mess for mom to clean up!
