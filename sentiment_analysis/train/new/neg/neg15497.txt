It is very cute and serves it's purpose...slightly over priced for some tulle and a piece of elastic.  I ended up having to make cuts in it because there were two different locations that the bottom of the tutu was sewn into the waist band.  Had I been able to notice the changes I would have contacted the seller.  We added navy tulle to the top and you can't see the imperfections. My neice absolutely loves it, but what little girl wouldn't.  If I had to do it again, I would just make my own.
