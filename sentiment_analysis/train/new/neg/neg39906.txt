I really liked this sippy cup at first, when it arrived. It's well made, it disassembles easily, has only 3 parts ( + spout cover if you take it off), didn't seem to leak. And i like the color.BUT, first of all my 8 months daughter doesn't like it at all. (she was 7 months when i got it). Maybe it's the flat shape of the spout...Also you have to put the spout in a certain way otherwise the cover won't fit. Not a big deal, but just one more thing to think about. And if you're in a hurry or you have a wiggling or screaming baby on your arm, you want to do it as quickly as possible w.o. any kind of thinking.And since the spout is flat it's kind of hard to clean, unless you have a tiny brush. Which i happened to have from my other bottles, but i am guessing not everybody does. I can also fit my pinky in there, but again my fingers are tiny. So if you like to thoroughly clean it it'll take a little bit of effort.And finally the attached cover is a nice idea, but in reality it's not very useful - i had to take it off. b.c. if it's on top, it's right in your baby's face. And might even close/fall onto her nose. Which won't be painful or anything but probably unpleasant. And if you turn the cup so that the cover is at the bottom, it definitely falls down and knocks your baby on the chin. Again, nothing horrible, but a bit annoying.So overall, it's cute, but a bit flawed in the design, IMO.
