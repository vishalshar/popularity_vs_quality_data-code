It's kind of my fault.  The description says 13cm diameter.  As a very new mom of twins with breastfeeding issues, that measurement was beyond my comprehension.  The pads are wonderful quality, and I love the smaller size, but the large is just ridiculous and doesn't fit with any sizing norms.  I'm not kidding, think dinner plates.  I can't picture how anyone but the largest plus sized woman could wear these.  The sizing really should be XXL or something similar.  These were very expensive to be so useless-and again my fault for not returning.  I'll chalk that up to a broken printer and not enough hours in the day to eat let along fix a printer to return the item.  The small is generously sized for me and I'm a DD pre-pregnancy.  If not for the sizing, this would be a 5 for sure.  It's an absolute life saver for Rynaud's, and possibly the only reason I'm still able to nurse.
