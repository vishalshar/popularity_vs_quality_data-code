I was so excited to get this bag - I've gotten a lot of Luvable Friends items in the past and have been very pleased with all of them.  I love the size as I hate big, bulky bags, and this one is perfect - I love the way the top opens and the pockets are all convenient and easy to access.  I put a few things in it and set it aside to use the next day to go to the doctors.On the way in we noticed the straps were both starting to loosen from where they were sewn.  On the way out, my husband picked up the bag by the strap and it came right out of the seam, leaving the bag on the floor.  It was sewn in so that it frayed the strap material - it should have been folded over and then sewn.  It was so disappointing and embarrassing standing there with a brand new diaper bag in one hand and the strap in the other.I did manage to fix it easily - on the one side there's a velcro strap over the one side pocket - I slid the plastic piece from the strap over that. Then on the other side I sewed it to the inside of the other side pocket, (folding it twice first), and with it being there it helps hold things in that side pocket also.  I'm actually very pleased with how it turned out and I like the strap coming from the pockets better than the top anyway.Other than the 5-10 minutes in having to repair it - I still am very happy with the bag, and it was a good deal.
