I am giving this a 3 because it is not that it isn't a good product if ONLY I could use it!! I ordered these for my son who is 1yr. and 22lbs. These will NOT fit him until he is about 3YRS OLD!! They are extremely HUGE!! I can't believe how incredibly big they are. So, I guess I will save them, but I still have the need for sleepsacks although they do not make them in his size...makes no sense:(
