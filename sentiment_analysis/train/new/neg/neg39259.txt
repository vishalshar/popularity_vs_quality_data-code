I don't usually write reviews but found it necessary to let people know this does not actually fit all cribs. The product itself is probably a great product in use.  I was very careful to follow the directions as to make sure the product would last and ultimately we could never install it correctly.The product being a bit too narrow would only allow the adhesive to stick on one side of the crib and would not stretch far enough to securely stick to the other side.The instructions note that during removal you are to use the heat setting on a blow dryer so you do not strip the finishing. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT because in the process of application, every time the other adhesive strip separated from the crib, it took the finishing with it.
