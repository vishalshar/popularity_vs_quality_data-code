i like this pump BUT if you use it all the time sometimes it looses its suction and you have to figure out what the heck it going on with it, you have to read a book and understand that you need to replace little parts that are on the cup that you put on your breast ( i don't remember how they called) but I didn't have time for that at all, a little bit complicated when it come to cleaning and too many parts...it was ok...
