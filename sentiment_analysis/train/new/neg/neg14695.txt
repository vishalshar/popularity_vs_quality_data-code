This cover is so soft & cute, but they chose to make a brown/red border around the edge of light blue & white. So, after the first wash, the red ran onto the front fabric that has the elephants on it. I followed the wash instructions exactly & it still came out ruined. I''m sure it's bound to get dirty at some point using it with the baby anyways, but I'm really disappointed that they made a product that can't be washed without making it look dirty & used. If it weren't for the color issue, I would've given it 5 stars.
