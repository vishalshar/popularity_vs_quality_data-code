The pattern is not worth the price difference. You can get a plain organic cotton cover for the same money & be much better off. I bought a few Summer Infant patterned covers like this one along with a solid organic terry cotton one (also Summer Infant) and now I wish I had gotten all of them in organic cotton.The material on these feels very plastickey to me, almost like they would not absorb water. I don't like touching it let alone have my baby's head rest on it. The pattern is very cute but I use a pad liner which covers most of the surface so I don't get to see pattern too often.LOVE the 100% solid color, organic cotton version of these though.On the plus side, they fit the pad very well and I like that they have slits on the side for the safety buckles to come through though I am not using the buckle yet, I guess I will when baby is older.
