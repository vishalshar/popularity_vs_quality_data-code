So far I have been a happy customer with amazon.com, but this week it is the second time, that I am unhappy with a product I purchased at amazon.com. The dispenser in the box was not wrapped in plastic and sealed as they usually are and did look kind of dirty, so that's nothing you wanna use. Also the wrapping of the wipes is a totally different design, even though the wipes seem to be the same. Looks like it is an older design, and the exspiration date is not too far away, considering this is a big box.
