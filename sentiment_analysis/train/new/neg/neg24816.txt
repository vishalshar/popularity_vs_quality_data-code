After our nasal aspirator from the hospital broke we were really desperate finding one that just worked as well. First be bought one at a store , just to find out it had no suction at all. Then after some research we came across this one. The fact that it does not need any pricey filters made us decide to get it. It looks really nice and does suck the boogies out quite well... but somehow they ended up in our mouths! When it happened to my husband I told him that it must have been water from rinsing it, but the next day it happened to me! Since we had to use it, we ended up putting some tissue paper in it, which catches the boogies. We also try not so suck so hard anymore, but the weird feeling stays.With the tissue it actually works quite nice, I just wish they would suggest it in the instructions and we would not have to find out the hard way!
