I bought this before I realized I wouldn't necessarily need it. None the less, I like the colors and design and I still use the diaper holder and the large blanket. I do work that it will fall apart in the wash like the small pillow did due to the fact it doesn't feel strongly made, so I try to keep it on delicate or by hand when I can.
