I read the other reviews complaining about the hanging issue but thought that I would come up with a clever way to hang it. Not so much! The ribbon it comes on is way too short to hang from the ceiling, yet way too long if you buy a separate arm to attach to the crib. I decided to hang it from the ceiling in a little nook in our nursery as a decoration instead of a mobile for the crib.
