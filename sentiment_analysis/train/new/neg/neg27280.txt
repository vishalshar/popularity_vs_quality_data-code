Great service by Amazon as always.....crib arrived in record speed (highly recommend you become Amazon Prime member).The crib itself is very well constructed, and best of all easy to put together.  Takes 20-30 minutes and needs very few tools.  Great size and very portable (fits in my trunk).As many have indicated, the mattress that comes with is barely an inch deep and provides little to no support for your child.  Do strongly recommend you opt for Crib and Mattress combo option at a discounted price (pull down menu option).The only major limitation has to do with railing height.  While my 18 month fits in it length wise, the railing height even at the lowest mattress setting, is dangerous for taller and more agile kids. My 18 month FELL OUT it face forward, since the railing height is just above his belly.  One lean forward and POW.THIS CRIB IS FABULOUS FOR TRAVEL, GRANDMA, ETC......but only for infant stage and probably best up to 16 months.
