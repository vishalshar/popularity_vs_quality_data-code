I purchased this to have at my house for when my new born grandson comes.  I like the natural look and feel of the material and the mattress pad with the velour cover is nice.  I just wish that it were more stable under the mattress pad.  Even a small baby sinks a little in the center.  I can't imagine how he will be positioned when he weighs 10-12 pounds!  There must be a defect in the wheel inserts because I also couldn't get them in.  They don't click into place and it seems that the holes where you fit the wheel assembly are different sizes.  I would have liked to have used the wheels but gave up trying to get them in. It looks like this bassinet might fold, but it doesn't. This is such a cute and different bassinet that I wish it were a little better made.
