My daughter loves this toy, but the initial batteries only lasted 3 months.  This might be because there is no on-off switch.  I replaced the batteries and it takes several, and it cost $14!! I was shocked.  I may have to start being careful and not bringing this toy around in my diaper bag, just leaving it home.  The constant sound coming from it really kills the batteries and they are pricey. Otherwise a great toy.
