I love the winnie-the-pooh, the stuffed characters are adorable.  This product has a couple of down falls for me.  1st when I put it on the crib the arm got in the way of the mobiles.  I had to shove a piece of cardboard in the bottom attatchment to make it work.  Also it only plays for a short period of time (like all my baby stuff) . . . either my baby has a really long attention span compared to most, or baby product manufacturers need to consider having music play for more than 2-3 minutes.  It also seems incredibly loud for tryinjg to lull a baby to sleep (although it does seem to work for my baby)
