I have probably five of the 10oz. cups and really like them, but the new more rounded design I do not like!  As soon as I received the cup I put it in the dishwasher (top rack), which the directions said it was okay to do, and when I took it out the bottom had buldged out.  Now the cup will not sit on the table without wobbling like a weeble! I want the old 10oz. cups back.
