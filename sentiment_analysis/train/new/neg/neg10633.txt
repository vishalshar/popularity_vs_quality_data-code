I saw a video of the mamaroo being demonstrated and instantly had to have one. It was pricey, but I didn't care. Since it was supposed to be so awesome I didn't check out any reviews before my purchase.We purchased it for our 4th child and hoped that it would be an awesome alternative to a regular baby swing. Wrong. I'm going to try to list all of the things I hated about this product.-it's slow. So very slow.-the toy that is supposed to dangle above baby's head doesn't snap in well and dangles literally an inch from baby's nose. I had to remove it after one use.-it makes cheap sounding noises. It makes these cracking sounds as it's going, like it's just barely holding up baby and cheaply made.-the sounds all sound pretty much the same because the speakers are so awful-almost $300-just doesn't look comfortable for baby!-baby hated it, as did a lot of friends babies who tried it.My baby wasn't sleeping well at all, and wouldn't stay in the mamaroo for more than a few minutes. When I finally gave up on it I went and got a regular baby swing and he was instantly satisfied. He sleeps so good in the regular swing.This product really is good in theory, but just isn't as awesome in reality as it seems.Please don't waste so much money on this product.
