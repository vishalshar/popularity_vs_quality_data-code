I bought this to use my Graco snap N go carseat with my new Contours Options stroller. I was not aware that the carseat does not snap onto the bar. There is a red strap that goes over the top of the seat where you would attach the car seatbelt if not using the base in the car, and buckles with a male/female clip. The bar only serves as a platform for the carseat to sit on top of and is not secure unless the strap is used. It does serve its purpose, but it just seems silly that it wouldn't snap (it should really have both the strap and the capability to snap on depending on the type of carseat you have). The strap is fine, but my baby doesn't love having it across his lap. All in all, this is the choice you have, so you must buy it if you want to be able to move the baby from the car to the stroller without taking him out of his carseat, I just wish it was designed a little better.
