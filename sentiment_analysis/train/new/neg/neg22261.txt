Splurge the extra buck for the new design!  These have a pop top instead of a screw top like the new model. They end up opening up if the kiddos squeeze it hard (hello- they are "squeeze 'ems") which ends up making a mess. Amazon carries the newer ones; trade up. I've had the new model for over a year, and they are still going.If, however, you have a gentle squeezer, these are nice because they stand up on their own when filled, they are clear so you can see what's in them, durable, easy to clean with a bottle brush, and relatively easy to fill (I use a spoon).
