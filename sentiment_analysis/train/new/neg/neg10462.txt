Just an FYI to anyone trying to replace their older model of this tub (light blue and white, purchased around 2008-2010 I think) - the product has been redesigned. Both sides can be fastened into an incline now, and the drain is located in the middle, inside of to one side.I had the old model of this tub from the time my 1st child was about 2 months until she was probably 18 months. It always worked well. I stored it in the shower when not in use. (I don't think it would be convenient to fold up everyday - not to mention you would have to let it dry first). It is convenient for road trips or visiting relatives, though. In the beginning, it is best to just pour water over the baby, instead of keeping water in the tub (using it like you would use an infant sling) - that way the baby will not slide around as much. When baby can sit up, you can fill the tub and they can enjoy themselves without being lost in the huge regular bathtub.You can get this same effect from numerous tubs, I got this one because it could fold up for travel.  I also liked that it was cushioned.I have been using my old tub for 2 months with baby #2, and there is a hole in it now. I do feel I got my money's worth though.  I decided to get a new one rather than try and patch it. When it arrived, I saw that the product had been redesigned. I prefer the old one. With the new style, I cannot position the edge of the tub over the sink. (I like to drain water out during the bath and use fresh water to wash baby). This one will be returned. I will be in search of the old model.
