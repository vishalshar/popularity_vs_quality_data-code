I know there are BG users out there that absolutely love these diapers.  I unfortunately am not one of them.  I find them really bulky and difficult to remove waste if it gets underneath the cotton.  The cleaning instructions say to line dry and let me tell you it took more than 1 day to get it completely dry.  I will not be buying more of these...ever.  Cute print but not worth the hassle.
