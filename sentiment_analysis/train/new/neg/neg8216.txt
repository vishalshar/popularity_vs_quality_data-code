Bought this item in 2011 and the grinding noise other reviewers noted in 2009 has not been fixed.  It doesn't bother baby, so I've learned to ignore it.  Today when trying to replace the batteries, I discovered that the battery compartment was horribly tight, making it very difficult to replace batteries without using a flathead screwdriver to pry old batteries out and jam new batteries in.  Also, there are some flimsy thin plastic pieces in there that could easily be broken when applying the force necessary to get batteries in/out.  Not sure what function these pieces serve either.  Also, I tried to replace using Eneloop rechargeables with C spacers... no luck.  Eneloop are 1.2v while this device needs 1.5v.  Had I the choice to do over, I might have gotten the Rainforest model instead.
