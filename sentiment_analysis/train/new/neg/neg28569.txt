I feel like these were just really expensive underwear. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE that they are made of organic cotton. They are well made too (if you're looking for really good quality underwear for your child), but it really is more like underwear than training pants. They are only a little thicker than regular underwear. One big downside too was that the plain print wasn't motivating for my toddler. If he has dinosaurs, monkeys, etc. on his underwear or training pants, then he wants to keep them dry. It's like a game. Stripes just didn't work for him. I'll be buying more of the Blueberry brand training pants and regular underwear in different fun prints instead of more of these.
