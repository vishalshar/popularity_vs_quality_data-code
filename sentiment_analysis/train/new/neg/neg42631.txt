Product is no good, vendor was greatI bought these since the sun is always on my side of the car as I drive to work everyday and it's pretty bothersome. The thing with these shades is that even after following the instructions of putting the suction cups under warm water and sticking them to a window for reshaping before the first use, they just don't work properly. My car doesn't have tinted windows or anything that would prevent the cups from adhering properly. Yet, every single time I attached them to the window, they would fall on me a few minutes later. It often happened while I was on the freeway, which can be distracting and dangerous. When they were brand new, it would take longer for the shades to fall off, but after a couple of months it happened several times during my 30min commute, to the point where I just gave up using them.That being said, when I contacted Starlight and Sunny about it, their customer service was superb. Not only did they refund me without asking me to send the shades back, they also sent me an alternative option for free, which is the static cling shades. That's a similar version to the ones I purchased but they adhere without the suction cups, thanks to a static layer of plastic that covers the shade. These work SO MUCH better and aren't falling on me all the time as I'm driving.The one star is for the product, but I give 5 stars for the seller!
