This is the second set of these we have purchased. These are sub-par performers, basically the front portion is too short so if you kids' feet hang over the edge of the car seat (which I suppose they all do) the feet will be resting against your car seats not the protector. The other fail this product gets is that the back tucks into the rear seat, that's fine, and the bottom of your seat is protected but the material that you would assume goes up the back of the seat to protect them does not. These have a very short back and are not designed to protect the whole seat. In fact the ones that I have really only protect the seating portion of your seat.. In any case build quality is good - but the design is lacking.. Go for the one step ahead type protectors instead.
