We purchased this when my son was 2 months old and it quickly became a staple in his nap routine. I found the swing was not very noisy when being used without music. The music selection is not the best I've seen on a toy, but it does have a tranquil feel to it so it serves the purpose. The bee and snail are adorable and would hypnotize my son as he swayed.The reason I rated this at 3 stars is because when my son reached 6 months and was at 18lbs, the swing would barely move its full range anymore. I replaced batteries twice and the sound still worked, but I guess the weight was too much despite the advertised weight limit. It was a wonderful product for about 4 months.
