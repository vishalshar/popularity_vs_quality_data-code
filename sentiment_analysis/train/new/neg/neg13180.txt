I think the color of the bangle is great and the idea is nice but it is a bit big and bulky. I breastfeed and I can't have it on the arm he'll be feeding because it's so big underneath his back. He likes to chew on it but it's even to big just to wear around. It serves it's purpose I guess but it's not sneaky trendy way to entertain your baby.
