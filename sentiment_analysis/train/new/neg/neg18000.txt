I bought this cup for my son for Christmas thinking it would be easier for him to drink from.  He can't really drink it from it all that good just yet, but he does like this one the best out of all of his sippy cups.  The way this cup is designed, it's supposed to not leak when it's turned upside down or shaken.  It doesn't work.  My son can have this cup for 3 mins and be SOAKED from his juice/milk leaking out of it when he turns it upside down.  I don't know if I just don't have the lid on correctly or what it is?I paid full price for this sippy cup.  I did not receive a discount or get it free.
