I purchased the Kolcraft Sit & Step and my son loved it.  However, it had 3 faulty parts on it.  I was a little set back by Lynn the Customer Service Representative and her attitude. The lack of concern for the defects on the product is somewhat alarming.  Kolcraft is willing to send replacement parts so long as part itself was not expensive.  On the box itself it has a number to call for Customer Service and states not to return the product to the store because it can not be re-sold.  I tried it their way by calling the Customer Service line and found that this company needs some serious help with their service techniques.Defective Parts:Tray & Base - the Tray latch that is attached by the manufacture at the plant had a stripped screw hole.  This is a safety feature on the Toy itself and Kolcraft refused to replace this part.Walk Behind Frame - Left hand back corner cracked and chipped.  They are willing to replace this part. It is a less expensive part.Discovery Center Toy - After loading in new batteries and double checking to make sure the batteries are placed in correctly the toy, it did not work.  Kolcraft insisted that I placed the batteries in wrong.  It doesn't take a Masters in Engineering to put batteries in a toy. Negative means Negative and Positive means Positive.  They stated that it might be a problem with the batteries not making contact with the points. It is a known problem but they want me to send back the defective part at my expense.My recommendation for anyone buying a Kolcraft toy is NOT to deal with Kolcraft.  Return the toy directly to the store.As I stated before, I attempted to do it their way to save them some expense of having the store return the toy to them but they are not willing to work with their customers.  I will never again buy a Kolcraft product.
