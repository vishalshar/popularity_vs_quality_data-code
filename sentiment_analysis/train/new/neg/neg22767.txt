If I had paid 2 dollars for this, I wouldn't bother to complain.As reviewed by others, it is indeed correct that it's poorly designed : too flimsy for Dr Brown's own 8oz glass bottles!! The bottles on the picture must be a light plastic model (if it's not a computer-generated rendition), be warned: you won't be able to do that with glass bottles.And the bottom section of the rack? impossible to reach anything underneath.A cheaper substitute: your regular dish rack.
