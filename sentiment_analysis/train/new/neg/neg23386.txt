I really like this bag.  It seems pretty durable so far and it's stylish and functional.  You can fit a lot more in there than you think!  Great size and I'd be able to use after my babies are no longer in need of a diaper bag.  Kind of cool.  I love that compartments.  One thing I'd change is to add a latch that holds the two straps together when putting it on my shoulder - sometimes one strap falls down, but not a huge issue especially for the price.03.26.15 - after not even a year of inconsistent use...it's falling apart. Seams are coming undone. It looks and feels nice, but the quality is not as good as I had hoped.
