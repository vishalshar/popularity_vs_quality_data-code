We have some other chicco stuff an loved it and liked the looks of this so tried it out. Overall looks awesome, we have a modern decor and this fit right in. Cons: doesn't rock easy, mobile arm is flimsy as hell as everyone else has said. We ended up taking our vibrating/song attachment from our pack and play and clamped it on this, if it wasn't for that i would have gotten rid of this already.
