This is actually a very cute little seat but it is really very cheap and flimsly. The seat tilts to the side with the doll in it and wiggles around alot.  If the girls put any pressure on it when putting the doll in I think it will probably break.  I am going to look for something that can connect to it and the bike to give it more stability. Not sure what that would be right now.  Also the harness does not actually work like the harness of a real seat with a button/latch to release the restraints.  You simply string the velcro straps through slots in a cheap piece of decorated plastic to strap the doll in, so the girls will have to pull the straps completely out of the slots to get the doll in and will then have to be able to thread the end of the strap back through the slots to fasten the doll in.  Very disappointed in this for the price.  Might be a good buy at $10 or $15 but $25 is way too much.  Like others have said, the only saving grace is that it is cute and the girls will love it, while it lasts.
