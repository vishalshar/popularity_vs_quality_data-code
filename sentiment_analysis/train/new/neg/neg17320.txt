I bought this about 6 weeks ago for my Britax boulevard click tight, right when we began potty training my 2 year old. Today she had her first accident when she fell asleep in the car. It protected the seat a little bit but a ton of urine went through onto the car seat pad and even beneath that into the metal at the core of the seat. This now left me with TWO pads to clean rather than just one. What a waste.
