Starts out wonderful, everything from the music to the vibrate function on the mobile, baby loves the vibrate and then it quit working - on the first one of these we had - less than two months after we had it.  So we exchanged it for the second one.  We haven't had it for a month yet - and guess what! The vibrate stopped working already! Wouldn't be a big deal if my daughter didn't love that part of it! Oh yeah, not to mention that it's sold with that feature and SHOULD work.Aside from that and the failing singing lady's voice who sometimes sounds like static on a bad cell phone call, this thing is constructed well, looks very nice and fits nicely in tight places.Oh - and good luck finding a second sheet to have as a backup to cover the pad.
