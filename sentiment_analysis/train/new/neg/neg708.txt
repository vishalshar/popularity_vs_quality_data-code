Alert!  McPolos/Fulfilled by U-Essae = false advertising.  Not made in USA.  Parents know silicone bibs are sold through  different sellers on Amazon. We waded through different prices, styles & quality of similar bib offerings.  McPolos/U-Essae lists "USA" as country of origin under Product Details. We've paid more for their bib, to avoid sellers who honestly list made in "China" & sold silicone bibs for less, or came with free extras (baby spoons, etc). As suspected, McPolos package arrived, & states "Made in China."  The seller was already suspect - - just read their  dramatic claims in the product detail with zero support evidence --how their bibs last longer than Baby Bjorn; how sellers using french names are somehow knockoffs, & how you don't really want xtra, free spoons that come with the competition's bib, do ya? Also, someone who seems connected to the seller or who is the seller, leaves strange, emotional attack comments on negative reviews (if a bib didn't work for baby, she must have a "behavior problem" & how dare the reviewer down-rate the product -- really silly, immature stuff for a supposedly reputable business). But deceiving parents isn't silly, it's unethical, & we're reporting it. Trusting both the product materials & seller honesty is part of a review, especially when talking babies & safety -- 1 star is generous for the trouble to return.  If parents prefer this bib to the competition that also buttons in the back just like this one, go for it.  But don't be dissuaded from lower cost sellers because you trust that you're paying extra for made in the USA, if that's your deciding factor. Seller has likely strategized to leave this deception uncorrected & expand the profits per hour, until we parents call you on it.  Profit fairly, not off of false advertising.
