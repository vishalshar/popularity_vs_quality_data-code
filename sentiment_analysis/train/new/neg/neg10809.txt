I was really excited about this product, as I was decorating my daughter's playroom. I don't normally write negative reviews, but I ended up being REALLY disappointed with the product I received. The cut outs around the decals were misplaced, and were actually placed in the middle of the decal. In other words, when I took a flower off the page, because the "cut out line" was placed in the middle of the flower, rather than around it, I only got half of the flower off the page. I have included pictures here to show what I mean. This ended up being a completely wasted purchase for me, and I would warn others against purchasing this item, as many of the decals are not usable.
