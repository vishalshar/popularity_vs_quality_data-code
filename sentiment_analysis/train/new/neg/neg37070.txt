I really had high hopes for this mirror after reading many good reviews about it and after looking at many other car mirrors. Unfortunately, it doesn't work for us (we used it in Nissan Murano). The mirror is cute and attaches easily (stays in place pretty well for the most part). However, if you are looking for something that will allow you to see not only the baby overall but his/her face as well then this is not a mirror for you (the customer image/picture submitted by C. Fromel with a little girl right next to the baby is pretty accurate actually of what you will see, maybe a little clearer but not by much, and yes, that small). If I wanted to see, for example, if my son was sleeping, I was not able to do that. I had to ask my older son who is seating next to him to take a look and tell me if his baby brother is sleeping.Because we couldn't see the baby's face clearly/well enough at all this mirror is useless to us. We got a simple rectangular Fisher Price Travel Care Max-View Baby mirror that works much better (not ideal, but better than Rainforest monkey mirror) as it actually magnifies the view of the baby so that we can see his face really well.
