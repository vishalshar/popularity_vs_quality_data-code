This was not soft and "silky" like I had been expecting. For the price, it was extremely disappointing and not worth it at all when I bought another at the same time for less than 1/2 the price that feels luxuriously amazing and I had expected it to be the lesser quality one.  Thank you Amazon though for having ample time to return the item and providing easy return label.
