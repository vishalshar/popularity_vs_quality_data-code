I have other wall decals that I absolutely love... This isn't one of them!  The road pieces don't match up like they should, they aren't even all cut the same width, and the white line doesn't even up with the other pieces.  They are even different shades of gray!  It took forever to apply, and I even had to trim and cut some to make them fit.  Once I finally got it all up, it looks cute until you get up close, then you can see places it doesn't fit well.
