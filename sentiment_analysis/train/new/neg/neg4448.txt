We have a pump in style advanced tote bag purchased in 2011.  This tubing does not fit.  The adapters at either end do not fit the pump.  If you look on Madela's website, the proper part number for the pump in style advanced is 87212.  This also does not appear to be an authentic Madela part as advertised as the quality of the tubing does not seem up to par with what we purchased from Madela.
