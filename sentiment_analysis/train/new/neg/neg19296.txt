We got this product because another brand we had kept disconnecting at random times and would beep until we reset it.Pros. The unit hasn't disconnected once which was the main reason behind our purchase. It's very sensitive so you can hear the slightest sounds if you'd like. There is a light sensor and vibrate mode. Range is good compared to our other one. Probably a few hundred yards.Cons. Quite a few compared to our other model. The unit cannot adjust sensitivity. Our other model could adjust to block out small sounds and only play loud ones. Not the case with this one. Also it has poor battery life. We keep it on all day and it lasts about 12 hours in battery life. Other model lasted probably close to 48 hour. Related to the sensitivity the parent unit constantly has a white noise sound. If you turn the volume up the white noise also increases and can be quite annoying.Overall I am torn on recommending this. Granted it's better than I urge other one that would beep in the middle of the night but we sacrificed many features to get it.
