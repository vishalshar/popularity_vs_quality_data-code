I have never seen a pacifier as hard to use as this. First, there is no handle to hold it in place, especially when my baby keeps on fidgeting. The part to hold is no thicker than 1cm. Given my fat fingers, it was extremely difficult to use as I keep dropping it. Secondly, one has really to see which direction each flat part is facing as there is only one direction that can be fitted into the baby's mouth. Terrible structure.
