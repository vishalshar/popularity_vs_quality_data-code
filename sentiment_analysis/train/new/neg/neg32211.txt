It's just way overpriced.  I usually read reviews here diligently, but I guess it's hard to find a bird clock for a little girls room, so I bought it because it matched.  It really is just a film sticker on particle board.  Looking at the pic here it looks like a decal that might be 3-dimensional, but it's disappointingly not.  This clock is ok and it matches her room, but it's not worth the price at all.
