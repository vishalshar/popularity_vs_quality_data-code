I can't make this thing work.Once it's assembled, I myself, a grown man, can not suck anything through the straw. I can sometimes get it to let a little liquid through, with great difficulty, if I jiggle some things around a bit. But that's only if I get lucky.Moreover, the thing is hard to assemble. The straw has to go inside a chamber in the lid, bend around a little bit, and exit a hole on the other side. But getting it to bend the right way is a matter of pure luck. You have to just close your eyes and sort of hope for the best. Half the time I end up just getting the straw bent against the inside of the chamber.Finally, the lid has a mechanism that closes when the cup is not in use, hiding the straw and preventing leaks. The problem is, the mechanism takes considerable strength to open. It's never jammed or anything, but to open it I have to stop everything I'm doing and struggle with the thing for half a minute or so. That's not convenient.I don't know if some of us are just getting a bad batch of cups or what, but in my experience, this cup is literally unusable.
