I got this product to help with the bowel movements after hearing it about a similar product on the Joe Rogan Podcast. It works, less strain and it speeds up the amount of time I'm in there. I would give the product a higher rating if the part where you put your feet on was wider. I have size 12 feet and after a few moments they start to hurt and have to adjust them every once in a while. Other than that I say it works.
