Reviews were so good that I decided to order this pillow. I'm used to sleeping on my back so I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping on my side since the 4th month when they recommend you do. I didn't want to buy a body pillow because we have a queen size bed and my husband is tall so the three of us wouldn't have fit in the same bed. I got this one last week, I'm 7 months pregnant now and I just don't know if I like it yet, the first night I hated it and I've been using it for 4 nights now and every night is less bad, but still I can't seem to have a good night sleep on my side. I get a lot of pain on my hips and this is not doing the trick entirely. I think its better than other pillows only because it's so small but you will need additional pillows to be comfortable.
