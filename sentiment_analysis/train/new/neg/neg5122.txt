The font for where it says "we make a family" is not what appears on the picture. Debating whether to return. The font depicted is nice, and this one is a bit cheesy. It also only measures 22X14. So doesn't really accurately reflect picture of description.  May return.8/18/13 update: So I decided to keep it instead of the hassle of a return, and boy and I kicking myself. I have purchased many wall decals from various companies, and this is by far the most difficult to install and cheapest product. Do yourself a favor and find a different vendor. The best wall decal are already sandwiched betweenthe two peices of contact paper. This one, you have to first apply the separate peice of contact paper to the decal, then install. Also, the letters stuck to the contact paper, bubbled, and would not adhear to wall without me scraping almost every letter with my finger nail off the contact paper first. Decal also ripped due to letters not coming off contact paper onto wall. You get what you pay for, which is a very cheap peice of junk. Buy elsewhere.
