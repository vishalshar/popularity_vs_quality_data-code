The music is too loud, and coupled with the flashing lights...my 7 month old cries everytime I turn this thing on.  He does not like this toy, and he is the most easy going baby ever.  He has a mellow personality and is the happiest baby I have ever seen.  Always smiling, except when we turn this toy on.
