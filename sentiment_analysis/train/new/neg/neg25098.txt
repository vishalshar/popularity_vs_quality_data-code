My daughter wants to be held all the time, so I invested in and eventually bought an ERGObaby carrier for her shortly after she was born. I didn't realize that a baby under four months would need an Insert, and I was happy to find one that would match her carrier. I loved that the insert had an adjustable strap and the way that its made to fit baby. At first it was difficult getting her into it alone. I would to re-read the instruction manual and watch several demonstrations (by ERGO)  online before I felt comfortable. Once I finally got the hang of things, I began to familiarize my daughter with being in the insert before using it with the carrier. My daughter would tolerate the insert, but as soon as she was in the carrier all ready to go, she would begin crying. I would check to make sure she wasn't caught, pinched, or slouched too much. She was fine and I was stumped. As my daughter got older and no longer needed the insert, we noticed that she would go into any carrier without crying. That's when it dawned on me, as a new baby she absolutely hated being swaddled. I guess the insert/carrier combination felt that way to her. Every baby is different :) Even though I've had minimal use out of this insert, I don't regret my purchase and I would recommend this to a friend.
