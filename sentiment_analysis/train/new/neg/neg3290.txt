I ordered this blanket set for my autistic son, as a back up, to his original blankets. His original blanket looks exactly like the picture, baby blue solid blanket with a striped baby blue and white blanket. But, what was pictured here is not what I received. Of course, I had to through another on line service to find the blanket set I needed. I'm just happy a friend needs these blankets has back up for her autistic child, so these are going to her.
