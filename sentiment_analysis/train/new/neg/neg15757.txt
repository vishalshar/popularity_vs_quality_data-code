I bought this to use on my daughter's carseat (Britax marathon.)  It was ok while it lasted.  My husband somehow broke the plastic arm that goes over the carseat right before we took off for a weekend road trip.  I was dissapointed.  It needs to be much more durable, it only lasted about a month.  Maybe if that part was reinforced with metal or something it would be more durable.
