Honestly for the price I thought it would have been made a little better. It does not look the same as the picture it looks extremely faded. I also had to cut strings off of it to make it  baby safe.. It's still cute don't get me wrong but there was definitely false advertising.  I bought this for my nephew who is due in a couple days.
