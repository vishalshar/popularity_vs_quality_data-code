Like was mentioned by other reviewers, the wooden frame is terribly cheap and flimsy. When the product arrived, the wooden frame was already chipped and splintered (I almost got a splinter in my finger from it), and when set up, didn't balance correctly on all four legs. Seems like it could very easily be tipped over, which isn't safe for a child's room. The fabric is very cute and the liner is easy to remove to carry laundry, but this product is not at all worth the price. I am returning it.
