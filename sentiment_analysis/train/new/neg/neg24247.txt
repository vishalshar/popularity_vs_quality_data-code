I loved the box set up when we first received it, but the third time in use one of the 'wings' hinge thing broke. Without their ability to snap the whole thing together, the whole thing is useless. I don't know if I could contact the company for a replacement 'wing', if i am successful at doing so I'll update the review because it was great when it worked.great idea, needs to address the realistic fact that many of the wings will fail so they should offer replacements right up front****contacted company, they said product is discontinued and my only recorse would be to attempt to return or exchange the item from the place purchased ***
