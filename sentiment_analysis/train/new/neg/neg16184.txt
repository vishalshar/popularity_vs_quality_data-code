These are really cute and my son does likes them a lot.  They have great colors and textures, but he only loved them after I had to fix the major flaw these things have.  They collapse the minute your baby squeezes them or rolls on them, they are not stuffed, totally defeating the purpose of a block.  I decided that I liked them enough to rip them open and stuff them myself, why Taggies didn't think of this is beyond me, it's so stupid.  But now, after my alteration, I love them.
