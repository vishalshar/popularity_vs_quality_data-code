Ink was dry so print barely seen on paper used. Would be a better product if ink was a little more moist. Ink also came off my newborn but not the wash cloth I used to clean his hands & feet with. Pad could be a tad bigger as my newborns were premature & their hands & feet barely fit on pad. I'm sure full term babies will not be able to fit at all.
