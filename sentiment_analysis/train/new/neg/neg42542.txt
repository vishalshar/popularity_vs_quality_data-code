The Lamaze Crib Soother isn't a bad product, but it isn't really great either. After receiving it in the mail, it became evident that a defective unit was shipped to use. I was easily able to exchange it for a new one with Amazon. The second unit works fine. It can stand by being leaned against something, or strap onto the crib frame. I haven't used the MP3 feature because I would have to hook my phone up to it as I do not have an old MP3 player laying around.All in all, it's an OK product. I think it will serve the purpose, but it really isn't anything special. A bit expensive for what you get, though.
