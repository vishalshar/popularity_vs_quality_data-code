It is great to have a potty that can be out and about with you and that it has it's own carrying case. This potty is definitely durable and easy to set up, clean up and use. I also like that it comes w/ a nice carrying case. However, I think there are other potties out there that might be a bit more portable.  This one is pretty big (which is good if you have a taller child), so it has to be hooked to the stroller b/c it doesn't fit into the basket underneath.  Also- it only comes w/ 4 bags and pads so you have to separately purchase more bags and pads (or makeshift create your own, which we do) and not a whole lot of bags and pads will fit into the carrying bag. Since we are potty training right now, we can easily go through 4 bags in one morning outing.
