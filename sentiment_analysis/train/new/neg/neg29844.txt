Had a mom swear by it, but did not work for my LO. Can still move her arms around inside which woke her up. I will say, every product will not work for everyone. This might be great for your baby, but not mine. Excellent seller transaction :)Other products you might be considering and my thoughts:Halo Sleep Sack Swaddle: 3 out of 5 stars. She likes it and sleeps for 5 hours in it but the noisy velcro would wake her if I needed to change her in the middle of the night. Still a good sleep aid but here are better...Miracle Blanket- A true miracle!!! 5 out of 5 She sleeps 7-9 hours, uninterrupted in this awesome baby straight jacket. There is a separate leg pouch so you can change in the middle of the night, if needed.Aden & Anais swadddlers- 4 out of 5. Houdini can still break out of these, however, I am not concerned she will suffocate due to the lightness and breathability of the fabric :)Swaddle Me- summer infant- 1 out of 5 - but again, I know some people who own the entire collection and swear by them! Again, there is velcro, put my daughter in it and she refused it immediately. Easy to use but didnt get her arms in tight enough
