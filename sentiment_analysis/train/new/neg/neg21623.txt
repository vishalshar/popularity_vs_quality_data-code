I owned another one of different brand that I really like, but the price shot up after I thought of buying another one, so I decided to try this one as they look similar and with the same size. D rings were there, but not the wire on the neck, which is very important to me otherwise I can use my large scarf for the job. If you are like me - feel more comfortable seeing your baby any time while nursing, look for one with wire.
