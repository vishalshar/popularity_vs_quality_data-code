I absolutely love this diaper bag. It's so cute, the red is vibrant and pretty and there's plenty of bag space.But I absolutely hate the opening. It's not a normal zipper. When you unzip it, there's a strip that velcro's then shuts. It's hard to explain but it's stupid. It's a pain in the butt when you're in a rush. It's just not convenient. Which really irritates me, so much that I bought a new diaper bag. I just couldn't get over it. If you don't mind the opening then it's a really great bag. :)
