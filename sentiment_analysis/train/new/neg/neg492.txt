I thought I had to purchase this gate to use the Y-spindle necessary for my staircase (as mentioned in the Y-spindle's product info), so I purchased it. The gate itself is fine, no problems. The closing clasp didn't make a clicky sound, so it sounded like it didn't close firmly, but I think overall the quality was fine.The reason I don't like this product is that it is freaking expensive! And when I realized my existing gates could work, I had to ship it back to California and lost a ton of money! And even though all the parts were included, they knocked off $15 from my refund b/c I had torn the plastic open.I'm on the East Coast so I had to pay a pretty shipping and handling fee. Overall, that experience really ticked me off!!They're lucky I didn't give them a lower rating but I don't want to misguide you buys about the quality of the gate itself. I'd say, check your local stores first before you dish out lots of cash for such a standard gate that might not be needed in the first place.
