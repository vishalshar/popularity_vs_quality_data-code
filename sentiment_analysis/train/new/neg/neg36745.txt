I purchased this bag because I was tired of toting around a purse and a GIANT diaper bag. The biggest and only beef with this bag - there's no zipper enclosing the main area of the bag. Maybe I'm supposed to use another area for my things I cherish (cell phone and wallet), but I like to keep these things in the main compartment. Needless to say, things are always falling out whether it's toys or my wallet. I still use this bag, but am thankful that cross over purses are in style. I now carry a small crossover purse with in addition to this bag as my daily diaper bag for errands.Searching for a purse that could possibly do double duty rather than a 'diaper' specific bag.
