These work to keep the wetness off of clothing while potty training. My son wears them at school over underpants in case of accidents.  They are a little loud due to the plastic material . The problem is with the sizing. My son is 3 and an average size, I first bought the 3t and they could have fit me. Then the 2t, again huge. Ended up getting the 12 month ones and they fit him with room to grow. If you are going to buy these, buy 3 sizes under your child's age.  Again, he only wears underpants under them, so if wearing over cloth diaper you may need a size up. Hope he doesn't need them for long.
