NEVER use any extra padding in a carseat unless the seat came with it.  Although I applaud the innovation and idea, truly needed, the design is seriously flawed.  Reading the other reviews I see everyone says, "I had to loosen the straps on the car seat...".  This puts your child at serious risk if in an accident as the padding will compress and suddenly the straps are not tight enough.  Same goes for coats and buntings, they should NEVER be used with a carseat.  For your baby's safety just use blankets or even get one of the seat covers that just go over the top of the seat, but anything that interferes with the straps is a BIG safety risk.
