I love what this has to offer in terms of functionality. It's a lightweight-ish umbrella stroller, that functions as a snap and go for the first year. Unfortunately, the execution of this, the first model, falls flat. In the first week of use three years ago, the foam handles started falling apart, and the logo fell off the side. Then, I noticed that the wheels would get stuck. Turning and backing up are very clumsy. The inly reason I'm hanging on to it is because We still have the Keyfit, and are planning to have another child.Today, while I was shopping for a new one, my son insisted on trying the new version, and It performed wonderfully. Iwonder if they'll swap out the front wheels?
