When i got this my son was so excited.  He was putting his dirty clothes in it daily.  It has been a few weeks and the handles have come off and the netting is separating from the frame.  I am extremely disappointed.  I have a cheap one of these that i have had for years that has not done this.  I wouldnt waste your money.  Better off getting one at five below or walmart.
