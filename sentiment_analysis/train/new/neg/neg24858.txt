I wanted to use this with my Pack N Play Travel Lite when the bassinet sling in in use. However, the rods required to make the bassinet sling will not allow this toy to lay flat against the side of the Pack N Play so it juts out and baby can reach under it and further flip it up and off.I wish companies would make mirrors that work with the Pack N Play in bassinet mode like they do for regular cribs. Babies love mirrors so it would make sense they'd like them in a Pack N Play as well.
