We've used these swaddles for both of our sons. When our second was getting close to the 14 lb. point, I ordered this swaddle and an organic cotton version. I washed both before using according to the instructions included. The organic cotton version came out fine, but this version shrunk down to smaller than the small size we were already using! It's completely unuseable. I've had good luck with this product previously, but will order an organic cotton version instead.
