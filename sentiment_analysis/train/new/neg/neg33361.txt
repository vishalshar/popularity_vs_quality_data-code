This mattress really seems great. Like many others state, no smell, firmness is great, etc. However, it is too large for my crib. The dimensions on Naturepedic as well as the tag on the mattress say 27-1/2" wide. The mattress is a good 28" wide. Amazon does show this under the dimensions, however, I assumed the actual manufacturer would be more accurate than Amazon, so dispite all the warnings, I risked it and it was indeed too large. Unfortunately, the mattress is going back.
