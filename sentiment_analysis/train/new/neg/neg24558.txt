These fit my 20-month old very well but we only used them a handful of times when he rode on the mower with daddy before they snapped in the middle of the earmuff plastic & broke.  By the time I had time to process the return, it was too late/past the return policy date.  We also purchased the HearTek Kids Earmuffs and they are super cute & have held up very well when my son wore them while we were having some construction done on the house & now we use them on the mower.
