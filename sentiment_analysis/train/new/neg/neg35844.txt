We have several different styles of sippy cups and this one is the least liked. My five year old will use it but it's always her last choice, same with my 18 mos old twins. I am not 100% sure why they don't like it but I am guessing it's harder to get their mouth around, the other types we have, have more of a spout or mouth piece that makes it very easy to suck the liquid out. This is the "graduates" line so they are made for older kids but it's still the least favorite of my 5 yr old and she easily drinks out of regular cups.All of the sippy cups we have are leak proof except for the cheapy Nuby ones we bought for $1 at Walmart, those are horrible! I bought the regular Nuk sippy cups that are green and purple and then the next advanced that we got is the Nuk brand with the red and blue fire engines. Then this style of Nuk sippy cup. All three Nuk sippy styles have different shaped lids. If I were to do it all over again, knowing what I know now, I would get the plain purple and green, they have a slightly curved body for easy handling and the largest mouth piece, which all of my kids prefer.The lids of these can be difficult to get on but do-able with a little patience. Lid has to be on tight or it will leak.Happy shopping!
