Bought this monitor in April 2011 for baby due in July. Started using in August. We have many walls between ours and baby's room. Worked great for the first 5 months use. Last night, I woke up to find the monitor screen with the Summer Infant logo on display, meaning it wasn't connected to the signal on the video in the baby's room. With our bedroom door at the front of the house shut and the baby's room at the back of the house shut, there would have been no way for me to hear him crying. We have had signal problems tonight as well. I hooked up the cheap sound monitor as a backup. I can't rely on this product now.
