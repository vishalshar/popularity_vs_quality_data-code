It's cute, and there are a few things I like about it, like the fact that it can be unzipped and rolled to the sides and out of the way when indoors, and zipped all the way up for outdoors, with an easy enough transition.  The inside pattern is cute and stylish, but the the outside fabric was problematic.  It's slippery and does not stay in place while in use, so you would constantly need to pull it up around the baby, not convenient at all.
