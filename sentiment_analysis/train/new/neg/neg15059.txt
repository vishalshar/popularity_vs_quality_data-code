Honestly I had high hopes for this pillow. I found out it's just really thick foam with thin fabric on it. So thick that it was only good for nursing my child until around 3/4 months. After that it was awkward and still had no give in the foam. The covering ripped at the seams when I tried to put it on after washing it. I do like how it was not having to be completely around my body to be close to me and that it's not round and tubular so there was no weird gap that my kid rolled into. I am pretty picky about my nursing pillows and have actually found that a decorative pillow about this length/width has only worked for me. Would've been great if it wasn't so thick and gas some give instead of the dense foam.
