I could not decide whether to give this product 2 or 4 stars.Here's the problem, it is a lovely item. However, there is absolutely nothing we could do to get this item to stick to the tile in our bathroom. Well, short of not putting anything in it. I'd say that we had the organizer less than half as full as pictured with plastic bath toys and it fell down from the weight each and every single time. And despite how tempting it was to just slap it up there as soon as I opened it, I took the time to clean the area where it was going, then wait for it to dry, then hang it, and then wait 10 minutes before hanging the organizer. I also tried putting it from different spots, but still no dice.So here's why I'm neither returning it nor giving it only two stars...I just so happen to have a shower caddie with two prongs that are placed approximately the same with apart as the two white knobs where the suction is supposed to go. The organizer now hangs off of these two prongs. So in the end, I still get my organizer effect. However, now I have to rehome the items that were perfectly suited for the prongs before the organizer came around and I can't hang the organizer at a height that is accessible for my toddler.So there you have it. My mixed review of a product that really should be awesome in theory.UPDATE: Since first purchasing this product, we have moved to a new apartment. The organizer hangs much better to the tile in this bathroom, however it still consistently falls down about twice a month. Tolerable, especially compared to the once every 15 minutes at our last place. I'm still going to leave my review at 3 stars. I would maybe have bumped it 3.5 stars if it were option, but still don't think it meets 4-star expectations.
