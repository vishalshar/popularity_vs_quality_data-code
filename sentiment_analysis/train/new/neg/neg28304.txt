I told my husband not to order these, but he went ahead and did. These never touched my baby's mouth and they never will. I don't know what kind of plastic they are because of course it doesn't disclose that, but after washing them I gave one of the keys a bite and I was disgusted. The chemical smell is repulsive. they say BPA free, but that doesn't mean much, there are a lot of worse things on the market which have come out to replace BPA (i.e. Tritan) and I dare say this is one of the worst.I'm going to stick to silicone and natural rubber. I wish I knew what this material was so I could avoid it in the future.These are going in the trash!
