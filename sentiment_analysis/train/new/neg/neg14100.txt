Yes it is wonderful to use, because it's perfect height for me at 5'3 so I don't have to bend over to wash. It is not made for small houses with small bathrooms. I have a very hard time filling it, the hose is too short to effectively reach my sink and I ended up with water all over the floor. Once you get it filled, it needs a cushion to hold a newborn, there is no way you can bathe a newborn who can't hold their head up. The plastic would be very hard on their head and they can be injured. I solved this by pre-purchasing a leachco safer bather pillow. It's perfect for this tub. The pink is beautiful and this is definitely a good buy, just beware that it fits where you want it to go =)
