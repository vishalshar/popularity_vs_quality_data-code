This is a great bag with one big issue. I used it on a trip and gate checked our stroller several times.  3 out of 4 times this was gate checked the airline put it through to the carrousel instead of bringing it up to the gate.  This caused me to have to carry my 30lb child through the terminal to connecting flights.  I asked the flight crew about it and they said that all bags end up at the carrousel, even if there is a stroller inside.  This happened when we had an international flight -  we went on the next plane and the stroller went to baggage claim.  We ended up having to put in a lost baggage request and a couple days later the stroller was forwarded to us.  So basically, this seemed like a great idea, but is really impractical.
