This bottle tote looked good, it snaps easily, it fit my baby bottles (the standard gerber $1 dollar bottles) and is a good fit for water bottles but it didn't keep anything cold.  After only an hour or so all milk or water will be lukewarm if you're in hot weather.  If the weather isn't too hot, it will be somewhat cool after an hour or so but what's the point of buying one of these if it doesn't keep it much cooler than just throwing it in your purse.  Especially if you're buying it for a baby bottle cooler...it's worthless.
