They are super cute and they do hold on really well, but the decal on the clip has rubbed off and it makes me concerned about the paint rubbing off in baby's mouth. I prefer the chew beads paci clip personally. My baby is 5 months and will chew on the chew beads, but isn't a fan of the wood in her mouth. They are cute though.
