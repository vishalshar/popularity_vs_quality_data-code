We bought this in March of 2014. Our grandchildren live out of town and this is only used when they visit. The mattress has a great concept however it cheaply made and it's only been used about a dozen times. It is stored in a closet in it the carrying pack that it comes with.  The seams have cracked and the outer part of the mattress will no longer stay inflated. Knowing what I know now I would have never spent 70.00 on this product. Sorry for the bad review, honestly I've never posted a one star review, it really is a very poorly made item.
