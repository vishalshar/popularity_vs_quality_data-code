It was a gift and so thin that I had to purchase another blanket to compensate for the lack of filling.  It was for a baby crib, there is no way this would keep a little one warm in the winter.  The person wanted this particular one, so I accommodated but felt bad when I saw how thin it was.  It seemed cheap.
