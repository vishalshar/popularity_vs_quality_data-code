The first time I purchased this item one of the air tubes was cracked and the bunny would not pop up. An exchange was made, however, the second time proved just as disappointing. My son loved it at first, as did I. But it took less than 2 weeks for a 4-month-old to break another air tube. I only give this item 1 star because my son loved to kick and make the animals hop into view (when it was working). However, after the second item broke, his frustration with trying to kick the bunny into view again made him kick so hard that, like others, the entire thing would shift. Great concept, but it seems cheaply made and impossible to fix. Not recommended.
