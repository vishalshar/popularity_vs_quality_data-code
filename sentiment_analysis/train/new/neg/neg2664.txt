I was so glad to find these bags and have used probably over 100 of them, but unfortunately, they're not perfect. I've had several bags leak on me. I did not over fill them and followed the instructions. Some leaked after being frozen, then thawed. Some leaked from just being put in the fridge (before being frozen). Although most of them didn't leak, the few that did left a mess for me to clean, which was annoying. If you do use them, it's probably a good idea to store them in a bowl or plastic bag just in case they leak.
