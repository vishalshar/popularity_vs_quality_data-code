I seriously JUST got this delivered, took it out of the box to look at it and the beads fell right off.  Very disappointed in the poor quality of this!  Also, if the beads can come off THAT easily then clearly this is a CHOKING hazard and defeats the purpose of giving it to a small child for their first rosary!!
