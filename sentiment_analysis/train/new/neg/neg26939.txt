Unfortunately after a few weeks of use I had to edit my 5 star review. This product would be much better if it was fitted like an actual sheet. The way this cover is made makes it too loose causing it to bunch & ripple under the sheet. Being it is so thick this is definitely not what you want under your sheet!
