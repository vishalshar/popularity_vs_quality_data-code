When I first saw this brush I was very excited. Finally, a brush that did not use bristles! Two reasons I don't like the bristle cleaning brushes are:1. It sprays/flings the contents of the bottle when you remove it.2. I feel it misses a lot of spots on the bottle.  But since it's only formula and I usually soak the bottles, it's not a big deal.So, back to the microfiber brush. The brush has to be forced into the bottle and after a few days, the microfiber finally tore away.  But when it was in the bottle, it was just a few turns and you could tell it was coming into contact with more bottle surface than the bristle wands.I use the Dr. Browns bottle.  With the smaller 4oz bottle, there was no point to use this.  They cleaned the larger bottles well but again, you had to force the wand into the bottle.  On the few wide mouth bottles we had, it worked great.  If they offered different sizes it would be perfect.I know some people are worried about bacteria and such but just like my other sponges and bottles cleaners, they all have to be replaced at some point. When you go through as many bottles a day as I do, something like this would help to cut down on washing time. Hoping Nuk creates a smaller wand.The Nuk drying wand on the other hand works great! Not sure why there is such a long wait for this to be delivered.
