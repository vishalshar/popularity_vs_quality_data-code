If I could give this gate a zero or negative stars I would.For one thing, their size chart is wrong!  My deck is 61" across so I purchased the gate and a 4 bar extension.  Turns out it was too small so I purchased a 2nd 4 bar extension - now it fits without the endson it.The gate itself is very flimsy and not sturdy at all.  The extensions slide in but dont click onto anything so they fall out easily.In the end, I decided to keep it vs returning it because I didnt want to deal with the hassel.  I taped all the extensions so they are somewhat sturdy then connected the gate to my deck via wire to keep it from falling down.Do not buy this gate it is a piece of junk.
