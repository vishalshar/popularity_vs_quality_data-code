Very disappointed.It is a piece of junk... It looks like it's gonna break any minute. And it looks like a toy.It does not fit standard faucets (see attached photo).I don't understand the photo on Amazon. How is this thing supposed to hold onto the faucet. It either falls on mine or splashes water everywhere.It can be convenient when camping and travelling, yes... if it fits the faucet.Overall, I don't recommend it.
