It's only 20% polyester, but you really notice.  Most mothers want 100% cotton for babies, and I am no exception.  If you buy them, the design is cute, but there are much better, softer, more absorbent products on the market.  It reminds me of the synthetic static cloths I have for dusting my coffee table.  Hardly something for putting under babies face.While not the worst product, I would not buy again.  If it wasn't internationally shipped I would have returned it.Manufacturer - Make your product 100% cotton, and you will have 100% happy customers.  Its my own fault for not reading the description properly, as it clearly states it is not 100% cotton.This same supplier/company has plenty of other, better products on the market: for example: Luvable friends receiving blankets, and Luvable friends 4 pack super soft washcloths.  Wish I'd stocked up on a few extra of those instead.
