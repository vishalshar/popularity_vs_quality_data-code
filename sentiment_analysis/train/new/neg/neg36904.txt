I was disappointed after receiving these scissors because I thought they would be great for baby nails. Yes, they are well made, and the tips are rounded for safety.My gripe with these was that the blades were too thick and I could not get them under the corner of my son's nails. The best way for me to cut his nails is to get adult nail scissors, albeit they have a sharp tip, under the corner of his nail while he is sleeping and make a snip. Once the notch is cut, I use my fingers to peel the nail the rest of the way across. This particular baby nail scissor does not allow me to get a good start by clipping the corner so I will go back to using my old Sally Hansen adult nail scissors.
