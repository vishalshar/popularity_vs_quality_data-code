We bought this from babies r us and thought it was great. I put it together and everything was fine. The problem came when we decided to see how the unit worked. The noise that came from the motor was terrible. I thought it was going to break. I was concerned with the noise because if it sounds like this right out of the box how will it sound 6 months from now? We called the company and told them the issue and they are sending us a replacement tower that holds the motor. The company said it was covered under the warranty. We will see if the replacement still makes that noise. Would have given it 5 stars bt the motor thing killed it for me. I do lovet the mp3 player option.
