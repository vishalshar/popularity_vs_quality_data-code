I opened the box i noticed they sent me the wrong color. Im not too picky so i gave it a chance because i care more about how it would work. I also noticed some color fade by the way, like it had been in storage too long or something.  It works fine, holds my 18lb baby fine. At first I thought the little mat was for babies who cant reach the floor yet, or like to jump but it doesnt have any tension, it will prevent the baby from rolling the walker though. When I put it in rocker mode it doesnt do much rocking, but I figure it is for safety. My baby likes to try and rock it the little it will move. As for the toys, they keep him a little busy,but it will also play music. Push a button and plays a song. They also continuasly play music as long as you hold the buttons, so imagine how tired i get of the music when my kid leans his elbow on them for a few minutes. The good thing is you can take them all off. they have a strap you undo and the toys come out as a tray and you are left with a indented tray like the high chairs. You can feed them there or put in other toys.
