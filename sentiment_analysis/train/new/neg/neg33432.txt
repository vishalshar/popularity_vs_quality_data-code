I bought this chair for my 10 month old daughter who is big for her age.  She likes to sit AT the table, so I sometimes use this chair instead of her highchair.It is a nice chair and looks great with our kitchen table.  The chair pad is great too because it is plastic instead of cloth, so it wipes off very easily.  The neutral pattern works for male or female too.The only problem I see is that when my daughter is sitting in it, the tray is basically on top of her legs so her food is right in her lap area.  That means she has to try to get the food in her lap from a longer distance than her highchair.When she is using it without the tray, I think it will be better.
