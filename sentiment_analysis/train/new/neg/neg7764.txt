I bought this for our baby to help keep him warm during the winter months. It is a weird thick material that didn't seem to fit well on the car seat. I think I used it 5 times and just got sick of it. The strap at the top is really thick and makes it uncomfortable to carry the car seat when it's on. I wouldn't suggest it.
