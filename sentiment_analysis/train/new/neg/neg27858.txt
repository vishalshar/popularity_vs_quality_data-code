Intially, we loved this stroller.  I loved the bassinett type cover when our son was an infant, I liked the three reclining positions and dual positions of the handle.  But this stroller does not wear well.  After about 8 months the side covers on the inside of the seat came out and I could never get them to go back in.  The harness seat belt is a total nightmare so we took it out, and just left the bottom part attatched.  Every time we opened the stroller though, we have to make sure the seat belt is in not stuck before we open it. The wheels are definately not curb or sidewalk friendly.  I have gotten stuck many times going through the crosswalk trying to go up the curb.  This always jolts my son and upsets me.  The tires needless to say aren't all terrain let alone even "most terrain."  I could go on but I just think for $400 things should last atleast a year and be equipped to easily move through a crosswalk. Oh, and recently, (I have had the stroller for 14 months now) I was lifting the handle to change positioning and the whole entire handle bar broke off on both sides. So, now I have to purchase another stroller. For those of you wondering, I probably use this stroller about 2-3 times a month, so that adds up to anywhere between 24 to 36 times overall.  Perhaps I just got a lemon, but I would not recommend this stroller to anyone. For the price they need to upgrade its mobility. Most Peg-Perego are made with all the same plastic parts as Graco or Evenflo, they just have sportier fabric and a fancier name.
