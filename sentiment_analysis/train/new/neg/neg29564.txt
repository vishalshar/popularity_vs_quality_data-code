Not easy setup as advertised.Installed the app for IOS and the app could not locate the camera. Tried many times and it still could not find. Tried with android and it worked.The firmware needed to be upgraded and the upgrade was failing. Tried both ios and android and same result. Tried to manually upgrade using dlink product website instructions, but could jot as this particular model doesnt have a firmware available for download.Atlast decided to return. I may have to put more time for setup, but who knows if something else happens after the return period.
