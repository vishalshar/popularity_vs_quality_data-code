Desperate for a good nights sleep, we purchased this for our 8 month old during our home move. My mom has a nice soft memory foam play pen mattress for when we visit and I guess that's what I had in mind when I read foam. It's NOT the same thing. My kid sleeps better on the floor than on this thing. It's a stiff peice of plastic coated foam. It is about the consistency of a loaf of French bread. He usually sleeps on a hand me down $90 Walmart mattress, but it took him 4-5 nights to actually sleep on this. You could argue all kinds of external factors but he has never not slept on the memory foam one at my moms. Had the packaging not gotten thrown away I would have returned it. I would have spent the extra to ship it back and buy a more expensive one.
