these decals cannot be called decals, they are thinner than scotch tape. impossible to remove from backing without tearing. i was so aggravated trying to remove them. if my granddaughter had not seen these when they came in, i would have thrown them in the trash when i tried to remove the first one. i know for sure if i ever take them from the walls they will be in tiny pieces. dont ever buy these.
