But the reviews are true, the velcro wears out. Fast. It also doesn't hold as well as the snap/button closures, and it ismuch bulkier than the snap closure-types.It is perfectly waterproof, so no harm there.. but as far as cloth diapering goes it is very bulky as-is and I prefer to keep things trim as possible. I love thirsties brand, as well as a few others but as far as all covers go- I wish I had stuck to the snap closures instead of investing in the velcro styles.IMO- aplix/velcro looks easier and cuter, but I don't like wasting money. I feel I wasted more money on aplix than snaps. But go thirsties!! Good brand. (:
