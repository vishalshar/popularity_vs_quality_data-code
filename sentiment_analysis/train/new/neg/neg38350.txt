Pay attention to the 1-star review for this product: almost all of them are about the screws. If you have never had the experience of having half-a-screw stuck in your fine kitchen cabinetry then prepare yourself before installing this product because that is going to happen. I have no idea why a manufacturer would essentially sabotage their own product to save $0.001 on a screw but Kidco seems to have chosen to include the softest, cheapest screws in existence. Even if you drill pilot holes and, carefully select the right size of screw driver and apply only steady, careful pressure you will sure strip or shear off half the screws included with this set.Additionally, the instructions included should not be taken without careful consideration. If you're seeing the product sample image that I see, you will notice that there is a screw for door handle on the door. This is exactly where you will need to install the hook mounting plate if you follow the directions! So don't: instead, install the mounting hook onto the cupboard door first. Make sure the TOP of the mounting hook plate is below the BOTTOM of the catch that you would install onto the cupboard. Doing this should prevent you from drilling multiple holes and ruining even more screws.
