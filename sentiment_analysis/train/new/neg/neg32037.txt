The Manhattan Toy Go Push Toy Puppy is an enjoyable, all plastic toy with rounded edges and front wheel drive. When fully mashed down and released, it will travel about ten feet. My particular Go Push Toy pulls to the left a bit.The plastic seems like the sort that would splint into pointy plastic bits if it were to be broken. The internal mechanism seems well-planned, considering that while it is standing upright, it is not “in gear,” allowing it to roll forward or backward without breaking. When the body is pressed down, it basically works like a rip-cord when the spring-up motion pulls an internal strip to make the wheels spin.Although it does not take a shop press to mash it down, it seems to take some effort for little hands. If the head is pressed down, it flips, and properly pressing down on the body results in friction at the joint for the body halves trying to move in two different directions beneath the hand.This is a cute puppy toy that is easily rolled without mashing, but it does make for something to chase down when the self-propelling action gets put to use. The product is okay, and I would recommend it for those who are fascinated with puppies.
