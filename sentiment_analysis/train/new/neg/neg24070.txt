I love the look and it is very sturdy...here comes the but...  There are so many crevices for food to get stuck.  I have 6 kids and only the first 4 really used it.  It got to be such a pain to clean out after every meal that we basically stopped using it. There were many times I had to use a toothpick to get little bits of stuck food out. I mentioned it's very sturdy.  You would have a had time knocking it over but that also means it has a larger footprint.  I can't tell you how many times I stubbed my toes walking around it.  I hope someday a company will be able to successfully blend function with an aesthetically pleasing design.
