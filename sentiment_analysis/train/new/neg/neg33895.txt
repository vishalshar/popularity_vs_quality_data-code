I received my item today. It is a clear counterfeit. The packaging was terrible. The tags were all wrong. It is a cheap and terrible knock off. My order was fulfilled by amazon and I was shocked to see that they would send such a terrible fake. It all said limited edition especially for babyhaven.com. No wonder I haven't seen it anywhere else. It's a sham! I read that babyhaven.com was a scam so I expected that I would at least get legit stuff if shipped by amazon. Boy was I wrong! Out of the 3 wubbanubs that I ordered two were a clear fake! I probably won't be buying anything from amazon in the future!
