I like it.  The baby likes it.  Has a nice wide base so you don't have to worry about it falling over...at the same time it means it takes up a little more room.  Assembles easily, tray removes easily.The biggest problem I have with it is the removable cover.  The top is easy to get on, the bottom part is A LOT trickier.  Two tiny elastic straps are supposed to wrap around a couple of plastic tabs to hold it in place, but the elastic loops are too small and you REALLY have to stretch it to get them on.  I couldn't do it normally.  I needed to loop the elastic on the end of a screwdriver and kind of slide it onto the tabs.  We are not looking forward to the first time we have to remove and wash because of this design flaw.  Even if you try to do this hard part first before pulling the top over it is extremely difficult.
