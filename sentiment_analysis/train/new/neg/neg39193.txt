I bought this pump because it was recommended. I am unhappy with the suction but am really disappointed with the little white disc/valve that's inside. After a while, while you are pumping, it keeps popping out, you have to disassemble the entire pump, put the little disc back into its place and continue pumping. I have tried to buy replacements of the little white discs, but none of the stores selling the pump sell them. I was unable to find them online.  I finally called Avent and spoke to a rep who told me that they replaced the discs with another part, which she'd ship out to me. I called Avent 2 days later to follow up on the order and was told that it was sent out by USPS and should get to me in 5-8 days. In the meantime, it is almost impossible for me to pump milk for my son without constantly taking the pump apart and reassembling it. Yesterday, I called again to tell Avent that I was very unhappy with the pump and the handling of the shipment. The rep I spoke to was actually helpful- she told me to boil the white valve in water and white vinegar, said that it might help the silicon to expand. It worked on one of the valves so far and I hope I'll get the replacement parts soon to see if they are any better. I think what upsets me most is that Avent keeps selling the pumps with the valves even though they are aware of the fact that they wear out and need to be replaced.
