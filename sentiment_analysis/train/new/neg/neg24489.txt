Very disappointed in this bag. The buckles were gold tone which I didn't notice in the picture (that was my fault but I hated the gold - wish it was silver toned or stainless steel instead). Also, very cheaply made. The zipper on the inside kept getting stuck and the liners for the compartment was so cheap, it wouldn't really hold anything. Everything would fall out and end up at the bottom of the bag. It also didn't have the gradient check marked pattern as shown in the picture. It was the same material - although you could see it had a checkered pattern it was not as detailed as in the photo and looked too shiny. The bag just looks super cheap from every angle (which I expected for the price). It was not what I expected and I don't recommend this product at all. It ended up in the donation pile so sorry to the future owner of this bag.
