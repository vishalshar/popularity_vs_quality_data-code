I have been pumping for 6 months now, and in that time, I have dealt with four brands of breastmilk storage bags. There is one complaint I have about all breastmilk bags. The ounce lines are never accurate (some more than others, but never right). I always look at how much I pumped with the bottle and write the total alone with name and date. This allows me to know how much is in it after I've frozen it flat and never worry about how inaccurate the lines are.Here is my comparison of the four types of bags I've used in order of my preference.1. Dr. Brown's Breastmilk Storage Bags -Pros: *Very thick. *Entire opening is sealed by a pull off tab. *Very easy to fill *Stands up as you start pouring milk in. *Extremely easy to pour into a bottle. These are my favorite bag!Cons: *On the expensive side. *Ounce lines on the side aren't as accurate as I'd like (though more accurate than others). *Only sold (as far as I can tell) in packs of 25. This wasn't a problem for me as I can only freeze a little of my milk, but if you are pumping and freezing a lot, this would be a deal breaker.2. Bonafide Baby Breastmilk Storage BagsPros: *Medium thickness (not as thick as Dr. Brown's, but much thicker than NUK or Lansinoh). *Write on tab. *Easy to fill, starts to stand on its own as the milk goes in and does not collapse. *Pours easily into a bottle. *American made. I don't know about the others, but this one specifies it on their box. *Includes a non-toxic permanent marker.Cons: *Ounce lines on the side are extremely inaccurate.3. NUK/Gerber Seal N Go Breastmilk BagsPros: *Double layer zip-top. *Writing area is on the tab, not on the bag itself. *Cheap.Cons: *Very thin. *Hard to pour into without spilling (doesn't like to stay open). *No sealer tab. *Plastic tends to collapse when you are pouring the milk.4. Lansinoh Breastmilk Storage Bags -Pros: *Double layer zip-top. *Writing area is on the tab, not on the bag itself. *Top of tab has pull of sealer tab. *Cheap.Cons: *Very thin. *Hard to pour into without spilling (doesn't like to stay open). I have had several leak after I froze and then thawed them - this was a deal breaker for me, as I use bags solely for freezer storage.The Bonafide and Dr. Brown's storage bags are both really good. I will probably stick with Bonafide simply because they are cheaper than Dr. Brown's. I am almost done with my current pumping time, but when my next baby comes along, I will be using Bonafide's.
