Let's make a product that is designed to be used within close proximity to water, but is unable to be machine washed or dried. GREAT IDEA! Oh, but you say I can "spot clean" it. Well, I've tried "spot cleaning" until I'm wearing the fabric thin, but it still smells funky from constantly being used near a splashing one year-old. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this. You'll end up throwing it away after a few months once the damp smell has set in. And, just to be clear, I hung this thing up on the towel rack after each use. I Also Febreez'd it and let it dry in the sun. Just an awful product.
