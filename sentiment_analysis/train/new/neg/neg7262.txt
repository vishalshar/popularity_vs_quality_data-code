I would love to give this at least a 3-star rating because they are really pretty and we love this brand, but for the reasons I will be providing, I just can't. My baby has been using NUK pacifiers (the ones with the handle) exclusively since the day she was born. She had about six of the 0-6M ones (all "flat" ones but in different colors) and then when she turned 6 months old, I bought her the 6-18M ones. This is the only design with handle where the water cannot come out completely when I wash the pacifiers. The flat ones are fine. I hand wash, machine wash, and sterilize all the things my baby puts in her mouth all the time, so I didn't think it would be a big problem. Fast forward six months, I was horrified to find mold inside the nipples. I checked all the pacifiers and only this particular design is affected. I washed them in the dishwasher but the mold is still there. I will be throwing these two away.
