I bought this item as a way to give my little one a little more freedom on our trip that we are going to be taking to Disney Land in a few months.... I thought this would be a great way to give her a little bit of breathing room you know test out her own legs and such with out me or my husband having to carry her or using a stroller....When I received the item I was super excited to open it up and check it out... now in the product description on this link and even on the actual packaging itself it states "The Dora the Explorer Tether Buddy features a zippered backpack compartment for toys and more." now first of all there is NOT a ZIPPERED backpack compartment... there is just a Velcro part where the flap shuts with a VERY small compartment to put toys and other things in. Second right behind the VERY small compartment is a large section of the backpack that is nothing but stuffing or padding... not sure why they couldn't have made the stuffing and the padding area smaller and included a ZIPPERED backpack compartment like it actually says on the actual package its self... this would have been a huge decision for me to make if I would have known that it did not have the ZIPPER backpack compartment that was advertised... This will actually hold VERY LITTLE and its going to be mainly for the tether part I guess.....Ruby
