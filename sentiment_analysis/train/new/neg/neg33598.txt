This toy box is of good construction quality but of poor finish workmanship.  The piping around the lid is nearly detached and the under lining is cut irregularly and looks a mess, with staples irregular and completely visible.  The side seam is crooked...off by almost three inches at the bottom.  If I had seen it at a store I would definitely not chosen this one.  This item should have been described as defective and sold as such...definitely not of first quality.
