I bought this on recommendation of a video I saw. The lady said her baby loved looking at the faces and also the crinkly sounds. Not so for my little guy. He could care less about the faces and so many of his toys already make sounds that he really doesn't engage with this. I should have saved the money. He's just as happy with his toys and a printed blanket a friend made. IMO this is way over priced. Nothing impressive about it.
