Accidentally dried these bibs once and the backs are peeling off now. The bumbkin bibs I bought at the same time, that also got dried by accident, did not peel. While I like the size and coverage of this bib better, I will be buying the bumbkins from now on because the back doesn't peel on these when accidentally dried.
