I love this thing.  It fits better than any other cover that we have.  I have a variety of cloth options since our baby is a newborn and I wanted to experiment with different ones to see what works best for our family before going all out and getting a bunch of any one thing.  This works out well with all the different types--prefolds, flats, QSFW, modified QSFW, sewn origami folds, etc.  (Note--our newborn was almost 12 pounds at birth--this fits perfect with out munchkin--your normal newborn might need a bit more time.)I wish I had bought more than one and probably will soon buy a couple more.Edited to add (baby is now 3 1/2 months old)I bought a second one of these and then another brand's product.  I have changed the rating down to 3 stars.  The elastic looks ratty (after one month of usage--washing 2-3 times a week, we don't use these any more) and, like others, the legs gape open and allow the contents to be "shared".  We have these in the diaper changing area and are ready to use, but automatically use something else first.  We haven't actually used these at all in several weeks.I would straight up recommend to save your money and get a better product.
