Had some of the flat bamboo/organic cottons first and didn't appreciate that these were not the same thing. They are OK but not nearly as soft, aesthetically pleasing or nice to touch as the others. I use them as burp cloths for a big spitter but if you use them as diapers you may not notice a difference. Not sure how they stack up in terms of absorbancy in an objective way -- I feel like they are less absorbant but I may be biased. For what they are they are just fine.
