As I began cloth diapering, a friend of mine was using Bummis covers and prefolds.  I had no idea what was out there for diapering, so I spent $12/cover.  They were fine for the first little while, but I got them hoping to save money by using them for a while (and hoped to use them on subsequent children).  The Aplix wore out after about 5 months.  I washed them according to the directions.  I eventually sewed my own velcro over theirs to make them last a little longer.  I moved shortly after that, then I had them with a front load washer.  They leaked terribly!  I tried all the tricks they recommended to help, but they just didn't work right.  For how much they cost, I was highly disappointed with the lack of quality.NOTE: I picked up some OLDER ones at a garage sale that were well used, and the Aplix was much better quality.  Those have outlasted the new ones I bought and are much better.  I spent $3 for 5 covers.  I didn't ever use them with a front load washer, though.
