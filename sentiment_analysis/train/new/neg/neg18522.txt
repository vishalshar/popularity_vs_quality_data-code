Our child is almost 5 months old and is ready to stand with furniture so we bought this from another store to help him move around the house.  Big mistake.  He is near the top in height and weight and is about 4 inches from even touching his toes to the floor.  Best guess is he wouldn't be able to use this until he's about 9-10 months old and probably starting to walk.  It's not worth modifying a toy like to to force it to a new height when something could injure your child or void the warranty as it may be.
