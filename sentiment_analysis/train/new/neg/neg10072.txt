We bought this because we were trying to get a slow flow bottle for our baby that preferred the speed of a bottle over the patience required for the breast. We already had the Avent from Phillips but bought Adiri because it still wasn't slow enough. Skipping some experiential detail I had to experiment (as the dad) by observing how much came out of the bottles. Both products have the same size holes... but the Adiri has two (2) for each nipple. Obviously that doubles the flow.
