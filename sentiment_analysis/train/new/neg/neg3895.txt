This is a super cute little purse. Love the mirror, the pen, the unobtrusiveness of it. But my little rhinestone fell of within weeks. It's not like it saw any 'hard' use. I never even washed it.You can really fit an amazing amount of stuff in this, though.Maybe I'll have to buy a new rhinestone and glue it on.*See comments below for update on this review
