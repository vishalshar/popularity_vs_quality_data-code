the only problem is the bottles keep cracking on bottom, if similac would make the bottles in glass, tighten the seal a little for these (a little formula dust will leak, NOT A HUGE ISSUE, but leaks none the less, also leakage is significantly reduced when cereal is atop of formula) I would purchase (10) 4 ounce, (5)  8 ounce and 5 of these to aid in travel, for each child infant until weaning. LOVE LOVE LOVE the ease of cleaning, function of product etc for the simply smart system. BUT THE BOTTLES CRACK.
