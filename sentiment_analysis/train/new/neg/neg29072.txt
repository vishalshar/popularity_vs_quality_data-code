We ordered three of these seats and my sister-in-law ordered three of these seats all at the same time (a total of six between our two families) because we carpool often and between us we have three children who were ready to move out of their 5-point harness seat - some of which were Britax and some of which were Recaro - to the next step.  We had good luck with the previous Recaro seats so we thought this would be a good match for our needs.Amazon did a great job shipping them quickly.  Upon installing them, everything seemed to be alright, but when I went to fit the headrest to each individual child, they would not slide up and down properly.  I thought I was doing something wrong, until I heard from my sister-in-law that the headrest would not slide properly on two of her three seats.  Her third on worked fine so we were able to see how it it is SUPPOSED to work.Of all that we purchased collectively, FIVE of the SIX were not working properly upon arrival.  We have begun the process of return/exchange through Recaro, but this seems unacceptable for a piece of child safety equipment.
