I have always loved these bottles. I originally fell in love with them when I had my first baby in 2012. I had tried so many bottles, but these helped so much with his gas that I didn't look back. Even though there are more pieces than some others, they're way easier to clean and it just makes sense how it all works. So when I had my second baby this winter, I bought more of the 6oz size because I only had one bottle.The new bottles are a little different in shape- more ergonomic and squattier. The main difference, however, is the ink that is used for the markings. It is scratching off really bad after only a month of using. I have to use formula for my baby, so those ounce markings are pretty important. I've mostly hand-washed the bottles, sometimes they go in the dishwasher on the top rack (which says it's ok). All I have to do is touch it with a fingernail and more comes off, I don't even have to try to scrape. This is a HUGE disappointment for me, because I have always loved these bottles and have recommended them so many times in the past.I've added photos so you can see what I'm talking about. The yellow-bottomed one in the first picture is the one I bought in 2012, the two white ones are from this new pack I got.
