These are cute, and fit my daughter's chunky legs well during the winter when she was around 7-10 months old. Unfortunately, they are more pilly and worn looking than some of her other leg warmers that were worn and washed just as often. Still, they are affordable, and cute, and do the trick...My daughter does not care about the pills.
