I have to say the the quality and durability of this are good HOWEVER, this crib came with the most noxious bad chemical factory smell.  We aired it out for a few days of unbearable smell, then I felt guilty putting my 11/2 year old down in it.  I washed it over and over again with a cloth and warm soapy water, essential oils and finally- after 6 months the smell is completely gone.  I don't know if anyone else had this problem or mine was just some fluke.  It is very nice to look at and seems very strong but holy cow- the mild lingering smell after months really nagged at me.
