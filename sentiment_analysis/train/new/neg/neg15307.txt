Let me first say that I love my Medela pump, and I love most of the accessories...but I do not love this nipple!  It is supposed to be slow-flow, but it is definitely not that.  Kinda silly, if you think about it; a premiere breast pump company selling nipples that will put breastfeeding mothers out of business!We found the Ameda natural nipples to be much slower, and I have no problem switching from breast to bottle (with daddy).
