Ehhh its ok. I bought this just a cpl months  before my baby girl was supposed to be here. I thought at the time that i was getting a great deal. But i quickly found out that i was wrong. Just 2-3 months after use, the large bag started fallung apart. The inside pockets had torn so that when u put sometjing in the pocket, it would fall thru. Then abt a month later, the strap broke. Its okay if u want cheap. I'm currently looking at other productsby different brand.
