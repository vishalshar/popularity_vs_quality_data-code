I bought these gloves for my 18 month old. They seem warm, and open up wide enough to help with getting little hands in there. They seem to have room to grow without being ridiculously over-sized. These would be 5 stars for me, HOWEVER, the string between the gloves (the selling point of this for me!) is SUPER long.  Like probably an extra foot or more too long, causing the gloves to drag on the floor if she's not wearing them.  So I tied a loop in the string.  That seems okay.The second issue is that my child's preschool sent them home and asked us not to use them again as they are a strangulation hazard.  We've used string connected gloves before with no issues from them, but apparently these gloves are an issue likely because of the length of the string.Takeaway: If your child goes to daycare/preschool - check with the school first. They may take issues with this style of glove, and the length of the string makes it even more problematic.  If your child's coat has an inner and outer layer, you may be able to put the string between the layers and negate this problem, unfortunately hers doesn't. So now we have a pair of gloves we can't use... lame.
