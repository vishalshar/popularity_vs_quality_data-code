My daughter had the Jungle Tales theme room and with the soon to be arrival of my son I've added on some extra pieces including this hamper. I knew the wood would be unfinished from the other reviews. I also bought one of these for my daughter's new big girl room Trend Lab Maya Hamper Set but the material on the Jungle Tales hamper far surpasses the Trend Lab one. Just like the bedding and window valance it has different textures on the flap. VERY soft and inviting to touch. The wood can easily be painted or stained as the hamper material can be removed due to velcro holding it on at the bottom and around the top. The main issue that I have with it is that mine too was broken (as another reviewers was) at the bottom (back crossbar is out of one of the holes) but it can easily be fixed with glue I'm sure and this does not affect its ability to do the job. Just a pain to have to paint and glue this. I would send it back to be replaced but I think that would be even a bigger pain since the box it came in was big.
