This diaper bag is very cute and fun. However, it does not keep its stability too well. It falls over and is hard to navigate through. The pockets can be confusing. The straps are good, especially the adjustable one. The changing mat is convenient and the bottle bag could be insulated to make that a better feature. Order arrived on time and is true to colors and size.
