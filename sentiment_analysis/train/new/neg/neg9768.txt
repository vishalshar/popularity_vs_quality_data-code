This liquid holster does not fit on the Baby Jogger City Mini GT Double Stroller despite being advertised as fitting on the stroller.  If this had fit on the stroller, it seems to be otherwise as described, self-leveling and able to fit a variety of different sized cups.  One drawback is that you must use a screwdriver to attach the top piece onto the stroller, so if you're out and about and need to fit your stroller in a tight space, one piece of that cup holder is, for the time being, permanently affixed to your stroller (unless you happen to have a screwdriver with you).  I realize that it's not actually permanently affixed, but if you don't have a screwdriver, it would be very difficult to remove.  The part that holds your cups is easily detachable, so you could remove it to avoid damage.Even if this had fit on my City Mini GT Double, I don't think I would care for the large attachment to be screwed on to the stroller handle.  I could see how this could be a great attachment system on a bicycle or something else that needs a really sturdy attachment, but for a stroller that requires moving in and out of a car, or in tight spaces, I'd prefer to be able to remove the entire cup holder, if needed.
