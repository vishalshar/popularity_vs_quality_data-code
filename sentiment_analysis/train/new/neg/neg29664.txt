The buckles on this seat are just awful!  This makes taking the baby in and out of the seat a serious chore.  One feature makes it a keeper.  It has two positions for rear-facing.  One is full recline for a small infant.  The other is more upright and takes up a LOT less space in the back seat.  This is so great, as we can finally put her on a side, near the door which makes it easier to get her in and out of the seat.  She's a heavy baby and lifting her over to the middle of the truck's back seat was killing me.  I have replaced the buckles from our other forward facing seats (I am NOT recommending you do this) and it is now the perfect seat.
