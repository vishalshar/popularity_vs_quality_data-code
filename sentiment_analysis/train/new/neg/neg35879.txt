These spoons are very shallow in depth, they are almost similar to trying to use a Popsicle stick. This can be a pro or a con depending on what type of food you're using. Some foods are very runny which makes it a balancing act to try and feed baby, especially if your baby is moving a bunch. For the less running foods these are great since baby is able to eat all food that you get onto the spoon. The spoon handle can be bent with moderate force but overall it doesn't feel too cheap in quality.Pros: Great balance (will stay balanced in food), spoon depth is great for non-runny foods, decent quality.Cons: Spoon depth is bad for runny foods.All-in-all I'd rather have a spoon that works well for both runny and non-runny foods. Even if this comes at the expense of baby not able to get the entire contents of the spoon into his mouth. The increased depth is at least good for trapping the excess liquid and preventing it from falling off the spoon.
