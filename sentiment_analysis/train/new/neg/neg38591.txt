We have always purchased these diaper liners for our baby's cloth diapers.  They were excellent and a great price, and yes, could even be washed and reused (if the baby only did #1).  Now, we got a new box of them and the material is totally different--like a cheap, mesh type material with large holes....there is no way these will hold in the #2 bowl movements of ANY baby, even if your baby does solid movements.  And they will for sure not protect your Cloth Diapers if you want to use as a barrier with diaper rash cream.  I was sorely disappointed with this purchase, seeing as these have been wonderful for us for the past 1.5 years.  I will be looking for a different option.  It will be worth paying a little bit more and getting something that is good quality.  Why, Cutey Baby, did you decide to downgrade your product and change it on us?
