My son, who was very premature and has some very mild delays had difficulty mastering the cup.  He did manage to do very well drinking out of the old Nuby designed straw cup.  However, holding the cup was a bit difficult, these handled cups are much easier for him to  hold and manipulate, but the straw/valve system is aweful.  I thought he was just being picky until my 3 year old also refused to drink out of them.  I went to my local mass market store and bought the old design tall cups and replaced the straw and lid, after a bit of *surgery* to make them fit and now he is doing great!I would give this cup a 5 star review if it weren't for the difficult valve/straw design.  I still purchased two more when I realized I could modify the old straws to fit this cup.  I hope they bring back the old straw with this newer cup.
