The car seat is great. The stroller is great. I have found them very difficult to use together, however. My husband and I both have trouble getting the car seat to insert into the stroller easily (usually wakes up the baby). Also, the carseat doesn't fit onto shopping carts safely. I usually have to put it into the basket itself. Other than that, he is very comfortable in his seat and it is super easy to use. And very safe.
