Having had luck with other Safety 1st products, I figured this one was a winner too.  Turns out to be a pain!  I never get the same temperature twice, it's always different from what another reliable temperature says, it's uncomfortable in the ear canal (I tried it on myself, my husband and our child), and putting the probe covers on is awkward when you're trying to watch a little one.  I changed the batteries and it worked normal (giving accurate readings for a change) for about 1 day.  I need something reliable everytime, and would gladly spend more for something that works properly and consistently.  Don't waste your money on this - or be sure to keep your receipt and the original packaging so you can return it.My daughter DOES like the beep sound it makes.
