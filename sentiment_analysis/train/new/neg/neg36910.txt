The forks are worthless because they don't stick the food.  The spoons aren't as nice as the longer ones byt the same brand.  These are pretty short in length and fatter so they don't work in smaller top containers like yogurt very well.  Next time I'll get the longer thinner take & toss spoons.  Price here is decent though.
