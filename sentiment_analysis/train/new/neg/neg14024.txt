We bought the smallest size, but they were still really big on my two year old. They are also a bit bulky, even more so than some of our prefold diapers with covers.We don't know whether they do the job they are supposed to because we bought them too late in the process. Since he was already night trained, we used them as regular training pants, and they are really too bulky for that, especially with the cloth insert folded up for a boy, per the instructions.They'd probably work really well for a 3 or 4 year old who needs them for overnight. The pad is very absorbent and very big.
