Really, really awkward.  On its own, this is not worth buying.  Major buyer's remorse!The only thing that makes this purchase slightly less regrettable is that it assembles/ disassembles well with the compatible "JJ Cole" stroller.If considering purchasing on its own... save your money, don't do it.Update 3/20/15:  Who is writing the "5 star" reviews?  I recently tried using the car sear without its base.  Are you kidding me?My review promptly went from "2 stars" to "1 star".  I could not believe how difficult it was to install and remove this car seat.As far as I know, most car seats can be installed in your car without a base.  It is designed to be strapped down with a seat belt when the base is not available.  In this case, yes, there is also an option to install without the base.  BUT, the clamps on both sides, which are designed to hold the seat belt, were so incredibly difficult to open and close.  Besides that, closing them made an obnoxiously LOUD snapping noise.I know, I should have returned it.  Like I mentioned before, it was part of the set with the stroller.  Don't think I can return just the car seat.
