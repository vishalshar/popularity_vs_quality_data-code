My daughter loves jumping in this! The only con would be that the spring is way too loud.EDIT: Had to lower my rating one star. My daughter fell forward while in it. It's possible she was getting too tall, but she was under what the weight limit is supposed to be. She was okay and didn't seem bothered by it. But check out the photo as a precaution.
