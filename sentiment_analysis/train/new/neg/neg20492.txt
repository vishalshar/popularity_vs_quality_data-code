We had high hopes for this swing because my son who's a tad over 3 months now has loved his Natures Touch swinging papasan chair so much and we needed a less bulky swing for upstairs. He can sleep up to 5 hours in the papasan swing, but in the crib or anywhere else he sleep a max of 1 1/2 hrs at a time so I thought that just getting another swing would suffice and allow him (and I!) to sleep for the amount of time he sleeps during the night in the papasan swing, but unfortunately this swing failed. He'll nap in it for 20 min here and there during the day, but that's it. I tried it at night for a week and he still woke up every hour-1 1/2 hrs just as he would laying in the crib. The seat is far too deep and it's really difficult to pull him out because of it. Because there's open space between the chair and bars he always stretches out his arms when I'm pulling him out which makes it difficult cause I also have to watch his little head due to the bar above so there can be a lot of maneuvering to simply pull him out of this thing. He's 15 1/2 pounds now and this just barely swings on the highest setting. He's used it since about 13 pounds and it's always had to be set on the highest setting to move at all. This chair is also supposed to have an up right setting which it does not. It will go into this setting for a moment when he's not in the seat, but once he's in it it drops to the reclined position and will not stay in place upright. Would not recommend as I am sure there's many many better options out there. If I hadn't cut up the box I would had returned this.
