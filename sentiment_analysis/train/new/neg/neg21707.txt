Fabric is not very soft and cozy.  The comforter ripped early and comes out if all of the other blankets are in the wash.  The sheet is rather rough.  Didnt use the bumper as they are not recommended any longer, and all of the throw pillows and decorative wall hangings were in the way more often than not.  Wouldnt probably order it again knowing what we used out of it but definately for the price its ok.
