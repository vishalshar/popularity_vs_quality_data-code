Its cool, but I was a little disappointed.  I thought that the Alligator would be able to hold the socks with his hands, but once removed he will not be able to hold the socks.  He can how ever wear 1 pair of socks though...Another disappointment was that the socks was a bit small.  Looking at the fine print it did say 0-6months, but kids don't start walking till at least month 9, then what is the reason for the no slip grip that the socks has??Socks should at least be bigger for kids that want to practice walking...
