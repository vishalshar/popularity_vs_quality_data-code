I ordered this car seat because my daughter is going to outgrow her Chicco Keyfit infant seat soon. It seemed like the safest car seat on the market. Unfortunately it is also the size of a small whale, especially when in the recline position (which you have to use to keep it rear facing). It will not fit in our Dodge Dakota or my Subaru Outback so we are returning it. Granted, my husband and I are tall (I am 5'8" and he is 6'2") so we can't drive with our seats all the way forward, but even putting it in the middle position of the back seat will not work. I'm very sad because I don't think I'll find a safer seat out there and this thing looks supremely comfortable, but since buying two vehicles isn't an option we are going to return it and try a Britax Diplomat.
