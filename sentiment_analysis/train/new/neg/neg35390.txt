I purchased these instead of nail scissors because the nurse who gave us a birthing class told me nail filers are easier and safer than cutting newborns' nails with scissors. Well, our baby boy's nails were so soft it was impossible to file with these. They just bend when I tried to file. I purchased nail scissors instead and they worked great.
