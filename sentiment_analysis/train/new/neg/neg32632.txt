I ordered this after it was recommended by fellow Mom's of Mulitples. My girls kept spitting out their pacifier and then crying. Friends said that this could be laid next them and it would stay in their mouth. The Wabbanub hardly has any weight to it at all and is about 1/3 the size of a "beanie baby." Basically it was useless. I didn't return it, because it isn't any worse than their normal soothies, and they do look cute when they are hugging it.
