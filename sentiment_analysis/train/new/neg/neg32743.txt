There is nothing basket-like about this item. It is heavy, wooden, and suggested for a nursery? Bcuz of the nursery theme, i thought..outta work fine as a small bathroom, or bedside wastebasket. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It has sharp edges, and its very heavy,(i bought 2),to be so small. I stuck 'em in corners, and even the coloring is a tad bit garrish. Perhaps as a set, within the entire line, it works, but i'd NEVER place in a childs room, cuz if they ever touch or fall over one, OMG!One more thing...there is a big, white label stuck permanantly to the inside bottom of each one. You CANNOT peel it off, and it looks awful when you are standing looking in. Therefore, you gotta put a bag, or something in there to hide that. Just a total waste for me. Oh well.
