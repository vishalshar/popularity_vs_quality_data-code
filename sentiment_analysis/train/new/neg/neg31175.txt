I'm not going to go into a lengthy review there are enough on here to read for that.  I really love these cars seats (Britax) for their safety features but I feel like installing them is a pain in the butt.  With two of my vehicles now (Mercedes Benz and  Ford F150) two both completely different vehicles.  The carseat does not balance well in any of the vehicles.  A noodle is needed to even out both seats and then the seats sway side to side.  Does anyone know a better way of installing them.  I had the firemen do the one in my car and my husband put the one in the truck.  I am also finding the seat belt is not long enough to barely put my child in the seat and click it.  It's very strange.  I know you can order an adaption to it but as much as your spending the whole seatbelt should be apart of it or the adaption should be in the box already.  (Just an extra headache.) I'm wondering on whether I want to return the seat just because of these minor headaches but I haven't quite figured out what I want to do because I know the safety features are rated very high on these seats.  I will say I do like the seatbelt better on the Britax Marathon.  It isn't such a headache as this one.  Hope this helps some of you future buyers.  If you don't mind these little headaches then I would say buy this seat!
