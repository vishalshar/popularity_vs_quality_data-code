I thought this mobile was adorable and ordered it.  We got it home before our baby was born and tried it and it was wonderful.  Though after about 1 month of using it (using it a few times a day over our changing table), the music box started going out and playing off key.  We have been using it with it's off-key melody for the past 2 months and now it makes this loud grinding noise.  I am going to throw it out and buy a lower end mobile for $20 from a department store and hopefully have better success.  I hope this was just a defective one and that this isn't the experience for others.  Unfortunately the one I got was junk!
