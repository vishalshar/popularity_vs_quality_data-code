I don't understand why it is so hard to make great baby products.  Clearly the makers do not have kids.  After doing a bunch of research, this is still one of the best options even though it is still not great.  Starting with the positive comments: It looks great, baby is very easy to get in and out and wiping down the seat is very easy.  Also, it fits a small baby very well then grows nicely with the baby.  Negative comments: The plastic tray cover is practically useless.  It doesn't cover the edge of the tray completely so once your child starts making a mess, food gets all under the cover.  You end up having to clean the tray even after you take off the cover. And the cover doesn't fit in the dishwasher.  Probably the worst thing about this high chair is the groove around the inside of the tray.  When baby gets food on the inside of the tray, it gets in the groove and is very difficult to clean out.  It can get pretty gross.
