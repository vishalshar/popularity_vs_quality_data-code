My Wife and I bought this item with the hope that it would help our 18 month old Daughter sleep more soundly during the 14 hour road trip to Colorado we were about to take. To shoulder some blame for the less than 5 star review, I'd like to mention that the car seat we used for the trip was an upright model, which is probably a large part of the problem, with ZERO recline to it. Knowing this about the car seat ahead of time, we were hoping this neck pillow would allow our Daughter to comfortably rest her head on one of the sides of the pillow. I read the specifications for this item, as well as numerous reviews, and decided to give it a shot.The pillow is manufactured very well, and my Daughter liked it from right out of the box. We tried it around her neck while standing and it fit perfectlyâ€”like if you were to use it on an airplane. Unfortunately when we tried using it for her first nap in the car, all it did was push her head forward, which caused my Wife to worry about our Daughters airway slowly being closed off. We tried it several more times on the trip but it never got better. Eventually we gave up and instead folded a few blankets to put along her side and then put the pillow on top so she could rest her head on it at least.I do feel though that if this pillow is used in a car seat that reclines, and is more of a laying down seat, then the outcome could have been more positive.
