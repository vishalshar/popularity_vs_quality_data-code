Although we really wanted to keep this one, the zippers looked like they'd fall apart fairly quickly, so we returned it. (One zipper looked off-track already and they're not YKK, so they looked small and weak.) If Bumkins would only use a better quality zipper, this bag would be a 5-star product!If you're using it infrequently, the zipper might not be an issue. We just couldn't see it holding up to regular use. We bought this bag to hold the Potette portable potty seat and liners in the main compartment and tissues and wipes in the front section. Zippers would have to hold up, because you tend to not be gentle with products when rushing to get a toddler set-up with their potty on-the-go. We decided on a Planet Wise wet/dry bag instead.
