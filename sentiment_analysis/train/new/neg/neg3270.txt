We bought this gate for our deck to keep the kids from falling down the stairs.  We were very disappointed in the quality of the gate.  In order to expand the gate it slides, when we received the gate the top of the metal from the slides had paint already missing.  One of the screws to tighten the slide to a fixed width was striped and would not tighten.  It was also awkward to open as you had to use both thumbs in order to open the gate.  We have returned this gate.
