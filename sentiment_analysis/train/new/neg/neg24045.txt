I was disappointed as these weren't the same as the Hawaii Medical soothers as advertised.This is the exact seller description:"GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Pink 5 PackHawaii Medical"However, I got JollyPops made by Sandbox Medical, which is NOT GumDrop by Hawaii Medical. I DID NOT get what I ordered. Had I been contacted and communicated the difference, I might be typing a different review. Very disappointed in receiving the wrong items. My close friend ordered from the same exact link a month prior and received Hawaii Medical. Again, very disappointed and irritated!
