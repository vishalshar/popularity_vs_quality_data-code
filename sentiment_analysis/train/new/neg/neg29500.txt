The pen set came with hello kitty gold nail art decorations and gold rhinestones.  The pens are catchy and makes marbelizing fun.  Not only I get to create art but use artistic looking pens.  I like the different sizes of round tips to get the exact lines and swirls that I like to create.  I own other pens as well and for the price these are pens are what to expect.  I was hoping they came in their own storage case as others usually do but thats okay.  The free bonus was nice but not the reason i purchased the pens.
