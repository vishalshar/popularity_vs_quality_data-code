Product was okay, fabric was soft and nice. Purchased to keep the babies legs warm, but not very satisfied. It seems durable but it just isn't very long with a taller child you have to curl their legs and tuck them in to get their legs covered which isn't very comfortable for long periods. Also the hood seems next to useless regardless of the size of the baby (unless were talking about a newborn). The way a child sits in a typical carrier it just doesn't allow the hood to cover their head because it pulls up under their arms. In the product photo it even looks like hood just won't reach over the baby's head as it sits high in the carrier. Whenever we have tried to use the hood it unsnaps, so we just leave it off and use a beanie. But the rest performs as expected.
