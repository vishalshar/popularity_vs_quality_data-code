Good concept.  Its a good idea for helping babies learn how to feed themselves with less of the mess that would be involved from an upside down spoon.  But, due to the small amount of food it can hold on it, it is only really useful for a short age period, after 9 months or so, those little bites the spoon can hold are just not enough.  But, every baby is different, so it may work better for others!
