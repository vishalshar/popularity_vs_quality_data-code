I really, really wanted this monitor to work for me.  It has awesome picture quality, and I love the feature that enables the user to hook the monitor up to a TV.  The monitor is small and portable, yet the image is so clear and sharp, even in total darkness, and there is no distracting light on the camera to keep the child awake.Unfortunately, I was unable to resolve the awful interference and resulting jumpy picture that I got with this monitor.  The audio static was extremely loud as well, yet the receiver did not pick up the sound in my daughter's room very well at all.  I could not hear my daughter in her room, even with the volume turned all the way up.  We even tried speaking directly into the camera, and it was nearly impossible to hear.The other complaint that I have with this monitor is that if you hook up two cameras and wish to have the monitor scan both, it will scan all three channels instead of just the two that are running the cameras.  Therefore, if you don't install a third camera, you will likely see and hear a static-y third channel flip by every 10 seconds or so.  I imagine that this could get to be pretty annoying after awhile, especially at night.  This should not be a problem with the installation of one or three cameras; just with two.
