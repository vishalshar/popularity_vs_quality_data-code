I received this stroller as a gift at my baby shower in Aug 2010.  I didn't use it for the first 6 months since my twins were too small.  Once they were around 6 months old I started using it occasionally on weekends for errands but it wasn't the stroller we used for going for walks or anything outdoors.  The fabric seat has ripped in two different spots.  I emailed customer service, sent pictures and explained that I hadn't used the stroller much and I didn't think it should be falling apart already.  The response that I got was..."We are sorry to see that the damage to your Twin Techno seat. We have inspected the images you have provided and it appears that the fabric has suffered stress or pressure outside normal usage. The tears to the rear of the seat and the fabric tab hole on the side may have been caused by incorrect folding by folding the product with the seat in the recline position. This would put stress on the areas where the seat has torn. Of course we cannot be certain of how the damage was caused as we were not present when the tearing occurred, we are confident however that the damage is not of manufacturing nature."This was followed with a phone number to call to order replacement seats for $50.I registered for this stroller because I thought it was higher quality than most other umbrella strollers out there and would get me through my stroller year.  Had I known that I would be replacing parts after 6 months I would have just registered for a cheaper umbrella stroller.
