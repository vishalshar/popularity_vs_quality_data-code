Unfortunately the inside of the pipes were totally rusted. I had rust all over my floors and my couch just from removing it from the box, and it gave me a bad skin reaction. It got metal flakes in the fabric and toys. The rust fell from the pipes and into the speaker that goes abouve baby's face, too. Inspect it well before putting your child in it. Ours is being returned now.
