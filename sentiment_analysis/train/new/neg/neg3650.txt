Meh. Everything slid around on this tray and usually ended up on the floor when we made sharp turns which resulted in an unhappy 3 year old and a messy car. It was easy to clean which was a definite plus, but it just didn't work for us. Plus the tray never sat flat with the angle of the arm rests on the carseat. I ended up buying one of the soft nylon ones with a more forgiving contour and with bigger lips around the edge so even when sliding occurs things usually remain on the tray.
