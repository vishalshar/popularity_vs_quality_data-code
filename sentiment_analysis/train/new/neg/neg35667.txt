This is listed as 8 inches wide, 30 feet long, but is actually only 6 inches wide and 15 feet long. Im not sure why they dont correct the measurements? Close up, this print reminds me of a comic book. Its printed with lots of little dots, instead of being just smooth color. From a distance, it looks nice and works in our sons room, but close up is a whole different story. If it wasnt such a pain to send it back, I probably would, but it will do the job.
