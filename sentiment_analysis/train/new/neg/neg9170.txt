I ordered two sets of pacifiers. When I opened the box, one set of them was rolling around in the box as the packaging had come apart. The other package was taped and stapled together. This product is obviously for a baby, and while they appear unused, don't know who would be comfortable giving their baby pacifiers that appear to be tampered with. Really disappointing.
