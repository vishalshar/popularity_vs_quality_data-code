My son HATES tummy time, so I thought this might help give him a boost and start to enjoy tummy time. Sadly, this product did not help so much. The pillow is great and helpful, but the mat really isn't that wonderful. The mat is quite small and is somewhat slippery....so that doesn't help him move his body to sit up. The pillow is attached with velcro and not very secure. Not to mention the two little toys that come with it are a JOKE....he paid them no mind. All in all.... the price just isn't worth paying if the only useful part about this thing is the pillow component. I'd rather just stick with using the Boppy pillow instead.
