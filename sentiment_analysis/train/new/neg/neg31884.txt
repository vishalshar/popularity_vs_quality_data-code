If you need a basic bouncer for occasional use, this one may fit the bill. It's attractive, has a mild vibration setting, and has a decent enough reclined position. However, my son is not a huge fan (maybe he'll grow into it), probably because it's a bit boring and not very soft. Also, it lacks a newborn insert so you'll need to use a rolled up blankie if that's how you plan to use the chair.I wouldn't give it big thumbs up or down. It's kind of lackluster.
