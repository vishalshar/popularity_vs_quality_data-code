I received this feeding set as a free item from Amazon during a promotion. I really don't have any use for it because my child doesn't attend school or daycare just yet but I have found that the smallest bowls do come in handy in my husband's lunch. After using them for over six months I did come to find that I preferred other storage sets, the lids on these do not go on easy and I wouldn't really trust them to not leak. I don't hate them but I also didn't waste any money buying them... and I don't really recommend that you do either, I'm sure there are better sets elsewhere for a similar price.
