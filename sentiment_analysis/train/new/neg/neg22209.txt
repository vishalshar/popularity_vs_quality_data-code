This should never have made it past quality control. The thread tension had to be set incorrectly and the seams are coming apart. There is also an area of the raw edge of material exposed and the cheap quality of fabric is already falling apart. I sew a fair amount and the only reason I didn't make my own cover for the pillow was because of all the piecing this cover takes. Now I might have to just sew it to have a nice quality cover.
