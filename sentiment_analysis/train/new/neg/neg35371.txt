I liked the idea of these plates but the box came slightly crushed and there was a small sharp gash in plate. I was going to just live with it and try to smooth it out myself then I noticed the second plate had an even worse gash that was really sharp and unsafe for a kid to eat off of. Not sure if the plates were damaged in production or shipping but I was disappointed and would rather buy in person after inspecting these plates.
