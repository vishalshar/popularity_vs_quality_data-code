These bibs are a good size width and length and they have a large neck opening, so they fit a toddler pretty well. But they are VERY thin, two-ply very thin terry. My 10 month old drools constantly and he will soak through these bibs in less than an hour. The shape of the velcro rough and soft sides do not match, so you have to be careful how you fasten it to make sure the rough side doesn't touch baby's neck. And be sure to fasten it before the wash so they don't eat your other clothes. They are bright pretty colors and they don't fade or shrink in the wash.Bottom line: I wouldn't buy these again as they are too thin for my drooler.
