I purchased one of these for our now 6 year old daughter and loved it. Naturally one of the first things on my "must have" list for our daughter this time around was a Safer Bather. Had I only known...Six years ago these were filled with the little tiny styrofoam beans like you would find in a bean bag chair which was great because it gave the bath pad a bit of "float" to it which helped keep the babys head elevated during her bath, and it drained like a charm when I hung it up to dry.Fast forward 6 years and I am totally disapointed. The one I recieved this time was filled with polyester batting which has started to turn lumpy after just 3 months of light use. It also weighs a ton when you try to pull it out of the water and hang it to dry. Even after hanging all night I have to squeeze the excess water from this thing in the morning to prevent mildew. The worst part is that this thing does not float at all. It simply sinks to the bottom of the bath tub and lately I have been finding that my very active 3 month old will turn her head and almost get water in her eyes despite there being maybe 3 inches of water in the tub and I always position her so that her head is at the opposite end of the drain. Luckily she is already sitting and is ready for a big girl bath seat so I can quite using this piece of junk.This thing is so bad it's going to be repurposed into a dog bed or something. I just wish they had not changed the great product that the "safer bather" used to be.
