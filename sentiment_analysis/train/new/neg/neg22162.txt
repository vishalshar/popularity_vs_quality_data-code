I purchased the white with Sage Toile, the basket is white, but as is accurate on other reviews, has large visible screws all along the top.  I thought they must have put it together wrong or there would be covers for the screws because they are not in the picture but they are definitely on the actual product so keep that in mind.  The "white" is the basket only.  the "Sage Toile" though pictured white is a yellow with green print.  That was disappointing. there is a smell to the product, I have it airing out so I am hoping that will go away, but if not, it will be returned.  The mattress is an extremely thin, plastic coated piece of foam (not a dense type either, a cheap type. Can't possibly be even 1/2" thick.  It does have a sheet which I wasn't sure of so I bought the extra sheet, which will be needed anyway, but I didn't know if it would come with the sheet.  The canopy looks quite wide on the picture, but it is really very small, only goes out about a 1/3 of the way over the bassinet.  I haven't made up my mind if I will keep or return yet, it will be very hard to pack back up in the box and there is no return shipping label enclosed.  Buyer beware.  You do get what you pay for.  For me it is more the incredible misrepresentation of the product in the item pictured vs. what was delivered as to why I am giving this only 2 stars.  Another issue is that it has to be put together in the room where it will be used.  I wanted to put this together for my grandson and take it over assembled, but that is not an option unless every door you will go through is >33" wide.  Also it says it says "WARNING! Once the bassinet stand is assembled, do not disassemble and reassemble for future use.  Doing so may affect the stability and safety". So by that standard, this is a one baby use only product.  I find that disappointing as well. I think these things should be more clearly defined in the product specifications.
