Got these to stop my cat from chewing on the corners of everything (windowsills, tables, bookcases...) They worked great, until the sticky dots lost their stick. Also, not the easiest to apply... It comes with a sheet of double sided stickers. You apply three stickers (one to each inside face) then stick the cushion to the furniture. It takes some careful work to get all the stickers applied without brushing your fingers against the ones you've already stuck on. I can see that folks with bigger fingers than mine might not be able to do it.
