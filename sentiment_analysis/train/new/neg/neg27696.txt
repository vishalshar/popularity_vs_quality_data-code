Our triplets are now 12 weeks old and we have been using this seat since they were about 4 weeks old.  I was impressed initially as the seat went togehter easily and was cute with it's attached toys and bright colors.  It seemed like the perfect product for our family as our 20 month old daughter also loved to sit in it, whether in the infant or toddler position.  The first dissapointments I had with this chair were finding that there was another whole seating position to use for newborns that laid the seat flatter but since I hadn't noticed earlier I chalked it up to my post-partum haze (however I had read the instructions putting it together and couldn't find that this step was outlined there), and also that it doesn't rock smoothly or easily.  A couple of weeks ago we realized that there are sharp corners not covered by the seat cover (elbow bends the striped hood attaches to) that poke the kids' heads when they slump to one side.  We have to put a recieving blanket over the sides otherwise they wake up screaming, no doubt with a headache.  The final issue that prompted me to write a review is that over the weekend one of the kids had a blow-out in the chair which prompted us to wash the seat cover.  My husband washed it according to the tag instructions (cold water, dry low heat) and the seat is now ruined because the nylon tether in the back shrank and caused the cardboard back to buckle outwards.  My advice, buy a regular bouncy seat; they're so much cheaper and easier for the babies to self-operate.  This product was not worth anything near what we paid for it, and after just three months, is now useless.
