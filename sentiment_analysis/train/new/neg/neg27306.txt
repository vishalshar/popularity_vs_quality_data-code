I was a bit apprehensive about the quality of this basket, as I paid under $25 for it, but when it arrived, I was wery pleasantly surprised!!!  It was exactly what I had hoped for, but not expected....a STURDY, WELL-MADE Moses Basket. One draw-back is that it does not have the "foam bumper" around the sides, although it will be very easy to get some 1/2" foam at the fabric store and put one in.  The liner has to be 'pulled' over the edges of the basket. However, once washed and air-dried, liner has shrunk enough that it canNOT be pulled onto the basket.  I'm going to be making a bumper and another liner out of a soft fabric for about $8-$10.  The handles can be moved out of the way when baby is in the basket.  Just hold the top/center of the handles as they lay over the basket and push them toward, and over, the outer edges of the basket.  Would recommend to anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a Moses Basket and can make your own liner.
