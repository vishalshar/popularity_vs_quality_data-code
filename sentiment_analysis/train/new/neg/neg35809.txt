The dresser arrived with 2 broken wood pieces.  Amazon does not offer a way to just request replacement parts.  They only offer to ship the whole dresser back which is difficult since we completely unpacked the dresser and cannot get it back into the original box.  The box itself is at least 80 lbs heavy and takes two people to lift and move around. I have tried calling the manufacturer, and was on hold for over an hour without talking to a live person.  They make getting help very, very difficult.Update: We got a replacement dresser. I assembled it. There were no broken pieces of wood this time, but there was a screw socket missing on one of the panel pieces (the screw socket is one of the little threaded metal pieces mounted inside the wood parts which the screws connect to). I bet someone at the factory in China forgot to glue a socket in. In other words, the quality is still not 100%. Two out of two items have had quality issues. Luckily, the place which is missing a screw socket is not very critical for the overall sturdiness, so the dresser holds together even without that one screw in place. It is annoying to put together a defective piece, but I can't deal with taking this heavy item back to the UPS store again.
