I purchased the Portable Playsafe Playard, received it today and put my 1-year-old daughter in it to see how it would work for her.  I created the circular enclosure using all six panels.  She was fine in it, until she was able to reach her arm, leg and then her HEAD out between two of the panels.  I was sitting in the same room as her, about six feet away and it happened so quickly, by the time I got to her, her head was stuck between the two panels.  I was able to open up the panels and get her out and she doesn't appear to be injured.  My fear is if her head (or any other baby in this model of playard) had gone all the way through and the panels tightened around her neck.  The panels seem too flimsy to be safe!  My baby just turned one, three weeks ago and has only been walking for less than a week, just to provide info.  It's not as though she is one, but almost two and more likely to have the strength to push her way through the panels.Model: 07804
