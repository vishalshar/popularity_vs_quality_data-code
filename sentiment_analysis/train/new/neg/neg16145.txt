This double stroller organizer attatches well, and holds a number of the things I had hoped it would well: my phone, teethers, a bottle and toys and books for the kids.However, I had hoped for short trips it could replace a diaper bag, as it seemed to have large pockets, and it doesn't. I use cloth diapers and can't fit one--let alone two--in any of the pockets without it threatening to fall out, nor can I fit my small reusable wipes or formula containers.Also, you really need both hands to put anything in the cup holder, which is a pain if you want to be able to take a sip while walking, so I had to add carabiners to each side that I can clip a water bottle to.
