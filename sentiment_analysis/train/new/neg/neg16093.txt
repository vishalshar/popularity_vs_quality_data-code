They are pretty stiff, and at 8-9 cents apiece, they add a good chunk to your diaper cost.  They work fine, and they do what they are supposed to do, but after a few rolls, I bought some of the ultra-soft ("cloth-like"), multi-size Viva paper towels.  Tear off the smallest measure, fold each side in about an inch, and voila--a MUCH softer liner with better coverage at a fraction of the price!  Don't waste your money on these.
