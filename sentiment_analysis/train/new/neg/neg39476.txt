Useless. It is really much bigger than it needs to be. Not compact or discreet in any way. I bought this before my baby was born-- I put wipes in it and tried to use it on 3 or 4 occasions but the red "button" that has to be slid over to get the wipes out was too hard to move-- which is definitely NOT something you want to deal with in a public restroom and you are trying to change a diaper. I tried to get it to work after that experience but it didn't loosen up any. After a second frustrating experience at a public bathroom-- I took this out of my diaper bag permanently. A few or two later I came across this and all the wipes were dried out. Just stick with the portable, disposable wipes with the hard plastic open/close feature (target brand , pampers and huggies all have these). They will be MUCH easier to use-- and the wipes case diminishes in size as you use them- and you can throw away the bag when you are done.Save your $$- skip this one. It isn't helpful. If I had purchased this in a store locally, I would have retuned it for a refund. As it was, didn't think it was worth paying shipping costs via Amazon to send it back,
