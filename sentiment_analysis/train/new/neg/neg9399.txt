This bag is great for the convenience if you forget a bottle at home but for me it ends there. Do to the shape of the bag you have to be extra careful not to overfill the bag even a little bit otherwise when you go to seal it closed you will end up with milk pouring out. The 5 ounce size is not large enough if you produce a lot of milk like myself. There are times I can get out 4-5oz from one breast so it is time consuming when I have to stop and put on a new bag when I am on my 15 minute break at work. They also only have one zipper which I do not care for. The other bags I use have two and prevent leaks. I was rushed and did not get the entire zipper zipped so when I placed this in the freezer laying down (I like to freeze mine flat to save freezer space) milk poured out everywhere. They are too pricey to not be very efficient. I will stick to my Lansinoh bags and leave a bottle at work just in case I ever forget one again.
