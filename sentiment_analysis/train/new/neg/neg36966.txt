It took a few tries for my 2-year-old to learn how to use it and she still can only push it up (meaning turn the lights on). It's not terribly smooth. Also be ready to use it yourself; once installed there is not enough of the actual switch to grip onto so you can no longer operate the light that way.Keep in mind that it extends straight down from the lightswitch - I was unable to install it in a couple of places because there were other fixtures (such as a bath towel rod) in the way. The rigidity is necssary, I suppose for pushing it up to turn the light on but it does limit the places you can actually put it up.Also, while it is true that the piece itself glows (ever so lightly) in the dar, the stickers do not. So once you put the sticker on you get almost no glow-in-the-dark effect because the largest surface that would glow is now covered with the sticker.That said, it does an okay job.
