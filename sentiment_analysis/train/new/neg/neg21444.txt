This toy has too many stiff / hard edges for my 4 month-old grandson.  He is quite strong and swings his toy-filled hands hard and fast.  He cried when hit by a much smaller 5 month-old who accidently swung her hand and hit him in the face, so he would hurt himself with this toy.  Although it has a lot of colors and designs, it does not have any animation to entertain him.  It does not have a very loud rattle, the tags are too small, the feather sections have stiff/hard inserts and not much area to grab.  He needs no help with focusing and loses interests if he does not see the activity in the room or car; this toy must be for newborns, not 4 months and up.
