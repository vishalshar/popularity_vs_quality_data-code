First of all do not let the picture fool you into thinking that this will create a strong barrier protecting the child from reaching the stove top. It is nothing more than a semi opaque plastic attached to the stove with three short adhesive elements. If your child is big enough to stand and reach it then she can pull this shield down with little effort.The protective "powers" of this shield lay in its semi transparency. While it is still possible to see pots standing on the stove they are now pretty well obscured from child's perspective. Before our daughter showed good deal of interest in activities happening on top of the stove, now she disregards them completely, even when she is standing right next to it. The shield would probably work even better if it was completely opaque. I guess it can also protect the child in case of something spilling out of pots or spraying out of frying pan but don't rely on it 100%.Some reviewers complain about adhesive elements not holding well. That happens to us repeatedly. Stove design needs to offer enough area for the the adhesive stripes to attach and ours does not. Adhesive provided did not work at all, we had to buy 3M, 20pound tape. It however keeps letting go every week or so and needs to be replaced with new strips. So make sure that you have enough flat, vertical surface near the top of the stove just like on the picture. All in all it is much better than nothing.
