The first time we ordered this product, it came with one misaligned hole so we had to return it. It seems well made and sturdy, so we ordered it again. However the big issue is with the straps. The strap for the child is so lengthy even with the lowest adjustment, that we ran the straps from the back of the seat and over the back rest to restrain my 2.5 year old. Also the strap doesn't hold very well, my daughter can easily push on the straps and it starts getting loosened up.This actually is very dangerous because I have seen her trying to slide under while the booster was on a chair and the strap almost caught her chin. She could have been left dangling that way. We order nylon straps with a buckle and are going to fix it on the lower side towards the front to properly restrain her.
