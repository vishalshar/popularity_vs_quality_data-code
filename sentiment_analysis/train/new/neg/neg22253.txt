It was more on the thinner side, I expected it to be a little thicker than it was.  This was purchased to use on our upcoming flight and I thought after that will be sent to the sitters for every day use, but my toddler sits on his little chair and covers with this blanket to watch TV.  As long as he loves it, I'm happy :)
