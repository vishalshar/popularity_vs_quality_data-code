Based on the good reviews I went with this changing table and I'm a bit disappointed. It does the job but: 1) It's not very sturdy. 2) The changing pad slides so I had to stick it with Velcro to the table. 3) The paint has marked up my wall so I put a towel in between. 4) My son sticks his arm underneath the bar and has cried cuz he doesn't know how to move it out. So, ehh it's okay..I wish I would have spent a bit more and bought something else. Darn
