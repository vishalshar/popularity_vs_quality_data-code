Thought we loved them, but not so much.  So we bought two of these initially. One for the top of the stairs and one to help keep the kids in the living area safely. The one upstairs is good so far, but is only closed at night as a precaution. The one for the living room lasted about 11 months before cracking one day.  I bought another one and two days after installing it my 3 year old managed to break the bottom of one of the pieces of wood. Now, only a couple of months later my 1 year old who is only 18 lbs was able to push and knock one of the pieces of wood out and fit right through it.  She met me in the kitchen today and I didn't know how until I walked back with her and saw the piece of wood laying there and realized she walked right through the gate.  Thank god that this was not the one at the top of the stairs or my baby might not be here right now.  I'm very diasspointed in the lack of quality in these gates I've bought recently. There is no way my 1 year old pushing on it for a minute or less should be able to break it. It terrifies me what could have happened if it was not this gate.  Now I am out all of this money and have to find a more reliable gate for down here and I guess upstairs too as I don't want to risk that happening with that one.
