I was very excited when I saw this Electric pump for just $45 but you get what you pay for. It has great sucktion but the speed is extremely slow and very little milk gets into the bottle. Not because it can't suck but because it is totally sealed. Think of a straw that can hold water when you have your finger over one end - that is like this pump. With pumping your breast and the bottle totally seals off the valve and no milk drips through which makes the 3 way bottle adapter fill with milk and back up into the pump. As soon as you release your breast from sucktion to milk drips down into the bottle but really - how often do you want to do that? It must be a design flaw and I'm hoping they fix it. The 3-way bottle adapter is great though - it fits with our gerber, medela and advent bottles - not with our playtex one though. If you are looking for a pump I'd advise not to get this one - get a nice hand pump or spend a little more and get the medela electric.
