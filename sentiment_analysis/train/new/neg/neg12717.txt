When I first received all my fitteds (Tiny Tush, Sustainablebabyish snapless, THX hemp, Grovia Kiwi Pie) I loved these because they were soft and seemed well made. But right now after a couple of months of use they are my least favourite of the bunch.Pros:Slight faster drying time than the rest of the fitteds I haveDecent absorbencyMade in USA (for those who find this piece of information important)Cons:They are now (after a few washes) not any softer than the THX hemp.Awkward fit in the front (even on the smallest setting they seem to stand away from the front always making me nervous since I have a tummy sleeping boy) that seems to be getting worse with each wash.Only one insert, which makes it the least absorbent of all the fitteds I have (no "scientific" experiments, just my observation)Definitely not a trim fittedThe insert is not reversible because of where the snaps are the wide part has to go in the back, where as i'd prefer it in the front where my boy needs more absorbency (if he poops I need to change the whole fitted anyway)
