This toybox is ok.  It is a fine size, actually holds more than it looks like it does.  My main issue is the flimsy sides are not convenient for my little toddler just learning how to walk.  When he is getting toys out of the toybox, he falls sometimes and just keeps going and falls into it.  It doesn't have much support to hold him. Other than that its not too bad.
