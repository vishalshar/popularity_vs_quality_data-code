I purchased this mattress because several of my friends highly recommended it. The mattress itself is super firm and well designed. I would love it and gave it five stars if there was no odor issue.Everyone in the family smelled it the moment the mattress was pulled out of the box. It was put in the balcony for three days until the the smell was not that strong then we put it in the crib. The baby slept on it for three days. He started getting nauseated, trying to vomit something out, the back of his neck turned red. By then I still didn't link these symptoms with the mattress until one day I was playing with him and put my nose near his neck when he was in the crib. The odor was so penetrating and made me sick. I contacted amazon customer service and got a replacement. The second one came with a less strong but same type of odor so I am returning it with no hesitation this time.I asked the customer service agent if they can open a ticket and collect such cases to avoid future potential impact to other babies.  The agent said amazon is not able to do it. I have to contact the manufactory by myself if that is my concern. So today I am putting my very first review on amazon to warn the parents who really want to buy this mattress to smell it first before letting your baby sleep on it. The two mattresses I got may be the two only bad ones since none of my friends have this issue. they have had it for a while and they all love it. But again, no one wants to put their kids in the risk so be careful!
