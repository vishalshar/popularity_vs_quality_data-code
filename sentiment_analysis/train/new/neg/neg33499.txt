I bought this to be use on a car seat, to help my baby's head to stay in place and not being dropped every time she fall sleep. The pillow just created a bulk on the back of baby's head, so it was hard to work with. Also, baby felt uncomfortable and always take out the pillow. For the only thing it has worked for us is to be used on the umbrella stroller, to keep head centered and in place with the movement and while sleeping. There it seems to be comfortable.
