I love these sheets. They're wonderfully soft, cuddly, and, due to their slight stretch, very easy to put on a crib mattress. These are 5 star sheets with one glaring problem. They smell horrible. They're packaged in some very, very stinky vinyl. I literally washed them three times and one of them still smelled very strongly, while the smell on the other had faded for the most part. So gross. What bothers me most of all is that these are organic and they still package them in toxic material. Well, hello! Consumers informed enough to buy organic in the first place know/care about the dangers of vinyl. Give me a break. I know the can package using a different material, because I ordered some organic cotton pillowcases that came in a completely unscented bag with recycling code 5 on it. Buy at your own discretion, but be prepared to wash the bejesus out these things.
