I bought this pair of chewbeads after debating it for a while. Here's what I discovered:Pros:-dishwasher safe (yay)-babies love to chew on these-babies like to play with the necklace-the necklace itself is very soft siliconeCons:-way too expensive-awful smell right after opening them, it takes a while to go away.. like weeks-my hair gets caught in the clasp and some beads in the back-lint/pet hair will stick to it like a magnet.-clasp is hard to open
