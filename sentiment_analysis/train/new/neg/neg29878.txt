When my baby was nearing 6-months-old, I bought this food tray along with the OXO tray of 6 blocks (2 oz/each) so I could try out both options. In the product description for this Fresh Baby tray, it states that the capacity of each block is 1 oz. Actually, if you fill each block up to the brim, it holds 2 oz of food. I do like this option to make a batch of food and then pop out into a freezer bag to store until I needed it. However, after using this for about a month now, I've found that thee silicone seems to retain food smell a bit. I made a batch of steamed zucchini (with no other seasonings), and the tray felt greasy and smelled a little bit after I popped out my zucchini cubes.Also, I didn't notice the other reviewers' comments until after the fact, but this lid is flimsy and not an airtight seal. Your best bet is to freeze your food, then pop the cubes out into a freezer bag for longer term storage.
