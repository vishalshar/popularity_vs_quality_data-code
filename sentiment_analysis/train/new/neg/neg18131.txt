Our Summer Infant died after less than 2 years of light use. After doing a ton of research, I ended up buying this Levana product. The title of my review says it all. It's a decent monitor and will do the trick, i.e. letting you hear and see what your baby is up to. I would say that if it's more important for you to HEAR your baby only when there is a good reason for it, buy this monitor. But if it's more important for you to see what your baby is doing, buy Summer Infant.What I like better about this product is the VOX function that our  Summer monitor didn't have: the monitor will suppress all sounds (including static!!) unless they exceed some minimal threshold. So you will hear if your baby speaks or cries, but otherwise the monitor will stay completely quiet. This is a big difference from Summer Infant, where the sound function is basically always on. What it means is that our monitor kept picking up static, which used to wake me up 3-4 times a night. This won't happen with this product.The big con, however, is that the picture quality on this monitor is horrendous - well below what Summer Infant's. In night vision it is very hard to make out what our kid is doing in his crib. In this respect the Summer Infant monitor, blows this product out of the water.Levana also has a few functions that our Summer Infant didn't have (e.g. it can play kids songs and you can speak through it to your baby), but those are nice-to-haves for me.Overall, there are surprisingly few baby video monitors in the $100-200 range that get good user reviews (I had spent a lot of time looking). If you don't want to shell out $250, this one will probably be good enough.
