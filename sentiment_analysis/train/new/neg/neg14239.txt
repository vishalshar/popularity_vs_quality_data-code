I bought this for my son just before he turned 1 yrs old.  This product is so-so.  He had a vague interest in it.  Like all Fisher Price products, it's very plastic-ey and overpriced.  I prefer more educational products for my son (i.e. Melissa & Doug).  This toy was packed away not long after it was purchased...it has not been missed.
