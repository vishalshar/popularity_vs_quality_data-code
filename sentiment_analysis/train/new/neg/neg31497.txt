The stroller looks great.  It works great AS  LONG AS you have the infant car seat in jt.  As soon as you put the child in it without the car seat it starts trying to fold in on itself.  It cannot withstand daily use.  My first one started folding down when I was out and about and Safety 1st happily exchanged my stroller.  I got a new one (free shipping to my house!) and the first time I used it it started folding down.  They are again replacing my stroller to a different model.  The stroller may have been crap, but the fact that I felt with such nice people over the phone will make me continue using Safety 1st products.
