I have had problems with vasospasms after pumping. Lact consultant said to try heat packs after.  It works well.  I did go against manufacture suggestion and microwave for 15seconds to get a nice warm pad.  There are quite a few problems with these however.1. HUGE.  I have a large B cup sized chest and they were protgruding out of my bra obnoxiously.  These would probably work really well for someone that is sporting a DDD or higher.  Seriously almost the size of my whole face.2. Can't really be warmed up fast.  I'm sure they won't last long being microwaved but the recommendation is to soak them in basically luke warm water for 10mins.  The water temp max is 122f which really isn't that hot and its kind of a pain.  I did try to put them in a bowl with warm water and then microwave the bowl so they don't get all that microwaving heat but it didn't really do more than just letting them sit for 10mins.  blah.3. They cool down faster than the amount of time they took to heat up.4.  They aren't recommended to be used without the lovely terry cloth pouch.  The pouch is nice but if you are sore at all you'll stick straight to it!
