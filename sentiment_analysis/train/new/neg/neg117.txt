If I had the option to give this a "zero", I would.I was expecting diaper size pins that were strong enough to go through a thick fabric such as a cloth diaper.  Needless to say, these are not a standard size diaper pin and will penetrate nothing thicker than one layer of a thin Tee shirt without bending.A total waste of money and time.  (Also had to wait a ridiculous amount of time for them to arrive.)
