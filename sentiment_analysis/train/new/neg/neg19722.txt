I love sleep sacks for babies as it prevents them rolling out from the covers and waking up from being cold at night.  My 8 month old has outgrown hers and because we are going into the winter I wanted to order a larger size. The one I have is a British one and its awesome. I purchased this Grobag sleeping bag and I was dissapointed.  Firstly, they are extra long. It does not show on the picture.  Where the zipper begins, they have a piece of fabric that folds over it, and then a huge button of some kind to hold down the piece of fabric.  This button has a plastic cover on both sides so if your baby lies on her side, it will dig into her.  I dont understand why they would not have used a small clip or button. Very strange.  And the zipper goes all the way down and around the bag.  Way too long. The item needs a few improvements that would make it so much better.
