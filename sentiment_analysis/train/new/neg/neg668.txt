This base is ok. It's the only one I am able to get though because it's the only one that fits the carseat I have. I do like the gray part that extends out so that it fits other vehicles seats well. However, I would like if it extended to about half the length as well. It needs to be either in or out, which doesn't always fit the needs of the vehicle's seating. So then your child will either be sitting up too much or too much in the laid down position. Also, I found that the hooks don't attach well to all vehicles. To this day, I still can't put it in a Volvo. But overall, it's a pretty solid base.
