I was so excited about getting this pillow. Unfortunately my excitement didn't last long. The pillow is not firm, to be honest I've had it less than a month and it has already become flat in some areas. It also doesn't have a smooth/seamless design. The top of the pillow where your head goes, digs into your neck and is very uncomfortable. The picture is very misleading, I wish I would have kept the original packaging so I could return this pillow!
