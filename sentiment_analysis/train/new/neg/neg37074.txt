Not as padded inside as I thought. Dips down in spots so my baby hates it. Will have to repurpose or give away as its too small for a toddler to snuggle on. It's cute as a ladybug toy and has great colors, won't work as just a stuffy toy as it has little dots on the underside that gives an undesirable texture for snuggling.
