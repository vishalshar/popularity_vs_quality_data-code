My son loves it, although it spokes me looking in rear view mirror when he's not in it. Biggest problem is unlatching it. My son cannot do it (he's almost 6.) He could get out of his old Britax. You have to pull both latches out at the same time to unlatch it; sometimes even I have difficulty getting him out.
