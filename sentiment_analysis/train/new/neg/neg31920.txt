I found this item on this site and went to a babyrus store to purchase it.  I took the items out of the bag to look at them and I was so disappointed!  The colors are not vivid like they are in the pictures.  They are dull and faded looking already.  I can't imagine what the comforter would look like after it had been washed a few times.  The crib sheet was very thin and scratchy.  The lamp was tiny and looked to be cheaply made as did other components of the set.  I love the thought of an entire "Nursery in a box", but this set sacrifices too much in the quality department in my opinion.
