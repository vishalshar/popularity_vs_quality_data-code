The bag itself was the best fit for me with an infant and a toddler.  I tried out many different kinds of backpack diaper bags and this one was the clear winner.  I cloth diaper and was able to fit diapers for both of my kids in this bag prior to my toddler potty training.  I love that it can be used as both a messenger and backpack.  The backpack function is a little awkward fitting and not super comfortable.  I wouldn't want to walk around all day using it as a backpack, but for quick trips, it is perfect for getting the bag out of your way and allowing full use of both arms/hands.  Unfortunately, the quality of this bag is horrible, especially for the price.  I've actually owned and had to return two of them now (thank you Amazon for your fabulous customer service).  Both bags broke after only 3-4 months of gentle use.  The backpack strap stitching ripped apart where it was connected to the bag on the first one.  The second one, the plastic buckle connecting the shoulder strap literally snapped in half in my hands.  I was hoping that the quality issue was just a fluke with the first bag, but that doesn't appear to be the case.  I can't recommend the bag due to the quality problems.
