BabyHaven fulfilled this order, and instead of sending the one pictured, they sent the crappier, new Deluxe version, which everyone says does not contain odors.  Unfortunately for me, I ordered this before my baby came and had the box put away in the nursery.  I only discovered the mistake outside the 30 day return period.  Both Amazon and BabyHaven told me tough luck, even though they clearly sent the wrong item and had advertised the older model (which is what I wanted) falsely.  Very disappointed.If anyone wants to know about the version pictured, the older version, it's GREAT.  I ended up having to re-buy that one on Ebay.  Worth every penny, that one.  Baby Trend needs to get its act together and change the design back to the original.
