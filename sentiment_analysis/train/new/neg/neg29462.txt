I LOVE this pacifier holder! I love that it velcros through the end of the pacifier instead of having to "thread" it like so many of the others. My husband finds it much easier to use as well. And if I need to get the pacifier out of the holder for some reason, I do not have to pull it out of his mouth if he is asleep to "unthread" it, I can simply unvelcro it.  I like the colors and patterns but wish they had some basic solids as well.UPDATE: After using these pacifier holders for a while, I have found that the metal clip starts to rust. I have about three that I rotate. My son does drool on them a lot. When I wash them, I hand wash and make sure I dry off the metal clip. I do not submerge the metal clip in water to soak the pacifier holder. The first few that started to rust, I thought that maybe I didn't dry them off very well when I washed them. So I threw them out and bought some more. Unfortunately it happened again.  So, I love this pacifier clip but really hate that it rusts. I plan to wean my little guy off of the pacifier soon so hopefully the pacifier holder I just bought and the few I have left will not start to rust!
