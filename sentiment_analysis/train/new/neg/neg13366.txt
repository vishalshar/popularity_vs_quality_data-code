We have 3 of these, one for each kid. We loved the first two, but were very disappointed when the 3rd one came with one less slot available, exactly where we wanted to put the seat for our 16 month old. We got our oldest to trade chairs, so it worked out for us, but I wouldn't recommend this seat for a young toddler anymore.
