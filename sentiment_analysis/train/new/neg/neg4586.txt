Pros:CuteGood conceptBright colorsEasy for kids to understand (basic words, colors, and textures)Cons:No storage for pieces other than the original box, which no kid this age could open on their own, and they don't even fit in that well, just slop around in it.Can be confusing for kids, when they try to match up, for example, a green lizard with the color green, they are basically told they are wrong since the piece won't fit, the frog is green, the lizard is rough... but I think making the connection of the lizard being green as well is just as important...
