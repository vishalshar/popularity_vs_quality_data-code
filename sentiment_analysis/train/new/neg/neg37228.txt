I love the concept but the implementation does not work well. It is uncomfortable for the kids, so they tend to take it off.  I bought these for our European trip:  One for my 6-months-old baby and the other for my 5-year-old son.  However, I found the strings/wires to be rather inflexible and the two yellow clips not being able to take a strong grip of the napkins.  Thus, I was disappointed with the purchase.  I tried but did not use it with my baby.  My older son used it a couple of times, because I insisted.  I would like to see the strings to be made of material like shoe laces and the clips to be able to hold onto more area of a napkin.
