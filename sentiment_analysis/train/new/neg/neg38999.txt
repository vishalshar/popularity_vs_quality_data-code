This is cute and works well.  My son loved the little toys on the toy bar.  The only issue is that after just a few months of use the plastic that holds the toy bar in has bent so that the bar no longer stays up.  If you are buying this for light use or use with one child it is a great purchase.  If you expect to use it for multiple babies, as I had hoped, you may want to look for something more durable.
