These bottles are really cute and I love that they are convertible so that they can be used as my cub grows older, however, milk does get stuck in the venting system.  I was told by a friend who also used the bottles that a toothpick will get it out but I barely have time to wash bottles, let alone pick out the gunk.  I've kept the bottles rather than send them back as I am hoping to use them as sippy cups when my little one is big enough.
