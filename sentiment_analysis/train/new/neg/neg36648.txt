I've noticed a lot of people complaining about weak milk and no suction. I too had this problem when I first bought the pump. Turns out the little white duck bill valve was defective: somehow the slit at the end that is supposed to pop open and closed had remained sealed. It was a simple fix to take a knife tip and slit through the end of the valve. However, I only recognized the problem because I have used Avent pumps before and knew how the valve was supposed to work. I suspect some of the other disappointed reviewers also got defective valves.
