I love this car seat but there are some snafus with it.  It is too big for one I understand that it give more protection but sometimes it is more of a hassle trying to figure out how you are going to go shopping at the store, the base is wonderful.  It really is a catch 22 it is a great car seat but really the only problem is how bulky it is, it becomes hard to find a spot in your car to put it without having something else squished.
