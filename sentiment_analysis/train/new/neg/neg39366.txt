Ordered this product based on great reviews (and despite the ridiculously high price for a simple piece of plastic). I was surprised that it doesn't work on any of the seats in our 2006 Toyota Camry. Once you put the guard on, the metal will simply not click into place. Needless to say, I am returning this product. The product description does state "works on MOST cars" but one wouldn't know which cars until you bought it and tried. Would be helpful if they had a website listing the vehicles it doesn't work on which would also eliminate some of the negative reviews.Another annoying thing about this product is that when unbuckled, the guard is loose and essentially falls off making it easy to lose or misplace.
