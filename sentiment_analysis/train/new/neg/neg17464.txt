I am fine with it. My little is 5 month old, and she sits in it OK. She is always a very happy child. The chair is not making her less happy or happier. But my mother in law does not like it. Since she is the care giver now, the chair is in the corner of the living room most of time. She thinks it's not necessary to spend time putting the baby into the chair, belt her and pull the chair to the desired place. My little one eats well in her arm and plays in the rocker happily when we are eating. My little took solid food very well the first day. I don't think there will be a problem feeding her in a booster later. Maybe for a happy and easy going child high chair is not necessary. I regret spending money on it.
