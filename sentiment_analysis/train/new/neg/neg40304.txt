I just got this for my daughter's new big girl bed and really had a struggle putting it together.  The instructions that came with it are so bad I found myself wishing for Ikea instructions instead!  Normally I wouldn't mind so much, but for a child's safety product instructions really should be better to make sure it is being installed properly.  Even though it comes with a travel bag I really don't think we'll be taking it to grandma's, it is way too much hassle to take apart.  Also, like another review said, it will not fold down unless the bed has a box spring.
