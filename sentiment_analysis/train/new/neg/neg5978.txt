my daughter gave birth to twin girls. first, if you are interested in breastfeeding twins, you MUST have a nursing pillow specially made for two.  tandem is the best way to go to keep your sanity.  i purchased both the my brest friend and the san diego bebe pillows for her, thinking whichever she liked least i would keep at my home for when she visited.  GOOD FEATURES OF THE ECO TWIN:  built in nursing cover for occasional privacy needs. pocket for access to water bottles, etc., soft fabric, and room for both infants to nurse comfortably. the little pillow is somewhat helpful. THINGS THAT COULD BE IMPROVED:  the latch is cheaply made. the cover is soft and pretty but difficult to remove for washing. most importantly, the foam core is not as sturdy as it should be for the price; it probably won't make it the 5-6 months she'll need it, which is very disappointing. at that point she'll go back to the my brest friend, which was tilted inward a bit making it a bit more difficult for newborns, but overall it was much more comfortable for the mommy - better latch and better back support. the terrycloth cover on the my best friend is soft enough and easier to remove.
