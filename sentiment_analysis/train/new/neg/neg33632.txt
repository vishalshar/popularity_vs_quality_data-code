I've receive the WRONG item, it doesn't look like the photo shown on amazon which can cover my feet.It can only cover my ankle.i asked for a replacement, the seller asked me to provide the photo how it can not cover my feet.So i put one of my leg in and take one photo. (oh BTW, i also attached another photo showing this is defective)The seller wrote me back that they will give me a refund or replacement.Couple hours after, i received another letter, telling me that they think their description has showed that its"footless", so they don't think they made a mistake. And also, they saw the picture that i demo how it can not cover my feet, it turns out that i've already used this product, they can't give me a replacement.They totally ignore that this is defective. that's the most horrible shopping experience with them. Don't buy anything from this seller!!
