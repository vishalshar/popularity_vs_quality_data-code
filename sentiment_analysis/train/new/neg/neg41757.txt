Our game arrived without the poles pictured on the box. Have not contacted the company yet, but probably won't bother, because even adults couldn't pick up the sea animals with the fishing line and 'bait.' Will keep the animals as tub toys - my toddler loves how they stick to the tile walls - but would not recommend as a fishing game.
