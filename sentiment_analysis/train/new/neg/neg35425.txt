I loved this monitor and think it was a vital key to my sanity after having my baby. I wouldn't have to get up and go to my baby's door I just kept the monitor in bed with me so I could hear if he started crying. After 4 months of use midway through the night the transmitter completely died. I looked in the manual for troubleshooting and all it said to do was make sure it was on and plugged into the wall. Well duh. Of course it was a gift so I don't have a receipt or a box for it. I'm about to start the process of going through the manufacturer which I'm sure will be a fun and long process. I would have thought a Fisher Price product would last longer than this especially for how much it costs.
