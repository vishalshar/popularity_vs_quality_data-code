The product description is missing a crucial piece of information.  By their own specification on the back they will only fit knobs between 3.5" and 4.75".  In other words if your knobs are less than 3.5 inches apart these locks will slip off and will not work.  Found this out the hard way, though luckily we had another door to secure.  Amazon you've got to add this type of information into your product descriptions!  Otherwise they work without issue.
