My husband and I use this as a spare seat for our 22 month old son. I like how light it is since we travel a lot by air, and how it is pretty easy to install. But I am conserned about how my son who is 25 pounds fits in it. He is constantly slumped in a corner even when the straps are as tight as can be. My nephew who is the same age but heavier has the same problem. It just does not seem safe if an accident were to occur, it seems to lack support. We are now thinking of buying a Britax Marathon as our main car seat and using our Cosco Alpha Omega (which we love) as the spare. Hopefully it will work better when our son is 3 or 4, but I really feel that it is unsafe for a child any younger than that of an average size.
