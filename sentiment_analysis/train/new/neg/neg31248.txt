Like others may have said, the opening is so small. Works ok for a 2 yr old to feel safe, but if you are trying to train close to a 3 yr old, the opening is so small. We even removed the guard and still small. Also, the sound is really rediculous and can't even tell it is a car. Sounds like static and stopped working after a couple months.
