I purchased this new with needing to use to help build up my milk supply and to have milk saved in freezer in case of an emergency and to take with me for when I was away from baby durring feeding time. I only had used the pump 3 times when the motor burned up and I had to contact first years to be replaced once replacement was received and i used about 15 times again the motor burned up and would not extract milk. Contacted first years the second time and they said they couldnt do anything else for me. Very disappointing. Not good product
