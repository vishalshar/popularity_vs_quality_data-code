The quality of this set is good. My little boy loved the design too. However, the backpack is too small. I bought it for him to take to preschool, but it doesn't fit his lunch, a spare set of clothes and any papers that the school sends home. He's still using the lunchbox, but we had to get another backpack for him to take to preschool.
