The title gives a good summary. The three star rating is for its beginning to come apart after just a couple months, and now after a year with twins, there are a number of seams that are coming undone, lining coming apart from the canvas, and one pretty big hole starting. It has always had enough space for what we needed. If BIG ENOUGH is the issue, this is your bag. Just don't put it through as much as we have :).
