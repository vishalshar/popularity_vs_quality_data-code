The replacement adhesives must have manufacturing issues as we've ordered replacements twice and each package had varying degrees of adhesion. Some sets would work for two weeks and others wouldn't last a day. We always pre-applied rubbing alcohol to the skin and let it air dry before placing the adhesive on the skin. Temperature was relatively constant and there were no extreme heat or issues with sweating. The adhesives do work, but we found that my wife would often need to secure the buds within a maternity waistband. Not bad, but could be better and we managed with some engineering.
