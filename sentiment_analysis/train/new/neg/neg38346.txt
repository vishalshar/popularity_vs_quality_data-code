I've been meaning to write this review for awhile now. We've owned this dresser for over a year. At first it was great. Assembly wasn't nearly as difficult as other reviews claimed. I did it in under two hours aided only by my five year old.But after a few months, it started falling apart. The drawer fronts came off and then the sides started separating from the front. No matter how much we tightened the cam bolts, they quickly came out again.Finally I completely disassembled it and reassembled using wood glue at every joint. Now it seems fairly solid. It's been a few months and we haven't had any issues.So definitely use the wood glue from the start.
