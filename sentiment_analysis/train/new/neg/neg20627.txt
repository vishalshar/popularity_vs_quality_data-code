The butterfly engraving is pretty faint.  Didn't seem like it would stand the test of time.  The box had a tab on it like it had been hanging on a Walmart display hook.  I thought it was tacky and would have made it difficult to wrap.  The bowl had some dark markings in it but they came off in the dishwasher (still, shouldn't have to wash a gift before you give it).  The final straw was that the plate had a long, deep scratch right across the middle.  Returned and will not buy from this vendor again.
