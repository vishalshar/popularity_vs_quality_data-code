We liked the crib for the price. But now our baby is ready for a toddler bed, and we found the lack of bed rail to be a huge no-no. The bed at its lowest setting (like you'd want so a toddler can get in and out) is not conducive to the strap-on type of bed rail, and there's no conversion kit for the bed. We struggled with how to make our toddler safe in the bed but in the end it's more cost effective to buy a whole new toddler bed. It's annoying since I got this crib for its supposed conversion capabilities.
