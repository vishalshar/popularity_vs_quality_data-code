My boy loves this activity book, it could brings lots fun. Only one slight problem is this book got bit smell, I guess could be the new material, tried wipe it with damp cloth, but seems doesn't work. So I avoid my boy chewing with it, and put it away for a while wait for the strange smell fading away.
