I debated between buying these bibs and the 10 pack set by Green Sprouts. I have a three month old baby who has reflux and therefore spits up like crazy. Here are my thoughts on these bibs.Pros:Length- These are long. They cover all the way to the bottom of my baby's tummySnaps- I ultimately decided to get these instead of the green sprout ones because of the snaps. Velcro gets stuck to everything in the wash and it drives me crazy. Snaps are also more gentle on baby's skinColors- These are very bright and fun. Half have been washed, the others are waiting to go in the wash. The ones that have been washed have held their colors well.Cons:Noise- the waterproof layer inside is really noisy. Like my baby likes to move the bib around because it sounds like one of his developmental toys that has a crinkly layer inside.Neck size- My baby is pretty small, so these fit him on the tightest snap (he's three month's). If you have a chubby baby, you'd have to use the larger setting, and I'm not sure how long they'll fit.Absorbency- a lot of my baby's spit up just rolls right off. I thought the terry cloth material would be more absorbentWicking- I've noticed that if there is a lot of spit up right by his neck, the lining at the top of the neck wicks up the moisture and it bleeds down the back side of the bib, essentially bypassing the waterproof layer, and therefore still gets his clothes wet. The whole point of getting a waterproof bib was to try and reduce the number of clothing changes we were needing to do!Price- I wouldn't say that these are worth $30. The box they come in could be done away with to reduce the price.Overall:If these were the same price as the green sprouts bibs (which I haven't purchased so I don't know about their quality, but they do appear similar) then I would say get these because the snaps are nice. But with the price difference, I'm almost wishing I had tried those first (because they have great reviews and I'd also be saving money!)
