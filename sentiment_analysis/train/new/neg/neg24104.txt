I have never written a product review, but I had to weigh in on this so called portable crib.So like many new grandmothers, I didn't have a spare bedroom for my little granddaughter, but where was she to sleep when she visits?  I thought the best solution for me was to get something portable that I could easily set up when she visits and take down and store away when she's not with me.  And I did my due diligence.  I read all the Amazon product reviews for Graco's Pack n Play portable cribs, Chicco's and Baby Bjorn.But before ordering, I went to Babies R Us so I could see what they looked like. "Babies" didn't have the Baby Bjorn, but I wasn't planning to get that one anyway because it was more expensive.  What I didn't do was to try to collapse the playards or set it up on my own before deciding to purchase.  I ordered the Chicco over the Graco simply because of it's available colors.  This playard was neutral and attractive, and BIG and HEAVY and DIFFICULT to assemble, and IMPOSSIBLE to break down. There is no way to take it from room to room without disassembling it and it's heavy, heavy.Lucky for me though, it was purchased through Amazon.com and even tho it was totally unpacked and  set up, they agreed to take it back.So then I had the ridiculous project of breaking it down and getting it back in the box.  This product, which is supposed to be easy to pack up and go, required UPS to pack it because none of the accessories fit back in the box!I ended up buying the Baby Bjorn portable crib, at a little more money, and it's FANTASTIC.  It sets up and breaks down in literally seconds.  It's light as a feather, weighing only 11 pounds and we take it everywhere.  It stores in a little briefcase type carrying bag and is worth every single penny because it has saved my arms, back and neck!
