My son has started to stand up and turn around in his highchair, and we couldn't find the original safety belt that came with his chair.  A quick trip to Amazon turned up this cheap, well-reviewed safety belt.  Cool.  I bought it, and received it in the mail fairly quickly.  I installed the belt, buckled it, and cinched it up as snug and tight as it would go around my son...and he promptly stood up and turned around WITH THE BELT STILL ON HIM.The safety belt is very elastic...I expected something like seatbelt material, but it is more like the waistband on a pair of sweatpants.  It is completely worthless for its stated use, and my wife had to buy her own material and clasp to make a new safety belt.  This one went into the trash.  Looking at the picture and the previous reviews, I would not expect something that is so elastic a toddler could stretch it out with no effort.  Belts are meant to hold something in place, right?
