These are good bottles and most importantly my baby took them. However when I left the babysitter with them, she didn't know that the bottom screwed off and spilled my liquid gold everywhere, it's happened to me too, so not totally her fault. But besides that there are SIX pieces to ONE bottle. I'm not a clean freak and didn't sanitize them after EVERY use simply because the production of removing to wash the bottom plastic, rubber insert, body, nipple, lid and screw top was enough for me. We switches to kiinde and now I only have one piece to wash; a nipple!! The baby prefers it too because it's easier to hold.
