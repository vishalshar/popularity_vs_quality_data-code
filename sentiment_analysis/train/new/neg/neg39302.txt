This arrived in two days! Very fast delivery, and we were so excited to open it up and take a look for our baby due in Feb., but to our surprise the colors don't look like they do pictured. The tan is almost a hint of pink, and we are having a little boy so no good! We took it out of the package and in different light it looks better. Still debating on returning for another set or not....
