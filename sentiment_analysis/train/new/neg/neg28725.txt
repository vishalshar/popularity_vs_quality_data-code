I bought this cover to use with my 8 month old son when we are out and about.  It does a great job covering all the parts of the shopping cart but it has no padding at all.  My son is pretty big - 70% weight, 90% for height - and he still wobbled around too much to use this cover without blankets stuffed around him for padding.  I think it will be great to use when he's a little bigger but for now it's going in the closet and it's back to the drawing board to find a cover that has more padding to use in the meantime.
