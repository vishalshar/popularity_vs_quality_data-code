Love that it has the AC adapter cord. I was very upset that it did not have the same songs as the original My Little Lamb. That was the reason I bought this model. We borrowed a friends My Little Lamb for our first child. We have home videos of her with the music playing and it stirs up such nostalgia. Years later we were having baby #3 and buying a new swing that had an AC adapter vs batteries. I chose this one thinking it would be just the updated version with 5point harness and AC power. The music, unfortunately is not the same. I bought it early and didn't open for months until baby had been born, so I couldn't return. If I would have known that it wasn't going to have the same music, I honestly wouldn't have purchased this model.
