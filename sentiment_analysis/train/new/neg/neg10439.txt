Aesthetically this dresser and all of its matching furniture are pleasing, however, everything has to be put together, even the railings the drawers must slide on need to be screwed in, even Ikea doesn't require you to screw in the rails for drawers.  I realize this product had a low price point so I shouldn't have been surprised that its a little on the flimsy side.  When opening/closing the drawers they always feel like they want to catch and fall of the railing.  The wood used is a soft wood so it feels cheap, very similar to Ikea quality.  I was never planning on it becoming a family heirloom so it is serving its purpose.  I would recommend to anyone who is on a budget but would like furniture with a more modern trendy look like this.
