I got these for my little girl's room whom should be here in a couple months. :) But they weren't really what I expected.Pros* Cute color combinationCons* They were smaller than what I wanted. I have an IKEA bookshelf in her room and I was using these in the cubbies but they don't really fill up the cubby nearly enough (lots of wasted space).* The material doesn't fit around the inside board snugly enough. So there is a tad bit of loose material especially on the bottom board insert. Plus I'm not too fond of the type of material used.I say make sure you measure the space you plan on putting these cubes and make sure they are not too big or too small for what you want. Also, zoom in a bit to get a really good idea of what you'll be getting. When you zoom in on the picture you can see some of the "not so pretty" aspects of the material. But for $8 I guess you cant expect perfection. Still putting these to use.
