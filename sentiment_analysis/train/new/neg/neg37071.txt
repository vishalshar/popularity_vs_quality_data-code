Hello, I bought one of this a couple of years ago for my older son, we're still using it on his bed and like it very much so now that his younger brother is about to leave the crib I simply bought another, expecting to get the same thing, huge mistake.  The product has some important changes to the worst, in no particular order:1. The metal parts that go beneath the mattress are way shorter and instead of a rectangular it’s a round tube, so it’s not as stable as the older version.  Cost cuttings probably?2. The new one has an extra lateral tube on each side that hits against the mattress and pushes the bedrail outward (maybe if your mattress is really, really thin (or short) this won’t be a problem, but then you'll get a nice metal tube for your children to hit himself with on top of the mattress) .  I really have no idea why they made this change, it can't be cost cuttings and is stupid security wise, the only explanation I see is that since as a whole this thing is flawed, those extra tubes might be what actually stop children from falling.  Unlike the older version that fits tight and the mesh is what makes the stop.3. The width adjustment has been dumbed down or beautified, safety should never be dumbed down nor come second to beauty!  In the older version you can adjust each side by loosening or tightening the cord as needed, so no matter your mattress width you could get it really tight to the millimeter.  In the new one you have four or five preset holes where you can adjust a pin to set four or five different widths, this simply doesn't work, even less if you have extra tubes pushing the rail outward and cheap small metal parts and even cheaper plastic ones trying to hold it steadyRounding it up, the new versions fits awfully loosely and separated from the mattress, I can't recommend you another product but I definitely discourage you to get this one.  Don't waste your money, and more importantly don't count on it as a safety measure.
