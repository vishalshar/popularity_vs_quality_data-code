This is the first review I've ever given. I read many reviews, but look at them as just opinions. Please just view mine as my one person one sided opinion.  This monitor is only ok. I thought it would be great to upgrade to a digital monitor, but it still sometimes has interference which surprises me. Also, when watching my son on the monitor, it's like he's in slow motion. Like the picture is not in real time.  That's odd.  I don't think the temperature guage is exactly accurate. Perhaps the heat from the actual camera skews the temperature read out a little. The monitor always reads a couple of degrees hotter than the room actually is. I finally just turned that off, so I wouldn't pay attention to it.  Keep in mind that when you are talking to baby through the monitor, it's almost as if you're yelling, so talk softly. It's very loud!  For almost $180 I did expect a bit better quality.  I'll use it, because I own it, but won't rush out to be the exact same one for replacement if something should happen to this one.
