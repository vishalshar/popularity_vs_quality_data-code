I wasn't able to use it once my daughter was at least 18 mos. It's size is most appropriate for a 2 - 4 year old.  My 2y4m old wears it, but it's a little long when she sits down. That makes the pocket lay across her lap, vs catch food inside it. I think the user satisfaction is largely determined by their child's height and whether they sit in a height chair/booster.  Maybe it would be a great smock for standing up doing artwork.
