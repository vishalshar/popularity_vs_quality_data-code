My son loved this swing until the motor burned out.  The music still plays but it no longer swings.  I ordered this swing because it had mostly good reviews although many said the motors stopped working.  I chose to take my chances with it.  After just 5 months of use the motor burned out.  The reviews weren't dramatic, it really did stop working and not because of misuse or a heavy baby.  We use the swing pretty often and my baby is only 16 lbs.I did contact Graco and they are willing to send out replacement parts but we are stuck without a swing until they show up.As far as the correct product and shipping time, I was completely happy with that.
