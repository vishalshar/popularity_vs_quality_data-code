5 star: looks1 star: ease of assembly3 star: Average of the first two bullet points.I am quite handy but this is a 2-3 hour install. Make sure to have a second person while intalling all of the slats. Pre-drilled holes for metal brackets were not even close to matching up. Matched one on each side and drilled the other hole on each side to match up. Beautiful bed so It's very sad I had to rate it this low but assembly is part of the stars I award. I would still recommend if your good at jerry rigging.
