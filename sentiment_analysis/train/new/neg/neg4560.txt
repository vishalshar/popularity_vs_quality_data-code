Not wild about the Synergy carrier and definitely don't like these bibs that are supposed to go with it. The thinness of the material is a non-issue beacuse, they do have a non-permeable membrane to keep the drool from penetrating to the carrier, but a simple (and more cost-effective) plastic lined bib will do the same job. I don't like these overpriced bibs beacuse they fall off every time you put your baby in or take your baby out of the carrier. I hate to pay for something that is suppose to make your life easier and only proves to provide more frustration. I have found that a simple, plastic-lined (or not) baby bib works better for my baby in (and out of) the carrier and costs much less!
