We bought this set for the main parts and we are glad that we did not have unrealistic expectations regarding the other parts. The curtains, changing pad, and pillow are a joke. The curtains were not even close to fitting the width of the window, the changing pad is extremely thin, and the pillow is about as thick as an I-phone and provides no support. It is also smaller than a sheet of paper.The sheets, blanket, and bumper are all very good. The bag, bottle holder, diaper holder, and toy holder thing are all ok for their use, but are not likely to last for over a year.Overall, I think that this is a good buy for the price as long as you don't have unrealistic expectations.
