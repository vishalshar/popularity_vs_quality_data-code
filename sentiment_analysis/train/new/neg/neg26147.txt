I purchased this car seat for my 6 month old son, based on reviews online and saftey tests.  The car seat is beautiful, very plush and roomy, however, the crouch strap is too short making the leg straps too tight and they cut across my son's upper thighs. He is average height and weight and I do not understand how this isn't a problem for more buyers. The only way to prevent this problem is to loosen the straps and that is not an option because if the straps are not secure there is not protection in an accident. Needless to say I returned this seat and purchased a different brand. I would recommend to anyone considering this seat, go to a Target store, use the display model, put your child in the seat and adjust the straps to fit, just to make sure you do not encounter the same problem.
