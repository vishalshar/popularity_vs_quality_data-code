This cup leaked and I'm not sure if I just received a bad one but the other I've purchased after had worked fine. The replacement straws are great to have since my daughter is constantly bitting on it.- easy to clean. I use a bottle brush to clean the bottle and a small straw brush for the straws and mouth piece.- easy for 2 yr old to use. No biting on straw. Easy flow that my 9 month old uses it at times.- velcro strap easily attaches to my daughter's backpack and STAYS SECURE!I can attach it to anything including my diaper bag and it has never come loose. Make sure to keep strap closed when washing.- can easily see how much liquid is left- additional straws are great to haveCons:- leaked- design doesn't last long. It slowly comes off after several washesI will continue to purchase this cup in all designs
