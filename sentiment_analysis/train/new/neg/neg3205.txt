We used this item to separate our open concept living room and kitchen for our one year old daughter whom is running around getting into everything. The product itself is a sturdy high quality gate. I gave it only three stars because 1. The gate itself is not very wide. I'm I size 6 and I feel like it's a little too narrow for my liking especially when I'm carrying my child and 2. Quite frankly it was a pain in the butt to mount it to the wall. It took my husband and I almost two and a half hours to get it sturdy enough. The brackets it mounts to the wall with are cheap plastic and the screws are super long. Considering the tight space you have with the gate being there (the way it needs to be installed) it's hard to tighten the screws for it to be sturdy enough for a 20-30lb toddler to pull themselves up on. I wish I had thought to buy the supergate with the extrawide gate and the extensions. It would only give me 120" versus 144" but the esthetic would be better. That sucker is up now though and neither my husband or I is taking it down.
