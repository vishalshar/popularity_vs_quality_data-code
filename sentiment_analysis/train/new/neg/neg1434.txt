Reviewers mentioned shedding, but that is an understatement. The minute I opened the package, white fuzz started spilling out like confetti. I tried shaking out the wipes thinking it would stop, but they just kept shedding. I packed them up intending to return them. However, when I went into the online returns system I found a message saying they cannot be returned. This was NOT made clear when I ordered them. I've been impressed with the quality of Under The Nile materials, but these are clearly defective. I'm disappointed both in Under The Nile and in Amazon's refusal to process a return of a clearly faulty item.
