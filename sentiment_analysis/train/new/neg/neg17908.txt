Like other people have stated in their reviews, the quality of wood used for the frame leaves a lot to be desired. The removable net bag, while a great concept, also is lacking in the quality department. The net is very stiff and I can see how it can easily rip. The theme printed hamper material itself seems to be the same great quality as the other items in the bedding set (which I rate highly).
