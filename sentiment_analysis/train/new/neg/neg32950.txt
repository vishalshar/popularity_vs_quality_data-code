My husband and I agreed on this bag but it definitely wasn't a great find.  I have really broad shoulders and it was hard to put on; it really didn't fit my husband at all.  If I wore it on one shoulder instead of both then it would slip off very easily sometimes almost getting my son when I'd carry him in his car seat.  It seems pretty durable, except the velcro wore out within the first few months we had it (we do go everywhere and our son was right along with us)!  Everything I put in there ended up in more of a pile at the bottom and trying to do anything one-handed wasn't possible.  Over all it's good for someone who isn't use to wearing a back pack all the time (&/or has a small frame), who is not really active or plans to not use it much, or that doesn't mind not having things organized.  I ended up selling the darn thing...just to get back some of what I spent on it.  Sorry it's long winded...but I hope it helps!
