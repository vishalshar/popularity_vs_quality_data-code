The cloths sour. called the manufacturer.  They just said it was the pillow you put in the bottom. replaced the pillow that came with the warmer without benefit. Tried more water,less water and even some of the solutions that are mentioned in the instruction book. Rolled rags as instructed, tried other ways of folding stacking rags. Increased and decreased number of rags. None of this kept them smelling soured.  Called manufacturer again and basically there response was oh well to bad for you.
