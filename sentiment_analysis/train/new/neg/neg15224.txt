I am a 34DD. Unfortunately, didn't get the support I needed for this. Large was too big around. Medium fit perfectly, but not enough support, so the pump pinches as it sags against gravity. I did have some luck wearing it upside down with the elastic at the top. Overall, you're better off putting holes in an old sports bra. Also, zipper is not that easy so you really don't save time with it being strapless.
