I really like Spectra products. I have a 9 plus pump I use for travel and work, but I am very disappointed in this pump. After 6 months it's power has died down and stopped working as efficiently as it once did. It now takes me double the time to even get half as much milk. Very disappointed, I'll be contacting the company.
