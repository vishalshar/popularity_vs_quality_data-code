I attached it to the City Mini GT single stroller.  It definitely gets in your way while you're walking.  You need to adjust your stride which takes a little getting used to.  The problem with this stroller/step combo is that the City Mini doesn't allow you to hang anything on the handlebars (even a diaper bag).  So having a toddler hang on the handlebar adds some weight and may tip over the stroller (it hasn't happened yet but I"m always careful to make sure I get my toddler to step off first before taking the baby out.
