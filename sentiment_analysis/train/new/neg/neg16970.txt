This is the best outlet cover that I've found so far, but it's not great.  It is relatively easy to install, and unlike the safety 1st version, it will fit on outlets that have 1 screw or 2.  I find it hard to open once installed, so it's best for outlets that are not frequently used.  Also, it is a very tight fit over power strip cords since they stick out farther and it does not fit over big, square AC adapter plugs.  The hole for cords to come out is only on the bottom, so you have to install it opening to the right.  If you have a tight space and need it to open left, the cords will then come out the top, which looks ugly.  Still, it's fairly cheap and I'm confident that if I can't get the thing open, my baby won't either.
