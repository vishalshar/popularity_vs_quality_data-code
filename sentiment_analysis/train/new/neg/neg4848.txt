I was so excited to get these labels and used them on my child's shoes and boots right away. I followed the instructions but the labels started moving around in the shoes on the very first day. The labels were also very easy to come off. I actually had better luck in the past using the Avery no-iron clothes labels when in a pinch for a solution to label shoes on their inside.
