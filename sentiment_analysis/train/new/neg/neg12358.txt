Instead of a few large suction cups, this mat has several very small suction cups. It doesn't stick to the floor of the bath tub and floats while my son is taking his bath. Part of the tub floor is textured, so that contributes to the problem, but the suction cups do not stick well to the non-textured part. My son loves the images, though.
