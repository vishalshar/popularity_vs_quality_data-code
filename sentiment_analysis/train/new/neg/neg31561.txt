We spent a significant amount of time looking at double jogging strollers online and in stores (good luck finding any to look at).  We purchased this one for our 18 month old 35 lb. kid and our newborn (now 15 lbs.).1.  It came mostly assembled and took 10 minutes to complete assembly.  Came with rain cover, which works pretty well (if you remember to put it on :) ).2.  Nice wide canopy to sheild from sun.3.  Seat incline system is primitive.  The most upright setting is not straight enough for our 18 month old, so we have to put blankets under his head.  Unfortunately, the folds of fabric fold into the childs head / shoulder area and look like they could cause some discomfort (haven't registered any complaints from the kids on that yet).4.  No snack or cup holders for parents or children.5.  Small underseat storage, but easy to get to.  We just carry some diapers, wipes, a bottle, snacks and water...don't need much room.6.  Tires need to be pumped up at least once a week.7.  Very HARD to turn if you are short.  I am 5 ft. 3 and it is difficult.  Hubby is 6 ft. 3 and is OK for him.  (See #4 re: drink holder, hard to drink a cup of Starbucks and walk at the same time).Overall, it seems durable and rolls pretty well if the tires are properly inflated.I'm looking for another stroller to walk with because this thing is too hard for me to turn (equivalent to weight lifting, muscle-aches the next day and lots of spilled Java).  Also, the squirels in our yard liked the canopy and at a couple of holes in it (this is probably just a personal issue, but I thought I'd share anyway).
