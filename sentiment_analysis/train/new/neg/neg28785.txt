These pouches are a great idea. I was stuck with TONS of prepackaged baby food in jars, as well as homemade baby food that I had frozen, but my twins suddenly refused to eat off of a spoon.Even though I had read reviews on here about the seams being hard to clean, I decided it was worth a try and perhaps those people had written those had not tried cleaning them well enough.After just a couple of uses, and a long time attempting to clean inside the seams, they are already accumulating food. I do not foresee being able to use these for long as its nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get them completely clean. \They are fairly easy to fill, seal, and use but the issues with cleaning is a deal breaker for me. I personally would not buy this brand again because of the issues with getting them clean.
