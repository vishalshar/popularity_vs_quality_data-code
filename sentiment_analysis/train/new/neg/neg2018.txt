My son literally hates this pillow, he has another non-memory foam pillow (The Little Pillow Company) and even though it is smushed he loves it! He refuses to sleep on the memory foam one. He just found it too firm I believe. I left the old one in there and he will move the foam one to the other side of the crib and place his old one back and switch them! I have video! I also learned he only likes to sleep on one side of the crib I guess! There's no doubt it's a well made pillow, but my 22mo just didn't like it sadly.
