I have the DaVinci Katana 4 in 1 crib and realized I wouldn't be able to use regular teethers on it because of the design of the crib.  I didn't want to use those plastic ones that tape on because I didn't want to ruin the beautiful finish of the crib, but I wanted something to protect it once my son started standing in his crib.  This does fit the bill, but they are a bit big to really work.  My crib only has one side rail to attach this to (the other side is the changing table/drawers unit), and it was much bigger than the rail itself, so it doesn't attach very well.  I tried tightening it, but that doesn't really work.  The front and back pieces with the hooks fit a bit better, as the wood piece you attach this too is longer.  However, all sides tend to slip.  That is the main problem of this item; if your child tries to stand and grabs onto this, the cloth moves and your child will slip off.  When I take this off, he has no problem standing because he grips the wood.  When I put this on, he slides right off because he can't grip.  It is definitely better than nothing, and seems to be the only thing available for my type of crib, but I really wish it worked better.  I may try to see if I can find some rubbery material to attach to the underside of this so that it can grip the wood better.  Overall a fairly good purchase, but if there was something better I would toss these right away and get the better item.
