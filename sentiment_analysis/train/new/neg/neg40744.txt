When I received my box, all the tape had been opened already, and the product inside was sloppily folded as if someone had rifled through them previously. There was also even older tape marks that had turned black (when all that's left is the stickiness which then attracts dust and turns black). Considering this is for my baby girl it bothered me that it had been tampered with and seemed to have been tossed around cross country. I am exchanging for another and hope the same thing doesn't happen again.
