I read all the other one-star reviews, and I know I may be taking a risk with this product, but I do have confidence in Amazon's refund/return program.  I need this to assist with in-home hospice care for a family member with Alzheimer's.Here are my initial impressions:1. A seven inch diagonal screen?  Yes, sir, but the image from the camera is allowed to occupy less than half that space.  The majority of the screen is used to display a motionless image of your choosing.  BLEH!  Motorola needs to decide if they want this thing to be a digital picture frame or a room monior.  If it is supposed to be a swiss-army knife, add a can opener, toothpick and a tiny marlin spike, OK?2. This product is made in CHINA. CHINA has overtaken Japan as the world's largest producer of junk - and I don't mean boats.  "Paging Mr. Deming; Mr. Deming, please report to China."  The OWNER'S manual is written in Chinglish or Englese - I can't tell which dialect - and it is remarkably deficient in useful information, like how to SET the date and time.In summary, I would say this monitor is barely up to the task it assigns itself, and gets minus points for lousy documentation.
