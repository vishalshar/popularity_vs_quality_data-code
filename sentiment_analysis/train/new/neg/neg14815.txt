I loved these for my son to eat his yogurt out of.  He started using them around 18 months and still uses them now at 2.5 years old.  They are great.However the quality is not great.  The ziploc type closure at the top peels off no longer allowing the pouch to close.  The yogurt squeezes out everywhere and the pouch is useless.  I have thrown almost all of them out and will not be buying more.Also yogurt tends to wedged into the cracks and crevices and even the dishwasher can not get it out.Genius idea, but needs improvement.
