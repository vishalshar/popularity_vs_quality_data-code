I bought these to place on top of cupcakes for my daughters baby shower cup cake tree.  I washed and dried them before placing them on the cupcakes.  They were adorable and Thankfully my brother helped himself to a cupcake and licked the frosting off the bottom of the duck before the baby shower.  It left an awful taste in his mouth for HOURS!  We thought he was kidding so both my sister-in-law and I did the same and we were left with this same awful taste in our mouths for hours.  We had to scrape all 200 Pink Girl Mini Rubber Ducky - 24 Countcupcakes and re-frost them.  We were very thankful that this was caught immediately and whatever these ducks have on them didn't penetrate into the cake.  These ducks are very cute but there is some chemical in them!!  I would not recommend these for ANY situation and they should be removed from the market until rectified.  I have bought large ducks like these and have never had a problem.
