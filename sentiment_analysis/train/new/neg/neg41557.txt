I was expecting a full sized piggy bank, especially for $25! I'm really disappointed. The bank itself fits into the palm of my hand, so I'd say it's the size of a newborn puppy. And it's mostly padding. So, it doesn't hold much money at all. I'd say this is extremely misleading, so be sure to look at the actual sizing of it.
