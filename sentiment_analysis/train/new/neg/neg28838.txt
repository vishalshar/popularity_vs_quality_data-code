I really wanted to like this Nasal Aspirator.  We got it for our newborn who nostrils where too small for the standard bulb they give you at the hospital.  For us, it just didn't do the job as well as we would have liked.  We never seemed to be able to get the suction we needed to get her nose clean.  I love the idea behind this as I am a germaphob who is a bit grossed out that I can't clean the standard bulbs after use, but if the bulb doesn't get out the snot it doesn't have to be cleaned anyway so it sort of defeats the purpose.  Cleaning and putting it back together is a breeze so that is definitely one thing it has going for it.  I don't hate it since I like the idea and it did fit my babys small nostrils, but since it wasn't as effective as I'd hoped I just can't say its better than okay.
