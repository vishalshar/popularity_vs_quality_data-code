You'll be surprised with how a company like Fisher-Price will place such a piece of crap in the market. This Made in China - cheap plastic - low quality components- piece of junk is useless. I tried monitoring my baby just 60 feet away and got NO SIGNAL AT ALL. When I got closer (40ft) I had a signal but full of static. This monitor is TOTALLY UNRELIABLE. I think it is UNSAFE to trust it for taking care of my baby. Any good reviews on this product MUST be placed by the company. IT IS TERRIBLE. DO NOT BUY IT.
