I purchased this item in 2010 when my son was about 6-7 months old.  I loved the product: it was space-efficient, fast, and pureed perfectly.  I could adjust the consistency of the purees.  I did not have any problems with chunks or food pushed to the sides.  I also did not have any problems steaming vegetables, even when the food chamber was full.  I had to rotate and rerun at times, especially when I had both proteins and vegetables at the same time, but I didn't see this as a problem.  I was using this food maker daily to make complete meals for my baby.However, after about 3 months of use, one day our steamer stopped working!  Just like that, while it was sitting on the kitchen counter.  The blender was still working but not the steamer.  Amazon's return/exchange period had passed so I contacted the company.  They were incredibly nice and helpful, and sent me a replacement immediately.Unfortunately, with the new replacement Babypro, the blender suddenly stopped working after a month's use!  This time the steamer was working and my son was able to eat small chunks by this point so I just kept the product and continued using the steamer only.  I was very disappointed that the second Babypro had failed too.  As a first time mother, I was really proud of making homemade food for my baby and loved this machine for allowing me to do so.All in all, could have been a great product, but it failed me twice.  I will not be buying the BabyPro again for my second baby, I am going to try a different baby food maker.
