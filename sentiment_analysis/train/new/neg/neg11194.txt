We purchased this for my daughter and after it was aired up, She fell in love with it and was bouncing on it for the entire day. Notice I said for only the entire day because the second day she had it broke. The air intake (where you fill it up) separated from the rubber of the Horse causing it to leak all the air out.We contacted Toys R Us and they said they would replace it. However we would have to pay for shipping and it ended being more of a hassle than it was worth. We just took it as a loss and went and bought a new one from the mall.
