The item i received has a scratch behind the plastic you can't get rid of and it's right of the middle of what the baby should be looking at.  The sound is so low it can't be heard in the crib when the volume is on high.  Using it in the portable crib is useless because it has to be too high to hear at all. I'm very disappointed in this product.
