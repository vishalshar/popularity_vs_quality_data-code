If a company is going to send out a product with a faulty part, I think they should at least let you know about it. Although, why wouldn't they just send out the replacement part in addition to the boxed set with the faulty part? The tubing they send out with these machines is faulty- call customer service who will overnight you the new tubing which will apparently fix my problem. I'll update as to whether it does. But anybody with a new baby will feel similarly upset at wasting hours trying to make this thing work with faulty parts.
