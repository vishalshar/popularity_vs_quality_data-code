I wanted to love this high chair...and I did when we first purchased it.  This chair has one serious design flaw.  Obviously the design team behind this...don't have children.  Babies are messy.  When feeding a baby, food goes everywhere.  Add teething to the mix and you get drooling and a baby that sticks everything in their mouth.  This is why I hate this chair.  The straps are not all removable.  You can only spot clean some of them.  So when the straps started turning carrot orange and my son wouldn't stop trying to chew on them, I couldn't really clean them.  I even tried to take the thing apart with a screwdriver.  I wrote a letter to Fisher Price and received a $25.00 gift card.  I purchased the Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster Seat instead... and I love it.  It is easy to clean and all the straps can be removed for proper cleaning.  So if you have a perfect baby that does not get messy when eating, purchase this chair:)  If your child is more like the average baby...go with the Healthy Care Booster instead.I will say ONE good thing about this chair.  I like the padded removable cover.  I think the cover works better with smaller babies and makes them more comfortable.
