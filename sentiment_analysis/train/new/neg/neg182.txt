i am sure this fits many other strollers, however not my JJCole Broadway stroller,  which has a crossbar, where I planned to install this. well this is too small for the crossbar. I tried attaching it to the canopy bar, too big , never tightens and in the way of opening the crossbar. will try to have a rubber in between the clamp for the snack cup , which is adorable, but not sure if it will be secure enough. The selection of cups and snack cup holder is so cute, really nice work with that but not for my stroller, so I will have to buy another product i can try out first . Little bummed as I was excited to have a functioning snack cup.
