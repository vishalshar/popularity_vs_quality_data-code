#1 BASKET - Tiny, but this is an umbrella stroller after all.#2 MANEUVERABILITY - Excellent.It rides great! Very smooth!#3 RAIN COVER/CANOPY - This is where my problems start. This canopy is useless. It doesn't keep the sun out of my baby's eyes, nor does it protect her from rain when she's in a "reclined" position. The wire frame is ackward, and although I can get the canopy not to slide of the wires it's still a pain to deal with it. I regret buying this stroller because the canopy is horrible!#4 FOOT REST - nice feature#5 STROLLER HEIGHT - Stroller bars are nice and tall so it's easy to push this stroller.#6 EASY CLEANING - It's plastic/vinyl so it's easy to clean or wipe down.#7 RECLINING SEAT - Reclines by a few inches (by unzipping the zipper), not enough for sleeping but enough for comfort.#8 WEIGHT - Very light and easy to fold. It is sturdy enough not to tip over when I hang my purse on the back. But be warned - when folded it's very long and it hardly fits in my trunk diagonally.I gave it 3 stars which is generous considering how much I hate the canopy!
