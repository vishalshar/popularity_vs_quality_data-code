I have purchased these bowls previously, and the first set I purchased lasted for a long time and did not stain until they were over a year old.  Unfortunately, this second set has already stained (after only a few weeks) and I cannot get the stains out without a significant amount of scrubbing (and some won't come out at all).  We put everything in them - cut up fruit, veggies, dry snacks, etc. which is no different than what I did with the first set.  I am hoping this new set are just a defective set.  I really like the idea that they are made from recycled materials, my kids can't break them, etc. and we love the colors.  I may purchase another set to see if I continue to have the stain problem.
