We have the original version of this chair (which amazon sells for $27.99) and love it.  The only reason we decided to buy this deluxe version is because we wanted a 5-pt harness for added safety.Two things I do NOT like about this chair:  (1) Seems to be smaller in size.  We put our 17 lb. son in it and it looks like he will outgrow it before long.  I compared it to our original version and the seat back is indeed more narrow.  (2) The tray is more difficult to attach as compared to the original version.  The plastic also seems to be flimsy where it attaches to the seat.The only positive about this chair is that the type of fabric on the seat cushions will be easier to clean.  This is not enough of a reason for us to keep the chair, however, so we will be returning it.
