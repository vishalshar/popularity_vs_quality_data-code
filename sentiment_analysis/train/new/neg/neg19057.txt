It took me a good 20 minutes to figure out how to install this cup holder onto the car seat. I had to google it, and it turns out, I was not the only person who was confused! Here is how to do it:Find the red tabs on the car seat. Right next to the tabs you'll see gray piping (it was gray for me, might be another color for you). There are hidden holes next to the piping. You kind of have to spread the fabric to see the holes. Then you shove the cup holder stick into it. You have to push it all the way in, and it can be tricky to do this because the fabric gets stuck in the grooves. Then, you have to find a way to stick it into the holes in the car seat. Once it's in, it's suppose to click. It's really hard to do it and I'm not even sure I did mine correctly but for now it's serving its purpose of keeping gold fish and drinks at hands reach for my screaming children.
