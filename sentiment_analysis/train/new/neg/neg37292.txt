My son likes these. They are easy to drink from. I was them in the dishwasher - top rack. Haven't had issues with mold and we have been using them for almost 6 months. My son tries to shake them upside down and they will leak a little from this. The occasion throw will also produce a little bit of liquid but stops leaking after its landed. On even more rare occasion, the throwing can knock the inside leak proof tab to fall off and in which case it leaks! And digging the little tab out of the cup full of liquid is less fun. One of my cups would get water droplets forming on the insulation by the pictures after being washed in the dishwasher. It always dried after sitting out for a bit and no mold appeared. But then about 4 months in, the insulation part of one cup completely separated from the cup! The picture design came off since it was just paper. The cup is still functional though.
