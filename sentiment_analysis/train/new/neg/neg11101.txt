I bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods.  Ten months later, I hardly ever use the darn thing.  It worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases.  My complaints with the product:- Not particularly sturdy.  The backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily.- The straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way.  Not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere.  However, everytime I remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear.  And unfortunately it seems I need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured (another complaint).- The second tray which pops on over the swing away tray (at least on my particular model) is very easily removed by my son.  He lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor.  The point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably.- This seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat.  It HAS to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over.The good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space.  It is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design.Overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand.
