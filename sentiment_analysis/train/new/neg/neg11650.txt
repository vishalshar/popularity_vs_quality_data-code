I don't often write reviews but I can't help writing one for the Evenflo Tribute LX convertible car seat. What caught my eyes was that it was a top seller on Amazon. It looks nice and was cheap. My wife likes cheap. However, as they say you get what you pay for. The features of the seat looked like it was designed by an intern at Evenflo. Evenflo cut costs by cutting quality.Overall, I will be returning the car seat and purchasing another one.Pros - Super cheap for a convertible car seat. Nice choice of colors. Comes with anchors clips. Big enough for my 10 month old baby. Frabric can be easily removed and washed. Light weight.Cons - Edges of plastic seat are sharp! Sanding down the edges would help prevent cuts. Doesn't come with harness pads. The harness rubbed up against my baby's neck and caused a rash from a thirty minute ride to the doctor's office. The instruction said the harness clip should be at armpit level but it still rubbed the neck. Automatic 1 star for that. The swivel base is not high enough for a rear facing setup. A rolled up towel or pool noodle can help tilt the seat back so the line on the car seat is horizontal with the ground. The cup holder is a joke. The instruction said to remove the seat liner and clip the cup holder in the slot then pull the liner over the cup holder's bracket. Well the problem with that is the liner can't magically go through the middle where the bracket is attached to the cup holder. The foot print of the rear support of the car seat small. I can see it damaging the seat it's install on over time.
