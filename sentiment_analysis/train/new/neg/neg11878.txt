This wasn't the high chair I wanted, but I also did not want to spend $200 + , so I settled on this one. I am not a fan of 5 point harness, or fabric on the seat. But like I said, I settled for one that has those features. I think for the money, this is a good highchair. It gets the job done without being too cheap. The fabric does wipe off pretty well. I also like that the tray can be put on by either squeezing two buttons(?) on the sides, or one lever in the middle on the front.
