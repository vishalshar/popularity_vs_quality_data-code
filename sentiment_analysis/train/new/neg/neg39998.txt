I was excited to find a product that would grow with my baby and this chair will. Hopefully I'll like it better as a toddler chair then I do a an infant rocker. This device does not rock much on a carpeted floor. There's a little bit more of a rock on my kitchen floor- but of course that's not the best place to have a baby at my feet. The toy arm seems to be in the way when getting baby in and out of chair, even if I move it aside it just falls back to center. My baby is only entertained for a max of 5 mins in this chair. Can't reccomend this chair-but will hold hope for the toddler chair.
