We bought this baby monitor in June of 2010 for our son who was not yet born.  We dind't need the monitor at first since he slept in our room, but once he moved to his own room the monitor performed great.  I really liked this monitor for the first year of use- the sound was good, there was no static, it was reliable, and I loved the feature of the temperature display.  However, now it has been over a year, and the battery on the parent handset only works for about 45 minutes until we have to put it back in the base.  We have also noticed a horrible static sound, it gets to the point that we have to turn it off since it disturbs my and my husband's sleep in the night.  Now that our son is older we don't need the monitor as much, but I really expected this montior to last longer than a year, especially for the price we paid for it.  Now if we have another child, I will have to buy a new baby monitor, and this is really disappointing since I did love this monitor at first.  So, think about how long you expect your electronics to last before you decide to purchase this monitor.
