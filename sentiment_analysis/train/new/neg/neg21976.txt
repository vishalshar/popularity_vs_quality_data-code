The idea is great, but the rail guard was about 3-4 inches too short in length. My son was able to the guard completely off, because the velcro didnt work well with the crib slats. Mind you, our crib is simple and has pretty thin rails along the top with slats are just as big. I'm not sure how this would say on any crib. I am returning it, since it is unusable.
