I bought this stroller after trying to decide between the graco IPO and this model.  As a mom of three this is to be my "forever" stroller--the one that stays in the trunk and will last our family until it's time for grandkids.It came quickly and is really good looking.  Easy to assemble.  It seems very durable and tough, but the tradeoff with that is that it is heavier than I thought it would be.  The IPO was lighter weight (by about two pounds) but also had a higher weight limit, so consider that if it's important to you.  It folds and unfolds easily and quickly, but it takes up more room in my trunk than I thought it would and it's curved funny when folded so you have to put it in just the right way or it rolls around/tips over.  Loaded with features.  I'm not thrilled with the adjustment of the seat--my 2 yo is always straining to sit up and the way it tightens, it just won't sit her up any higher.  I wish I could tighten it up just a bit.  Decent basket size and the handles are a great height for me (I'm 5'10").  Feels solid and rugged, but is narrow enough to fit through most aisles.All in all, a good stroller.  Look at the Graco IPO before you purchase this one, though, just to be sure!
