I agree with the above review. This item is poorly designed.Designers at I agree with the above review. This item is poorly designed. Designers at Maclaren probably never placed a baby in this rocker. If they did then, they never bothered to change the basic design flaw i.e. that the toy bar is badly designed to be placed on the rocker. It is difficult to get the baby in & out of this rocker the toy bar and the canopy.Also, my baby hates the vibration that the Maclaren rocker provides.she cried whenever we tried to put her in the rocker. She loves the hanging toys the dog, the rabbit & the elephant.She loves the Fisherprice rainforest bouncer.
