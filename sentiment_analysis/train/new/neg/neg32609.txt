I use cloth wipes and am tired of carrying a spray bottle of water with me for the times when I am not near a sink, so I have been looking for a product that will hold wet wipes in my diaper bag.  I own several of the larger Planet Wise wet bags, which I use for storing dirty and wet cloth diapers, so I decided to try the mini wet bag for the wipes.Unfortunately, it didn't work out. I had previously looked at the Planet Wise website and noticed that this product was advertised to include "waterproof inner material" and that "each bag is innovatively sewn with hidden seams and sealed for no wicking or leaking." Because of this, I felt comfortable using wet (not damp, but not dripping) wipes.  During its first use, though, I noticed that the bottom corners were damp. By the end of the day, the entire exterior fabric was very wet, presumably due to wicking along the zipper. This also led to the dye bleeding in a few spots.My disappointment is probably partially my fault for interpreting the website description to mean that Planet Wise had devised a way to keep the zipper area from leaking, which led me to think I could keep the bag on its side for storage. At the same time, though, I don't think I would be able to ensure the bag remained in a horizontal orientation (zipper facing the ceiling) when holding wet items even if I tried, so I would probably still experience leaks anyway.Watch the video if you'd like to get an idea of the size of the wet bag and how it fits in the Ju-Ju-Be B.F.F. Diaper Bag, Black/Silver as well as how well it can (or rather, doesn't) handle water.Three stars because this product could be useful for things that don't get very wet.  If it's wet enough that you can wring water out of it, on the other hand, I'd pass on this product.
