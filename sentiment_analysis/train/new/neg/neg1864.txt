I ordered this Baby Photo Album without reading the review about it, when I received it i found that most of the pages are upside-down, there is a space near each photo space to write a memo about it and the word memo is written upside down !! I called Amazon customer service, the representative was very helpful, i asked for a new album and he requested a ups pick-up the next day to return the damaged Album and placed an order for a new one that arrived the next day with the same problem !! only the first pages are OK but most of the pages are also upside down !So after another waiting for the other Album and the waiting for the pick-up for the damaged Album, I still get an Album with upside-down page and words, the inside is opposite the cover ! so if i can give this Album a zero satr i wouldn't mind !
