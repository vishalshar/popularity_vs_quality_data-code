Difficult to rate because the product has both pros and cons.The Pro:  It's a beautiful gate, well made. I used to work in wrought Iron design and its manufacturing process, so this gate really meets 5 Stars.  It's also adjustable to meet the exact opening within the allowable overall size.The Cons:  Very poor opening and closing Latch.  One has to push a button plus lift the gate at same time to open.  I can see that is meant to be childproof, BUT the closing is nuts.  One has to bring back the gate by lifting the gate again and fit into an exact slot.Well it's not so simple, because you have to push the button again, and make a perfect alignment, because bottom of the gate also has to fit perfectly at same time. My Gate was off by 1/8 inch on the bottom which prevented the top to fall into the slot on the top. It required jiggling to close the gate.Further at night time you need a Flashlight to see the slot whether it's the top or bottom preventing the gate to drop into the lock position.  Nothing is easy here.  Very poor design.  A Door should simple close with one hand, but you need two hands with this gate.  One hand to lift, the other to feel the lock between your 2 fingers as a guide, this since gate opens and closes in both directions.The competitor's Gate will only open in one direction, the reason being, a gate needs a "stop" to know when to lock.  With this model your fingers are the "stop".  On a normal Door the Jamb is the stop.The Gate would be OK in the daylight, if you don't mind fiddling, but we were planning to place the Gate into the bedroom from keeping our dog from jumping on our bed while we sleep.  I don't want to turn the light on, just to close a Gate, if have to go to the bathroom at night.One suggestion to the Maker:  If you don't want to redesign the top lock, at least widen the 2 Bottom Gate Guides by 1/8 inch, to allow the Gate to drop down without much ado.
