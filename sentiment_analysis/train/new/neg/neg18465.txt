I bought a ton of stuff off of Amazon from my Baby Registry, but this was one of the couple of things that got sent back and this was by far the worst item.  It arrived in an unsealed box with a different branding.  Upon opening the box, there was a spot for batteries, but no batteries were provided.  I put my own batteries in and noted that the thermometer appeared to be very cheaply made.  After putting the reading on Fahrenheit, I tested it out on two perfectly healthy people.  First, the instructions were incorrect.  You do not "hold the power button down" for a reading, you briefly press it.  Otherwise, no reading happens.  The readings it provided were ALL over the place and completely inaccurate - from 98.2 to 100.4 degrees on a person whose temperature was really 97.  Now maybe I had been sent an already returned lemon (eww!), but my experience was that it was junk.  At least it was easy to return through Amazon.
