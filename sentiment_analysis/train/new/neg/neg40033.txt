What is shown in the pictures is Sunny Baby brand diapers. What I received is Baby City brand. The Baby City diapers are made of fabric of lower quality and sewn with less care. I am a professional seamstress who bought these to save time. I bought them on a black Friday sale and thought I was getting a great deal on Sunny Baby diapers, but instead paid a low price for a low quality thing. Because I did get what I paid for and I was in a pinch in need of diapers, I kept them. After posting this, I was refunded 50%. I have chosen to keep the one star rating, though, because I am still that dissatisfied with the product, although the seller has stood behind their guarantee. That will be reflected in my review of them. If the brands were different and the quality equal, I would have been a satisfied customer.
