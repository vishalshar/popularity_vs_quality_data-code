I bought this in June 2013 for about $40. I loved the price, size, and pockets and the fact that I could use it as a purse and mini diaper bag. Soon it began to come apart at the seems and also the shoulder straps were peeling apart.  The quality was not very good although I loved the style. I thought maybe I'd just replace it when it fell apart too much. Now, 1 1/12 years later, it is overdue to be traded out. However the price is now double at about $80 and definitely not worth it. The quality just isn't good enough. Also, when the baby was really young it definitely wasn't big enough for all things needed, if leaving the house for a while you would need a real size diaper bag. But if just going for a quick outing it's perfect for a few supplies to throw in it, since I used mainly as a purse.
