The item I received is not what was advertised. I have this version of the frame and was hoping to match it. I, like another reviewer, thought that I wouldn't get the wrong item. My mistake. You'd think the issue would get resolved after more than a year. Nope. I'd advise you not to order if you are actually wanting this particular frame. I received the silver matted frame that was a little smaller than the one that is described here. The silver frame was actually being sold a few dollars cheaper than what I paid for this one. I see a review back in November 2014 with this same problem.
