This is a very cute bedding set, but I am not sure what to think about the quality.  The first time I washed the quilt (according to label directions), one of the flower appliques pulled away from the stitching about one inch in length.  There was no way for me to repair it.  Thankfully, Amazon let me return it.  I had to order a second set since it came from a 3rd party seller fulfilled by Amazon.  The second set has completely different background fabric (the pink with cream swirl).  It is much cheaper, thinner fabric and a different, lighter pink color than the first set. The design is printed on, instead of being woven in like the first set.  Also, the sheet was thinner.  I am returning it, and ordering directly from a big name baby supply retailer.  I hope I get the good quality fabric, because I already washed and hung the window valances which are made from the nicer, woven design fabric.  Very disappointed, and wondering if Lambs & Ivy has someone doing knock offs of their sets.  If not, they have definitely cut the quality on this set.
