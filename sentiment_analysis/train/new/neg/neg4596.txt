I spent a long time picking out which links I would purchase. I decided that all the different textures and colors of these alphabet links would be a better investment then regular links. I was very wrong. First of all, forget teaching your child any letters. Some are very awkwardly shaped and hard to read. Also the link factor is not as effective in clipping on to things because some of the letters are tiny and narrow. Toys slid right off, and I am constantly picking them off the floor. Very disappointed and unhappy. I ended up ordering regular circle links and wasting the money because shipping them back for a refund wasn't worth the extra money. Do not buy!
