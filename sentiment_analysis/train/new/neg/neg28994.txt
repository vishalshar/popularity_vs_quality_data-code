I bought this stroller for my 18 month old to replace a long-beloved Maclaren Quest that had seen better days.  They are fairly comprable and the Uppababy is certainly cheaper.  Downsides - no rain cover included.  Also, because the brakes stick out beyond the back wheels, it's very tough to "bump" this stroller up and down stairs.  This is a huge downside for me - I'm constantly having to pick up the front to get up and down small flights of stairs, over the curb, and up and down flights in the subway.  My little guy seems comfortable though and the recline is nice and deep.
