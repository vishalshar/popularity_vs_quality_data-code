These are fine washcloths, but nothing special.  The texture is finer than the average terrycloth, with smaller loops and shorter pile, and they're a bit smaller than most washcloths, so they're nice for small babies.  However, the binding does tend to shrink a little in the dryer so the washcloths don't fold flat after the first wash, and I can't say they're noticeably softer than a decent, cheap 100% cotton washcloth, of which you can get a dozen for the same price as four of these.  We have a couple dozen regular cotton washcloths for big jobs like bathing the baby and cleaning up messy diaper changes, and a couple dozen soft flannel wipes for delicate jobs like washing the baby's face and precision diaper change cleanup in the delicate areas; these cloths fall somewhere in between, and don't really do anything the other two don't cover.  There's nothing really wrong with them except the curling issue, but if I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy these.
