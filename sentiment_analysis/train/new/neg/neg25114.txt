I guess it's my fault for not reading the product info carefully... but the packaging, as displayed in the photo, is so misleading. I thought I was buying 100 sheets (given the inexplicable 'x100' on the packaging). There are only 5 sheets!! And there are a ton of pages in the memory book that these are for. They include like 2 sheets in the book to get you hooked, then charge an arm and a leg on amazon to order more. To make matters worse, they (cr Gibson, the makers) don't sell this product on their site. I sent them a message. I will edit this review if I hear from them and am satisfied
