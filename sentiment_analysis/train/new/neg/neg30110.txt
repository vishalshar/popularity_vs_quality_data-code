Quite the transistion from the maxi cosi priori we had our little guy in before this one!  He can now unbuckle himself unless we twist the seatbelt receptor end to the reverse so it's close to the seat.  My first experience with this new skill was while we were driving down the road and he was suddenly standing behind the driver's seat of our minivan. Scary.  The seat height adjustments are easily accomplished.  On long trips he complains that his butt hurts and when sleeping his head rolls all the way over and off the side head rests unless we prop him with a pillow or stuffed animal.  Bought one for each car when we purchased, but would probably not buy again for use with the seat back.  Am looking forward to the days when we can use it as just a booster!
