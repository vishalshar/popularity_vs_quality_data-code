I understand now why it's pretty inexpensive. It's cute, it's light, and it's easy to use. The things I didn't like are it's too light. It feels kind of flimsy. I took the cover off and the backing is foam, not cushion like most car seats. The only reason I am keeping it is because I need it and it was free. (a gift-and I am thankful for it!) If you have no other option, it will do.
