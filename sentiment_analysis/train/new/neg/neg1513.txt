Okay, so I read all the reviews about how fabulous this product was (for the most part) and decided to get several sets of these to secure our three refrigerators. Yes, three...don't ask? 2 are in the garage and 1 is in the house. We have 3- 2 year olds...now the multi- fridges may make more sense. These little buggers are industrious, but beyond that- I also thought this looked like a good product to keep one's husband from forgetting to actually close the freezer door all the way. There's nothing like watching 9 hours of couponing go out the window when you find all of the meat you are stockpiling is cooking inside your freezer because the door is wide open in a 200* garage. Nice. Okay, back to the product. These definitely do NOT work in a hot environment. The adhesive on the back of the two pieces literally melts, so do not even consider these in an environment that is remotely hot or humid. You'd be better off buying a used bandaid. I was pretty pleased with these inside for about 2-3 weeks. The simple fact is that, the adhesive is just not meant to withstand any real, repetitive stress. With 3 kids, I am in and our of the fridge a zillion times during the day. With regular use, the slight lifting you need to do to get the male end of the latch let go of the female end is just too much on the poor old adhesive. It gets tired and eventually loses its grip (kind of like parents)... So now my kids regularly just take these things off of the fridge and rub what's left of the adhesive in one another's hair. Yet, another drama. So, my advice: save your money, or buy some industrial size luggage belt to wrap around the whole stinking refrigerator if you really want to keep industrious fingers out of the fridge OR purchase a tazer and zap your kids if they go within 4' of the fridge (kidding of course.)
