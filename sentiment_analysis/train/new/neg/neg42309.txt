It was nice at first. Not anymore.  It is cumbersome, and makes me sweat.  It is a pain in the butt to flip it over during the night, just if I want to roll over.We have a queen sized bed, and with me trying to snuggle the pillow, I take up half the bed!  I am not a very large person (even with my growing belly).Some reviewers have said they had problems with the length because they are taller, I'm average height at 5'7 and I don't have an issue.  Typically you would be in the fetal position to use this thing comfortably, so I dont see how height could be an issue anyway.Frankly, I feel stupid for thinking I need a special pillow to sleep well.  But this is my first pregnancy and I was trying to suck in all the perks I could.  A special pillow sounded awesome!  In hindsight a regular body pillow would work just as well, even better, it would be lighter, cooler, and pillowcases are not hard to find...well I think I just convinced myself to go buy one.The neat thing about this Body Support Pillow, is that your baby will be able to use it.  So to make myself feel better about this purchase, I am now telling myself that I "bought it for the baby".
