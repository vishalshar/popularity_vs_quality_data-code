I got 3 of the Silikids Siliskins for my Evenflo Classic Glass bottles and 3 of the Evenflo Cozy Sleeves. Thought I try out both kinds of sleeves after my husband managed to break one of the glass bottles on our tile. I could not get on the Siliskins, and I was determined. I worked at least 10 minutes trying to pull it on in every conceivable manner. Do not recommend this product. The Evenflo Cozy Sleeves work great if applied as per their instuctions.
