I really wanted to love these, but they just did not work for us. The pressure built up in the straw and leaked milk everywhere. You have to release the pressure from the straw, and I simply don't have the time to chase my toddler AND his sippy cup as he tosses it 50 times a day. It's a well-made product otherwise. We contacted customer service and they were very helpful but we just couldn't make these work for us and had to return them.
