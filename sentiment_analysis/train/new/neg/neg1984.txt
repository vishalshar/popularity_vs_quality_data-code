This is a very nice stroller.  I love the color, it's easy to fold and not heavy at all.  I am disappointed though that the seat does not sit straight up. It has a slight recline to it that my 1 year old gets really frustrated with.  When something gets her attention and she wants to sit up, she can't because of the restraints.  And I can't very well not buckle her in.  The other thing is that there is a bar that is welded right scross the back in the middle of the way of the basket under the stroller.  So don't plan on going shopping and putting any bags under the stroller.  Your diaper bag might fit and that's it.  These are the only 2 complaints I have and where the stroller is nice I might not have purchased it knowing this.
