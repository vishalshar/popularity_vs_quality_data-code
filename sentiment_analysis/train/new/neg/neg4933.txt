I never write reviews but I had to for this because I am so irritated by it. Yes, the music is horrible, but I can deal with that. It's the fact that it will not stand up straight, no matter what I do. After a few weeks, you cant even see the pictures that light up because they are so far down below. My daughter liked it at first because of the lights (great for at night when she didn't like being in the dark). The remote might work if the thing wasnt so bowed! I've tried adjusting it, putting something in the back to make it stand straight - today I just lost it and vowed that I would write a review. So, the way that I've adjusted it, my daughter can see herself in the mirror and she gets amused by that, and I've just accepted that's all this thing will be good for. Wish I had read some reviews before I bought it!!!!!!
