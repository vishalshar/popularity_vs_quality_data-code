I bought this pump thinking that it sounded good for the price.  I wasn't planning on using it everyday, but wanted to pump frequently so that my hubby could also feed my baby.  However, after I purchased it, I learned that no bottles can be purchased to pump directly into, so you must use the containers as pump only and then transfer to the bottles.  Also, they only came with a couple of containers, so you can't even store the milk in them ideally.  If you wanted to, the lids don't fit easily on the containers.  I wrote the company to try to return the pump before I ever used it, but they would not take it back.  After using it, I was even more disappointed.  It did express milk, but it took a long while to get alittle milk.  The shields are flexible and difficult to keep centered on the breast.  Also, the oval indentations in the shields leave red marks on the breasts after pumping.  This pump also added to my nipple soreness.  I ended up renting a hospital grade pump to get my breasts healed, and ultimately, buying a Medela pump in addition to this pump.  I guess I will just trash this one...
