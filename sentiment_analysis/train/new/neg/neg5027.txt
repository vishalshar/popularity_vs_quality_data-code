These are great for a cheap set of utensils, especially for the price. They are all easy for a child to hold. The spoons are wide and deep, and for a really little child these might be to big to fit in their mouth neatly. The same goes for the forks. The forks are worthless for stabbing anything, and really they only do the same things the spoons do except with slits in them. I got some Nuk Gerber Graduates and moved a bunch of these utensils into my child's room as a play/practice set. Other sets are worth the extra money!
