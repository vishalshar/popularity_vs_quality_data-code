I'm very disappointed with this gate. Within less than 24 hours of it being installed, the wooden slat closest to the latch where you open the gate broke off. Due to the design of the gate, there is a plastic covering on the top and bottom of the wood where the gate where it latches into the wall. Due to these plastic coverings, the wooden slat closest to the opening has to be narrowed down to fit into the plastic. It appears to be the same width as the other wooden slats, but then there's a much smaller piece that actually attaches to the top and the bottom. This design flaw reduces the structural integrity of the gate, hence it breaking so quickly. The latch itself is also not very user friendly. It very rarely can be used one handed to open.This gate was purchased for a child care center to replace a gate that was used to close off a toddler  bathroom when not in use. A parent was simply pulling the gate closed when it broke. I would not recommend this gate. It is poorly constructed and not easy to use.
