I purchased this seat based on the rave reviews here on Amazon. I had a 2 month old that wanted to be held ALL the time and slept for only short increments. I thought this seat sounded like a lifesaver! I was dying to receive it!I put it together as fast as possible and put my daughter in it. And nothing. It's helped not one bit.I should have gotten a bouncy seat as that would have been more useful.The music is too loud and you can't adjust the volume. I really can't say anything great about it.We have now had it 2 months and I don't believe it is more than ordinary.I hope it might work for you as it has for other reviewers~ but I am one disappointed mom!
