I have never given any low scores because I believe most people in business really do try hard to give the best that they can.  This company shipped so very quickly - I recieved the item in a couple of days - which was great.  However, I gave them a low score because of the quality and price of the product.  The diaper pins were very cheesy, not at all the kind of quality I would use on diapers.  They seemed more like they should be rated for crafting they were so cheaply made.  I hope they dont rust on cloth diapers.  They were of the quality one would find at a dollar store - so the price was way over the top (with shipping - over $20).  Once received the value was no where near the asking price and I probably could have gotten something very similar at a Big Lots type of store for less than $5.  So, I rated them poorly - they recieved 2 stars for shipping so quickly, but zero stars for quality and price.
