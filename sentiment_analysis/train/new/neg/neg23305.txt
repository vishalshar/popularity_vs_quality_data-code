There is no denying these little guys are cute, and the concept is wonderful and creative. But check the dimensions - everything is smaller than I had anticipated. Our 18-month old does not initiate play with these independently but she does like playing with them with someone else if they start it. Just be prepared that for the price you aren't physically getting much, and as other reviewers have stated, the base is pretty flimsy.
