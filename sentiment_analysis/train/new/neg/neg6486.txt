Even after reading the negative reviews on these bibs, I decided to place my order based on the bibs I bought about five years ago by the same brand.  Other than the convenience of having 3 snaps for a nice fit as the baby grows, there is no comparison to the older version.  These are a thin plastic, unlike the older cloth-like vinyl.  After 2 weeks of use, including hand-washing them every night, the stitching has come loose on 2 of the bibs, and right near the snaps, no less.  I am so disappointed in these and feel that for this price, I should be able to expect the same quality that I have experienced in the past. I will search for a brand other than JJ Cole in the future.
