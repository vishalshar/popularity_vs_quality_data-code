I'm ambivalent about this canopy, mostly because I bought it for a two-year old.Pros:Super cuteInexpensiveHelps transform a crib or a toddler bed into something a little MORE.Cons:Easily comes apartPlastic rods that hold everything together easily bend. And that bend can be permanent.A younger kid can tear it down immediatelyNot a strong construction.My kids bed looks great, but that's pretty much all it does. It CANNOT stand up to a bedtime tantrum and she will literally pull on the canopy and it all comes tumbling down. She's 2, so I would avoid getting this for a younger child and get it for someone much older, since they have the maturity to not destroy it.
