Dangerous, turned around for a second to grab a book and my daughter was wrapped in it. She is a feisty little, but I can not see this being safe at all for anyone. She doesn't even roll over yet and still got wrapped in it. She did like looking at it from afar. She would stare at it from her sit me up frog and swing. So I give it 2 stars for visual stimulation purposes!
