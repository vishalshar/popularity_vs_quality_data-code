I was Super excited about this purchase because my infant sweats a lot and my ac doesnt hit his seat as well because its rear facing. Well i got this to help out a little. Its a great little fan to cool him off if the ac air is hitting it. However, it only functions while running on usb power. When i went to use it on batteries it never turned on. Tried different batteries and same thing happened. It doesnt come with a manual so no troubleshooting help. So if you just want it to use in the car w out the option of taking out then this is good.
