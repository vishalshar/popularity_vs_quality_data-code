I was diappointed in the actual material of the product.  It had a lot of "give" and was very stretchy.  I never felt 100 % secure that my baby wasn't going to fall out and often had one hand on her, which defeated the purpose of having the wrap.  I thought maybe I just needed to practice more, but I never quite got it.  I eventually gave up using it (probably when my daughter was about 8 months), well before I would have if I'd liked the product.
