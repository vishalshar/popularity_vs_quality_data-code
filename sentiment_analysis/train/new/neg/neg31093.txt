July 2013 Update:In May, Customer Service offered to send me a new Follow Me Fred because the old one was in perfect shape, but the battery compartment couldn't be fixed.  I received the new one and so far it is working well.  I still only rate this 3 stars because I have yet to see whether this one will hold up for longer than 6 months (which is Tiny Love's end of replacement duration).Original May 2013 review:I purchased this toy for my daughter in 2010 and it worked well, but the batteries always died very quickly.  It didn't help her learn to crawl, which is why I purchased it; however it did amuse her greatly.  When she grew into toddlerhood I took out the batteries and put the toy carefully away in the closet.  I brought it out recently for my baby boy and put in new batteries.  The toy won't even turn on now.  Both my husband and I have inspected everything carefully and yes, the batteries are in correctly.  There is absolutely no damage - not even a scuff - on this toy and the battery compartment is pristine.  I contacted Tiny Love customer service and they won't replace anything after 6 months.  They suggested I purchase the part I need, which is laughable because upon close inspection no part is missing, damaged or defected.  How would I know which part to replace?Two stars for poor customer service and lack of durability of the toy itself.Buy something else from a company that will actually take care of its customers.
