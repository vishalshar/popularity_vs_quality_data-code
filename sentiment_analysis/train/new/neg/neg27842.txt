Beautiful, fade-resistant colors ...I bought two of these - one in Navy and one in Red. They are very soft to the touch (and stayed that way even after a few washes), but they are SO thin. I was really shocked.I actually had a well-worn Simmons changing pad cover that was very plush (I was buying these to replace it), and I ended up keeping it to use UNDER these. I have a hard time complaining about such a low price, but a person should really know what they are getting.So, if you buy one and don't want to be stunned by what comes out of the package - keep these things in mind:1. They are THIN ...2. Very stretchy/gauzy3. Stitching isn't anything amazing4. They do wash nicely5. Liquids pool on the top (if you have a toileting accident, it buys you time before it soaks through)6. Each one has crescent moon-shaped slots for the changing table pad's safety straps
