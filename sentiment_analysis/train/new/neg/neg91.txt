Overall I was satisfied. It is a cute baby book and the pictures fit well. However my particular book had stray markings on the cover and inside the pocket on the cover that I had to remove with nail polish remover. Most of it came off, a little bit smudged and wasn't removed completely.  A little disappointing. I am hoping they don't notice since this is a gift.
