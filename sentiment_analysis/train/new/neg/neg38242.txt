This bassinet looks very classy in the picture. When I received it, I was so excited to get it all set up. To my disappointment,1. the cushion that came with it is a lot thinner than I thought and flimsy.2. I was missing 3 screws for the bassinet. I would of called and let the company send me a replacement but living overseas and waiting for the mail though fpo takes a while, and the baby was due soon, my husband ended up going out in town and find as close as the 1 screw that came in the little baggy.3. The basket/toy bin is a joke. the mesh to hold diapers and such for the baby would sag to the floor, making it drag as I push the bassinet over. So, trying to put something down there is impossible, unless you alter and create your own shelving.and 4. the wheels were just as bad. Our carpet in our housing is like the carpet in school classroom, very thin. So anything with wheels have no problem rolling in them, except for this Bassinet. The caps on the wheels kept popping out when i try pushing it, or just completely falls apart.  I ended up taking off all the wheels and just had it like a rocking bassinet, which was fine on some days. But when my newborn would just a little, the bassinet would of course rock and waking him up in the middle of the night.  Even if the baby outgrows this Bassinet, the bottom would of been a rocking toy bin since the wheels were horrible (unless of course anyone else could tweak it and use a different set of wheels, but that just beat the purpose on spending this much on something new)  I do not recommend this Bassinet to anyone.
