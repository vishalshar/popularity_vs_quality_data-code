I don't like enough to buy another but don't dislike it so much that I will return it. It smelled awful when I pulled it out of the package and took 3 washes to get rid of the smell but whatever. Also it's super thin. I was expecting a nice snugly flannel sheet to help keep my girl warm and this is not going to do the job. You can never have enough crib sheets so I'll keep it but it's definitely not what I was looking for.
