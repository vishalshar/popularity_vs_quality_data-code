Like the other reviews said, the pink was extremely light, but that is exactly what my husband and I were going for in our little girl's room. I didn't want it to be too overwhelmingly pink. I absolutely love the design and the femine look and feel of the whole set. The one thing I was not a huge fan of was the material the comforter was made of, it is pretty thin. I paid a decent amount of money for this set, but I do think I paid a little too much, I would not buy another JOJO Designs item, and yea, I could have sent this back, but we did absolutely love the design, it is so chic....we just have to use other blankets in our angel's bed to make sure she stays warm at night.
