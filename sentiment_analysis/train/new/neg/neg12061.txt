These are such a great idea! So convenient if you switch diaper bags often, or just like to keep things organized easily. We keep some toys in the goodies one, and an extra Nuk, socks, baby spoon and bottle nipple in the extra ones. The bad part of these are the clean and dirty pouches. The dirty pouch still has a mesh back, so if you have any wet or gross clothes you can't put them in there. It would be much more functional if it was a wet bag or laminated material. The clean bag also ripped for us on the seam where the mesh attaches to the front canvas. We have twins and try and keep a onesie and pair of pants for each of them in there (in small sizes--they are only 9 months) and it ripped pretty quickly. Pretty disappointing!I love the idea and wish I could find something similar but better made. I may wind up just making my own.
