I've used this wrap for five months now and the only thing that I like about it is the tail because I can nurse while carrying my baby with ease. I don't like the fabric and when tightened it digs into my neck and my baby's legs and hurts.  It seems to be twisted 90% of the time and I know that I'm threading it correctly.  I have to readjust it too often because the fabric is always sliding and loosening up the sling.  I NEVER go hands free using this carrier.  I don't know what they're talking about but this sling isn't that secure.  Another thing about slings is they are only supported by one shoulder and your back so eventually the weight from any sized baby causes a lot of pain and discomfort.  I am looking into the Moby or Sleepy Baby wraps because they're softer, more secure and distribute weight evenly, but I'm not sure if I want to be bothered with all that wrapping.
