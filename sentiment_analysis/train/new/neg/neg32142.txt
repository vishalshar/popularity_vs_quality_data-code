First thing I noticed was the box had a holes and dents in it.Not all the pieces were labeled and pieces of the wood were deeply scratched or little pieces broken off.Instructions were not perfect but it's pretty easy to figure out where their place is.The table, once assembled, is pretty lightweight.I am 9 months pregnant and it was easy to move.The drawers are a lightweight cloth that at first was a turn off,but considering its for a diaper changing station its good because it will be easy to wash if any accident occur.I kept the table, but I don't think its worth the price.
