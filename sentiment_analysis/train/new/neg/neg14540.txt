It's strange, I purchased three of these Aden + Anais sheets in solid white from Bloomingdales a couple of years ago and they were sooooo soft and lovely. Then I recently repurchased another sheet (this time in Super Star) from Amazon and this one is stiff and doesn't feel the same at all. The quality has either really gone downhill in the last 18-24 months, the solid white is just much better quality than the printed sheets, or this is a fake. I don't know which it is, but I'm not satisfied with my purchase.
