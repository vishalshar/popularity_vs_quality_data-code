We own 2 of these and my mother in law owns one.  In general I suppose it's been fine.  Our daughter seems comfortable in it and it's held up well.  For impact safety, I'm pleased to say I have no idea (and hope not to find out).My complaints are with the straps, which are really consistently difficult to adjust.  Tightening her into the seat is a battle (with the seat, that is...  I think it goes without saying that it's sometimes a battle with the daughter, too :-), the straps don't pull smoothly at all and it's difficult to get it as tight as we want (and I'm not the smallest guy in the world).  This is the case on both that we own and on the mother in law's.Further, the strap doesn't slide particularly smoothly through the pivot (where it clicks between her legs), meaning it usually takes a fair amount of pulling here and there to get the slack in the right place, otherwise to get things tightening well on her chest can sometimes mean being far too tight on her legs.I also dislike the straps for the latch anchors, as it can be a battle to get them to loosen (though I haven't had any trouble tightening them) when I need to move the seat to a different car.My comparison on all these is the Chicco seat for smaller kids.  We used it with daughter #1 and now are using it with daughter #2.  It adjusts beautifully and we've never had a problem getting it exactly how we wanted it.When it comes time to buy a bigger seat for daughter #2 I will try to find a different seat than this one.***Edit:  We just inherited another one of these and its straps are perfect.  They work smoothly and are really quite nice.  A huge contrast to the other 2 we own.  Given that, I just bought yet another one of these.  If the straps work well, then I'd change from 2 stars to 5.
