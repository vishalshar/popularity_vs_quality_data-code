At first I really loved these. They were easy to apply, blended in with the table, and stopped my 1 yr old from constantly banging his head on the corners.  I've had them on for about 6 months now and they are starting to randomly fall off. I was eating breakfast this morning when two of them tumbled to the floor. I think I need to apply more sticky tape. Luckily, they give plenty of tape!
