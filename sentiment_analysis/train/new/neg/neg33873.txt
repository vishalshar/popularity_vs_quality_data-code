First note, you really have to press down hard to make sure these go all the way through to the second slice of bread. Also, you have to be sure to get the regular sandwich sliced bread (wondermbread size that we all grew up with)My kids and I love the elephant one, and use it most often.The penguin doesn't come out looking very birdlike (the beak is too small once the slicing is done).The puzzle pieces are to small and always gets stuck somehow -- my son loves puzzles but because of the way these pieces break apart (or not) it becomes difficult for him to "play with his food".Overall it's  nicer than just slicing off the edges and then cutting it in half.
