I was infuriated when I found this spindle won't work with all gates (says it on the packaging but not in the product description here). The spindle is too large to be inserted into the gate. However, this can be worked around.There is a rubber "bumper" where the spindle is inserted into the gate. This bumper can be propped out of the gate using a butter knife.Find a way to secure this bumper in some vice grips or something. Take a cordless drill and match up a drill bit with the thickness of the Y-spindle, and use that bit to make the hole in the bumper wider without breaking the bumper plastic. The biggest drill bit I had was the exact size of the spindle so I ended up having to screw the spindle into the bumper, but then I reinserted the bumper into the gate.
