We bought this seat rather blindly based on it's good safety rating on Consumer Reports.  Bad idea...Not that this seat won't do what it's intended to do, mind you.  But it is a painful ordeal to install the base in our cars, which do not have the LATCH connectors for the middle-back-seat (i.e., the only position that works well for this seat+base).  The painful problem with the base is two-fold:1) The place where you thread the seat belt is VERY narrow and not channel-like.  Thus very hard to thread a belt through w/o rasping your knuckles.2) The place where you thread the seat belt is VERY close to the crook of the seat, which makes it VERY hard to tighten properly unless your shorter belt-buckle-strap is shorter than our cars (2000 and 2001 sedans).Besides the major aggravation with installing this seat there are two other issued worth mentioning.It is also very difficult for me (partly due to my back problems) to unclasp my child from this seat while kneeling in the backseat.  This is due the two things:3) The two latches for positioning the handle are VERY tough to dis-engage.4) Both the upper and lower buckles are hard to dis-engage one-handed.We also don't like how heavy the seat is, though the handle-shape clearly helps.  Lesson learned: don't trust good safety ratings alone.  Try it out first.
