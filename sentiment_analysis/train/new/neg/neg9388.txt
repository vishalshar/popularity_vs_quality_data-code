I think that this is a great product overall, however I only gave it two stars because it only sort of solved my problem.  My fourteen month old son is long and lean, and in order for the Dapper Snapper to work at its best for him, I have to snap the entire thing into the very last allowable snapping option in one big loop, leaving about an inch or so of the Dapper Snapper left over, which I just try to tuck behind or back into the whole works.  I wish this product came with more snapping options somehow, for skinnier kids.  My work around, however, is saving me some sewing time with some of his pants.  Nice to know my boy has some room to grow into some of these nice clothes that our family buys for him all of the time, however, the waist bands of the 12 to 18 month old clothing size is often an inch or two too big so I always have to sew or do something like use this product with a work around.
