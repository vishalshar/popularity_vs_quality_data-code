I bought these for my son's room and when they arrived we were VERY pleased with the way they looked and the quality  of the stickers.  They were very easy to pull off the paper without ripping and easy to apply.  They are definitely BIG!!!  My problem with them is that they have only been up on his wall for 5 days and the big planets are already peeling and falling off the wall.  One of them fell off and stuck to itself and when I tried to unstick it to put it back on the wall it ripped :(I *just* read on another review to put some doublesided tape to help keep them on the wall, so I will try that next, but I wish I had known that before or that they stuck better.------------------------------------------Update - I contacted the company about the big planets falling off and ripping and they sent me replacements.  The replacements have been up for over 8 months without issue.  I do have to go and rub my hand on them periodically to stick them back to the wall, but on the whole I'm happy with these now, my son loves them and whenever someone sees his room we get lots of positive comments!
