I bought this after watching YouTube videos on how to apply wallstickers.  I thought this would come together on one big sheet the way it appears in the picture.  However, it does not.  Rather, each small group of words, "I'll love you" "forever" "I'll like you for always" "as long as" "I'm living" "my baby you'll be" are on one sheet but broken up and in different directions and you have to individually cut them and make each one level.  Makes it much more difficult.  I will be ordering another one from a different company so it comes on one sheet.
