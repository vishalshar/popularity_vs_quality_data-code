I run a daycare from home and always looking for that awesome sippy cup that doesnt leak and that baby will love.  Bought this cup for a 12 month old ready to transition from bottle to cup.  At first I was really impressed because it didn't leak and baby took to it immediately, but babies at this age are teething and the spout of this cup is a perfect teething object- soft and small so baby drinks and chews at the same time.  He really enjoyed it but the cup couldn't weather the abuse and after a couple weeks it was leaking and actually became a choking hazard since the tip was literally tearing apart.  Bummer because it really worked so well in the beginning.  Back to the store to look for the next "awesome cup".
