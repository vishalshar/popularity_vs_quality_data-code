These decals are super cute.  Although there is no sample picture, I didn't have any trouble coming up with a cute arrangement for the tree and animals.My huge issue with these is that they constantly peel off of the wall.  The sheets are shipped rolled, not flat so after I took them out of the package I had to leave them under a heavy box for several days to try and flatten them out.  Several of the larger decals (bear, deer, tree limbs etc) stick on the wall but parts of them constantly roll up and have to be pressed back on the wall.  The smaller decals (leaves, and especially the mushrooms) constantly fall off of the wall.Although these decals are cute and a great way to decorate the nursery I would not recommend them to anyone.  Maybe the product would be better if they shipped the sheets flat instead of rolled.
