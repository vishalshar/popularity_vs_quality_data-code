I purchased this in mid June for a 2 month trip to Tokyo.  Received it promptly from Amazon and it seemed like great quality for the price paid.  (I wanted something of decent quality, knowing it would get used a lot there but not long-term since I don't use strollers at home).  After just one week, one of the leg adjustment pieces broke off.  It just dangled there - did not really affect my 3 year old's comfort, but made it MORE of a hassle to  fold.  Could not really return or exchange since we were out of the country, so figured I would contact manufacturer for parts after we got home.  The stroller came with a one year  warranty.  Mia Moda has a bare bones, if not somewhat sketchy, website but I contacted them via email in late August asking for repair parts.  It is mid-October and no reply of any kind from them.Due to the fact that this stroller broke after barely being used, it is not easy to fold, and now after a few months the "open-close" latch has broken as well, I recommend DO NOT BUY this brand or model.
