You get what you pay for... I paid next to nothing, hoping to find a diamond in the rough. But this thing is so cheap and so small (see picture) that our child barely fit in to it, and she was really uncomfortable when we finally squeezed her into it. We put a doll in it for size comparison. If Peppa Pig barely fits, a child is most definitely going to have problems fitting. It's made with barely any fabric so it's not very sturdy at all. I was so scared that our child was going to be too heavy and rip it and she would end up falling and hurting herself. Not worth the buy - don't waste your money.
