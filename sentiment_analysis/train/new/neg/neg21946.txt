We originally bought this because our newborn wouldn't sleep in the crib. Or anywhere else for that matter! She liked to be held, and would cry and scream whenever we tried to set her down. She immediately loved it. Though the novelty has worn off a little bit, she still does. It's the only place aside from our arms that we can get her to nap for a decent amount of time. It works great as a rocker, and is easy to move with a hand or a foot. Folds up great for extra space when it's not in use. It's soft and we love the incline. (She has acid reflux and doesn't like to lay flat on her back that much.)I do have a couple of complaints. It was a little tough to put together. The fabric wouldn't stretch without using some extra muscle. Not that big of a deal, but something to mention anyway. What really brings my star rating down is the vibrate function. We exchanged the first one because it didn't feel that strong and started to make a rattling noise after a couple weeks of use. Our second is starting to have the same problem. We have used other styles of the fisher price rock and play sleepers (the puppy version, and a deluxe sweet beginnings from Target), and none of them have had the same issue.As far as the torticullis and flat head problem other reviewers have mentioned, so far we haven't had that issue. Though we make sure to take her out often for cuddling, feeding, and tummy time. And it's not the only place she naps. I also took the advice of one reviewer and added a folded up receiving blanket between the cushion and the hard plastic piece as a preventative measure.I would definitely recommend a fisher price rock and play sleeper for parents who need an alternative to the crib, have picky sleepers, or want something portable and safe. But I would go for one of the other designs!
