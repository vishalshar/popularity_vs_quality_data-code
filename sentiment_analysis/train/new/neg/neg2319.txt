When our first daughter was born, we bought the P3 and loved it.  When our second daughter arrived, we did not consider a brand different from Peg.  The quality difference between the P3 and Tender is stark.  The P3 is well-built, well-designed, and Italian made.  The Tender is poorly built and made in China.  The design is fair.  It does not collapse as well as strollers our friends own, it lacks storage, and the Peg Perego Viaggio car seat we used with the P3 does not snap in to the Tender.  While folding the stroller, the foot rest clipped something and a rivet popped out.  The foot rest now swings freely and dangles.  The materials the stroller is made of are not rigid enough given the length of the stroller.  As a result, even on the sidewalks in our neighborhood, it's extremely difficult to push this stroller in a straight line.  Whether turning or trying to maintain a straight course, the flex within the frame and handle makes controlling this stroller a squeaky and labored process.  Finally, given the amount of plastic in the stroller, it's surprisingly heavy.I cannot think of too many merits of this stroller.  The folding and unfolding mechanism can be managed by one person.  It looks pretty good.  The wheel locks and braking mechanism are decent.  You'll need the front directional wheel locks to help you steer a straight course when pushing this stroller outdoors.We were extremely disappointed in this stroller.  We're going to replace it with a cheaper, superior model from a different manufacturer.
