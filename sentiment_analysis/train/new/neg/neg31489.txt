Ignoring the multitude of negative reviews on Amazon, I purchased this for our child. This CD player is a complete waste of money. First, the sound is so low at maximum volume that it is audible only in the very quietest of times. No screaming baby is going to be even touched by its effect - which defeats the major purpose of calming a baby. Second, the player is so designed that if you have a sleeper other than a crib with slats, the sound will be completely muffled, worsening its already low volume. Third, the system of hooking the player onto the crib rail is iffy at best. A small knock and it will fall off, either onto the infant or the floor. Fourthly, the unit visibly and tangibly vibrates when playing a cd. It is flabbergasting that a reputed company like "The First Years" could market such a disappointment. This CD player is going back to Amazon, even though I will have to pay for S&H both ways.
