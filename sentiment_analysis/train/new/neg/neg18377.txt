We purchased this to carry back and forth between the changing table and the living room (since we spend the majority of our time there). The velcro that holds the two party together doesn't hold them too well... It almost needs velcro higher up to keep it together. The pockets along the entire outside are great though. You can hold all kinds of things such as desitin, qtips, etc in them.
