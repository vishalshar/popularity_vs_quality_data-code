I ordered a girl's bike and received a women's bike. I am a petite girl so the shorter one would have been easier for me to ride and maneuver, but I had to make due because I can't exactly ship back a bike. Still getting used to hopping on and off. It's advertised as a girl's bike so that's what I should have received.
