Returning. I was shipped what I believe is a Chinese knock-off. Different colored end caps (that one can rotate, making me wonder if they could come off), the two black bands you see are in different places than in the picture, shipped in white box with a sticker that says "rainforest shaker - Made in China", nowhere on it does it indicate Discovery Toys brand (nor is it called "Rainfall Toy" anywhere on the box). Cheaply made, colors not as vibrant as photos, not the real deal.
