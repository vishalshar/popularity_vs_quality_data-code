These curtains are very pretty but be aware that on amazon's site, the color sandstone is not represented well.  I had to look elsewhere on the internet to get the color (all the colors that are tan or brown on amazon are Autumn).  Also be aware that, although when I looked up this color on other sites, the beige (sandstone) looks very muted but that is not the case, there is a very pronounced rust in there.  It is not "muted" at all, it's very dark.  I have ordered beige chiffon scarves as well, not only for a little more fullness, but to "cool off" the rust hue in these scarves.  I'm hoping to drape the new scarves over these "ombre" scarves and maybe get more of the effect I was going for.
