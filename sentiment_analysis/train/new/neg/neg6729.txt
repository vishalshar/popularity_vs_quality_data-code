We went with a Lion King theme for our son's nursery.  Its cute and holds a lot of diapers.  The only thing I don't like about it is that the hanger is a light weight, thin edged plastic coat hanger with a stationary hanger.  It would break very easily under the weight of the diapers and the stationary hanger means you are limited on how to hang it up.  I replaced the hanger and it works fine.
