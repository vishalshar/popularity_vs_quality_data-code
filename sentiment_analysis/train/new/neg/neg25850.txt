I really like this plaque, but i have one issue with it: why is the 0 after the 9?  I didn't really notice this before I bought it.  We have it hanging above our changing table and read a line or two to our 9 month old after each diaper change.  I refuse to read ...7-8-9-0 lest he think that 0 comes after 9!  I don't know what they were thinking, but this doesn't make sense and isn't going to help a child learn that 0 comes before 1!
