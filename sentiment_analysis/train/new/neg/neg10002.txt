I got this a few weeks ago.. the reason i chose it was because my baby was 2 months old and already 15lb so i figured a couple of months and she will outgrow any other swing since almost all of them take up to 25lb and that's it.. this swing is good, but it she doesn't calm down in it, she has to be already calm to sit in it and take a nap.. i think that it needs much more padding and the chair base is wooden so when she kicks sometimes she hits her feet on it and she gets cranky.. also it doens't recline.. as a seat, it could have used a vibrator.. we do use it a lot as a chair but only when she's in a good mood, if she's crying she kicks hard and that's when she hits her feet on the base and it gets worse.. I don't know if I would buy it again, I would probably skip the swing and get their bouncer that turns into a rocking chair.. I hope this helps..
