Products not as pictured. The colors on the ring rattle are different than displayed. Additionally, the rattle is not the same as pictured. It has beads in one end and different color combinations. That being said, my 4 month old loves the ring. He hasn't quite figured out the others just yet but I'm guessing in time he will love them just as much. Woud have gave 4 stars if items delivered were what was pictured.
