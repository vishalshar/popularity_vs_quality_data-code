I was excited about these heat-proof, shatter-proof glass bottles. I really try to avoid plastics because of all the chemicals - esp for baby feeding. The natural nipples are great, and my baby took to them right away after rejecting many other types of nipples (she is primarily breast-fed). Unfortunately the rings pop off partially without warning and my child care provider has had lots of leak problems. It's so frustrating to spend my time pumping breastmilk that gets dumped all over the baby instead of being fed to her. Argh.
