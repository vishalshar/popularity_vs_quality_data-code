Due to the fact that you can't give 0 stars, I had to choose a 1, otherwise it would have been a big fat 0!!! We bought this mattress when I was pregnant, thinking that all crib mattresses were the same and we were totally wrong. A couple months ago my son poked a couple holes in the vinyl when he should have been napping, mind you he had nothing to use other than his fingers, no toys, nothing sharp, etc. Well last night he wakes up crying in the middle of the night, and my husband and I go in to see what is the matter, and find that the vinyl had split completely from side to side and the springs were sticking out. My poor little one had the springs poking at him. After further examination, we found that under the vinyl is a thin and I stress the word thin, layer of foam, then CARDBOARD piece and then the coils. What a joke!  Carboard!!!! Needless to say I went out today and bought him a much better, better constructed Simmons mattress. I should note my son is only 17 mths old, and the first five months of his life he never even slept on that mattress, so bascially he had only used it for 12 mths. Don't waste your money ....you'll only have to buy another one down the road. Take your money and buy a much better well known mattress for your baby!!! Afterall they deserve just as good a nights sleep as we do!!!From a mom who learned the hard way!
