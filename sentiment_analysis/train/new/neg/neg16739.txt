Just like the poster above, "unless he holds his peepee down the whole time the urine gets in between the red seat the pee catcher and comes leaking out the front. We had several cleanups cuz of pee getting on the floor."My son took a LONG time to want to potty train (I bought this potty almost exactly a year ago and he just got it down this week, but we weren't pushing it).  Now that he is using this potty every time he goes to the bathroom, I sadly see the flaws in the design.  Since the red seat is separate from the other parts, even when he holds down his penis as far as he can, it goes right between the two pieces.  My son likes to go in privacy so I couldn't understand why I was having to towel up a sopping floor EVERY TIME he sat on the potty.  This morning my husband watched what he was doing and confirmed that he is actually doing everything right, it still just goes right out the front between the crack.  Im bummed, I really like the look of this potty (my kids love Thomas) and it is very sturdy and the sounds are all working.  But a potty is no good if the pee goes all over the floor!  I'll keep it for when my daughter is ready to potty train, but its not great for boys, which Thomas the Train is aimed for.
