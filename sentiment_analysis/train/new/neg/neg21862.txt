I was very excited to get the snap n go and was looking forward to using it.  I opened the box, put it together (which was quick and easy) and felt good about preparing for my twins early.Unfortunately once I got my car seats, I noticed that my stroller is not made properly and is lacking hole "E" which is the hole I need to accommodate my graco seats!  I was even willing to get someone to drill in a hole where I needed it, but the bar was not even long enough to accommodate hole E, so it wasn't even the proper length!When I contacted the company they basically blew me off and did not even offer any form of help or retribution!  I'm totally disgusted!I looked them up on the Better Business Bureau and guess what, they have an F rating (out of A, B, C, D, F) and most of the complaints were for faulty products!  So, I think the bottom line is if it works it's great, but inspect your product carefully!  If there is a problem, don't expect them to help you in any way!
