When I first found out I was having a baby girl, this set was my first choice - that is, until I saw it in person at my local Babies R Us store.  The thread count was low and the fabric was flimsy.  I loved the colors, but the sheets looked very faded.  Being a big fan of the vintage look, I opted for the Lambs and Ivy Vintage Baby set instead.  It's sold at Babies R Us also; I think it sells for either 150 or 180 dollars.  Regardless, it's about 100 dollars cheaper and the quality is much higher.  I even found the set new on Ebay for 120!  I'm really glad I didn't get the Vintage Teaberry set.  Wouldn't you want to get more for your money too?  250 dollars can go a long way if you spend in the right places - and trust me, that's money you'll always need with a new baby around.Another thing, the latest (6th) edition of the Baby Bargains book rated the entire Wendy Bellissimo line a C-.  They would agree with me here: "But the prices!  $300 for a five-piece set that's sewn in China?  While we thought the look was a notch above what is normally sold at BRU, we were unimpressed with the crib sheet, which seemed thin and low in thread count."Also, a comment about the crib quilt.  NEVER put it in the baby's crib!  I've noticed a lot of advertisers and companies, including Babies R Us, drape quilts over the crib rails on displays.  It looks nice in an advertisement but is very dangerous if you do so in real life!  Your baby can smother in it.  In fact, it's recommended that your little one sleep with nothing in the crib, not even a pillow.  I was shocked when I read reviewer TracyD's complaint that the Vintage Teaberry quilt didn't fit over the bedding.  Well, of course it doesn't - it's not supposed to go in the crib!  I don't mean this as a personal attack, but I hope she didn't try to put the quilt in the crib with her baby.  I also hope other parents avoid doing the same in the future.  The quilt looks great as a wall decoration, though!
