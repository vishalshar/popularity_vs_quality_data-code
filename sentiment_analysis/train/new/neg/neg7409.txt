The bag is big enough and has great accessories with it to make it a functional diaper bag and purse.  I love the detachable zippered pouch inside.I absolutely cannot stand the material it is  made of though.  I searched for a fabric bag (not leather) that would work as a diaper bag and purse.  This is more like plastic than fabric.  The changing pad inside is made of 100% polyeurethane foam covered with 100% polyester.  Given that changing pad feels the same as the rest of the bag, I'm betting it is all polyester.  The strap is made of the same plastic-y feeling material as the bag but it is sharp and uncomfortable on bare skin when it is fully loaded for a toddler and an infant (the strap rubbed my skin raw).  The shoulder pad on the strap is a great idea, but it slides and twists upside down very easily. It doesn't even stay in place when I'm just wearing the bag one shoulder or cross body and walking. It still slides all over.If this had actually been made out of a soft cotton type fabric instead of plastic-like polyester material it would be immeasurably better.This bag gets three stars because it is a good bag (great pockets, size, accessories, design), if you don't care about the awful material. I will be buying another bag very soon that is made of a softer real fabric because this material has scraped me and rubbed me raw FAR too many times and I've only had the bag about 2 weeks.  I might not notice the problem so much in the winter when I'm wearing heavier clothes, but almost constantly adjusting the bag, strap, and shoulder pad is driving me nuts right now.
