We ordered the ORGANIC bin, and received the non-organic version. We already own an organic one, so I know the difference is that the Organic one is not lined, does not smell, and is made of organic cotton. The 'newer' version we received was lined and smelled. I returned it and was told the Organic version was no longer available. So I'm not sure why this is still an option on Amazon? It appears that people are ordering this one, and receiving the newer version without being notified.
