This was the worst money i have ever spent. The product did not stay in place like it was supposed to. It was constantly falling off the stove and hitting the floor in the kitchen startling the whole family. You are supposed to put position it close to the burners and that was melting the plastic. We ending up throwing it away after like 3 weeks. Wish i could get my money back. Absolute worst product i have ever purchased!
