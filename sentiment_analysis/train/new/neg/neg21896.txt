This product is defective.  When you are mounting the arm, it is just barely possible to find the perfect sweet spot where the drawer will slide in freely and the latch will catch on the way out.  This leaves me with very little confidence that the product will continue to work as it wears.If that were the only issue, I'd be worried, but I wouldn't leave a 1 star review.  However, 60% of the latches in my box are slightly misshapen.  This allows the arm to angle up just a bit more.  On this malformed latches it is literally impossible to find an installation height for the arm that both slides in freely and catches when the drawer is pulled.In my first image you can see the difference in angle between a good latch (background) and a bad latch (foreground).  In the second image you can see the defect.  The latch on the right has two small hooks that are bent in slightly.  Those hooks are straight on the good latch.  Those hooks are supposed to keep the latch from sticking up too far, so when they are bent, the latch is at the wrong angle.In sum, this product is badly designed in a way that will probably wear badly over time, leading to likely failure down the road.  On top of that, there are serious issues with the manufacturing process, leading to high rates of defective latches.
