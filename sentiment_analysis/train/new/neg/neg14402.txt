So I got this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, I purchased another toy from this seller, I really like their little owl toys!I loved how this was wood, and perfect to place on a high chair for her to play with.This toy was pricey so I wasn't to happy with the paint chip from one of the leaves.Regardless it's a neat toy, so I'll just suck it up.
