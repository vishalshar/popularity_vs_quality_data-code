I had a cheap version of these bibs for my son 10 years ago at Toys-R-Us for a few bucks.  When I found I was pregnant, I searched amazon to find them again, as his were long gone.  These bibs are great because they catch a lot of dribbles when babies are learning to drink from a cup.  They are also so easy to keep clean; just wash them in the sink and hang them up to dry.  However, after three months the plastic cracked on one of the neck straps, rendering it completely useless because it would no longer stay on the baby.  After seven months, the trough has developed a large crack in the bottom of the other bib, so it is no longer useful for containing spills.  I would recommend the Baby Bjorn bib over this one, although if your baby does not like bibs it is easy for them to pull the Bjorn one off if they put their mind to it.
