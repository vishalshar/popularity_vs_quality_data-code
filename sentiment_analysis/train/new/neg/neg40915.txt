I needed these to protect my head on wall cabinet corners.  They do an excellent job of softening the blow when I bump into them, but unfortunately they have a hard time sticking.  The double-sticky tape supplied with them sticks OK to the rubber, but not to the clean semi-gloss acrylic paint on my cabinets.  The problem seems to be that these corner guards are not molded accurately to fit a 90 degree corner, but instead are formed by cutting and gluing the shape from a stiff foam rubber extrusion.  As a result, they are somewhat distorted and misshapen, as can be seen in the product photos.  That means the double sticky tape has to pull them down into shape when installed, and there is constant strain on the tape as they try to peel themselves away from the surface -- even when nothing bumps them.  After a few days, in my experience, they pull away and are left partially adhered, ready to be knocked off by even a small impact.  I'm now trying a more aggressive 3M mounting tape to see if that solves the problem.
