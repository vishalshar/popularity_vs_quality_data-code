I am not sure any other car seat would be better, but in our car it is hard to get the belt buckle in (or out) because the seat is sitting a little bit over the receiver. I can't see why they can't narrow it in the back, at least on the underside.It is a safety concern, as I realized when I stopped for a dear suddenly and my son popped out of his seat as the belt was not fully engaged. I check manually every time now.Other than that is it a very nice seat.
