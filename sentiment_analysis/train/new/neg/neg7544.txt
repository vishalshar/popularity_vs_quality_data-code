Wow, I'm happy for anyone else who had a good experience.  Please see my attached photo of the gate latch. The gate looks good and should work, however, the evening I installed it, my 5 year old opened it and the latch on the gate broke off! It was clearly already broken when it arrive and I just hadn't noticed.  So, if you do decide to purchase this, be sure to carefully inspect the gate latch to make sure it is not broken upon arrival. I now have to uninstall it, package it up, and send it back...1-2 hours I don't have.
