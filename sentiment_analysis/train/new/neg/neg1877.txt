These are horrible.  Every single wipe has a huge sewn in tag that hangs off of it...the options are to cut it (risk having sharp edges on your wipe) or pull it off (the wipe will then eventually fray because it is like triple stitched in there or...just deal with the fact that Charlie Banana wants you to advertise for them each time you wipe your baby's butt.  So...I dealt with it.  Now to the functionality of the wipe...it is not textured in the slightest...so can you imagine wiping your baby's butt and cleaning poop off of your baby with a wet sheet?  This is exactly what it is like with these wipes.  Yes, they aren't stiff and hard...but I wouldn't call them "soft"...they just aren't hard.  They are EXACTLY like sheets.  They are horrible for the purpose of butt wipes.  Sew them together and make a pillow case out of them...a pillow case that has a thousand tags.
