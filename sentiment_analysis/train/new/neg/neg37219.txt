My DD is 5 months old and is a super drooler. So I wanted to buy a few bibs for her to catch her excessive drool. I love the Aden + Anais blankets so I thought I'd give the cotton snap bibs a try.The pros are:- They're super soft (just like their blankets) and get softer with each wash- Side button snap is a plus. Velcro closures pick up hair/link and wear out over time. These snap bibs are easy to take off/on and don't scratch my daughter's face.- Subtle colors and design. I like the soft colors and minimal design. I was looking for something that didn't have sayings like "mommy loves me" or "daddy's little girl". These bibs are beautiful. I get compliments whenever my daughter wears them.- Oversized bibs. These are a nice, big size and provide ample coverage.Cons:- They're not absorbent enough! My daughter easily drools through several of these a day. As much as I love the look of these bibs, they just don't function as well as some of the other bibs that I've purchased (like the Carter's bibs). I was initially trying to avoid buying bibs with the plastic liners, I can see why people buy those now.These bibs would be best for light droolers or perhaps during the early feeding stages. If you have a moderate or heavy drooler, I'd recommend buying something more absorbent.
