It does what it's supposed to do, but not in the most practical way. First, there is this plastic support under the area where the car seat is supposed to sit on, but its completely worthless because its too low, so the car seat doesn't even touch it. The car seat basically sits on the edges of the seat itself which doesn't feel very sturdy, then there is a worthless strap meant to strap the car seat to the stroller, but again another fail, there is really no good way of safely placing the seat on this thing. The cup holder is a joke. It is so shallow that even the smallest cups will fall over spilling all over the place. It folds down nicely, but then to open it, that plastic thing I mentioned first keeps getting stuck on the mesh at the bottom of the stroller making it nearly impossible to open with only one hand (if your other hand is busy). Maneuverability is okay, but its not the best and all these little nuisances add up to a not so pleasant experience. I would like to send it back, but unfortunately we left the box outside and it got wet on the rain, so we are stuck with this for the next few months. I wouldn't buy this again nor would I recommend it. When you consider the fact that most car seats snap into place there is no reason why this thing shouldn't take advantage of that mechanism instead of having that worthless strap.
