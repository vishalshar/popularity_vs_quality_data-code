Of course, you have to open them to know you would want to return them.As others have mentioned, you twist the top to store the straw in the same direction as you to open the lid, so sometimes it does the opposite of what you want to do.The other issue is that the straw is not free-flowing.  You have to exert some effort to draw up the drink...I know this because I tried it myself.  My 9 month old has been drinking from regular straws for over 2 months, and doesn't need to have to suck hard to drink.On the good side, it's cute, it doesn't leak and it's a nice small size.  I purchased the Oxo straw cup at the same time, and will go buy another one since it doesn't leak either, it's a little smaller (which makes it easier to drink from when the baby is in the high chair with a tray) and the straw doesn't take a lot of sucking effort to drink.
