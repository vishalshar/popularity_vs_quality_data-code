I REALLY wish I had read the other reviews here before I bought this thing. But I didn't. It is in no way a rattle, it's way too heavy for my baby, and will be way too heavy until he's over one year old, most likely. There is actually no rattle to this thing at all (as others have mentioned) and although there are speaker holes in the back of the gorilla head, almost no sound will come out unless you shake it very hard, and in a specific way. I doubt kids will get any of the tiny squeaks out of this thing at all, because it's not fun to try and try to get a noise that sounds nothing like a giggle, and is too quiet to really be of any use at all. My husband thinks it's bright and pretty and he told me I shouldn't return it, but I learned my lesson, to read reviews of even the "simplest" things before I buy them.It is suggested below that "teether" and "teething toys" are tags I might want to use. There is nothing on here that a baby would want to use as a teether, and "rattles" also suggested, is part of the name of the toy that so badly mislead me in the first place. No giggles, no rattles, not much of a toy.
