I wanted to love this gate so much.  It had everything I was looking for: metal construction, removable (temporary use), tall, a different kind of latch than I had used before.  However, all the things that I thought made it so great have made it not so good in actual use.  I am using it for a 2-yr-old, who apparently has some monkey genes.  She immediately began using the bar in the middle of the gate (necessary for holding the gate tight across a doorway) to climb up and over.  When I told her she was not allowed to climb it, the next thing she did was push it over.  It was wedged in the doorway really tight, and she scraped paint off the door frame where each of the rubbers were.  Then when the gate fell it knocked into a wall, and because it is a heavy metal gate, I now have a dent in the wall.  This is probably my eighth or ninth baby gate after three babies and many years of dogs, and I have hated all of them.  I don't exactly hate this one, I will probably still continue to use it, but I certainly don't love it either.  I don't know what could be designed differently, but it still seems like there is just no good pressure mounted option out there.
