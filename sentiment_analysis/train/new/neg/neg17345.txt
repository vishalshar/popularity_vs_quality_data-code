Purchased this necklace for 3 y/o who is an active oral sensory seeker. The beads are a perfect material to meet her sensory needs however, they constantly slip over the knots tied in-between each bead with minimal force. After a few minutes of use all the beads become pushed to one side making them less accessible if being worn around the neck. Also the clap is a plastic material, one bite and it becomes nonfunctional. I would love to recommend this to my future OT clients but due to the price and fragility of the clasp, I will keep looking for another product.
