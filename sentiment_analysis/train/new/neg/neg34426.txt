We buy a lot off Amazon and rarely give reviews.  However with this experience we decided to share.  We purchased this teether less than a month ago.  We purchased because of it being safe, made of silicone and its design.  When we received this product it came in an unmarked package which was a bit strange.  No product name or care instructions. Regardless of the packaging the main concern came when we soaked the toy in a clean cup filled with water and white vinegar.  See the photo.  The residue coating came off and pieces of blue can be seen floating. I do not recommend this product. ADDITIONAL - we cleaned the teether in a glass cup that had been sterilized and the floating residue appeared again.
