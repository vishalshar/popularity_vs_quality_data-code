Using this stroller in the Philippines and it is holding up pretty good.  Typical light weight construction but designed well.  She uses it daily and is please with the product.  Easy to fold and fits in taxi's front seat or truck.  I would not recommend taking it on airlines, but all other modes of travel works fine.  Lots of accessories available but in a rainy climate, the clear shield is easy to work with.  Compared to typical USA standards, this is an average $55 stroller.
