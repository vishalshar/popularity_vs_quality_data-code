This stool is very dangerous and unsafe!!! The lid for the step stool is not sturdy and it's easy to slip off if you step near the side edges. Last night my 3 year toddler slipped and completely fell off, landed hard on her face on our bathroom tile, and knocked out her front tooth completely. There's a chance her other front tooth may fall out also. We're very angry she got hurt because of this stool. Not to mention the fact that she'll have a missing front tooth (possibly two) for 3 or 4 years and how that will impact her speech, facial/oral development and self image. Please do not buy!!! It's not worth the risk to your kids and family.
