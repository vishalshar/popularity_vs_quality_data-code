I was really excited to get this bag. It's made by skip hop, which makes great bags.  Although it was a little small ( I could only fit two Dr. Brown bottles and a snack, no formula powder or ice packs), I liked the design. I like that it had a separate pocket out side and the mesh compartments inside. I like the extra long strap and a smaller strap that you can attach on your diaper bag.My husband didnt mind carrying it. So that was a bonus. I had no problems with the zippers, as mentioned before in other reviews.Unfortunately, my love for this bag came to an end when I had a few milk spills and realized that the bag was not washable. I mean...seriously? That's a huge flaw! I had about three bottle spills and all three spillled out of the bag and  on to the outside material of the bag. It says to wipe it clean but the bag was drenched a few times. So I decided to hand wash it and when it dried it smelled horrible. I tried to clean it again and it smelled worse. So I had to throw it out and buy something else.
