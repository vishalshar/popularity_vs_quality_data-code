Horrible! I HATE this video monitoring device. After less than 6 months the screen on the monitor started freezing and getting green stripes across the screen. We live in an 850 square foot house and it constantly loses a signal and then it beeps and beeps and beeps even if we are in the room next door. We purchased this device from ShopTronics and they sent us a defective device that wouldn't turn on and they tried to charge me to send it back. I had to send numerous emails just to get them to agree to send a return label for the defective unit and then I waited 2 weeks for them to send a replacement. The good news is if you leave positive feedback for the seller they'll honor the manufacturer one year warranty or so they'd have you believe. Probably the worst seller I've dealt with on Amazon. I tried contacting Levana directly and surprise surprise they ignored numerous warranty requests as well. I will never purchase a Levana device again.  In fact, I'm probably going to go smash this device Office Space style in the backyard. Garbage
