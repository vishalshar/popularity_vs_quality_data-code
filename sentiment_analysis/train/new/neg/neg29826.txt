This is an adequate bin, but not as aesthetically pleasing as I had expected.  Beyond a bit of a hem at the very top of the bin, the bin is unlined so that the inside is just the unpatterned backside of the outside patterned fabric.  It's fairly thin fabric, so the inside isn't white, just looks undone.  Not a pleasing look for our book bin.
