This is a very cute product, but the music only seems to play for a few minutes, which wasn't nearly long enough to get our baby off to sleep. He loved watching the mobile, but then it would stop and he would start crying again in no time. Finally he grew into the "grabby" stage and mobiles were no longer safe over the crib, so I "recycled" the parts. I cut off the little stuffed toys and put them in his crib. He likes them and they have withstood several machine washings. I also give him the little music box to play with (with supervision). But to sooth your baby to sleep, you need a different product.
