My negative review is because the pillow I received is different from the image.  The pillow itself is wonderful and my kids love them, but we lost one and tried to replace it but got a different version from the one we thought we were ordering based on the image. The hippo in the image has a flat face and closed eyes, the pillow we received had a very different face and small dots for eyes. This is very important to a 4 year old who wants his old hippo back.
