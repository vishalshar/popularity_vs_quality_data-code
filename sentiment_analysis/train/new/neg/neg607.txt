This is a total piece of junk.  I've only used it for about 3-4 months and the red foam broke off.  In addition, the hook shimmies itself to the side of the handles of the stroller.  Awful product and poorly designed.  I thought the heart was cute but it's so not cute when it comes to functionality.
