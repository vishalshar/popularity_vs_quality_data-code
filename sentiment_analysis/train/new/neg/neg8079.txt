The peekaboo clock is a fun and smart design for a kids clock. However, it arrived not working. One of the hands was detached from the central rotor. And the light cardboard backing, simply taped on the back of clock was stopping the eyes from balancing freely. Thankfully, the back of the clock can be easily removed (few hooks) and once I pushed the hand back in place (straightened the hand a little bit to stop it catching the others when they crossed path) and taped back the cardboard, it's as good as new! It's been working great since and we're pleased with it. I just don't appreciate having to fix something I paid $30 for, straight out the box. Luckily enough I had checked it before hand, and I saved my 4 year old daughter the disappointment of a broken present for Christmas (hard to believe Santa would break anything!). My advice to the manufacturer is a better finish (less flimsy) and better packaging for transport. Good design is also about good quality finish, not just about over-priced tag. So 3 stars only.
