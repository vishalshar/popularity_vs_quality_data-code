The artwork on this puzzle is really cute, but it's difficult for little hands to maneuver. There's nothing to grab onto to put the piece in place or remove it when complete. When all pieces are nesting, each is slightly raised, but there's no nub to grab a hold of. My daughter isn't interested in it much. It is a generous size, however, and she may grow into it (she's 20 months.)
