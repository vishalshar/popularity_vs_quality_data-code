Very disappointed. Received this item a few days ago and the seam came undone. I purchased this item for my 5 month old son. There is no reason the hand should be almost falling off from a baby playing with this toy. I am returning and hoping the replacement doesn't do the same. Going back and reading other reviews I see this isn't the first time this has happened. My son loves Mickey so I want to give this toy another try.
