I was surprised that my 29inch son was straining the limits of this thing after reading other reviews about how huge it was.  However, my large size dreamsie only measures 26 inches long (this is from the shoulder, but some of the length is lost in going around the baby).  It says it will fit babies 26-31 inches long but I think that's a stretch (groan...).  A large sized Halo sack (which I also have) measures 30 inches (and is advertised as being for larger babies--up to 18 months or 35 inches).  Unfortunately, the Halo sack lacks sleeves.  I also don't like the zipper design on the Halo as well (you have to get the zipper together at the neck and then zip down--great fun with a squirmy baby (though better for diaper changes, which we don't do with the baby in the sack)--whereas the dreasmie zipper just comes up from the bottom (no matching necessary) and has the cloth protector, which I've found effective).  However, the zipper on the dreamsie seems to come unraveled from the middle fairly frequently--I've always been able to fix it, but I find that really annoying (and so does my baby, who is waiting to be nursed to sleep while I struggle to fix said zipper...).  It's soft and warm.  If it were longer and the zipper stayed closed without a struggle, I'd give it a 5.  I miss the Carter's one size sleep sack!
