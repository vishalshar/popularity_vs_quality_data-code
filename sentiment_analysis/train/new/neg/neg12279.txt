*****after having this for a year-Here are my thoughts.I HATE it. The bar across the front broke and the company won't return my email. The wheels are SO hard to push and the brakes stick ALL the time.Since I purchased this for daycare- it was a waste of $400!!I will def go with a different company!!I love the size.I shopped for a stroller for a long time before I bought this one.It's heavy to load(nothing I didn't know)I'm kind of disappointed in the wheels, I expected them to maneuver through grass/other surfaces than cement better than they do! The dirt/leaves collect in between the tire and the wheel causing it to be harder to push. These wheels should be designed the same as a jogging stroller- in my opinion!Again, if you are a sidewalk walker- with very few hills, this is a stroller for you;)
