First of all, its not really Sherpa, so that bummed me out.  And then its just so-so in the looks department.  I hoped it would be a more vibrant, richer color.  Instead, it just looks like its faded or washed out.  I realize Its for a baby, so they went the pastel route, but to me it just didn't have enough bang for the buck, and I sent it back as soon as I saw it...It just didn't "wow" me in any way.  And for the price, I expect more.
