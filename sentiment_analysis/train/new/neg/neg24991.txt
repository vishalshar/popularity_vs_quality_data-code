We have a two year old and are expecting twins so we need a double stroller if we are ever going outside again.  The Joovy Scooter X2 seemed like a good solution.  The price is pretty incredible, overall the materials were of good quality and it seemed to work well.  Some features were a little annoying, like reclining both seats fully in order to fold the stroller, no automatic lock, the slamming fold, etc., but for this price I don't expect everything.  The basket is HUGE and amazing.  It is a little heavy, but no more than several others I've looked at.  I was pretty happy once it was assembled and took it for a short test walk with my daughter. Everything went well.The next day, my daughter had a friend over and I thought I'd try it out with two kids.  We went for a short walk, maybe 1/4 mile at the most, on a pretty smooth bike path.  There were some challenging areas (gravel, mulch) in small patches and the stroller did better than I thought it would on uneven terrain but it was generally REALLY hard to push around with two kids in it - and these kids are both little!  Several of us tried it and it was hard to control, hard to push forward on a flat, smooth surface, and hard to get up and down curbs.We are returning the X2 and are probably going with a valco snap dual.  It's more than twice the price of the X2 but I'll need all the help I can get schlepping three under three around and the X2 isn't going to make my life any easier.
