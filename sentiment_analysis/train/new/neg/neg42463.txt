I have never written a bad review, but here goes.  We took this travel bed along with us on our trip this weekend.  After carefully comparing products, I decided this would be the best travel bed.  My son is a spirited 3 year old, so my only concern was that he may jump on the bed.  He actually was very excited to sleep on it and went to sleep relatively quickly for being in an exciting hotel room!  But soon he started sliding off of the front of the bed.  Every ten minutes or so from about 10PM to 12AM I heard a "thunk" and would get up to slide him back onto the bed.  At 12AM I tried moving him to our bed to sleep between my husband and I, but that didn't work, so we ended up calling for a pack n play from the front desk, germs be darned.  He finally fell asleep in the pack n play at 1:30 AM, and we've been recovering from the sleep crisis ever sense.  I am sending it back.
