We Bought the rocker back in September, since my daughter was born only on December 15 it was closed in the box until last week.The rocker is nice, my daughter spends a lot of time in it during the day and we are happy with it.Unfortunately the toy does not work, we can't return or replace it now because the 3 months already passed. We didn't see a place to content Tiny Love on their website.Its a good product just cross your fingers it will arrived with a working toy.
