I gave this product 3 stars because my twin grandsons are able to put their hand into their cups easily for a snack and also to shake the rest of the snacks out onto the floor. I don't know if other parents / grandparents have had this problem, but I know that the cups are currently not being used due to this problem and I was disappointed that it didn't solve the problem we had before of making a  mess when previously using other snack dishes.The design and quality are good and colorful. I just wished it worked better.Maybe if they re-designed the lid (?)
