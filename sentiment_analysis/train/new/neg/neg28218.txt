I LOVED THIS CAR SEAT untilllll my little one had to put on his winter jacket and can barely fit in the harness. He's 4yrs old and is only 35lbs!!! There's no way he can get in this car seat in another month or two. Why is the harness so short, I just need more leeway to get him in without stuffing him in!
