Great if you have a long baby. I found the "baby holding section" (from head to rump) to be a little too long for a 5 month standard size baby. Also, I have an hourglass figure and the bottom strap keeps riding up onto my low back causing pouching in front where baby sits and slight strain on my low back. Still better on the back than the original Baby Bjorn. The options for baby positioning is great as is the higher weight limit.
