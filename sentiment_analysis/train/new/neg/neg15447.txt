I loved these when I was a child.  The heat from your hand makes the liquid bubble and move up the glass coils.  However, I've ordered twice from two different sellers and both have arrived shattered because they were not properly packaged.  I had to get a refund both times from amazon.  I have now ordered from a different seller and will send them a message or call them to PLEASE package this delicate glass carefully!  If I were to get one that wasn't shattered, it's going to be awesome!!
