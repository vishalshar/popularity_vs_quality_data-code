I basically have the same pros and cons as the rest...bottom line, I would NOT recommend to a friend.PROS - it looks nice, folds up pretty flat and stays standing if you tilt it forward.  I do not have issues getting the tray to sit on the little pegs and the recline is GREAT, we've been using it since our baby was a newborn so she could join us at the dining table.  Also love that the height is adjustable though we don't actually use that feature - we chose a height and there it stays.CONS - Can you say holes?  So - the tray and the tray insert (which is a waste b/c I always have to wash both - guess I have one of those babies that needs to be fed in the bathtub according to previous reviewer) are huge and will not fit in any dishwasher.  We are building a house and purchased everything for it beginning with studs and I looked :) Worse, there are holes in the large tray and I have to avoid getting water in them when washing!  And yes, as the others said - my baby doesn't really even eat that much food (she eats solids 1-2x/day and has for 2 months) and they are GROSS!I bought the Fisher Price Rainforest chair for our beach house which straps to a dining chair and comes with toys.  While it is bright green and slightly obnoxious looking, it is MUCH easier to clean and entertains my 8 month old while I am prepping her food and I would recommend it to a new mom rather than this clean-up disaster.
