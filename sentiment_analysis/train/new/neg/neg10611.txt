We liked this crib enough for our first baby that we bought another for our second.  The kids share a room so we wanted cribs that converted to toddler beds to save space (and $$).  When we installed the toddler rail, there was a 3-4 inch gap between the toddler rail and the bed frame, the perfect space for arms/legs/feet/hands to get stuck.  I contacted Babyletto about it and they said this is normal (even though the photos on their own website do not show this gap).  Aside from being terrible design, this is incredibly unsafe.  Definitely would not buy again.
