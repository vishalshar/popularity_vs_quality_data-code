These bowls are certainly better looking than the majority of infant/toddler bowl sets out there. However, they have not weathered the storm of toddlerhood well in our household. We've had a couple of sets for 2 years now. They are only safe to use in the microwave for 10 second intervals (thanks to whatever material helps weight the bottom of them). The lids on 3 of the 4 bowls we have no longer fit properly making it impossible to get them closed. I have never washed them in the dishwasher - only hand washed - and have never used the lids in the microwave. I've been much happier with the Munchkin Click Lock bowls. They stay shut and don't leak at all.
