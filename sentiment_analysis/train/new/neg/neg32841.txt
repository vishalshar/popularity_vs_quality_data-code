I was very excited to receive this sheet, having had Swaddle Design blankets in the past, I was expecting great things.  This sheet does not look anything like the picture.  The dots are actually a light blue and very pale, disgusting brown.  This does not match the pale blue and yellow colors that are currently in the nursery, or the pale blue and yellow dots that are shown in the picture.  I do not recommend this product if you're liking the colors in the picture.  I'm sure the quality is great, like the other Swaddle Design products that I own, but this product, in particular, is very ugly.
