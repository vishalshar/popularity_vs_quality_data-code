Avoid this product!  We have twins so we purchased one to make life easier while shopping at places that don't have shopping carts for multiples.  While it is a good idea this product comes up way short.  The straps are not quick-attach/quick-release a must for an item that will be used this frequently and while the parents are contending with children at the same time.  Ours RIPPED along the seam right away under the most normal use-case by a dainty 20lb. girl.  The product is supposed to accommodate 45lb. children.  That speaks volumes about the (lack of) quality.  We wrote Buggy Bench about it and the president of the company responded (and quite condescendingly so) that they don't offer warranty because they "do not know how or to what degree it is being used."  She (the president) did offer us a 30% off coupon (if we wrote back) toward the purchase of another Buggy Bench.  Since they do not stand behind the quality of their product we naturally will not be doing that.  Buggy Bench has truly gone out of their way to earn this bad review.
