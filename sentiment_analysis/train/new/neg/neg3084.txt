I was really excited to give this to my daughter for her 1st birthday. When i received it, the star that attached to the zipper was broken off. And the overall quality of the product was less than i expected it to be, so I got a refund. Will not order again. I would only say get it if it is on sale, other than that your 20 bucks is better off used for something else in my opinion.
