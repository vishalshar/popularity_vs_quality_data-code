Reading through the reviews, I have a feeling most people posted right or shortly after installing the kick mats in their cars. Not enough time to really give them a test run. I have two pretty calm four year olds girls and within two weeks these mats were hanging in shreds. I can't figure out why because the girls were belted in during our car rides. Possibly from the kicking against them? The thin nylon shredded right away from the binding and left the binding still secured around the driver and passenger seats, with the backing laying on the car floor. (The posted photo is when they were only halfway destroyed) I'm so disappointed, this is one of the lowest-quality excuses of a product I've ever purchased. Definitely won't buy anything in this brand again.
