These weren't great.  Maybe I am abnormally shaped but I found that if I put these on right after pumping, when it was most painful to simply put a bra on, they almost suctioned to my breast.  Instead of soothing, they made my nipples and the area that fits into the hole, swell uncomfortably.  Even when I wasn't leaking into them, there was a condensation that kept my nipples wet so that as soon as I took the cups off I was faced with the same issues that I would have if I'd not used them at all after pumping. My daughter was preemie and never latched so I exclusively pumped for her and was just really sad that these cups did not work.
