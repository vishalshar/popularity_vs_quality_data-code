This review is more for the manufacturer not the dealer. The bunny is cute and soft. We were trying to find a replacement for the old skip which was apparently discontinued?! We tried this but none of the new bunnies by the bay have rattles inside and my son could clearly tell. Really disappointed that they have changed the items so much but this is still a great gift for baby
