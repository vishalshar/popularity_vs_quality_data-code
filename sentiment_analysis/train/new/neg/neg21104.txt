This is OK. If I felt like it or iPad time I probably could have come up with something similar on my own. When I put the cover flush against the Xbox the babies could still press the buttons through it. I made it stick about half an inch to and inch further out and that seems for now to stop them from pressing the buttons. I think for the price it's fine.
