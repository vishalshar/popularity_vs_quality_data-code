I got this towel for my daughter who was 5 months at the time. I loved this towel at first, it was a great size and thickness, all other baby towels were too thin and short.  Now at 8 months we are still using it.  The only downside is that the towel lost it's softness after many washes.  I use it now to cover the baby after the bath, but I dry her with another softer towel.
