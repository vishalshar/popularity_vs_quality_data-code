At first I loved this bag. The colors and style were very appealing. However I used this bag only a couple of times before the zipper gave out. I never overloaded the bag or pushed it's limits. It was just poorly constructed material and didn't meet up to my expectations in the least. I have had cheap diapers bags from Walmart last longer than this. Long story short, I ended up investing in a Petunia Pickle bag instead. Disappointed doesn't even begin to cut it. Save your money.
