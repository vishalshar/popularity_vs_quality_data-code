I am really disappointed with this purchase especially after reading all of the positive reviews here. They have an awful plastic smell (smells like the plastic used for a flotation device). When I wash it with other laundry, it makes other garments smell like plastic too. If you are going to buy this product, I highly suggest you wash it several times separately before washing it with other laundry. You wouldn't want your baby breathing this awful plastic stench from her cloths, burp cloths, etc.
