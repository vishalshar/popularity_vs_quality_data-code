What I like about the Britax Travel Bag is that it can fit the base and car seat together. The fabric is nice and thick so it should last a long time. The backpack straps are great for carrying the car set on your back. The base was digging into my back though. I understand not all car seats are made the same so I won't hold that against Britax.What I dislike about the bag is that you have to be two feet tall in order to tip the bag low enough so that it rides on the wheels. I'm 5'10" and had to almost lean to one side so the front of the bag doesn't drag on the ground. Another issue of the bag is that it sways from side to side when rolling on the wheels. Walk fast enough and the bag will roll over. Does QA not get involved during the design and testing phase at Britax?
