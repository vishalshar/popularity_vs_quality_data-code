Ok, the penguin is adorable.  But that's about as far as I go with liking it.  The idea is awesome, but the follow through is not great.  First, the suction cups don't actually hold.  I had read reviews stating this, so I followed the instructions to a 'T'.  I left the suction cups on the wall overnight.  The base plate didn't fall.  I then put the empty penguin on the baseplate and left it overnight.  All was good.  Then I filled it (only 1/2 way because of my low expectations) and left it up overnight.  The next morning there was a poor dead penguin laying in the tub with soap all over the place.  Glad I filled it up only 1/2 way.  We moved on to the permanent sticky stuff and he is now hanging in our tub... permanently.On to the soap dispensing quality - terrible.  The first couple of days it foamed up quite nicely and i thought it was way cool!  But it seems as though the soap nozzle gets clogged easily and after 3 days I get 'soap spit' without foam.  I've cleaned it and it works again for a couple of days and then back to spit/slime.Such a disappointment!  I so wanted this thing to work.
