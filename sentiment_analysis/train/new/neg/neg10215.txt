This was a baby gift, I am 9 months pregnant. It is not what I wanted and have been trying to return it. The seller has not responded to my emails or returns for a week. I placed a claim through Amazon and nothing has happened with that either- I have just been told to wait to receive an email from the investigators. I could go into labor any day now and this product I am returning is the baby car seat package and stroller. This I have been trying to get this all handled this week. I have spoken to two amazon representatives of Amazon chat, I have spoken to three Amazon representatives over the phone, all this week and no one has been able to suggest any help other than to wait 1-2 weeks for an Amazon claim and to wait for the seller to respond. This is a nightmare, given the cost of the item and that it was gifted for an unborn baby, yet there is no customer service from the seller or Amazon to help with this. The product was not the item we wanted and it was not what we expected from the reviews and product information we read on it after receiving it. The wheels do not work and turn well, they are very small. The colors of the seat are very light and that is not what I wanted, they will get dirty so quickly given where we live by the beach in Santa Monica and our lifestyle. I am disappointed in the product and more than that, the customer service I have received. Thus I rate this item as very poor and I do not recommend buying from this seller. -Disappointed Mother-To-Be
