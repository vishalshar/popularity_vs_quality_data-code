These chairs were easy to assemble and feel very durable compared to some others we bought for our in-laws. However, my 3-year-olds found them very uncomfortable on our 7-hour trip to New York. The seat has little to no cushioning, so their bottoms got sore after a while and they kept shifting in their chairs. Also, if I could find a booster with back that also reclines, that would be good. These sit so straight up, it was impossible for them to sleep.
