We have a very active, squirmy 1 year old and I bought these after a few weeks of having a bath mat, hoping that they would de-slip our tub without collecting bacteria.  Unfortunately, they didn't come with any recommendations on best placement, or ways to ensure they stay in place. (They literally came in a plastic bag with no information about them whatsoever)Five is definitely not enough and more than one package is needed. Plus, only three out of the five have actually stuck. The other two had to be removed because they slide around so much during bath time, it's too dangerous to risk our little one slipping.Perhaps if we had grouped them differently and had they all remained in place I would see the benefit of this particular item and be willing to purchase additional packages. Instead I have to look for something new...if you do get them, I hope you have better luck!
