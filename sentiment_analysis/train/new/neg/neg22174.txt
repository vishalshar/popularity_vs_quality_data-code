I bought these for our BornFree 5 oz glass bottles, and they fit perfectly.  Overall they work pretty well.  They cover most of the bottle (the bottom is covered around the edge, but not at all in the middle).  They're tricky to get on -- but once you get the hang of the technique (there are step-by-step pictures on the tag), it gets easier.  I had hoped that I could put these on the bottles and then just leave them on all the time, but water easily gets between the skin and the bottle, so you have to take them off for washing, to let everything dry out.  If I had to do it over again, given how much I spent on the bottle plus the skin, I would probably have just bought the kind of bottle that has the silicone fused to the outside (like a permanent skin).
