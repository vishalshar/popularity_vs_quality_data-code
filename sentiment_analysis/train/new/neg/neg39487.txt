So we ordered this "doll" for our 1 month old daughter. We were hopeing if we slept with it we could then give it to her in her crib to make the transition from co-sleeping easier on her since it would have our scent on it. Anyways, I got it in the mail yesterday and while it is very soft and super cute it is soooooo tiny! we were expecting a bigger lovie that she could keep through the toddler years and this thing is so small I am doubting she will even use it. I am still going to try it since its already here but I have also already ordered another bigger sized lovie that I am sure will be what we wanted and she will be able to keep it longer. This doll in my opinion was not worht the $12 I spent on it. I wish I had done ore research on it. Oh and it is about the size of my hand, I am a regular 27 yr old woman, not tiny not large, just average, so think of this when you are considering this as a purchase. I gave it 2 stars because I dont like it, but I def. dont hate it.
