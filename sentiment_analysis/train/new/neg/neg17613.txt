We use the Inglesina chair for our regular high chair and when we go out places. I thought these placemats would be great. They are not easy to stick down, they don't lay perfectly flat, and you have to stick them down before attaching the chair to a table. Once my son watches me stick the mat down, he immediately rips it off of the table with ease. I just don't use them at all anymore. Maybe when he is older and won't be quick to rip them off (he is 8 months old). The other issue is that the picture shown is not what was sent - what was sent is an image of Sesame Street with some of the characters. Not a huge deal, but I was looking for a placemat that wasn't as busy as the ones we sent. I would have really preferred the bold colors and shapes of the ones pictured for this product.
