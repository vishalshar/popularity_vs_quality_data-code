With a $250 price tag, one would think that they chair would have a bit more quality control. The leg had a bubble in the clear coat and an uneven finish of paint that was sprayed. There is a a noticeable difference in color. Also, the screws are too long for the horizontal cross bars. So, when you put the screws through the wood and then tighten them into the horizontal bars, there is a gap between the wood and the bar. This leads to a bit of a wobble/flex. I contacted the seller and was told that this is how it was designed and that all their display models have the gap. But, this is no where documented in their assembly instructions. So what this led to was over tightening on my end - I mean - TIGHTENING with the little allen wrench. But still, the bar doesn't actually connect which led to me disassembling and reassembling 3 times, thinking I did something wrong or tightened screwed in the wrong order (they're numbered on the instruction guide for the order to tighten).Further, there is some concern about the overall stability of this chair. It would seem that a child that were to push backwards would easily tip. It is necessary to put these little plastic booties that they provide onto the bottom of the chair to prevent the chair from tipping.For me, there is just too many initial 'issues' for the price that was paid. I would say this is a weak attempt to be an Ikea lookalike with poor quality control and even poorer instructions. Definitely seems to be a style before substance type of setup.Finally, looks can be deceiving -- this chair is surprisingly tiny. It looks very awkward next to our kitchen table. The pictures posted with the product must have the people sitting next to a deceptively small table. Be sure to look at the measurements and measure compared with your table. Even with the 'seat' at the highest notch, I'm not sure our 2.5 yr old would even be able to eat with her elbows on the table.I'd recommend you find a different solution.
