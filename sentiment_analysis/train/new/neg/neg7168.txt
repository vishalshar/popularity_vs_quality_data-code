I LOVE this booster seat. It was exactly what we were looking for to replace the bigger space-saver high chair we were using. It's easy to transport and super easy to clean (except for the pesky glue residue from the sticker). Why the 3 stars? On our 2nd trip out with this seat, we got home only to realize that we had lost one of the side straps from the 3-point harness. Why would it come out so easily? There isn't currently a replacement available on the FP site for these straps, so we've had to suffice with only one leg buckled in. It's too bad, since I really do like this chair. Live and learn: always buckle the straps when not in use.
