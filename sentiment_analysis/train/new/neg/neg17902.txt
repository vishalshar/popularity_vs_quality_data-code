We had a smaller cheaper one, I think we paid $40 for but left it somewhere so we oprdered this as a replacement realizing we needed a bigger oen anyway for our growing 6 month old.  This really is not that easy to get baby in, it is definitely a 2 person job.  Baby also does nto seem to like it and my husband, who wears it mostly, hates it.  Would not buy again.  You can find a better one for less money.  We would not purchase this again.
