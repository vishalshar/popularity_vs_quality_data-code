We actually got The First Years rack as well as the Munchkin drying racks, and neither was very useful.This Munchkin Drying Rack holds lots of "snap out" pieces that fit in the Medela bottle lids (to close off breast milk after you pump), but little else. The bottle holders are kind of nice 4-8" tall stalks you can put the bottle on, but the stalks aren't much use for nipples. We don't use the lids with the snap out pieces, so it was pretty useless for us. It might be more helpful for those who use Tri-Flow bottles, since they are also made by Munchkin.Another popular option, the First Years Rack, holds most bottles/accessories in the front, but didn't hold them very well in some cases. Dr. Brown's bottles didn't fit well at all. The back area holds a scrubbing brush (which we liked - keeps it vertical and dry), but wasn't very good at holding nipples or bottle lids (from Playtex Naturalatch Bottles, in this case). My wife took one look, tried to place a part or two and sent me back with it.The best rack we have found is from Prince Lionheart:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00018XCJC/qid=1124937150/sr=8-6/ref=pd_bbs_6/002-3590167-9987266?v=glance&s=baby&n=507846It holds 8 bottles as well as other accessories on those same "projections"... it has places to dry the miscellaneous little parts of a breast pump and can fit the breast pump shields with no problem. A side by side comparison of the three racks makes it no comparison!
