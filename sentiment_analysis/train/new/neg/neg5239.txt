My son is 7 months and has difficulty using this right now because all 4 of his front top teeth are coming in at the same time.  They are sore to begin with, so the hard spout is too hard for him right now.  Maybe after the teeth settle into place?The spout is not hard plastic - it is silicone-like, but very stiff.The handle has a nice feature - it settles onto notches so it cannot be twisted.  The baby cannot dislodge the cap by twisting the handles.It's cute - I fell for the pooh logos.
