This thing makes me think that man never reached the moon.With all the intelligence in the world, why can't anyone come up with a good design for a formula dispenser?Please read my review on the Zo-Li dispenser as well to see what I mean.I bought this based on other people's reviews and thank god it's only $6, as it has a lot of flaws but it gets the job done - you just always have to be careful and wide awake when using it.Here are my gripes:1) The plastic it is made of is really hard and whenever I open the spout or the lid, I am this close to getting slivered.2) Formula definitely can transfer into other compartments when moved around in diaper bag as there is a gap between the lid and the dividing walls. Imagine workstation vs enclosed office.3) When you are half asleep as most moms are, and you accidentally have .001 of an inch of the spout open into the other compartment when pouring, the contents of the other compartment goes pouring in as well4) It is really hard to open the lid, which is not good because of problem no. 1 above. I am not kidding, my thumb is getting tiny blisters from opening the lid of the spout.5) The spout is round but the bins are pie shaped - and we learn this from kindergarten when we play with sorting cubes - triangles don't go in circles. Therefore, formula gets caught in the corners and it takes a lot of wiggling before everything goes out.The only thing I like about it is that I have been able to handle it with one hand and am still using it until I find something better - and it's not the Zo-Li.
