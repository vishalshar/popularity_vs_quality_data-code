This was purchased when our baby girl was 3 weeks old, it would soothe her and sometimes she'd fall asleep in it. The toy bar was too close and the lion toy to heavy to be in the middle, so we never really used the bar.The main problem with this chair is the vibrator box, it slides in at the bottom to one of the bars, right below where the baby's feet end up. As the baby gets heavier and moves her feet around, the box ends up sliding down and the vibration is no longer as effective. Sometimes, it falls out completely.The frame of the chair is solid enough that the seat stays put together, but as the baby gets heavier the 'chair' part tends to sink in, the more the baby sinks in the less she can use her hands to play.For the 3 months it lasted, it did a great job but I wish it had lasted longer. I regret not spending more on a quality chair...since now I have to purchase another one that hopefully she'll soon love.
