These were okay for the price. My local Party City didn't have any number balloons except the number 3, which was not helpful for my 10 year high school reunion. I ordered these online and had them filled at Party City. Quick transaction and I got them filled at my local party store.What could have been better:We weren't able to secure these to the wall with tape (weren't allowed to tape anything at our venue), so we were pretty reliant on string and weights (also purchased at Party City). Because these only had one place where they could be tied, the numbers spun around a lot, making it hard to tell what they said. This would have been better if there were two ties on either end of the base.
