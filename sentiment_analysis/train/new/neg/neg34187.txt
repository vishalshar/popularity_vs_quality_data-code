My daughter was 9 months old when I purchased this and 27" tall. It's a decent construction and extremely cute, but on the lowest setting, her legs would not reach the floor.  It was off about 1.5". She's not a short baby, and she's starting to want to walk. By the time she grows into the walker, she will already be cruising around by herself.  Unfortunately, we had to return it.
