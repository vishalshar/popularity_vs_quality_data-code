These things will damage your cabinets when you try to remove them.They are great when you are using them - but if you ever plan on moving, or you don't want to refinish your cabinets once your children are older, do not put these on your cabinets. I had cherry wood cabinets, and when we were ready to move i tried to get these off. It took hours and in the end, the finish on the wood was either ripped off, or it got scratched from us trying to remove them. I thought they would pull off kind of like the command strips for hanging pictures/little hooks, but they are not designed that way. There is no way to get to that sticky foam backing to pull it down.I called Munchkin customer service (the girl was very sweet - but they didn't provide any useful info). They told me to hold a hair dryer on it to dry out the sticky substance in the foam backing. This was all the advice they had and it was useless - the air blowing from the hair dryer had no chance of contacting the foam backing because it was completely covered in plastic.
