This product looks great, feels sturdy, will grow with baby to toddler & beyond as storage, but takes a couple hrs to put together. Also we noticed a strong odor at first for the black color.There are 2 big disappointments:1. The size of the cubbies- they don't fit any cube fabric organizers or drawers. The cubbies go deep & tall but need narrow baskets- think rectangles & not squares. I'm sure we'll find something to fit it eventually.2. The puny changing pad makes you want to buy a contoured pad that won't end up fitting the top, so don't waste your money. I guess one could just not install the top pieces, but that's what adds the flair. (The pad size from assembly manual states it is 78 cm x 38 cm x 2.5 cm.)We also purchased the Beatrice 4-drawer dresser to match but haven't put it together yet. Lesson learned: Pay attention to measurements!
