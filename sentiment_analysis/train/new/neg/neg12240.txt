I bought this thinking that it was the best sling in the market.  From the moment I tried to use it, I could not get it right.  I tried the different ways that it suggested but it was alwas very uncomfortable.  I tried putting the baby inside of it and he always looked to be in a very awkward position.  One half of his body was twisted one way and the other half was twisted the opposite way.  I just feel bad that I was unable to return it.  It was a complete waste of time and money.
