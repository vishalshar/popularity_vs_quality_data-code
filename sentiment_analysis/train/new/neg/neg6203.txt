If I'd written this review when we first bought these (we got the two pack) it would have been a five star. If my husband were writing it, it would be a one star right now. I'm compromising. The pros: Super easy to inflate (and deflate if necessary), flocking on the bottom that makes it cling to the sheet or mattress pad and not move around, great for traveling (easy to pack and includes a cute travel bag), and an end to the totally annoying and ugly bed rails that clamp to the side of the bed, wreck the furniture finish, and make your bedroom look like a medical facility. Yay! Cons: the seams split with regular use. My child is all of 30 pounds, and she's not jumping on them. She occasionally 'rolls' over them on her way out of bed in the morning. We went through four in less than a year (the 'patch kit' is worthless) before just rolling up towels and putting them under the fitted sheet. Eventually, we bought three pool noodles, strapped them together, and got the same effect with a LOT more staying power for pennies on the dollar. I understand and share my husband's frustration about throwing away money; but I do think they would be great for travel as opposed to everyday use, so I'm being generous.
