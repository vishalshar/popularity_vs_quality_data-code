If you are used to the sizing of the old made in USA and China FuzziBunz, then the new "Made in Turkey" FuzziBunz will be an unpleasant surprise. My experience only applies to the large perfect size. The new ones are at least two inches taller in rise in the back and much wider. My 24 month daughter (30 pounds, 35 inches) went from a trim fit in the larges made in China (on the second snaps in) to a bulky fit on the tightest setting on the new ones. All the extra material bunches between her legs and the diaper hangs off of her butt. The fleece is soft but more textured (I prefer the old ones better) and the leg elastic is less trim. Overall, I am not pleased at all with the changes and will be trying different brands with my second daughter due soon. Maybe if I'm still potting-training a year or 18 months from now, these will fit, but it's hard to imagine my daughter's already rotund belly getting much wider by then, and from what I understand, all sizes have this much higher rise and wider waist, so I'm doubtful the mediums would work. For now I use them only for overnight because they don't fit under clothes. It's a shame because I was a very much a FuzziBunz devotee. They have great customer service (they have replaced 5 of my diapers, several of which were out of warranty), but if I don't like the product any more, that doesn't help me much.
