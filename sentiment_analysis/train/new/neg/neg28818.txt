I bought these for my newborn daughter because she has torticollis & at first I thought they were OK but found these didn't stay in place.  I heard my daughters crying, which isn't abnormal,  but when I went to get her out of the car these had popped up from behind her head & were in her face. In my opinion not very useful or safe for a child that likes to move around.
