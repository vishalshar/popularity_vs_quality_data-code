Purchased this for our 2 month (now 3 month old). She certainly enjoys the music and the floating plushies on the moving bars. If your baby moves around a lot, you will want to use this with the music turned off because if they are too close to the bars, the motor stalls... and I'm sure that will reduce the life of the toy. Our daughter finds the toys interesting and likes to pull on them when she can get a good grip, this causes the motor to stall... so we don't often use the music and motion.This toy would be much better if we were able to play the music independent of the motion and vice versa. There's no way to use one without the other.
