I bought this seat for my three year old. My one year old is ready to move out of his current car seat. Therefore, my youngest is getting my oldest's hand me down Britax Boulevard. I can't help but compare the two. This car seat requires some assembly. My previous, Britax Boulevard, arrived ready to go into the car. The shoulder harness straps do have to be rethreaded as the child grows. I loved the color scheme, but I purchased this for my 3 year old and he has already outgrown the removable comfort padding (most of the orange shown in pic). Without the comfort padding, it feels pretty hard on the seat area. Does anyone make a cushy car seat??? I do agree with others, the crotch harness area is pretty tight. I do wish that I bought another Britax (even with the major price difference). It was a big hassle assembling this car seat. Others have brushed off the buckle issue. The big deal with the buckle is that it is unreasonably hard to unbuckle. Which is normally not a big deal in case of an accident. Unless, seconds mean the difference between life and death should your car catch on fire. That's the case for one of the lawsuits against the company.
