This product is the worst baby monitor that my wife and I could have ever imagined being accepted for any kind of production. 1st one we purchased didn't have working night vision, so we had to return it the first day we had it for a replacement. Everything appeared to be working OK until we started noticing that every once in a while the monitor's sound would out of nowhere shut off: REPEAT - THE SOUND WOULD RANDOMLY SHUT OFF! One morning this had happened and we woke to see the poor baby screaming for who knows how long, eyes were puffy from rubbing against the sheet, so we obviously felt awful. It took everything in me to not take this dreadful device and smash it against the curb and place with the trash. There were other issues with getting the thing to charge properly, which are minor in contrast to the sound shutting off on something that's designed for monitoing with sound. Most people use these during the night for when we're sleeping. HARD TO MONITOR THE SCREEN WHEN WE'RE SLEEPING. Sony absolutely dropped the ball with this garbage excuse for a "baby monitor", and we sleep much better now after switching to a different brand. STAY VERY FAR AWAY FROM THIS, UNLESS YOU WANT TO MONITOR MORE SELF SUFFICIENT ENTITIES, LIKE PERHAPS A LITTER OF KITTENS.... Seriously though its not for baby :(
