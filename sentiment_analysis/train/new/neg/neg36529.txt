When I got the package I was so excited to receive it.  it true to the picture...It took about a week to get here.  As soon as I opened it up it smelled like burnt plastic... Thankfully the smell washed away... But after getting it out of the wash and dryer (which I did follow washing instruction) it doesn't look like it's going to hold up very well... The set was missing a wall decoration but I emailed them and they promptly are sending it out.  I wasn't expecting much cause it was only $85...
