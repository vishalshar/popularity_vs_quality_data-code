I was really excited about this and it truly could have been a winner...I purchased this item for my 8 month old daughter and was extremely dissapointed with the crafstmanship.  It was packaged nicely so I did not suspect there would be problems...every piece was individually wrapped so to protect all of the wooden parts.  After unwrapping each piece I was shocked to find severe scratching to one entire side panel of the exterior side of the chair (where you can't just hide it).  I was equally dissapointed that on that same side the piece was not shaped correctly.  There were large gaps where the wood pieces should have fit flush together.  This was on the same side panel and was pre-made, so I could not undo it and fix myself.  I am extremely unhappy with this product...I would not go to a furniture store and say to myself "that is the one I want right there"  all banged up and misshapen.  I can't believe that this company does not have better quality assurance measures in place.  Whomever wrapped this bad boy clearly needs glasses.Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Mahogany
