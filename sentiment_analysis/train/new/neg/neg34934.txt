NOT SOFT AT ALL!!! Perhaps other sellers are more scrupulous than BabyHaven from whom I bought this hard-as-rock faucet cover. I bumped it against my head to make sure & it hurt!!! Can't imagine how much it'll hurt the little ones!! Tried to return but they said there's nothing wrong with it. If they meant soft plastic as in smooth, then yeah. Nothing's wrong with it but that's not what I was looking for when I bought it. Never buying non-Prime items ever again thanks to this crappy seller. I do NOT recommend!!!!
