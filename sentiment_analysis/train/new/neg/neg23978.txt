i have to say.  not my baby's favorite toy.  it was the first toy we got, but not the favorite.  i also do not like the way that they put this huge label right across the stomach of the tiger that says LAMAZE.  it is tacky.  i hate it.  i would take it off with a seam ripper if i didnt know it was going to leave a huge ugly spot on the front of the tiger. But seriously.  if you feel the need people, then stick your label on an ear. or a tag.  not right on the front of the toy in huge lettering so that the first thing anyone who looks at it sees is LAMAZE.  so tacky!  makes me not want to buy any more of their products.
