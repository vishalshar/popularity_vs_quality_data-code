After reading such positive reviews, I was excited about this purchase. Therefore, I must do my part and warn others that this thing couldn't be made with less regard for quality or efficiency.The main issues:1) Just moving it around the house causes the frame to come apart.2) Similarly, the curved bar that sits above the baby and holds the objects also falls off when just touching it. Granted, the bouncer is not meant to be picked up by the bar with the baby in it, but when moving it around - with the baby in your other arm - it would be nice if it stayed connected.3) The pad that the baby sits on moves all around. We have to constantly realign it to get him comfortable. And, the safety strap is also poorly made. Its difficult to adjust as it backs up into the padding. It also runs high, securing part of his chest, which isn't necessary and interferes with his arm movement.Bottom Line: Although these things are all around the same price, if you got to examine this one in a store, you'd surely choose another.UPDATE: In response to Virginia33's comment:Forgive Virgina33 for not being the brightest bulb on the tree. Where did I say it was meant for "carrying baby?" What I said was ..... Please pay attention now Virginia ...... "when moving it around - with the baby in your other arm - it would be nice if it stayed connected." Other bouncers do. This one, perhaps because they market to the Virginia's of the world, snaps off at the slightest hint of pressure.
