Beware: The product description said this bedding set is 55% cotton / 45% polyester.  That is not true.  It is 100% polyester.  Even the packaging says it's 100% polyester.  Why Amazon or the seller would falsely advertise it to be something else is troubling.Other than that, this is a cute set.  The comforter is very soft to the touch.  Like most other toddler bedding sets, the comforter is thin.  This is the norm.  Expect to add a heavier blanket on cooler nights.
