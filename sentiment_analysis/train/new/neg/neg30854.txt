Don't waste your money on this. It worked for the first two months, but when my son reached 12lbs it stopped swinging, which is the whole reason why we bout this. The instructions say max weight is 25lbs. I went to the Graco website and many other people had the same complaint that it stopped working when their child hit around 12 pounds. I think that if the company can see that many MANY people are complaining about it not working, they need to change the weight requirement.
