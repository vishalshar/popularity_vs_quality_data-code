This pillow did not work well for my kids (4 and 6). I was hoping it would help their heads stay more upright while sleeping in the car. Unfortunately, they're unable to position it so that it can be helpful for them at all. Also, the design is flawed since the cover also functions as the attachment for the seatbelt - it's awkward to position on the seatbelt because the pillow wants to fall out when the velcro is undone. I waited to long to be able to send them back so they've already found the way to the garbage. I was very disappointed.
