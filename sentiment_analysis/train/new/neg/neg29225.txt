I purchased this booster seat for my daughter who was about to turn two to use as a second booster seat for the kitchen table (we have a OXO Tot Booster in the dining room).  First of all, I am judging this product by how well it meets our needs.  We wanted a booster seat to (1) boost my daughter so she could sit in a regular chair and eat at the table with us and (2) keep her in her chair at mealtimes.  Well, this booster gives enough of a lift, so it meets the first need.  However, it fails miserably with respect to the second need.  Within literally 1 day of use, she was able to easily undo the buckle herself and pop out of the chair.  It is a very easy center press button buckle, and not challenging at all for a toddler to handle opening herself.  Not only is it easy for her to unbuckle, but once she is unbuckled, because of the form factor of the booster (no high back and sides) it makes it super easy for her to swivel her bum all around on the booster so in 2 seconds she goes from buckled in, facing forward, to unbuckled and sitting sideways with her legs swinging off the side, or even worse, completely turned around backwards because she is a wiggle monkey!  This booster seat does not meet our needs.  I am going to buy another OXO Tot Booster and give this chair away!
