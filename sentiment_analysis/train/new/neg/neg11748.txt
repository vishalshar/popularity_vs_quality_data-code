These were terrible. I thought they were super cute but I make and sell baby accessories and 9 out of 10 of these worked the first five times I opened them and then they just sort of went limp. Which is unfortunate because I sold several to people before realizing that they break down very quickly. Not worth it. Go with the metal ones.
