I bought two 5 packs.  I chose the green and the yellow version.  They really are pretty cute bibs, however when I got them I realized they were a little small for my 5 month old.  Then I washed them and they shrank.  I did not try to put it back on my child because I didn't want to choke her.  I think that it would have been nice to know that someone would have suggested an age range for this product.  I rated it 3 stars because I liked the bibs, but the bibs were small and then shrank.  I would return them, but it isn't worth it for me to do so.  I will be giving this item to Goodwill and hope that someone else will be able to use them.  I would not suggest this product unless it was for a child of 0-3 months of age.
