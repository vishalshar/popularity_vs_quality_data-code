So, the point of a sleep sack is to keep you baby warm but not have the suffocation hazard of loose blankets. The neck opening on this is so large that the front can easily come up and cover the nose/mouth. This makes it no safer than a blanket, thus defeating the entire point of a sleep sack. My son is 8 months in the size medium. His head circumference is in the 77th percentile, so it's not like he's got an abnormally small head.I'm unhappy considering the price and how well reviewed this is. Well, that and the danger it poses to babies. I've added photos to show what I'm talking about.I will say that it is warm, easy to get on, and seems to be made well otherwise.What I would recommend instead is the Grobag. The material is nicer, it's just as thick and warm, and the neck opening is small enough that he was able to use the 0-6 month size at a week old, and still uses it now. He is tall for his age and still has length in the 0-6m size too, so it's long lasting. We use it most of the time now that it's winter.
