We recieved this item today (had to order two because our daughter's queen size bed is not up against a wall).  They ended up sending two different models, even though we ordered two of the same model.  So that was a bummer...and they looked slightly different too.  Then when my husband installed them, they just barely reach over the top of the mattress.  The description states that they will fit a queen size bed and the length is OK, but these rails DO NOT work for deeper mattresses.  It's not going to keep our daughter from falling out of the bed.  Now we're back to square one again.
