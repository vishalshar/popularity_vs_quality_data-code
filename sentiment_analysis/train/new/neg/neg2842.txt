As another reviewer stated, I want to love this toy so badly, but don't.  It is great conceptually, but falls short when it comes to quality and usability.  The roller coaster ramps not only fall off easily, they are absolutely impossible to put on.  By the time I get one on, three others have popped off.  I am not sure that I have ever had all of them attached at the same time.  What frustrates me the most is that when my kids try to play with the dome, they never feel successful b/c it falls apart and makes it completely unusable.  They move on quickly, now never showing interest in playing with this toy b/c it is so frustrating to them.  It really makes me wonder how this product ever made it through a test phase.  Not only does it not stand up to play by kids, it can't even be put together in the first place by an adult.  Watching the video on the International Playthings website about how to fold it up amazes me.  They must have shot that video 50 times before it happened that easily!  I really think that this could be an awesome product, but they need some serious work on quality of construction.  My kids did enjoy the other aspects of the toy, especially the peek-a-boo aspect of it.  However, as another reviewer put it, a regular play tent serves the same purpose and can easily be taken down, rolled up, and easily stored on a small shelf!  Sorry International Playthings, but this was a big disappointment!
