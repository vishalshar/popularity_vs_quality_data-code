nice set!the star of this basket is the lettuce, with it's 4 detachable leafs.my 6 months old loves to chew on them. they really look good and realistic.the big disappointment is that 14 piece set means... not 14 veggies, but1 basket2 tomatoes2 mushrooms1 lettuce with 4 lettuce leafs1 bunch of carrots1 green onion,1garlic1 veggie that looks like a cucumber but is something else :)overall it is ok. hope this will survive to the time we will play pretend games :)) (not so sure)
