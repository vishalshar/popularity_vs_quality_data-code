I was excited about the price and how many items came with this, however this is one of those that you get what you pay for.  I bought my first son a CoColo set and thought I was getting a great deal with this one.  The bedding is very thin, the pillows look cheap and just all around looks like a bargain basement product.  If your looking for quick and easy this will work, but if you want looks and quality, spend the extra money!
