I thought I would save space with this chair... and it sucks. The concept is good, but it is poor execution. Here we go:- The chair is hard to clean. The fabric makes is more difficult than necessary.- My son can chew on the straps as they strap over his shoulders, which gets them more messy. And they are impossible to clean.- The tray is huge for my little guy. How is he ever going to reach his sippy cup in the corner?- Because the tray is so large, it is harder to clean and put in the dishwasher.- It is ugly.- It is flimsy and cheap looking. If I take the tray off and my son leans forward, the headrest comes off. Ugh.So, I bout the blue and green Fisher Price chair for $30. Works like a dream and all the complaints above are not an issue with that chair. Highly recommend it instead.
