I love the look of the rug.  My son thinks it's great it really ties in with everything we've got going so far but since the day I bought it, it smells.  Like a cross between burnt rubber and cat pee.  I've tried washing it.  I've treated it with febreeze.  i dont' know if it's due to a treatment on the backing of the rug or if something contaminated it.  For the life of me I can't get rid of it.
