First of all I ordered this as a surprise gift for my wife.  She loved the pattern and colors of the bedding and the mobile so I thought I would give it a try.  Thankfully Amazon has been great in taking care of my situation, because I am now awaiting the 3rd mobile of the week.  The first one I received was missing an extension rod to place the mobile at the correct height and was also missing the music box.  The 2nd one I recieved 2 days later after help from Amazon,  had all the pieces but the music box had stripped screws on the back of it and after my wife cranked it to hear the music the crank stripped out and would rewind.  Again Amazon was called and they are shipping a 3rd and final one. If this doesn't work I'm returning for a refund and looking elsewhere for a better quality product.
