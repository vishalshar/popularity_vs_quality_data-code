Pros:These bottles are prettyDrop In's make bottle cleaning a lot faster and more convenientCons:If you are heating up milk in the bottle (i.e. in a bottle warmer) the steam gets between the bottle where it bends. This was annoying because I even though the milk would be the right temperature, I had to wait until the bottle, and the water that got between the two plastic pieces of the bottle, to cool before I could feed my baby. Otherwise, the hot steamy water would leak down and potentially burn the baby's face while feeding. For this reason, I would way prefer the Playtex Drop In bottles that don't bend. Just the original style.
