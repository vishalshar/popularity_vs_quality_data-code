I had purchased the white version of this sprayer back in 2009. At the time it came with a light transparent tubing instead of the new metal replacement. The previous version was flexible and practical. Unfortunately this is no longer the case with this new version which is stiff, cumbersome, and too heavy for the plastic mounting bracket.
