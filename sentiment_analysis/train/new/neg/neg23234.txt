My son loves the shape of the nipple on this bottle. Then a major problem arose...I use a Munchkin bottle warmer , lately,every time I use it junk from the bottle warmer is finding it's way inside my sons bottle , and it has begun leaking as well.  The junk that was finding its way inside his bottle was pieces of rusty metal from the metal plate inside the burner. I screw the bottle on tight , really tight, but still stuff manages to get through, and it leaks. No good. When my son is impatiently crying for a bottle these are things I'd rather not worry about.Do not recommend.
