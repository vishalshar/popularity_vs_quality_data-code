These pads worked OK for night use. They were thick enough and stiff enough that I felt they were visible through anything but the heaviest of shirts. Unlike the other cotton pads I tried the backing seemed to prevent them from wicking through to my clothes, but the stiffness never seemed to decrease enough that I wore them away from the house. In addition to the clammy-when-wet feeling which I disliked, the stiffness of the pads meant that often when I unclipped to nurse the pad would sproing out and fall on the floor - not a huge issue when in the bedroom but a problem otherwise. They have been very durable, although I have not washed them as much as the bamboo pads I ended up using as my go-to inserts.
