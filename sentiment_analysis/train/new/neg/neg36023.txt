I really dislike this chair.  I've tried it on and off from when my baby was 7 pounds until 16 pounds and no matter what, it never seems to fit right - no back support at all and seems to force the baby into a slumped, rolled up position.  I guess you could put a towel or something behind the baby's back to try to have the baby sit in the seat better, but seems like the seat should simply come that way.
