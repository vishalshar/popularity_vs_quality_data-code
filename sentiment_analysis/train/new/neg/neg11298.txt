I love this car seat it's soft, aesthetically pleasing and the perfect size...... But my daughter doesn't think so! She hates it and I really wish she liked it! It seems like she is a little too snugged in here and has no room to really move so she hates and screams every time I put here in here but doesn't in the car seat in grandpas car or dad's car. I got this car seat because it had high safety ratings and looked super comfy but I guess not in my daughters eyes. Wish I didn't spend so much and I would've gone with something more roomy
