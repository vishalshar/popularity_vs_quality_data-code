This booster was highly rated by Consumer Reports, so I was shocked to discover the back is not rigid. This booster is also frustrating to use. My granddaughter, age 4, could buckle herself into her old, out-grown carseat. With the booster, she cannot do this, and I can barely do it myself. In additon, the seatbelt does not want to stay in the positioning bracket. I would not purchse this model again.
