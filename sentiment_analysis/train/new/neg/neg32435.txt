My son has started teething and he likes this teether.  We wet the turtle (usually just a leg or two) and he loves to suck and chew on it.  He also likes the wooden ring.The problem is that the velcro keeping the turtle attached to the ring is really weak. If he holds it by the ring, the weight of the turtle will make the velcro separate and the turtle will fall.  It's a nice idea to be able to remove the ring when you throw it in the wash, but it really needs to be stronger.UPDATE:  We now use the ring and turtle as two seperate teether toys.  He LOVES to carry the wooden ring around.  It's the perfect size for him to handle it and get it successfully in his mouth (he is 4.5 months with 2 teeth).  I like that he's not chewing on plastic (or me).  The turtle is still great when made damp with cold water.
