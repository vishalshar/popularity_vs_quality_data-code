When I received this it was way too big for my Delta portable crib.  I washed it hoping it would shrink a bit and it did.  Unfortunately, it already has a tiny rip on the outside of it and while it fits the crib, at the point where the two ends come together, I can't tie them around the bar.  It's too big and causes a gap in the bumper.  I did try to read the very small instructions they provide on amazon and that did help secure the bumper a little better but not as well as I'd prefer. Overall, it fits good enough and I'll make do.  Just hope the rip doesn't get worse.
