The beads are very large. The picture makes it look like they are smaller but they're maybe the size of a quarter. I was also unhappy with the color. It's less of a coral and more of a bright pink coral.  There is nothing wrong with the product. It's good quality. I just expected something a little different from the one picture that is available.
