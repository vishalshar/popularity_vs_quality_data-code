It's ok. The bowl sticks to the surface for 5-10 seconds then you can easily pick it up. Bought it for my toddler so that she doesn't spill her food, and it did not do its job. Tried to get the bottom wet, it lasted a little longer, but still my daughter was able to pick it up and turn it over. Giving 3 stars only because the spoon is wonderful. Very easy to use and my daughter doesn't spill anything from it. Goes straight to her mouth.
