We bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old because we wanted a second "exersaucer" type activity center for her (one for downstairs and outside on the patio, one for upstairs). We thought this would also last longer than her exersaucer once she started crawling and pulling up on things to stand. The walk-around part is GREAT; the problem is the chinsy toys on the activity station doesn't attract or keep her attention. She is entertained by the piano, but a baby can be entertained by ONE ITEM for only so long before getting bored. One toy is a water bag (filled with foam fish and stars) with two "squeek" toys (big buttons in the shape of sea shells that are supposed to squeek when pressed) that I'm assuming are, first of all, supposed to actually squeek, and second of all, probably supposed to do something with the water bag? I can't say for sure because the two squeek buttons do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Then, one of the stations is just a snack tray! So, if you only have THREE toys to come up with/design, you'd think Bright Starts could actually come up with something decent, right? Consequently, my daughter just runs around and around the thing, and we keep her entertained by leashing one of her toys to the chair so she can run around with it in hand and not drop it. Needless to say, she only lasts 5 minutes in this thing at a time before complaining and wanting to come out, where as she will easily last 50 min to 1 HOUR in her exersaucer!!! If you're trying to decide whether to buy this or an exersaucer, trust me, BUY THE EXERSAUCER or a JUMPAROO!!!
