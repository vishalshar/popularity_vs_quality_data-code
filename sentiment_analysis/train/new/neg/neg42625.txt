The potty is sturdy and clearly well built. Im looking forward to toilet training with it. We just received it today so it hasn't been used yet. Three points...1) The box it shipped with was the actual product box, which has holes so you can feel the ridges on the potty lid. Not a very clean way to ship it.2) The munchkin deoderant disk doesn't even come close to fitting in the lid. We're just going to throw it out.3) When I initially ordered the potty, it claimed it came with both the munchkin deoderant disk and a pack of munchkin wipes. Supposedly the potty had a side "pocket" for storing the wipes. This one shipped without the wipes and there isn't even a built in place to store them. When I read the product details now, its clear they changed the product being sold without warning.Overall I'm satisfied with the potty design so we're keeping it. However I'm dissapointed that the product I received is not as advertised.
