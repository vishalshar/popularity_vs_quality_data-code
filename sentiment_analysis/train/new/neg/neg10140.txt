PROS:  Looks nice, color is a little darker than picture (computer/monitor brand differences probably), good materials, straps work well, easy to operate, loosen, tighten, cup holders work well, easy enough to install on the back seat, secure, lighter than most, not as upright as other boosters, my child's head leaned back fairly well and most of the time, padding is adequate, my child didn't complain about being uncomfortable in several hour trips.  I'd be highly satisfied with this booster, if it weren't for...CONS:  None of the top comments mentioned, with the cup holders installed, the booster will not make it through and into the security conveyor.  On way to vacation, had to do the, special side security check.  On way back, uninstalled the cup holders, then booster fits through scanner conveyor.  But then, can you make uninstalling the cup holders way easier please?  Because the seat hooks are the loops, instead of latches, when it's tight, there's no easy way to loosen the strap to bend the piece of metal that locks it, then try to get it over and out of the seat hooks, all without being able to see it.  So I had to get my body on the booster, to give the strap some wiggle room, then pull the security loop forward, as tight as it is already, to be able to take it home with me, this at the car rental drop off center.  It's lighter than most harnessed boosters, but no where near as light as a Graco Affix (yes, not harnessed).  Those are the huge complaints about this booster.If this booster stays permanently in a car, then it's a great affordable purchase.  But because several reviews read mentioned it as a good "travelling" car seat, well, in my perspective, it doesn't meet that criteria very well.
