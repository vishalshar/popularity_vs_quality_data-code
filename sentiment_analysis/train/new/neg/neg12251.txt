I bought this organizer to keep things up off the floor in my van. So far it seems to be working okay. It was a bit difficult to get the straps adjusted properly, the bottom strap is a kind of short, but once I did they seem to be working fine. The material is a really good quality and it has a couple of bigger pockets that fit wipes and bigger items. I like that it has different sized pockets and that some are mesh so you can see inside. I notice on the product page that the length of the bottom strap has been increased since I ordered mine. Thatâ€™s good because that was my only real concern with this organizer.
