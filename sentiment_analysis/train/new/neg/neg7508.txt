I really like these, but my daughter only uses them as chewing toys & I end up taking them away from her after a couple of minutes. She's only 8 months old though, so probably too young for them. I'm afraid she'll chew off a hunk. She likes looking at them when I stick them on the shower wall during her bath though. The pieces don't all fit as snugly as I'd like, and the smaller pieces end up falling off.
