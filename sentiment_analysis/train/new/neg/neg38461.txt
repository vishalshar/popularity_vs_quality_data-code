I bought these in hope of finding a convenient way to dispose of baby's poopy diapers. This is not it. The dispenser constantly jams and I have to carefully untwist each bag out of it. The bags are also VERY strongly scented in this gross baby powder scent. I can hardly stand putting them in diaper bag. The bag dispenser for doggie poop that I have works much better than this one.
