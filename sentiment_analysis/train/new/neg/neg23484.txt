Final review - April 2015I started out giving this product 5 stars. It was fantastic! Well 2 replacement mobiles later, it's down to 2 stars. I really wish it worked (both mobiles just stop working, and there's a horrible clicking sound as it seems to be catching on something. So now I've purchased the precious planet mobile. We'll see if that works better.So buyer beware - something is wrong with this mobile or the lot that amazon has.*************************************************April 2015 - I originally purchased this mobile a couple months ago. It was great until about 2 weeks ago when it started to run more slowly, almost like the batteries were dying. Well, the batteries weren't dying, but the mobile was. Fortunately, it was still w/in the return period with amazon. The new one is great. I've only taken 1 star off because it's a great mobile and I'm hopeful it was a one-time issue. And let's face it - amazon is a great company. They stood behind the issue. Now, if it hadn't been within the return period, I can assure you my rating would reflect that. I will give the product the benefit of the doubt. If this one fails as well, I will update the review!****************************************************I really like this mobile for my daughter's crib. Here's my summary:Wide crib rails: we have the Pali Lucca crib and the rails are wide with a sizable 'lip' all the way around on both the outside of the rail and inside, talk about challenging trying to figure out which mobile would work! This mobile definitively works, even over a fabric teething rail guard. It does not look messy at all. So if you have a wider rail, give this one a try! This was the key factor in our decision to purchase this model.Soothing lights: baby girl loves how the animal faces light up, kind of like floating lanterns. These animal faces do not move in a circle, the move up and down, like floating lanterns. It's very peaceful. There are bees in the center which don't light up and those move in a circle. The light show on the ceiling...meh, kind of a bust, but I didn't buy it for the star light show. The stars are blurry on the ceiling.Music: the music is very sweet. It's not those annoying nursery rhyme, high-pitched tunes I often hear. It has 2 volume settings.Remote control: this is huge, which I didn't think I'd use at all. Now, fortunately/unfortunately, baby girl really likes looking at the mobile. So much so she sometimes doesn't go to sleep as she should - she's busy just checking it out. So when it stops, she cries a bit, I use the remote to play again and then by round 2 she's usually out. So I'm glad she likes it!Base part (which hooks onto crib): I'm not a huge fan of cartoon type stuff. I find it tacky and cheesy. That's my biggest gripe with this mobile. The base part. I've gotten over it but it doesn't really go with the decor of my nursery, again, the rest of the mobile is really sweet!
