I loved that it was affordable and reversible. However, after only a month of use its wheels began to squeek and the reclining back support could no longer stay in an upright position. It's very disappointing that my baby is now limited to just laying flat in his stroller and hearing a squeeking noise every time the stroller is in motion.
