Horrible product. I ordered this to use as a back up power source to pump in  my car if out and about or if I'm somewhere where there is no where private to pump as I am an Exclusive Pumper. I was at an appointment that ran over and was so engorged I was near tears. I pulled out this cord and attempted  to use it for the first time. First I was panicked that the cigarette lighter end was so large/ long I had to nearly jam it in. Then I remembered the port in the back seat. I climbed in back and got set up only to find out the cord didn't work AT ALL!!! I was furious. I drove home 35 minutes away in tears of pain. RETURNING THIS TOMORROW!!
