Doesn't cover cart after washing so baby can still touch (or get mouth on!) the icky handles and sides of cart. Cushions were helpful when support was needed, but not really a 2 in 1 bc it was a hassle to pull pillows out when using high chair. We ended up purchasing an elasticized cover that is so much easier to use AND it does its job covering all carts/high chairs we have encountered. Also, I washed and air-dried as recommended, but still shrank a bit (not much). However, the Velcro straps which wrap around cart handle bars and the straps used to secure toys shriveled. I didn't have time to iron out each time so that was annoying.
