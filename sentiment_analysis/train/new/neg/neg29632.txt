This monitor is horrible. It was WAYYYY over priced at the $150 price i got it for. I'm reviewing here bc I cannot find my original purchase. The battery life is horrendous! Don't rely on it overnight bc the battery only lasts about 3 hours max. Also when you add the additional camera and put it on multi cam mode, THERES NO AUDIO ON EITHER! Also if you have multiple cameras running you can pretty much no longer use the VOX feature. The only way to do so is to only stay on one camera. Scanning will make all cameras live all of the time and no longer react when there's a sound. I'd stay away from this and get a better, more reliable monitor system. There's no function to use the VOX feature while scanning multiple cameras. This monitor is just barely ok when using just one, but when you add more it's useless.
