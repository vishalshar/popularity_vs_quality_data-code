We like the crib and changing table. It's a straightforward crib, nothing fancy, but certainly looks good. The quality is basically like IKEA. The part we are miffed about is that in the item description it says "Converts from crib to toddler day bed (rail sold separately)" but this seems to be false. I have not been able to find any rail sold anywhere, and on Walmart's website several people say that it is NOT convertible into a toddler bed. So because that was partly why we bought it, thinking it was a great deal, we feel ripped off. However, If you think about it, it's still a good value if you consider the cost of other cribs & changing tables out there. I would still buy it if given the choice again.
