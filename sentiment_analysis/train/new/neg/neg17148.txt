The grandparents bought this car seat for my son to be a second one in their car. It is complicated to get in and out of the car, it's also hard to get the latch system tight enough so that it doesn't move around in the seat. But over all we thought it was a pretty nice seat until my son got sick and vomited all through the seat. Getting the cover off to clean it took forever I had to read the instructions just to get it off the seat and in the end they didn't even help. It was horrible  and the seat has so many crevices it took forever to clean. You'd think that for how much you pay for this seat it would be simpler, but it's not. We have the Graco my ride in our car and it's much easier to clean and adjust I think it's a much better product.
