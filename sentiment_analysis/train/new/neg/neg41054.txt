I read all the reviews saying they received broken or damaged item. When you read such reviews you don't believe until it happens same with you. I received this with intact packaging, no damage to that, but the piece was shattered ,with small plastic pieces in box, a large crack on back. Had to return , but I don't have time to find another storage, so asked for replacement. Return was easy through Amazon, thanks to them. I got another new item in 2 business days, but to not big surprise, it also has a crack. Thankfully not broken but a crack is visible. Tired, I am going to work with this and keep it.But I would warn other buyers that either the quality of plastic isn't good, or the packaging /processing of item by seller isn't right.Overall, the size of the stand is good and is what I was looking for. It is spacious enough. It fits easily pampers wipes box on top. Would hold cream tubes, comb etc on side compartments. Only I would be careful that the stand itself is fragile.
