There was no evidence of damage to the shipping box.However there was a hole (not a crack)in the clear plastic(which I had thought was made of glass),but when I took it to a local glass company to have a new piece cut,I was informed it was plastic instead of glass. Since there was no damage to the shipping container I can only assume this item was broken before it was shipped.I am extremely upset as this item was ordered for my great gran-daughters baby shower and I had no time to return it to you for credit or replacement.I believe your shipping dept.is the irresponsible party.
