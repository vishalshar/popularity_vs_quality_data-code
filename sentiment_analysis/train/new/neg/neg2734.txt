I really wanted to like this car seat but the cute Zebra cover does NOT stay put. I have the Britax Marathon for my other child, and I like that one a lot. I'm so frustrated with "angling" my daughter just right to prevent the seat cover from slipping all over the place on this one though. I regret buying it. She seems to be comfortable, I like the dual cup holders, but the seat is what sticks out the most in my head because I have to think about it every time I put her in or out. Also, the ClickTight is a little harder to do than the video shows. It does make the seat stay in VERY tight though, which is nice. I've examined every which way to try to keep the cover on, and even tried to jimmy rig a way to keep the cover on, thinking it must be a user-error. I've read other online reviews though so I know I'm not alone in my cover frustration.
