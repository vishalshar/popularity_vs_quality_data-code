I didn't like this bag very much, mostly because of the color. I'm sure if I had gotten it in a different color I may have liked it more. Another thing I didn't like too much about it was the material, it was really stiff and uncomfortable. This bag is probably great for some, but it just wasn't a great fit for us.
