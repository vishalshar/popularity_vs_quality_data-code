After giving away my Ocean Aquarium bouncy seat (and everything else) after my daughter grew out of it- I was thrilled to register for this "top of the line" combi rocker.  I ALWAYS DO THIS! I want all of the most expensive things-but I wind up regretting most of them after I have the chance to use them.  Although very comfy and cozy, the harness on the rocker is VERY cumbersome- especially for a new mom.  Lets review the steps to fastening the harness: 1-  unclip both shoulder straps from the buckle. 2- unfasten velcro padding from buckle 3- unclip two side clips...4 then put your baby in. 5 reposition the crotch harnesss between baby's legs-6 clip in the 2 side clips-7 fit the velcro padding over the crotch harness- making sure the hooks for the shoulder straps are positioned correctly under the padding. 8 clip 2 shoulder straps into the crotch harness. OMG! I am all for safety and security, but this process is more complex than the car seat safety system!  The range of motion for the rocker is slight to say the least.  YES- it does recline fully, but do you want your baby strapped in to a seat to sleep at night?  Nevertheless, after my longwinded rant of disappointment, I am returning the $80 rocker and repurchasing the Ocean Wonders bouncy seat- giving me $40 to spend on somthing worthwhile- DIAPERS!  I hope you find this review helpful- even though it didnt get great reviews, my thought process of "the more expensive-the better" won on this product- now I have to make the trip to return it-
