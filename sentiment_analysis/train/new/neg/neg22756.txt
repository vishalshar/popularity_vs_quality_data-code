I found it a little confusing to put together and ended up bending the legs a little.  Once it was straightened out it was ok.Not as sturdy as another bouncy my grandson has at home.  He liked the vibrations and did look at the toys hanging from the shade. I like the fact that you can remove the liner and wash it if necessary.
