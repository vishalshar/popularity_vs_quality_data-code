I bought Avent bottles because of their ability to be used as sippy cups. Trying to save myself a little cash and the nuisance of more cups. Alas, my kids just have no interest in these what so ever. Not to mention Avent bottles barely screw together so my kids can way too easily take the tops off. If I could go back I would have bought a different brand of bottle. Ultimately a waste of money.
