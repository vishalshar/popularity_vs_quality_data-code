This gate works well and is easy to use but the quality of the finish and construction is terrible. 5 stars for functionality, 2 stars for quality and finish.-The welds look like a 12 yr old made them (who knows, that could be true unfortunately...)-The gate isn't straight/true which makes the installation a bit more difficult as you naturally want to use a level to get it right. If you force it to be straight the hinges squeal a little bit because of the lateral tension and the bottom won't close flush so I recommend going with the flow.-In addition, the gate is designed to generate a lot of tension on the top mounts which is done by welding the post with the latch on at an angle relative to the far post that the gate pivots on; mine was welded at such an angle that the tension would have put a hole in my drywall! I had to bend it back using most of my body weight (200lbs) while pushing/bouncing it against the floor.-Finally the stopper on the bottom of the gate would not stay on, it was a very loose fit to where the slightest bump would make it fall off. I ended up wedging a toothpick between the metal and the stopper which has worked well so far.Once installed it's a good gate and easy to open with one hand. I recommend screwing it into the walls as my 9 month old son loves to stand up against it and yank on it relentlessly as if he's trying to break out of jail. The price is a plus too although I'm still surprised how bad the quality is at about 50 dollars each.
