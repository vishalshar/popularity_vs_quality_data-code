If there were a negative star, I'd give that. It is a very low quality blanket.  It sheds like crazy after initial wash before use.  I used a front load washer on a cold water gentle cycle.  Had I put it in with other clothes, I'd be even more angry now because it could have ruin all other clothing.  I've always had good experience with other Skip Hop products like diaper clothes....etc.  But this one is horrible.
