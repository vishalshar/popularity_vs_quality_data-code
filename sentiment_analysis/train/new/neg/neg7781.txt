In rear-facing position the installation manual suggests you use a rolled up towel or pool noodle to stabilize and correctly level the seat.  I wish we had returned it upon reading those instructions.  This is the worst design ever for a rear-facing car seat.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled at least 5 times using different towels and different sized pool noodles.  I will not put my child in this seat for fear of her head smashing into the backseat because there is no way to keep the base from lifting up.  The anchors only anchor from the front of the carseat, so that leaves the back portion of the base unsecured and able to lift up freely.  It is impossible to physically tighten it enough to where it does not move.  I've tried this thing in three different cars with the same result in all three.
