I loved this product until it literally just fell apart. We have had it for less than 5 months and the welded metal piece that holds the gate on just fell of the other day when I went to open it. Thankfully I was walking through by myself and not with one of the little kids falling behind when it just fell off and to the floor. I am now in the market to have to purchase a new one after spending $80+ bucks on this one. I'm a bit disheartened...hopefully mine was just one of the defects and no one else has an issue with theirs!
