I was super excited to get this booster for my 12 year old daughter.  She still needs a booster due to height/weight, but they are so obvious, it can be embarrassing for her to be one of the only kids her age still in a "car seat."  I ordered the Ozzi on it's sleek looks alone to replace her kiddie-styled Graco booster, even though there is tons of life left in it.Huge bummer when it came in.  Fits perfect in my 2007 Toyota Sienna, but the safety label on the front is HUGE and it completely negates the seat's sleek looks.  I will probably return it and just suck it up until she is tall enough for the seat belt alone.  Why Clek, why?!  And why isn't this shown on the product images?
