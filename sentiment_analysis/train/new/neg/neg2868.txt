Over the two months that I've owned these, I was really starting to rely on and love the ReSqueeze pouches for my daughter's yogurt and applesauce- no more spoon, no more mess.  They were awesome.  Used them everyday, washed by hand always.  Then, the other day, I noticed a leak in 2 of my four pouches.  It took me a while to realize what was happening because the seal still "works".  If only it was still fully attached to the pouch!  It has begun to pull away.  Huge disappointment.  For the price I would expect them to last much longer, especially when I have treated them so gently and never put them in a dishwasher.****Update***** I contacted ReSqueeze and they immediately responded with an offer to replace my busted pouches.  Great customer service!  I hope to find that I was unlucky with my first batch and that the new ones perform as intended.
