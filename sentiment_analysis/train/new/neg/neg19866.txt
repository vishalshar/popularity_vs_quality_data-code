This was my first 'open box' purchase.  It looked brand new, and the box did not look like it had ever been opened.  Overall this is a good booster seat, but I would probably not buy this model again.  The reason I gave it 3 stars are:  The activity lights for night time activity do not work.  The slot where the shoulder part of the belt attaches to the booster seat constantly slips out when my daughter buckles. The cup holders have a thin elastic strap which don't even hold a standard size water bottle (a larger bottle or cup fit better).  The cup holders are in the arm rests and the arm rests are not very long, so the arm rests cannot be used if there is anything in the cup holders.  The last issue I have is with the material.  It seemed fine and looked like it would keep my daughter cool.  The design pattern makes it hard to clean.  She unfortunately threw up in the car, and even after cleaning in the washing machine, I had to use a scrub brush to get all debris out of the weave/type crevices.
