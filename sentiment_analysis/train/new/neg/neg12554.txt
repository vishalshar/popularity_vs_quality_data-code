As a parent, this toy is incredibly annoying.  The noise box triggers with the slightest depression, so it goes off constantly when a child is holding it.  The noise itself is very loud and it's difficult to understand what words are being said.  There is no off switch, and no ability to change volume or the batteries unless you do some doll surgery.  The stitching is also very low quality.  In some areas the stuffing is showing, in others the lining is showing, and there are giant stitches where the hat is tacked down to the hair.I did some doll surgery and pulled out the noise box, then stitched it back up with a Henson stitch.  Looks better than it did, and now it's a quiet toy that's ok for bed time.
