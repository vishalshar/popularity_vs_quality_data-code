I LOVE the color. It is beautiful and bright. I wasn't able to find anything but pastel colors in my local stores, so Im glad I found this bold colored one here on Amazon. We have a 4 sided changing pad and it fits well.UPDATE: My daughter is now 22 months old and the elastic on this changing pad has begun to lose it's elasticity. It's not tight around the edges of the changing pad. Technically still usable, but annoying. Expected longer life from a Carters product.
