Pros: cute, pvc phthalate & bpa free, hygenic with no holes in bottom to let water inCons:flips over alot to where 90% of time duck head underwater, no squeakerI purchased for my 6 month son to be entertained in bathtime. This is one of the only rubber ducks that I found to be pvc/bpa/phthalate. I read this duck also had no holes in bottom making it more hygenic which was very important to me. When I received I was immediately happy because it looked so adorable. Baby would try to put in his mouth even before bathtime. First night in bathtime I noticed duck tipped over alot.i bought a bigger bathtub for baby thinking he needed more room. Next night I noticed baby would kick the duck and it'd flip right over. Even a small splash at duck would turn upside down.  I was spending 10 times a night flipping the duck over that was inconvenient plus baby would lose interest until I flipped over. I only give it 2 stars because of how cute it is but manufacturer definitely needs to fix this flipping over defect.
