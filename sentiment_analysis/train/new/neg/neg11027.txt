As someone that is generally an early adopter for technology in general, I find baby monitors to be horribly frustrating! There aren't any good 2.4 or 5.8 GHz models out there. And why don't they all have rechargeable batteries?This is actually my second set of the same monitor from Safety 1st. I have to say that they stand behind their products very well. We had an issue with one of the speaker units with our first set of monitors, and they replaced it no questions asked. We had that set for about 2 years without any real problems, but the monitors steadily get more static and interference as time went on. The worst part was that the volume control dial flaked out to the point that the monitor would turn itself all the way to the lowest volume even though the dial was turned all the way up.We contacted Safety 1st about the static, and volume control issues and they immediately offered to replace the monitor even though it was more than 2 years old. They asked us to buy a new one and send them a receipt since they didn't have any in stock when we called. They also requested that we send the old montior back so that they could test it and figure out if they needed to make improvements to the design. That was pretty impressive. They sent us a shipping label so returning the monitor to them was easy and cost free.The new monitors don't seem to have the battery life that the old ones did, but other than that, they seem to work very well so far. No static or interference. Besides the fact that there isn't a battery backup on the microphone units, and that you can't speak to your baby through the microphone unit like we could with our old Graco unit, these monitors work pretty well. If nothing else, I would recommend Safety 1st products very highly simply because they stand behind them.
