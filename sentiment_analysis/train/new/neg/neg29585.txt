I really like this product, however the 3 stars is due to the price. I bought this mat because of the sensory patterns on them. I wanted to stimulate my baby and it does just that. As soon as i put her on the mat, she went feeling around. She was also captured by all of the colors. They are really bright and get your attention. The cut outs are really cute, especially the mirror. I often find my baby starring down at it. It distracts her from the fact that she is doing tummy time, which is a plus. I'm sure many of you can relate. The swiveled edges also attract your baby's attention and add a nice finish. the sound piece was pretty disappointing.... i mean, it's functional but it's really cheap. Sound like one of those cheap musical birthday cards. And it doesn't attract her attention. See my last pic.For the price that you pay, they should have made this piece better. In terms of cleaning, I didn't have an issue cleaning the surface despite the different textures. It wiped clean very easily. overall this is a great product, just wish it was cheaper.
