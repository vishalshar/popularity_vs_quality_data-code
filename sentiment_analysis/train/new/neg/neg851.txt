Well, my 20 months old can remove these with ease so while I would like to believe we have a genius, super human in our midst, I think it's more likely that the covers aren't as effective as I had hoped.  And they are certainly nowhere near as difficult to remove as some reviewers have claimed.My other kids don't bother with them so I'd say they're probably effective for most little ones but if you have a budding engineer-Houdini on your hands, keep looking.
