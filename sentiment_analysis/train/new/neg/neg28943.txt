I had previously owned this model Bedrail and we used it with one of our other children - it worked great.  Fast forward a couple of years, we needed another one of these (in addition to the first).  I ordered the latest model.  The new unit came, I assembled it in 10 minutes and went to put it on the other side of the bed - it didn't fit.  Much to my surprise, the top bar (part that lays on top of the mattress) was designed differently than the previous unit.  The new units bar only flips up to 40-45 degrees (at best) where the old unit (2008) flips up to 80-85 degrees.Also - the picture you see online, in the instructions, and on the front of the box is not reflective of what is "in the box".  You are seeing pictures of older models of the unit.  They are 98% accurate; they just don't reflect the redesign of that upper bar - which for some will render the product useless.I've seen mixed reviews on Amazon and wanted to share this story solely for information purposes.  If you were a previous owner, you probably had no issues.  Long story short - if you have a skinny mattress - you may be okay with this.  If you measure and are at 10" or above, save yourself the time and trouble (assembly, disassembly, return) and look at another solution.As a postive (reason for 2 stars), Safety 1st (Dorel Group) was very responsive from a support standpoint.  Short call waits, email communication, photo review/comment.  Obviously, they couldn't fix anything, because it is what it is - but they did respond to questions quickly.  My final request was that they redesign there marketing materials for the product.  We know that won't happen, but I did make the request.
