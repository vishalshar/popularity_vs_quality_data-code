I really wanted to love this diaper bag but I was really disappointed.  When I received the bag it was a great patterned fabric and had a nice shape.  However, inside was literally a black hole.  The bag is deep so the black fabric inside just make it impossible to see inside.  What really made me send it back was when I went to put the backpack straps on the bag they were dirty and already fraying.  The bag was brand new so it made me wonder what it would look like in 3 months when it has been used.  Sadly, it went back the day I received it.
