There is no perfect shopping cart cover out there. I've tried a few now.  This one works reasonably well for most of the places we shop at. It works best on the traditional wire grocery carts- the fit is good and the belt can be threaded through the back of the seat. It's also well suited for plastic carts that have a wire seat back- like the ones at Buy Buy Baby or Bed Bath & Beyond.It's ok for the big plastic carts at Target. It's a tight fit, and the elastic on the cover pulls the seat back forward. That said, when my daughter is in a Target cart without the cover, she pulls the seat back forward on her own. I strap her in fairly snug, and she leans forward, pulling the seat back with her. Since this seems to be her preferred way of sitting in the cart she doesn't seem to mind or notice when the elastic on the cover pulls the seat back forward. You can't really use the cover's strap with the Target carts- the velcro is too stiff to let you thread the strap through the plastic mesh of the seat back.I haven't tried it on the Costco carts, but I highly doubt it could stretch that much. Conversely, I haven't tried it as a high chair cover for restaurant high chairs because it will be way too baggy.The biggest feature it has in its favor is that it is relatively easy (compared to other cart covers I've tried) to slip it on the cart with one hand while hanging onto the baby with the other arm. It also washes well and doesn't show dirt very easily- we live in California where the shopping carts are often stored outside the stores, so they can get a bit dusty. This cover does the job of keeping baby's clothes clean and free of that dust.Overall it's not my favorite baby product, but it does its job reasonably well.
