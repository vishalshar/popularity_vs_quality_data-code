The concept of this product is amazing but it's not exactly what I wanted. I'm so frustrated that it doesn't let you use the vibration timer without having the light on. It would be so simple to just be able to turn on the timer without having the light on the whole time. I only need the light for latching baby on and then I would prefer to shut it back off. The light is just at the point of being too bright so I can't wear this on my shirt without it being way too bright for nighttime. If the light were dimmer and the timer wasn't always connected to it this would be perfect.
