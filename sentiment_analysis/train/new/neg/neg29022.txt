Length of pillow was nice. However, the wedge was extremely hard and uncomfortable. It dug into my ribs and hips. After trying to sleep for an hour, I tossed it out of bed and made do without any pillow. Sending it back, as a normal body pillow works much better. Pillow is also too narrow for leg support, and to high for it to be comfortable for head and neck.
