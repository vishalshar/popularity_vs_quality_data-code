Attractive and not difficult to assemble (once you get the hang of opening the pins for the wheel assembly.)This stroller will work for one baby who can sit up (i.e., 6 months or older), or for one such baby and for one childwho is at least two years old. It is NOT for two babies, or closely-spaced children. The front seat is for the babywho can sit; the rear is basically a bench seat for an older child, not another full seat.The rear also has a standing area option for a child who wants to (and is able to) stand during the stroll.This means that the older child must have sufficient balance and stamina.This will work OK for our use, as this stroller will only be used occasionally.So far, our little one is fine in it, but I'm disappointed that there are no foot-rests of any kind, and his legs will dangle.I may have to improvise a foot-rest for this stroller.
