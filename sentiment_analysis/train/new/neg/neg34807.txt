After using this stroller for a few weeks I am going to bullet point things of importance. Some may see them as pros, others as cons. You decide ;)Im using this for a 3 y/o 32# toddler and a 5 month old.~Price is reasonable.~Folds and opens easily and for being a double stroller it is quite light.~Trays are not removable to put child in/out. -Front and 'driver' have a cup holder, back child does not.~I'm 6' tall and its not uncomfortable to push.~ Front canopy is nicely adjustable, the back is not. It's attached to the frame of the stroller. (Sun/wind beams right in)~There is no view through the top of the canopy to see the back child if they're sitting, but it you have the back lying flat there is a small area to view.~There is only 2 positions- straight up or lying flat.~3 point harness for both children.~Maneuvers nicely but, I find it slightly difficult to push it over uneven sidewalks.~The basket below is nice and large. Feet do not interfere with the basket space, but if back child is lying flat there is no way to access the basket.~The quality of the side of the basket is lacking. Made of mesh and 3rd time opening the stroller it ripped.~There is a little compartment along with the cup holder for the parent. The compartment and cup holder are nice and deep~My toddler is not very tall and his head is pretty close to the top of the canopy in the front.I cant speak for the use of a car seat with the stroller. We just put the youngest in the back.I have to say if we were planning on having this stroller long term we probably would have returned it.  There are just some faults with this stroller that seem like no parent was involved in the making. For the price, and the duration we plan on using it, it will serve its purpose.
