As a soon-to-be new first time Mom, I registered for this monitor because I thought that since it was higher priced that it should be a good one (since I knew nothing about monitors at that point). Needless to say, this wasn't the case at all. This monitor is absolutely horrible. I had it on my nightstand (next to our cordless phone) & every time the phone rang, the monitor would make this awful screeching noise. Also, in the middle of the night (for no apparent reason), the monitor would make an awful loud sound waking me & my husband up petrified that something was horribly wrong with our newborn. It is stressful enough being a first time parent but adding this monitor to the mix (with its extremely poor quality) only makes it harder. I switched to the Safety 1st Monitor (which by the way is much less expensive & comes with 2 monitors instead of 1!) and haven't been happier. It is crystal clear (still have it on my nightstand and there's no problem with the phone) & it doesn't pick up any static, etc.. I can even bring it to our basement while I exercise & my baby naps on the 2nd floor. I would strongly recommend the Safety 1st Monitor especially if you are a first time parent! It is great and it makes your new job a lot easier (as a monitor is intended to do!).
