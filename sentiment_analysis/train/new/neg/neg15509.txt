This product gets an A+ for compact design, portability and setup. It's small, fits right in luggage if you are travelling and sets up in under 5 minutes.It fits the bill If you need this for a day trip or  just to use while you're out visiting, shopping, etc... to allow your child to stretch out for a nap this will serve the purpose.Depending on where you set it up its passable for an overnight. the liner is only about 1" thick and if you set it up on the  recommended surface (table, floor) this can be pretty uncomfortable, as it's pretty much just like being on the hard surface itself.This can be remedied by putting in some padding  (Blankets, towel or a small pillow) below the insert to soften the sleeping area. Doing this is not recommended by the manufacturer but makes it more comfortable for an overnight instead of just a nap.We used this for my son, he can't roll yet, and is 22" long and he fit nicely into the footprint of the bed, The first night he seemed uncomfortable, so I added the padding (mentioned above), after that every night he slept in it without complaint.I would not recommend this if you have a child that can roll over as they will most likely rollover the side wall, it doesn't seem like it would take much to collapse the side walls. Do not put it on a table (or anything at height) if your child can move. With the dimensions of this bed I think we may get a few more uses out of this bed, but I think 26-27" may be the upper limit for him to fit in this.....
