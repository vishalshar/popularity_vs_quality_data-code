I bought these because our granddaughters were coming to visit. This is a good deal, but it's so hard to get these out of the sockets. That's good for the kids but not for grandmas that have arthritis in their hands. The ones that I bought at the store had a little place on them that you could wedge them out with the prong on another outlet plug.
