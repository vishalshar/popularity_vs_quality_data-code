We will be returning this item. The range is terrible. We thought maybe it was because we have an older house and the walls are very thick, but I tried it in my parents new house and you have to have the monitor in the room or hallway right next to the baby and cannot take it farther or even across the room. Even then, it loses the signal easily. I don't know many people who have rooms right next to their baby. Also, it has a flashing green light when the camera loses the signal which can wake the child. We have a toddler we just adopted and wanted to keep an eye on her at night. She stares at the flashing light and has a hard time going to sleep. I also don't like that it only comes on when a noise is heard. It comes on every time the heater or A/C comes on. Everything else about the camera is great. The screen is nice and you can see the child easily. The lullaby option is a plus, but not needed. I would not recommend this product unless you have the perfect place right behind the wall of the baby room to keep it. Even then, you might as well spend your money on one that will go farther so you can move it to the room you are actually in while the baby is sleeping. * adding this later...I would like to add to my review though that I received a FULL refund so the seller was not bad to work with.
