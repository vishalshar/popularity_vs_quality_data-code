These are good for daytime training pants, but unfortunately that isn't what I bought them for.  Based on the product description's use of the word "waterproof" and several glowing reviews about using these at night, I bought them for my already day-trained 2 year old to wear at night.  BIG MISTAKE.  The tag in the underwear says, "Trainers are NOT fully waterproof but will buy some time if an accident occurs."  So I just paid $16 bucks for thick underwear that doesn't do any better at keeping him dry at night than regular undies?  If anything, it's worse because they hold the moisture, keeping him wetter.  And once they are soaked, they are VERY hard to get off.  We tried them overnight despite the tag, because of the other reviews - he soaked his bed, moved to mine and soaked it, then had a screaming fit because he couldn't get them off (I even had trouble getting them off of him.)  I'm sure if you were using them during the day to catch an occasional accident they would be great.Also, they take more than just a single cycle in the washer to really clean and they are hard to get really dry.  I wish I could return them, but obviously they've been peed on.
