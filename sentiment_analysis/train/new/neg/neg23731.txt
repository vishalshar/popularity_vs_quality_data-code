I bought this thinking that it would get a lot of use.  The wipes case that comes with this kit do not keep the wipes moist.  I left this as an emergency kit in our car and when I needed a wet wipe, I found a bunch of dry napkins. (Sigh).  It's too late to return this item, otherwise I would have.  Also, the mat is removable, but the velcro sticks to baby and is very annoying.  I would not recommend this.  Find something else that won't sit in your closet.
