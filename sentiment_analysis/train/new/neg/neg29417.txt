I bought both the reusable flannel and the thirsties fab wipes and have been using them for 16 months now. I highly recommend using cloth wipes of either type if you are using cloth diapers as they add no added difficulty to cloth diapering, but save a ton of wipes.  If you are trying to decide between the two, though, here is how they stack up. For our use, the Thirsties have been much better and are well worth the added expense.  This is due to several reasons:1) The thirsties are more absorbant and wipe the poop significantly better than than the flannel.  Both have a more "rough" side and smoother side.  The thirsties is more towel-like on its "rough" side and is more likely to get the majority of the poop in one wipe than the flannel. (By "rough" I do NOT mean scratchy or irritating in any way, just the weave is such that there is more texture to it.)  The "smooth" side on the flannel is actually not as soft, and I don't like to use it on my baby's butt as it is both not as absorbant and more irritating.2) The thirsties is softer than the flannel.  Maybe that would not be true if I wasnt using cloth diaper detergent, but I just throw them in with the diapers when I wash them.3) The flannel wipes have stained.  Not a lot, but some.  The thirsties have not stained at all.4) The flannel wipes have frayed a little at the edges.  The thirsties look like brand new even though I use them now preferentially over the flannel wipes.
