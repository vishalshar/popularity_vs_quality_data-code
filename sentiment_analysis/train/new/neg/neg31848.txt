Honestly, I got this for my amazon parrot. She will have a toy parrot about 3 feet from her that will gladly interact with her. She is quite a talker and she loves to be talked too. So she now has a friend that repeats what she says and also says I love you, hello and I see you all the phrases she already knows and says. Actually when the toy bird says "I see you" my bird immediately says Peek a boo. It is cute.However, I just gave it 3 stars since the head does not move, the mouth does not open and the wings do not flap. However, in the parrot world the wings flapping is an aggressive move and would only scare my parrot. So it not moving around and flapping its wings is great for me. I had intended on gluing them down if they had moved anyway.But I felt the need to let potential new customers know that yes, it does record nicely but you may get one that does not move properly and then that would definitely not be worth the price.
