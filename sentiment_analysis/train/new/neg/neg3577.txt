I have been looking for a sectioned bowls for my infant son to send to his daycare and to have his dinner made in case I can't get home in time to feed so all dad would have to do (cause we all know how great they are at following directions) would have to do would be just pull it out and pop it in the microwave to warm it up and feed.  This is a great idea but the compartments are way to small.  I use regular ice cube trays when I make my own food so the size of the frozen cube is too big to fit into this dish making the lid not fit.  If you were to buy this feeding dish you would also need to get the trays that you use to freeze the food or else anything else wouldn't work.
