I already had the Rainforest Jumper for my daughter and ordered this version for when I take her into work with me (twice per week). This version is less interactive for her than the Rainforest version. The section with all the lights doesnt really have much for her to touch - it's not really obvious to her to spin the ball and she's too young to have the strength/ability to push the bar to make the lion spin. The rainforest version has the hanging monkey and parrot that she can bat at, and it also has a spinning wheel that makes animal noises & it's easy for her to make it turn. the whale is OK, but she prefers to spin the sun on the rainforest jumper.Things I dislike about both version - the toy that dangles is kind of out of sight and really not that exciting (and technically they can be a bit deceiving in some of the picture where they show the object standing straight up when it never does that), and both versions have a spinning wheel to the right of the section with the lights/music that is really kind of a waste.I also feel they cheaped out by putting in that little snack holding section instead of another toy - I'm not sure how many people are going to put Cheerios or something on a toy that the baby JUMPS in and would consequently spill all of their snack on the floor.I know my daughter is only four months old and she may very well gain appreciation for these functions later, but I still think the Rainforest version is more fun.
