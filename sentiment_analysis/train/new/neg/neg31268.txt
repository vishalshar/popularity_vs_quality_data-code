This highchair has pros and cons, but the cons are so ridiculous that it only deserves one star. Here they are:Pros1. Folds away fairly small2. Sturdy and easy to use mechanisms for adjustments3. The adjustable height means we can use it right at the table instead of using the tray, and we can also bring it down to it's lowest setting if we're having a snack around the coffee table.Cons1. The tray is immense. The clip-on cover just barely fits in the dishwasher.2. The bottom tray has seams where food and water get trapped. It's too big to soak in the sink, so this has happened just from typical use and rinsing.3. The cover has a 'wipe clean only' tag, which of course I have ignored because that would be disgusting. The result of throwing it in the washing machine is that the inner foam padding folds and bunches every time. It's a major pain to massage it back into position. Some quilting would fix this if I could use a sewing machine.4. The tray is too high. My son is the size of a typical 2 year old and it comes to his armpits.5. The seat is too big. When he sits with his knees where they should be he has room to lean back about 45 degrees.6. The straps are too short on the waist portion. Loosened all the way I still can't do them up unless he's all the way back in the chair, so his feet stick out straight and he can hardly reach the tray. This means he eats without the straps, but with such a huge chair it's easy for him to scoot back and pull his knees to his belly, then stand up.I don't understand what size child this chair is designed for.
