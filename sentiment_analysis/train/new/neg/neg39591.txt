Recently purchased this item for our new baby girl who is beginning to crawl and explore.  Thought it would also be nice to keep her and the dog separated during this time since she seems to key in on trying to get a hold of our dog's tail. Read over many of the reviews and looking for the right dimensions that looked nice at the same time.  Finally settled for this one after hours of shopping, I received the gate today open the box and that's all I see, just the gate... Missing several parts that were suppose to come with it, including the mounting hardware for the gate, and no 24 hr customer service either. Not happy with the performance or standards of this company that is suppose to be highly ranked on consumer reports for pressure mounted baby gates. Somebody within their company seriously fell asleep at the wheel on this one. Planning on having a word with the company in the morning and will post later how good their customer service really is...
