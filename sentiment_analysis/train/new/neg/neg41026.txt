Awesome swing but not all models have AC adapters!! I got the Little Lamb model which cost more than the dog one thinking it would come with the adapter since it costs more and also because it has more features, but no adapter. We got it all set up and realized this. I'm upset I hate batteries.  Won't be sending it back because we are desperate for the swing for our newborn. Apart from that the swing is really nice and doesn't swing too fast like some reviewers mentioned. My baby seems happy as a clam in it
