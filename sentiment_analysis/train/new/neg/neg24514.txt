I used to have a similar version from Safety 1st brand that worked much better, but after 3 years it broke and I needed a new one. These barely grip the knob when you press the buttons to open it, making it extremely hard for an adult to open the door, let alone a kid. As far as I know we have a standard door knob - we are in a large neighborhood with basically one builder for over 100 homes so I can't imagine they used anything out of the ordinary. I had to return them.
