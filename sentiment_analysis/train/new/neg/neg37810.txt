I was very disappointed in the Melissa & Doug Princess Puppet.  This is the first item received from Amazon I was unhappy with.  There is something wrong with the construction of the mouth.  My husband and I both tried to move the mouth up and down and it just doesn't work right. To be perfectly blunt, it looks deformed.  At first, I felt like returning the Princess Puppet.  Instead, I'm giving it to my 5 year old grand daughter, anyway; and she can decide if the puppet is a wicked, step-mother or a not-so-pretty princess.  We can't all be beautiful. . ."No one is perfect."
