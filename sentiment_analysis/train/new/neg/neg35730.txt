I liked one thing about these and that was how thin they were. I loved that! Unfortunately they did not work for me in any other way. I had a very hard time making the stay in place, I could not get proper suction of the nipple and the fact that they were completely round, with no cut out, made it difficult for me to relax. I kept worrying that my son was either going to suffocate or suck the whole thing into his mouth and choke (thanks to their looseness). I would recommend the Avent Nipple Protector. It's a slightly thicker plastic but I think that might aid in getting proper suction. Plus it takes up less space on your boob so your baby can have both his nose and chin against your skin instead of rubber/plastic.
