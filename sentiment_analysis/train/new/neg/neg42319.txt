I've had my eye on these for my son for quite a while.  He recently started enjoying knocking towers down, so I went ahead and purchased them.  Guess I should have looked at the dimensions before ordering because I was surprised at how small they were.  The tower with all 6 balls and the base is really about a foot/foot-and-a-half tall.  Pretty disappointing.  My son could really take them or leave them as of right now.  When I build a tower for him with them he will knock them down, but he hasn't attempted to build a tower by himself.  Perhaps once he is able to figure out how to do that, he'll enjoy them more, but for now they just sit unused in the toy boy.
