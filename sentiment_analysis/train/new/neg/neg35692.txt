I bought this carseat without seeing it in person just based on the Britax reputation and these reviews. It is clearly very nice quality construction and seems very safe. My one complaint is that the crotch strap is extremely short. I feel like I might pinch my son's crotch with the buckle (ouch!). I've read that this is on purpose, to ensure that the thigh straps are snug over the thighs. If I had to do it over again, I'd probably find a store that carries Britax in person and try it out...but I've already bought two of these and they're too large to return.
