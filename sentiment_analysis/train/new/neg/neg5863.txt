Our baby had to adjust to it... at first he didn't really like it.  Now he can sleep in it, but we do have to rock him in it before he sleeps if he is not sleeping yet.  His body does not naturally rock it back and forth (up and down).  We are hoping that as he gets older (he is now just about 2 months) that he'll grow more used to it and rock it more.  It is not a total waste though, he does sleep in it alot, mostly in the daytime.  However, it's kind of bad because he gets so used to it he has a harder time sleeping in his bassinet.  Hopefully the money that we paid will equal out if we keep using it.  However, the bad thing is the playthings (those little teddy bears).  We took them off and haven't put them on since, and now I can't figure out how to put it back on and have it stay.  He did not like those teddy bears though.
