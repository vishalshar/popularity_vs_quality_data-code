I've been using these for the past 3 months, and until recently, I thought they worked great.  That was until this evening when my 10 month old son, who has 4 front teeth decided to bite the top of the spout off and proceed to swallow it!  He seemed to be doing a bit too much chewing of his food, and when I checked, I saw that almost the entire top half was missing.  He then started gagging, so I know he swallowed it.  These can be very dangerous and a major choking hazard.  Please think twice before allowing your child to use these.
