We have this same seat with different fabric colors and have been using it for a year.  It worked pretty well for use most of that time.  Before my son turned 2, he could open the clip across his chest.We also have a Britax Roundabout in our other car.  The clip on the Britax seat is much better.  It is easy for me to open but a 2 year old can't open it.We bought this seat because it seemed comfortable, could also be used as a booster seat and was cheaper than buying another Britax.It is also nearly impossible to tighten the harness straps on the Graco seat with a winter coat on.  Britax does a better job with that too.I would not recommend this seat and would spend more money to get another Britax seat.
