We bought these because it was part of the same set we're using for our son's nursery. The decals are cute, but I wish there'd been a little more variety in the package. The real reason I knocked it 2 stars is that the adhesive on the back is very weak. They were very hard to get to stick, and I had to take down several because they just wouldn't stick at all.If you have flat, or even lightly textured walls, you'll probably be ok. Our walls are heavily textured so I'm sure that's part of the problem, but since the Disney Cars decals in our other son's room had no problem sticking, I don't believe that's the main reason.
