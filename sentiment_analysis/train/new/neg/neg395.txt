We've used this sound machine through 2 kids, the sounds work well to help them sleep and to block house noise. However, the product is such poor quality. I received one 4 years ago, which was heavy, had more features, and lasted 2 years and used every day, multiple times a day. After replacing the first one, the new sound machine that arrived was cheaper and noticeably lighter - and then broke within 2 weeks. I have returned THREE sound machines in one year! I keep going back to it b/c my sons only sleep to this sound, however the product is very poorly made and breaks easily!
