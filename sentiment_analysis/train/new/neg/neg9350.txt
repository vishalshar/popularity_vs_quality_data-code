The dresser was cheap and flimsy. The side drawer boards split while screwing in the railings. I tried repeatedly calling the manufacturer to get the issue resolved and the no one ever answered the phone. I tried emailing them with the issue to get new pieces sent. I was told to send pictures and details of the issues. All of this was done promptly and repeatedly and each time my email would come back undelivered. There is on way to get in touch with the manufacturer and we now have a broken worthless dresser.Do not order anything from Stork craft!
