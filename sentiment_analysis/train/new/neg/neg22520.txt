In reviews I read for this product, they said this extension was compatible with the G80 gate.  This gate is NOT compatible with the G80 gates and extensions I purchased in ~2010 for our then puppy.  When I called customer service today (for an additional extension to use for a new puppy), they said they no longer stock the parts for THAT G80.  Not even an apology, just "we no longer stock that part."  Wow - like talking to a robot.  Also, I see that Target has a current G80 - which is NOT the same as the one I have.  I am frustrated that they are naming gates the same thing (G80) when they are NOT compatible systems.
