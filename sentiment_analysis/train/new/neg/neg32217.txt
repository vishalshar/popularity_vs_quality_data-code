We got this set for our 3 month old twins, hoping to entertain them enough for us to finish a meal.The cow doesn't stick for more than a couple seconds, and is top heavy so it hit my son in the head when it fell. It is a relatively boring toy, doesn't spin well, and it is way too loud, especially for a toy that is right in front of your baby!The other toy is better, but it also does not stick for long.  Since it comes off the base, they can at least still use it and do seem to like it.  The black and white part that sticks in the base is a nice size for their hands to grasp. But as a tray toy, it is not worth it.
