I bought the car seat for the comfort and safety aspects, as well as the ease of use. Very easy to install! Seems incredibly safe, and hope I never have to test that theory. I am Very Disappointed however with one VERY BIG feature that is completely USELESS... The recline. Seriously, the recline handle is in the front at the bottom, completely inaccessible once the car seat is properly secured Rear facing. other than that, she loves it. so I give it 3 stars. hope this helps.
