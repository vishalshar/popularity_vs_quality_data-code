I bought this in hopes of finding a gate that would be easy to use and well made. This gate is neither. The gate itself is sturdy and the metal is good, however the sides of the gates that have the little pins on them with the cushions - the ones that hold against the wall are very poorly made. The cushions on the pins slip off at every chance they get - so in the end you get the sharp pins going against your wall - resulting in scratches all over the wall. Apart from this, the locking mechanism is not easy to use. If you put this gate somewhere where you need to walk at some point - meaning you need to take the gate off and put it back on again, then there is an issue of the lock. In order to lock the gate in the position you want, you need to put the little plastic part on top of the lock in the correct spot, and for some reason, to get the plastic part in that spot is a nightmare. It won't go in and when it does go in, the turning part which works in tandem with the plastic part and makes the pressure on the gate is most times too far, meaning you have to readjust the plastic part again. I am not the only one who has problems with this locking mechanism, my husband, my mother, his mother, my father and my sister all have problems with this. I would look elsewhere if you need an easy to use gate which you will unlock and lock many times a day. If you are looking for a gate that you put in once and don't have to unlock it for long periods of time, then this isn't a bad gate since you wouldn't have to deal with all these problems daily.
