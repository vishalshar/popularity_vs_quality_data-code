I was so excited when I received the NUK Cook-n-Blend Baby Food Maker. I started my baby on solids at the beginning of August and have been making my own baby food ever since. I have only made pears, apples, sweet potatoes, green beans, and peas so far, but about a week ago I noticed this baby food maker no longer properly steams my fruits and veggies. It boils the water in the little compartment and then beeps, signaling it is done, within a few minutes, without having steamed the veggies and fruits. I just checked to see if I could return/replace the item, but apparently my window has expired, so now I'm stuck with this defective thing that only essentially works as a blender. I am pretty frustrated at this point. It's not as though I was constantly using this baby food maker to make gourmet meals for my baby. This thing only lasted a month before breaking. Not worth the money in my opinion. I'm going to replace this with a different brand.
