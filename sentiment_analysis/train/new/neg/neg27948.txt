For one, the on button never makes it way to the "off position". The light on the button just turns off when it's done. Two- the amount of water left on the baby bottles when they're done. I don't know how the bottles can remain sterile if that much water is stays on the bottle.  If I boil water and put my Comotomo baby bottles in the water, when they leave the water,  the water evaporate off the parts. But when I use this Cuisinart sterilizer, the bottle parts remain fully saturated and therefore absolutely need to be hand dried or they will remain with large water droplets on them for hours. I do not know if this is because of the Comotomo bottles, but I assume it's not-- because it doesn't happen when I boil them. Three - The amount of water  that you are instructed to put into the fertilizer (to the fill line on their measuring cup) never completely evaporates and turns to steam. When the cycle is done running, there is still an enormous amount of un evaporated water sitting in the bottom of the sterilizer. Not good. The only good things about them is that the cycle is relatively fast (less than 10 minutes).I do not own any other baby bottle sterilizers so I don't know if this is as good as sterilizers get, but overall, I feel like I'd prefer to boil the baby bottles over using the sterilizer because then I have to dry them. Basically, not great for $60.
