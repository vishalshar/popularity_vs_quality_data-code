My grandbaby likes to chew on this necklace but it is not always easy for her to hold and chew when it's around someone's neck.  It just becomes easier to hold it, like and teether, and let her chew it.  If that's the case, it's no different than a teething ring and a lot more expensive.  Also, taking it off one's neck causes it to get dirty easier and not be clean for a baby to chew on.
