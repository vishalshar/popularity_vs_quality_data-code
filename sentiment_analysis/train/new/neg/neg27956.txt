This rain cover fits quite well, but it started to fall apart quite quickly.  First, the Velcro patches came off, then the seams broke. When the problem started to surface, I took a closer look of the cover and realized the design/quality left much to be desired. The Velcro patches are only glued on and they will peel off after some usage (not a lot usage). And the black seam cover/band is too narrow to hold two plastic sheets together comfortably. If you accidentally pulled the cover a little too hard, the seam will break and leave a gaping hole in the cover. Once the seams come part, it is very hard to staple/sew the pieces back together using the same seam cover. I had to resort to clear postal tape and it ruined the look. I bought this cover in late 2011 and was hoping by now Bumbleride had realized their design flaw and improved the cover quality.  Just checked the cover on Bumbleride website, same old design. Very disappointed. The quality of the cover does not go hand in hand with the quality of the stroller. I think that(1) wider seam cover/band and (2) sewed-on Velcro will make this cover so much better.
