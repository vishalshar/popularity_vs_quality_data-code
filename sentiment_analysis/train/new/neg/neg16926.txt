This is the worst product ever. It is impossible to collapse. Parts are constantly jammed. I called the company after 7 months to return it because I was about to leave it on the curb and they would not refund it. They do not stand behind their product. This thing is worse than an $80 graco. It also weighs a ton and has a horrible handle so traveling with it is a nightmare. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS OVER PRICED PRODUCT.
