The idea is no different than the ice cube bags where you fill up the bag, toss it in the freezer, and shortly after you have 12+ individually frozen ice cubes. This product uses the same concept except it's factory sealed to prevent leakage of the liquid.The reason I gave it such a low review is that the plastic material to protect the cells is very thin (stress very).  In my case, the fold of another Ice mat bag pierced two cells and the liquid stained my cooler :-(  Ultimately, I was left with the impression that the product was designed with forced adolescence in mind.  It's too bad as the concept works if you don't like water mess of ice but want the flexibility that a folding mat provides but in the end, I'll vote with my dollars and find an alternative.Note to Thermos reps (if you read this): Increase the thickness. To justify the cost, market the product as heavy duty.  Consumers are savvy enough to recognize the value in that.
