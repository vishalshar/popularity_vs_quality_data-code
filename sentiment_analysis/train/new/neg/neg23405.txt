I like the Soft Gear booster seat I got for my daughter a little better because it has more cushion, cleans up better, and is made in the U.S. It is, however, a good quality seat. Unfortunately, after using for about a year, we just got tired of the thing falling off. We've used it mostly on a bench seat, though we tried it on a regular chair, too- it falls off both. To put it on a regular chair, my son would have to climb onto another chair next to it, then get on it so it didn't fall off. The Soft Gear one has the same problem. It just doesn't work well not having a strap. I finally when to Ikea and spent $40 for a junior height chair that is wonderful.
