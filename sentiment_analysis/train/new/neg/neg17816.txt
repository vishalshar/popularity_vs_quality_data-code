I received a defective batch of covers (see attached picture).I brought along 4 covers for a day out. My toddler needed to go potty so I took him to the bathroom,  confident that I could protect his tush from the inevitable germs lurking on the toilet seat. While he waited patiently, I proceeded to prepare the throne. Can you imagine my frustration upon opening not one or two, but 4 (!!!), covers to find not one useable? My toddler had begun doing his potty dance at that point so I had to make do with a toilet paper covering.I have used these covers before so was willing to pay the steep price, as they provide substantial coverage; however, as a self-proclaimed germophobe, I cannot with confidence buy these again and possibly be stuck in the same situation.If you already have these in your possession, I encourage you to check your stock before heading out to use them.
