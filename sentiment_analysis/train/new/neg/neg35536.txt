I was soo excited to get this toy for my 5 week old.  He was always a very attentive baby.  He liked looking around and seeing everything.  He has the fisher price aquarium swing, and even from a week old, he noticed the the lights and moving fish on the overhead mobile.  That is why I thought he would adore this classical gym toy with the stars that light up.  But when I got it, he wouldn't even look at the lights from the laying down position.  There is a mode in the laying down position that allows one song to play when the baby kicks the toys that are hanging.  It takes quite a big movement or two to get the thing to play a song in that mode.  That's not a huge deal though.  When my baby turned about 8 weeks I had an idea about how to get him interested in this toy.  I put the toy in the sitting up position and sat with my son on my lap.  I helped him play the piano in that particular mode and also just let the music play for him so he could just watch the lights and listen.  He seems to really enjoy this.  So basically, we haven't really been able to use the toy as the manufacturer suggests, but we've found ways of enjoying it still.  And once my baby gets older and more developed, this should be a really fun toy.
