I think I must have gotten a lemon. The push was awful, it had a terrible wobble. Others say that they like theirs. It was ok for the price, but just ok. The hood however is very nice in that the zipper allows you to extend it very far. I bought a Quinny Zapp extra with folding seat instead and it's far more worth the price.
