The product description and many of the 5* reviews made me think that this product would come with the double sided tape that would make it attachable, but it did not come with any tape. It's not usable as is, and having to go and hunt down some tape to go with it is not the best. It's a little disappointing.The color is also a little different from that on the pictures. Mine has a reddish undertone that makes it not match the table it was to go on. Cutting my losses on this one - luckily only a few bucks.
