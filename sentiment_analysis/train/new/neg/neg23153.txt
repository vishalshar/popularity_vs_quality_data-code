I bought this thinking this would be used with the EasyWalker Flexi Bath tub for my 7 month old son. But when I received the package, it stated for infants up to 6 months. I wish this stated under product description before I had purchased it.But I also realized that since my son can sit up on his own, he is fine in the EasyWalker Flexi Bath tub without needing additional support.
