I purchased these for use with my Prince LionHeart Wipes Warmer, which is designed to be used with reusable cloth wipes. My Prince LionHeart cloth bamboo wipes didn't hold up well after washing, so I decided to give these a try after seeing the wonderful reviews on Amazon. Unlike the Prince LionHeart wipes, the BabyKicks are still going strong after frequent use and wash; however, they stain easily. All of them are discolored from baby's dirty diapers. The Prince LionHeart wipes looked like new after every wash, but began to fall apart, which is why I decided to replace them. So... if you intend to use these on baby's bottom, be prepared that they will look pretty gross before long!
