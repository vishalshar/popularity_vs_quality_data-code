We thought these would be ideal - we'd install them before he was able to crawl, we'd keep them turned down so we would have free entry into all drawers until he became curious and able.Well, now he is "curious and able" and the locks, when engaged in the upright safety mode, will, with enough force, jump out of the upright position and turn down allowing the drawer to fully open.  Ever seen a determined toddler yank at a drawer trying to get it open?  Believe me, he has the power!I will say that we are using the cabinet lip to stop the drawer from opening, but we have several styles of child-safety locks like this one on our drawers and cabinets throughout the house using the cabinet lips to catch the lock.  There is NO WAY my son can get in THOSE drawers and cabinets.  But, of course,  those other fail-proof locks do not have this turn-down convenience feature - thank goodness!  It is too much work to install these to find out they don't really work.
