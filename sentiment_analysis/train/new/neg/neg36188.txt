I breastfeed exclusively and wanted something that would allow me to be with visiting family and friends rather than hiding in my room to feed the baby.  The Baby Bond did not work for me.  It left a very noticeable triangle of skin showing around the nipple and another exposed patch of skin on the under side of the breast.  With constant adjusting, you could probably get a better fit, but the only way I could cover myself completely was to pull the fabric of the Baby Bond so close to the baby's mouth that her mouth was touching the material, interfering with the latch.  When the baby pulls away, it leaves the nipple and surrounding area completely exposed.  I returned this for a refund and plan to get a Bebe Au Lait, which seems to be a better option for modesty and full coverage.  The Baby Bond left me too exposed to use in front of company.  It also seems pricey for just two bands of t-shirt material sewn together, although the stitching is well done and it comes in a handy carrying case.  Overall I don't recommend this product.
