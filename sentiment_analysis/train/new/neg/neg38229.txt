I would give Zero star if I could! This product isn't "Kiddopotamus " brand as described. I would not have bought it if I had known babyHeaven sent me this "Summer Infant SwaddleMe". The leg pouch  of this one cannot be as easily popped down to do diaper-check as the traditional "Kiddopotamus ". I finally have to give up the idea of returning because i dont want to spend another several dollars on postage. Very frustrating experience... I feel like I have been tricked.
