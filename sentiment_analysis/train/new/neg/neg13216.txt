it doesnt hold very much. at the fabric on the outside gets wet as the bag defrosts. and it didnt take very long for it to have an odor. even after scrubbing it like crazy with soap. i found that i am very please with the packit bags. they are much bigger and save a lot of space since they fold flat. i love them! i have two. i would use extra ice packs and wrap it around the baby bottles just to make sure the formula stayed cold. and they also have very cute designs! and the outside of the bag doesnt get wet or have a bad odor. ive had my packit for well over a  year now and ive had no issues.
