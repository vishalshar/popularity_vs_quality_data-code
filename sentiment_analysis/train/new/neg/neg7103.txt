I normally have had great experiences with all my shopping at Amazon, but this product I do not recommend. I liked the color & the free screen protector = 1star and I liked the smart feature of the cover and stylus = 1 star, but the cover doesn't fit well. There are two plastic pieces to insert your device into at the top of the tab in order to clap in the tablet at the bottom, Well the two plastic (pinchers) at the top work well, they hold down the device in place, but the bottom keeps popping out like a fat belly would overlap tight pants at the waist. You might want to note that the picture is not the same as the product. You won't see any plastic thick pieces in the picture. I hate it, it will only stay in place when the darn thing has the cover over it. So, again, if you had a thinner tab, it might work but this was tailored to the Samsung so I don't understand why it just doesn't work right.
