This is so cute, but because it was to be a gift for a 3 year old, I washed it first because other reviews talked about heavy linting, and I wanted to spare the busy parents this hassle.  Unfortunately, the seams along the hood frayed terribly (even without machine drying) so now it looks old and used, no longer gift-worthy.  Disappointed, returning it.
