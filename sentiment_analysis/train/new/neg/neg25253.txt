I haven't compared this to any other camera, and I bought two simply because I already had one for my first child and I wanted matching to be able to use one monitor for both cameras. The camera does its job mostly. The video quality is mostly  good except sometimes it's not clear, but this is usually due to weird lighting during nap time when the lights are off but some light is shining through closed blinds. Sometimes it just loses a signal, seemingly for no reason, but it will come back- sometimes immediately and sometimes...takes a while. Like now...kind of irritating. This happens maybe 15% of the time, and only about 5% that it takes so long to come back- or that it flips on and off. Also the stand that's connected to the monitor broke pretty easily with my first one. I've been trying to keep the second one intact. So far so good. I do like the optional feature where the video turns off until the child makes a noise then it will cut on. This saves the battery life for sure.You can mute it, or turn the volume up pretty high. You can use one monitor for two cameras also if necessary. But we didn't care for that feature which I wrote about below. Lastly...like I said I didn't compare to any other cameras...but I'm not crazy about the way the camera sits and turns and I don't really like how it's made to hang. But this might be typical.TWO cameras with one monitor:I think when both cameras are used with one monitor, it just flips from one camera to another, I don't think you have control over this, but don't quote me on that. My husband witnessed this, I didn't - he didn't like that so we just use an individual monitor with each camera which is fine with us.
