I have seen parents using these in the airport and knew I wanted one for my next trip with my toddler. I just opened the package to find one of the nuts missing from the strap that is supposed to connect the car seat to the stroller. This would be easy enough for me to fix, but I live in a small town and will need to make an extra drive to a hardware store to get the right size nut, and that's the last thing you want to do the day before a cross country trip with a toddler. Be warned that this may not come fully assembled or with all necessary hardware, which is ridiculous for the price tag. I'm hoping I can get the part and get it working before my flight tomorrow.
