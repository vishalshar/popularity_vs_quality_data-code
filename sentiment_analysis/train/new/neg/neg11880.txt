I ordered the double for my toddler and infant and LOVED IT...until...my 2.5 year old tried it out and he's already too tall for the seat despite the leg adjustments...I had to return it...to my dismay...I wish they would make the seats long like the city mini GT (which I have and LOVE!)  I am going to replace this stroller with the double city mini GT...
