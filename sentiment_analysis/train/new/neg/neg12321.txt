We purchased this swing before there were any reviews available on it. We got it home and it was incredibly easy to assemble.The big issues are all involved with the seat. It doesn't sit straight and it does not feel secure. It is extremely wobbly.  When the seat is turned sideways, it is tilted inwards which would cause baby to roll towards the side.  The seat also does not lock into position.Overall, I feel it was a big waste of money and not something we feel comfortable putting our child into. My husband is disassembling it as I type this review. We will be returning it to Babies R Us tomorrow and will continue our search for a more secure and reliable swing.Please use caution when purchasing. It is an extremely cute swing with wonderful features but to us it is not worth the money to worry about our child's comfort and safety.
