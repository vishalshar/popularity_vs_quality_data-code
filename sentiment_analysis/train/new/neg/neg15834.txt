I've been loving the look of this stroller since it came out. In real life though wasn't what I needed. The main issue for me was the fold- not so compact with the basket (which is an awesome huge basket, fyi) on the bottom sticking out too much taking up too much space in my trunk. Ended up returning it and getting the Valco Snap which is just perfect for us!
