We bought this product despite the poor reviews since we already had the crib and changing table and wanted the matching dresser.  Other people had reported having problems with the manufacturing of the dresser, but they said they contacted LaJobi and were able to get replacement parts.THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.We didn't realize this when purchasing the dresser, and had the whole thing put together when we realized that the slots for the final dresser drawer didn't line up and that the bottom of the drawer wouldn't slide in.  When we contacted LaJobi, they informed us that the product has been discontinued and to simply return the product.  No offer to do anything else to help out.  I already have the entire dresser assembled except for the last drawer, and to take the whole thing apart, package it, and ship it back to amazon is ridiculous.  I am very disappointed in customer support from LaJobi (it took me two weeks to hear back from them) and won't be purchasing anything else from them in the future.
