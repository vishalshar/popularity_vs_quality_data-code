We have triplets and a new baby on the way. Our triplets are 3, but still only 30 pounds each, so well under the 45 lb/seat weight limit. We got this stroller because one triplet walks well, but being able to put the other two and the baby in it was our main goal. We are sadly disappointed and are returning it after 2 uses. It does NOT fold down well. We have a good sized van and it will not fit in the back, and barely fits inside the van at all (even long ways in the isle where we can fit full sized bicycles!) we are unsure if it is just this particular stroller malfunctioning, or a design flaw, but I cannot get it in/out of the van while pregnant, and my husband struggled doing it himself. We hoped it was just because our first trial of it was at the zoo and there were hills, but it did not want to turn well and is extremely hard to push. Today however, inside a medical complex on the flat marble walkway, he still had issues turning it around corners. The front wheels do not want to move well at all, and no, they were not locked because we checked to be sure we had unlocked them when unloading it. It is also very unsturdy and shaky, despite the three of them being over 15 pounds under each seats limit, so 45 pounds under the max limit total. The back seat/stand area is also extremely small and if a child is sitting there, it slides back and forth to where they are hunched over up in under the other seat, it does NOT lock in position. We were very upset and are waiting for ups to pick it up to return in the next day or two. I was hopeful since it has the highest weight limit of any other triplets we looked at, but it's not worth the hassle at all.
