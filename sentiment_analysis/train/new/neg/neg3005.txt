My four month old cries in the car, so I hunted this toy down, hoping it might entertain him.  He loves it...but sadly, the clips are not large enough to attach to the car seat.  I ended up attaching the clips to the retractable hood on the car seat, which somewhat works, but even then the arch is so short that the toys hang right in front of his chest.At that close range, my son can easily pull on the toys hard enough to completely pull the arch off.This is a great concept, but the arch needs to be extendable, the clips more adaptable and sturdier (maybe with rubber lining), and it might even be better for the toys to be on springy cloth attachments to make them more "pull" friendly.I wish I hadn't so hastily cut off the tags...
