I am so bummed about these. They are very cute to look at but they are not sticking to the wall. The paint I am trying to get them to adhere to is eggshell in sheen and the walls are perfectly clean. I have no idea why they are peeling off as I have other decals that are able to stick just fine.Update: Several of these peeled off entirely and fell to the floor overnight. Dang.
