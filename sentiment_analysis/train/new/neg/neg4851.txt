Although, the item arrived on the date as promised, it looked different than what I remembered when I ordered it off of Amazon.  I think it is overpriced for the quality.  I purchased it for cleaning underneath blades on my Magic Bullet and Cuisinart Smart Stick.  It will probably work okay for that but I have not had an opportunity to test it out.
