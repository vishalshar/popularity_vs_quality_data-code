Our baby is 9 months old and in a Britax B-Safe car seat and she can't reach the toys. We're getting a new car seat this week, so I'm hoping maybe she'll be able to reach better when she's less reclined. We'll see. It completely blocks the mirror though, so if you use a mirror to see your baby in the back seat, it's kind of problematic.
