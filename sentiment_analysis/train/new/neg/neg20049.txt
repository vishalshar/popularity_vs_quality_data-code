We were in the market for a new baby monitor and in the interest of privacy I wanted to get a digital monitor.  We picked up the Summer Digital baby monitor earlier this week at Babies R Us.  I could not have been disappointed any sooner.  As soon as I plugged it in I knew it was going to be a problem.  First of all, it doesn't even get close to loud enough to hear over any ambient noise.  Forget watching TV with this monitor on because you won't hear the baby cry.  On top of that, the designers decided to make it so every time you turn it off, the volume resets itself to low and you have to crank the volume all the way up to make it almost useable.  Did I mention the fact that the volume buttons are located on the side of the receiver...inconveniently placed right where you grip it when picking it up.  The biggest problem with this monitor...as if it needed any more...is the fact that every 5-10 seconds this monitor cuts out for a second, clicks, and then comes back in.Save your money and buy the Graco iMonitor digital baby monitor.
