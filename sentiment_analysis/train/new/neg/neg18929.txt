Let me start by saying that this is very colorful and attractive to baby.  The base is also attractive with lots of colors for baby to 'discover'.There is a play thing on each side - crinkly butterfly, mirror, squeezy sound making ladybug, and rattly bee.  It's large - about 38in square so you'll need some room to place it.  The flipside is that baby has plenty of room to play.  You can store baby's toys in there and still they space to play.It has mesh sides for airflow and so that parents can see in and babies can see out.  It's relatively quick to fold away for travel due to a button on each top arm which 'folds' that side.  A very neat idea.  However, that's where the good stuff ends because there are two major flaws with this product.Why do manufactuers insist on producing fabric based items for a baby that cannot be WASHED ???  Why oh why do they not make the fabric removable - do they not know that kids make a MESS ???  Duh !!!  How is one supposed to remove spit-up and drool (and possibly worse!)?It's perhaps the most important thing in any piece of baby equipment; be it a chair, car seat, pushchair, crib, or playpen.  THE FABRIC SHOULD BE REMOVABLE FOR WASHING.The second issue is that the base pad is only about 3/4 in thick.  That in itself is not so much of an issue as the fact that when it's placed inside the playpen, it 'dips' in the middle - by about 1/2in.  The centre strut /leg that holds the pad sems to be lower than the other legs  causing a dip in the middle (and yes it's on a flat surface).  Although baby hasn't yet 'rolled' into the center, it's not very comforting knowing that the center is not flat.  Perhaps the pad should have been thicker - better yet the center leg should have been the same size as the others.For what we paid, I don't think it's worth the money - especially considering that the pad can't be cleaned without using chmical cleaners (which we don't intend to use around baby).
