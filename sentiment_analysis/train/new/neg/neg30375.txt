this is my second Easy Fit Car & SUV shade.  the first works well enough, but there is always one suction cup that won't stick.  Regardless of that, I STILL bought a second Easy Fit sunshade when my second child was born.  The new one is useless.  the suction cups DO NOT STICK.  It's directly behind the drivers seat and the flapping suction cup is a huge distraction to the driver as it can cause you to think something is coming up in your blind spot.I contacted the company and was told to clean the suction cups and my windows with rubbing alcohol.  Thanks - I had already tried that.Going to have to replace it, and it won't be with an Uppababy product.
