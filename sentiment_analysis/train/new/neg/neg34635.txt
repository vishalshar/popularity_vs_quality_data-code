I got this set for my son. I love the classic ninja turtle design. The fabric is a little stiff and not as soft as I hoped. Even after a few washes it is still a little stiff. It's good for a ninja turtle themed bedroom, but it isn't the best. In the winter I would recommend only using it for decor. Put a softer warmer blanket on under it.
