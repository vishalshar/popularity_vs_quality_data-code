This is a really neat pacifier chain--great colors and shapes, holds our child's interest, makes the pacifier VERY hard to lose, and no worries about the product being made in China. That said, I am sad to report that after only five months of use, the yellow bead closest to the pacifier is splitting down the middle. Our child does put the chain in his mouth a lot, but he has no teeth, so my guess is that there's an issue with getting the beads wet (bad design flaw if that's the case) or we happened to get an item with a defective bead. In any case, I hesitate to recommend this item without reservation, and would suggest that if you DO order this item, keep an eye on it for splits in the beads.
