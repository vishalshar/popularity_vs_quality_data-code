I am in the same boat as a recent poster, being that my baby never slept on this mattress for more than a couple hours. I love that it's non-toxic, it didn't have a smell, and it's still waterproof. But it's extremely firm and plasticy feeling and not very comfortable. Even with an organic cotton mattress topper, he still never took to it. He ended up in bed with us. I really hope the next baby takes to it otherwise it was a waste of money. I know plenty of people who buy their babies 20 dollar mattresses and they seem just fine. I could never stand the smell of those things though. The three stars are simply for the non-toxicity and quality, the fact that it's made in the states and not in China. Just wish my son liked it as much as I did.UPDATE: Using this now with my second son, along with an organic mattress pad (not naturepedic) and he sleeps fantastically well on it so it is getting used after all. Just need to buy a pad for comfort.
