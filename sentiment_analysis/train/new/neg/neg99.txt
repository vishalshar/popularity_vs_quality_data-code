i had to exchange my first one due to the glide option being defective - it will glide twice or so and then will stop and the speed light will flash - received the new one and it does the same thing - contacted fisher price and was told that the model they had there did not do this and there was no way for it to be repaired, and so i was offered a refund - i decided to keep the swing due to it's other qualities, and really purchased it to be a swing so the glide option wasn't too important to me, but i was disappointed that my only option was a refund when i would have  liked to keep the swing but have it repaired so it works correctly! i originally ordered this swing based on it's appearance - looks appropriate in our modern home - it did not let me down and was actually smaller in size (a good thing!) than what i had thought. the seat material is extremely soft, the butterfly mobile is darling and can be rotated out if you don't want to use it, which i was hoping for this feature. the swing is a little loud but probably comparable to others, the volume of the music is a little loud even when it is turned all the way down. oh and the seat doesn't really have a recline option, it is a barely noticeable difference when reclined. so i guess my review is mixed and since i based my purchase purely on appearance, and i really do like the way it looks in our home, i can give it an OK rating even despite the other issues!
