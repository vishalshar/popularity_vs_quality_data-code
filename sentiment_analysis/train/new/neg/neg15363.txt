We used Nuby Soft Spout cups with our first son about 4 years ago.  Those were great!  They never leaked even when he threw them on the floor.  They were looking rather worn, so we decided to order these when our 2nd son started drinking from sippy cups.  Nuby has changed the design of the cups and with these new ones when they fall on the floor the lid pops off the threads of the cup and allows the contents to leak all over the floor.  At first I thought that it was a fluke, but it has been happening consistently.  It's so bad that now all I put in them is water since cleaning that up is easier than milk or juice.If you still have the old ones - KEEP THEM!  Do not try to replace them with these new ones.  You will be disappointed.
