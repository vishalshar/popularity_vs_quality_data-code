Works great for small batches. If you plan on making larger batches of food, this probably wouldn't be the one for you. One of the things I didn't like about this set, are the storage containers. They are almost impossible to twist shut. Not sure what the deal is, but I ended up having to push the lids down to get them to close. They are pretty cheap in my opinion!
