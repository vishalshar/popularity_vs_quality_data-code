The camera is pretty large and is very noticeable on our wall since its hanging. The power cord is pretty short too. The video works well at 25fps all be it very low quality at 4.3" display with 480x272 resolution. The lack of red lights with infrared you end up with a good picture but gives a effect that gets darker away from the center of the screen. The audio picks up well and playback works fine. I really dislike the user interface which is very complicated to use. They really could have made this a lot simpler. Added bonuses to this is the lullaby’s you can turn on from the remote and the power saving mode if there is no noise.
