As mentioned by other reviewers this sticker is super cute (4 stars) and a good value (4 stars) but it doesn't stay on the wall (1 star)! Skip Hop should make a better quality wall decal than this!!! I'd rather pay a few more bucks a get a sticker that actually sticks to the wall as advertised.I've had entire branches, leaves, etc. fall off the wall completely. That said, 60% of the pieces stay put, 20% have curling edges that creep back/peel slowly off the wall, and 20% fall off and are a daily frustration. I've tried supplementing with scotch tape on problem edges, and later a non-permanant double-sided (reposition-able tape). Results were mixed...it helps, but not enough. When I reapply and check the next day...it's on the floor again.Like others I am concerned about the choking hazard this presents as the product is designed to go in a nursery and could fall into the crib or on a changing table. Not sure what to do...if exchange it I have to take it everything down and then apply a new set that may not be any better in quality. This product has been more work and frustration than I bargained for...might have to go with boring bare walls.Some thoughts on what else exacerbates sticker adhesive problem: wall should be clean/dust-free, shouldn't be too cold, something other than a matte/eggshell paint (satin/semigloss gets better stick). I also noticed that the leaves positioned on the folds of the original backing are ones that tend to continue to curl on the edged and peel off the wall later.
