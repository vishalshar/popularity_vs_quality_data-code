I bought this bag after owning the Skip Hop Studio. Which I loved, loved loved. They no longer make it in black so I had no choice but to find a substitute.  And this one did NOT measure up. If you are deciding between the two, I'd go with the Studio in Pewter.Pros: This bag is Big. CON: Almost unnecessarily big. I guess for the food compartment. I only advise buying this bag if that food compartment is a big deal to you. It isn't for me and so it just makes the bag too big and takes up valuable room. Even if you don't use it, that pocket isn't really useful for anything else.CON: The material is too plastic-y. This bag looks like a cute purse but definitely feels like a cheap diaper bag. Totally gives it awayThe mesh pockets are not nearly as nice as the pockets in the Studio.The bottom of the bag doesn't have the stud/bead things to keep it from getting dirtyThe stroller clips are very cheap. (Again, not like the Studio)It does have many pockets (One of the reasons I thought it would be comparable...)The Studio may have been a Skip Hop Fluke. But I loved it, I do not even like this.I'm returning this.
