I bought this a month ago was excited , but no, a  BIG mistake.Seat is not deep enough for my baby to seat comfortably, he slides out , he is 10month old. and maybe this is more for like toddler.and this stroller is definitly not for shopping bags, it will tip over with one bottle of orange juice.stroller its self is very unstable. it shakes ,more like it feel like its going to fall apart.the sun window has no cover, you ask me why >????I have no idea, its useless and I hate it sooo much i wish i can return it.NOT OWRTH THE MONEY, GET city mini .BY the way, they are soooo hard to fold, stiff. sometime I need two people to fold it.you cant carry your baby and fold it...its impossible.and this is not for any moms is under5'5 feet tall. so uncomfortable
