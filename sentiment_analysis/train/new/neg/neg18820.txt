My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months, the monitor worked pretty well.  We got a bit of static from time to time, but I would have given it 4 stars.  BUT...one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green "on" light and saw that the monitor was not on.  Thinking it was a fluke, I turned it back on, checked the baby and went to bed.  But, over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more and more unreliable, turning off at will.  It was also hard to turn it back on.  I had to flip the switch several times before it would work. And, this is not a battery issue, since it was plugged in the entire time. I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs.  There's a mention of a problem with the power light going out, but nothing about the monitor itself going out.  Needless to say, we've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand.  I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes.
