It was pretty easy to figure out how to use.  But my baby doesn't love it.  And it is not a hands free carrier.  If you want a easy way to carry your baby and possibly comfort your baby, this will work.  But if you want to get stuff done around the house, this isn't the carrier for you.  The position of the baby makes it pretty difficult to move your arms around too much.
