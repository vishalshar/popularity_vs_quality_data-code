I loved this monitor when we first received it for our daughter (now 2yrs old).  We actually had the older model first, after about a year the light bulb burnt out - which I thought was pretty reasonable.  Since then we have had nothing but problems.  I replaced the light bulb and it immediately burnt out, again and again, they kept shorting out.  I finally took it back to the store and replaced it with a new one (this model).  Thank goodness for babies R us 's good return policy... since then I have returned this monitor about 4 times, each because the light bulb had burned out and everytime I replaced the bulb it would only last a day or two if that long.  I have since thought maybe I was using the wrong bulb and now I can't even find a PR 12 light bulb or equivalent.  It was quite disappointing, my daughter loved it and had a hard time falling asleep with out the light show, it took her a long time to get along with out it. I give it 4 stars for cuteness and effectiveness, but if you really want the light show to work, better buy something else!
