The product is very easy to use.  I just tuck it under my clothing and use it for brief periods while seated at the computer and don't worry about the sticky pads.  The included splitter allows both of us to listen to the same music.  I only use it when baby is already awake, and she responds to it and becomes more active while playing.  However, the reason for only three stars is that the sound quality is very poor for $50.  If I had it to do over again, I'd just buy a decent pair of headphones and rig them to stay in place.  It's not bad sound quality, but I expected it to be much better.
