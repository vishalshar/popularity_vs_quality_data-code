I have several sets of these sheets, and I love the convenience of them.  However, I'm really disappointed in the grey ones.  They are not bleach safe.  Yes, I know they are colored sheets, but when a nasty stomach virus rips through my house and the sheets are covered in vomit, I'm going to add some bleach to the laundry load...  For reference, I use 1/2 cup of bleach with many other higher quality linens with no problems.  I add it to the water before adding the linens.  These completely faded the first time I did it.  I would expect better color fastness for such expensive crib sheets...  This is especially frustrating since these are crib sheets, which by definition are more likely to have vomit and fecal matter on them and are therefore more often in need of disinfecting.
