I had purchased one set from Buy Buy Baby and was so happy with the mat that I decided to buy 3 more from Amazon (we have a large play area with hard wood floor and I wanted to cushion it for my 7 month old), even though these are so expensive. However, the 3 that I purchased through Amazon are different in their quality - within a couple of wipe downs, the paint started fading away. I was disappointed because I spent so much money on these and had high expectations based on my first mat purchase. I like the cushioning and the colors but the fact that within a month, the colors started fading and it started to look so old is really bothering me. I'm not sure if the seller on Amazon stores them differently or what, but the 3 I got from here are definitely different in quality than the store bought one.
