I just got this blanket and I am about to return it. It is much thinner than I thought it would be-- of course swaddling blankets should be a bit thin but this just doesn't seem sturdy or worth nearly the price. When I unfolded it there were deep hanger marks like it had been folded and hung with a hanger that was too tight for much too long. The hanger marks also warped and puckered the fabric, and in one place there was even a small hole. If I'm spending $17 on a swaddling blanket, it should be awesome and soft and not damaged until my child wears it out-- it shouldn't come that way. So I'll stick with my cheap flannel swaddle blankets for now!
