If you're a first time mom, I have some advice. Your sleeping habits will change drastically after your first trimester. I bought this at 12 weeks, and based my purchase on my pre-pregancy sleeping habits. That was a mistake. Use extra pillows until you know what kind of support you really need. Then buy a good pillow that fits those needs. I went back and forth between this and just using extra pillows. No matter how I used this pillow, the support I needed seemed just out of reach. This pillow was a little too small, I'm 5 feet 2 inches tall, and a little too firm. I had absolutely no idea where to stick my arms most of the time. There are a few things I liked, however. This is a good quality pillow though. The fabric cover comes off for washing, and that's pretty easy to do. This pillow does come with sleeping position suggestions, although none of them really helped me. My only complaint about the product itself is that I wish it had a storage bag for when you're not pregnant.
