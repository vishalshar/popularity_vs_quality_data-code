These hang over the window, which was great for us. On the other hand that is their ONLY upside. They do not compensate nearly enough for the slant in the top of the window so they actually are just as misaligned on the bottom as traditional ones. The worst part though is that they RATTLE! I have to put something under it to keep it quiet otherwise it drives me nuts while driving.
