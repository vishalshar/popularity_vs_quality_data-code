They looked and felt great when they arrived. Prepped them for use and wondered where the diapers I purchased went?! They had shrunk significantly and we're no longer as soft. I hope they at least will not disappoint in absorption so that if they do not fit they can be used as inserts - though many other reviews are saying they do not absorb well...
