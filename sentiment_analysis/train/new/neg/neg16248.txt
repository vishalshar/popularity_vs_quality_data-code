When bought, there were no dimensions listed in the product description which should have raised a red flag for me.  When it arrived, I was very disappointed with the size, which was puny for the cost.  I'd estimate that an 8 1/2 X 11 sheet of paper is quite larger than this item.  Definitely not worth the cost or quality.
