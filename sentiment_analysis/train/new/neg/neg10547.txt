I was out of town, where I tend to use disposable diapers instead of cloth. I stop at Target and debated between Seventh Generation and Babyganics. I chose Babyganics, because they had $5 coupon on the package, which made it cheaper than 7th. I also thought chemical free and organic, really could I go wrong . . . Yes, I could. The diapers didn't leak they actually didn't breath either. My daughter got horrible diaper rash from these diapers, pretty much after the first 24 hrs. Once we got home I stopped using them, but my husband put them on while the reuseables we're being washed. About 20 min last my daughter was screaming and I couldn't figure out why. Come to find put, she had peed and the diaper caused a very painful bright red rash. Tomorrow we'll be picking up some more 7th Generation. My poor baby. They also have a very chemical smell for something that's supposed to be free if dyes and chemicals.
