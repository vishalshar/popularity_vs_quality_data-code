Upon opening this item, the cover gave off such a strong formaldehyde smell that I knew I wouldn't be able to wash it out sufficiently, so I decided to look up Organic covers online. While looking at Organic covers, I came across some Organic pads, which informed me that the vinyl used in pads like this is also not good for my baby.I am only so concerned because I have Multiple Chemical Sensitivities and cannot be around anything that emits fumes, so my baby can't either. If you have a very strong tolerance for new clothing, which ALL contains high levels of formaldehyde (as well as does carpeting, furniture, flooring, cabinetry, kleenex, just about EVERYTHING not labeled as organic) and you like the smell of a new shower curtain, (I used to), then this pad is maybe a great bargain for you!For more advice on the chemical dangers of today's modern world go here: NikNice.comOrganic Changing Pad for those who are sensitive like me:L A Baby Cocoon Organic Changing Pad, Gold, 32"
