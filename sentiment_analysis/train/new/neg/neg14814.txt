I purchased this based on the high reviews and at the suggestion of my lactation consultant. When it arrived I eagerly opened it up and started to set everything up. With caring for an extremely fussy newborn I quickly realized that this lactation system was NOT for me. Too much time consuming set-up and clean up involved. If you are a VERY patient, stay at home mom this system might be more your speed. If you are an impatient person, as I am, and need something simple and quick I'd steer clear of this. I never even used it. I pretty much threw in the towel when I realized how much was involved before and after each use. Thankfully I am able to nurse my baby, even if for just a couple of minutes at a time to soothe and comfort her and supplement with expressed breast milk and formula.In summary, I am NOT impressed with the Lact-Aid Nursing Trainer and would NOT have bought it had I known there was so much to keep up with. The price tag is a bit much for what you are getting, all plastic parts and pieces. I think $40-$50 would be more appropriate.
