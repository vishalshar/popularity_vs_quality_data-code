After trying several body pillows, I thought this would solve all the problems I had with others. Most other pillows take up a ton of space in the bed and require you to curl around in a position not great for your neck. This pillow is longer than most, and because you can detach the pieces, is any length you want. Using only the bottom piece while using my regular pillow was very comfortable and eliminated my hip pain for the first few weeks I owned this. I thought it was worth the 2 hour drive to get one when they were released, and would have given it 5 stars after the first night.Not 5 weeks later, the pillow started to go flat. Now, nearly 10 weeks later, it is practically useless, regardless of how many times I fluff it and try to rearrange the filling. This, combine with the cheap fabric on the outside (which made my already-dry pregnancy skin so irritated, I had to "dress" the pillow in a tee-shirt to use it) makes it not worth the price. Just like the Boppy nursing pillow I had, it went flat in no time, and won't be usable for any subsequent pregnancies - I can't even use it to finish out this one. I'm an average-sized person who has gained less weight than I should have at this point in my pregnancy, so it isn't like I'm destroying the pillow with huge legs. It is just cheaply made. I may be able to open a seam and shove in more poly-fil, but for $55, I shouldn't need to.For the design, I'd give 5 stars, but the fact that I haven't owned it 10 weeks and it is already flat is too horribly disappointing.
