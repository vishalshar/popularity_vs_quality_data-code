I bought two of these for my twin boys. The first issue I have is that I've had to replace one already and would like to replace a second one but am outside the exchange period for Amazon. The problem inherent in these is that the battery compartment does not hold the batteries tight enough and the connection gets broken, causing the bouncer to stop working. If we squeeze the compartment a couple of times it puts the batteries back where they belong but sometimes we have to unscrew the whole thing and re-seat the batteries.The second thing I don't like is that this thing eats batteries like nobody's business. Bouncers tend to go through batteries anyway, but I have another bouncer (different company) and it doesn't go through them nearly as fast as this one.My third complaint is that it does not vibrate that strongly. Both of my boys prefer the cheapo no-frills bouncer we were given because it vibrates more.My fourth and final complaint is that the music turns off (and the overhead part stops spinning) after a few minutes. Our other bouncer keeps the music on for as long as we want and that works a lot better.The one thing about this bouncer that I do like is mirrored part over the baby's head. One of my sons loves to look at himself in the mirror, although he does get upset when it stops moving.Overall, I am not impressed with this bouncer and wish that I had bought something else.
