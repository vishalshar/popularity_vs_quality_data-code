The tentacles are a good size for grabbing and my 5 month old son loves the rattling ball. The mirror is kind of non-functional given its placement but it's a fun toy. However, he is now entering the phase of putting everything in  his mouth, and got a tentacle stuck in his throat and started choking. Obviously this is kind of alarming and we don't let him play with this anymore unless we are actively watching.
