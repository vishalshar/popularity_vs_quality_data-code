I guess wipe itself is good for both my baby and my wife.However, my wife complains about the packing every time she uses.It is really hard to take just one wipe. It always has a tendency to come out 2 wipes at a time. She had tried sever ways to take only one wipe but it is really hard to manage it.Is their any way to improve it?
