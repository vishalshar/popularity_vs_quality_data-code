Warning!! I purchased this as to protect my baby from the UV rays in the hot summer sun, that IS NOT what the product is intended for, this should not be called a SUN shield, but a Weather Shield. In the directions there are multiple warnings that you CAN NOT use the product in weather warmer than 65 degrees F, it will create an oven-effect. This is not breathable mesh material, it is a heavy material. You cannot see your child through the window or mesh. This would be nice to use in the Fall or Winter months when it is cold and windy, but don't expect to use it in the summer to protect your little one from bugs, heat, and sun rays.
