I honestly really dislike these spoons. I love the infantino fresh squeeze system, but this spoons suck. They only squeeze a tiny bit on the spoon and if you squeeze to hard it just flys off the spoon. My little man doesn't care for the spoon either. So I just squeeze what we want to use into a small bowl. They case is nice, and over all nice just not a great fit for us.
