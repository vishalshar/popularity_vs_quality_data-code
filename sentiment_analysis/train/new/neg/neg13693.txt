This bottle does NOTHING to help a baby learn to suck. The company calls the first 6 months the 'squeezing' stage. This is so false, babies develop the ability to suck/swallow suck/swallow suck/swallow pause, by day 6. 'Squeezing' hurts the mom, it's the reason moms want to quit breastfeeding! Oh my goodness, I am so disappointed by this feeding system. I had high hopes when they sent me the bottles for review... I was embarrassed that in 2014, a company as large as Chicco did not take the time to properly research their claims with current, fact based evidence. They could have made a really good bottle.Annie VerSteeg IBCLC. RLC
