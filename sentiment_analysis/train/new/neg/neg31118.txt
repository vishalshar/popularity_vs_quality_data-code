Primo high chair does not fit a chunky baby, the lamination is not holding up and I am disappointed in it as I loved the look of it. The height for the baby at the table is way off, so my daughter had to purchase another high chair for her baby. I am going to make some adjustments and hope it will serve as an ocassional use chair here at my house instead of daily use by a growing baby.
