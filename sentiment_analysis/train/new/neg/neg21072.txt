We had this monitor for our first child for 4 years and it worked good except I didn't like that the volume control and the on/off switch were the same so it was hard to get the right volume each night.  That was just a small complaint, though.  Overall we liked it.  Good picture and reasonable price.  Well, it broke when we started using it for our second child so we bought the newer Summer monitor at Babies R Us since that was the only model they carried.  The volume control was awful.  At the lowest setting it was REALLY loud and we couldn't sleep.  We took that one back and ordered the older Quiet Sounds version we had before.....the picture didn't work.  We sent that one back and ordered another....the sound had a clicking problem.  We sent that one back and ordered yet another....the sound had a clicking problem on that one, too.  UGH!  We finally bought a Safety 1st monitor for the higher price at Babies R Us.  It works, but the picture isn't as clear as our original Summer.  What a pain.
