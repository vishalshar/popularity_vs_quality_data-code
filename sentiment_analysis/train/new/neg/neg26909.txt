***UPDATED 04/15/15***Within 6 weeks the straps on this rail broke.  The plastic pieces sheered off where the cloth straps meet the frame holding the vertical rail.  I  contacted Summer Infant for replacement.  Took about 5 days for the replacement rail to come in.  I felt this was a bit on the slow side considering the inconvenience this caused.  Especially having to deal with my toddler falling out of bed because we were waiting on the new rail.  Once the replacement came in, I noticed they were not replacing it with an equivalent.  They shipped me a plain white bed rail vs. the exact same pink plush rail as I originally ordered.  I plan to contact Summer Infant again to get the correct rail sent to me or to get a check in the amount of the the price difference ($12+/-).After reading other people's reviews on this product and having the same issue, I am considering finding a different rail.------------------------------------------We are transitioning our 2 year old from a crib to an adult size twin bed.  This bedrail fits very snug on the mattress.  At 28 weeks pregnant, I installed the bedrail myself, without help.  Took about 20 minutes.  No tools necessary.We have the bedrail about 12 inches away from the headboard.  Keeps my toddler in bed when she is sleeping.  If she (38 lbs) leans against the rail while tossing and turning, the rail does not give.  The rail swings down with easy so I can lay with her during bedtime stories.  Swings and locks back into place very easily.  Very please with our purchase.Only one bedrail included with purchase.  Not a problem for us as we have our daughter's bed along a wall.  The instructions do show how to install an additional rail if needed.
