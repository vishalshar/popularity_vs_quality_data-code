I bought this in 2009, soon after my second daughter was born with the idea that I could monitor two rooms.  In truth, it monitors one room at a time, and it switches between them. The problem I came up with is that at night, I wasn't sure which child was crying. Half-sleep, and semi-conscious, I had to wait for the lights to switch from green to yellow, or from yellow to green to know which room was the child.  I did get a lot of interference, especially during the evenings when everyone would be on their phones/internet/radios, etc... I could hear my neighbors in their phones...At night sometimes, all I would get was just static, which is a blessing for the kids, but annoying to the parents when they are trying to sleep. After a year, one of the receivers didn't even switch anymore, it would stay on only one line. And God forbid, you lose power in the house for a second. The monitors would not restart (even thought they had batteries), and the receivers would just do this high-pitched noise that wouldn't stop until you turn the monitors back on... which means walking into the kid's rooms, and possibly waking them up.
