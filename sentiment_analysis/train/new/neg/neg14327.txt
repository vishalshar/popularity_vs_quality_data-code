I gave this bag for a baby shower gift (mother had registered for it).  I have children also.  I looked through the bag to find out what all the fuss was about.  I'm still wondering.....  My diaper bag that was a third of the price has all the same pockets, snaps, etc.  Is being brown and trendy looking worth the extra $$ ??
