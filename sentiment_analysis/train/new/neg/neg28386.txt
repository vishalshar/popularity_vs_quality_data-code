For the price, this is an okay cover. It is very slim fitting which I like, and it looks very sleek. I do have some complaints about it though:-It doesn't protect the screen. I dropped mine from a sitting position in a chair, probably less than 2 feet off of the ground, and the entire glass portion of the screen shattered. It looks nice, but it's not going to protect the fragile screen of the iPhone 6. It is soft around the edges, but still sturdy so it would probably protect the more important and expensive parts of the phone, and definitely keep the edges protected from scrapes and dings.-There is a little flap over the place where you plug in the charger at the bottom of the phone. I may be being a little too critical here, but moving that to plug in the charger got kind of annoying after awhile, especially since it doesn't really afford that much additional protection.-The two pieces are fairly difficult to pull apart and makes taking the cover off sort of difficult.In conclusion: if you're careful with your phone, this is a good case for a good price. If not, an iPhone screen repair is ~$110, so I would just spend a little additional money on a more sturdy case.
