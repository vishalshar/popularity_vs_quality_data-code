I loved this mobile and couldn't wait for it to arrive.  After assembly I tried to put it on my daughter's crib and found that it wouldn't fit.  The way that the music box/rail attachment is assembled makes it impossible to fit on a thicker crib rail.  I would guestimate that it won't fit on a rail any wider than 3-4 inches.  I contacted the company to see if there is any way to adapt it and they told me no.  I would highly recommend measuring your rail first before buying. If you're set on a Tiny Love mobile the company does make other mobiles with a strap that is used to attach it to the rail.  Otherwise, you'll be stuck like me trying to figure out a safe way to adapt it or whether just to return it all together.
