The design of this crib is pretty clever. That is why it got the second star. However, it was poorly executed. I have attached three examples of poor workmanship, but could have included several more. First, one of the screw heads was filled in with some sort of metal residue (pictured). This made it impossible to use. I had to use another similar screw I happened to have. Second, the wood was scratched, damaged, and/or missing stain in many places. Third, the end of one of the bolts had large burrs on the end (pictured). This meant that the cap part (pictured) of the "locking nut" had to be removed and now that bolt end is exposed on the finished crib. Under other circumstances, I would have returned it. However, I need it now and it is already assembled. You can use the included Allen wrench, but you'll need a screwdriver and a wrench (or socket in my case). I would not buy this crib again nor would I recommend it to a friend. The problems could have been prevented with better quality control or by including extra parts (which many companies do).
