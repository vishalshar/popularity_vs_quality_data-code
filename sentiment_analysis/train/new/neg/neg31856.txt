I have never left a review of any product (good or bad). I'm so disappointed in this product that I feel compelled to warn others. This is one of the worst monitors I've ever purchased. As a father of three and having owned other video monitors I feel qualified to make this claim. The picture is sub-standard, the coloring is constantly fluctuating, and to top it off, the video freezes like watching video on a dial-up internet connection.At one moment I was watching my daughter sleeping (or so I thought) the next moment she disappeared and miraculously reappeared on the other side of the crib - talk about being freaked out. Fortunately, I quickly realized the video froze. The camera is approximately 5 to 6 feet from my daughter, as instructed in the manual. I find it difficult to figure out exactly what I'm looking at. Is it her head or the stuffed animal's.I've learned that video/audio monitors are less than perfect and they are typically good at either video or audio (not both). Well, not in this case, as bad as the video is, the audio is even worse. I can only hear my daughter if she speaks or cries "loudly". You cannot hear normal speaking voices and you cannot hear other noise in the room (sound machines, creaks, etc.). While I don't want normal noise to be amplified, I do want to be able to hear all sounds in the room and to have the ability to control it by volume. I tried turning the volume up, but the static only got louder and further drowned out other sounds. I'm confident that these problems are not due to interference, it's unfortunately just not a very good product.I'm disappointed Fisher Price would put their good name on a product like this. I have no idea if they read product reviews, but I would welcome the opportunity to be proven wrong by one of their representatives.I'm shocked that the other 6 reviews praise the monitor with the exception of battery life. Perhaps there is something wrong with the one I purchased.
