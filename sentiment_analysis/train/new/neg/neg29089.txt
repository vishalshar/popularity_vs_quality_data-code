We received our changing table only to find it damaged (scratched in two obvious places).  Our baby will be here any day and we didn't notice this defect until we had already recycled the packaging.  Plus the thing weighs like a 100lbs and we live on the second floor so returning it was just not an option at this point.  (Amazon kindly partially refunded our order).  I will add that this piece of furniture just felt kinda cheap for the price.  The back is cheap cardboard veneer that you screw in yourself with shiny screws that look super weird against the espresso colored "wood" and does not fit together well at all.  Fine, that side will be against the wall, but still... it just overall had a cheap " less than Ikea" feel to it.  We were expecting it to be nicer.
