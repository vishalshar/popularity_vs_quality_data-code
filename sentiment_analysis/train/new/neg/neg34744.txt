I can't really speak badly about this item but I was a first time mother and thought this was a necessity but think about it unless you are outside for long periods in the winter it is not worth the money.  I think I used it 3 or 4 times and it was very expensive.  Not worth the money in my opinion.  Just one more thing I gave away.
