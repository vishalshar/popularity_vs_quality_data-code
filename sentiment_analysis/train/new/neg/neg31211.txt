I sent this as a shower gift. My friend was thrilled and disappointed at the same time because the container was broken when it arrived. The shipping was not carefully prepared because the whole plastic container was put into a big box without any padding or bubble plastic to keep it from moving or being shifted. Her remark was "I can't believe such a big company is so cheap and/or inconsiderate in shipping item like this" :(
