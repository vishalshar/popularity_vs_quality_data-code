I recently bought the stock car bed for my almost 2 year old son. To get him out of our bed, we thought a racecar bed would do the trick. And it did! He absolutely loves his big boy bed. However, my husband and I were not happy trying to put the bed together. The pieces do not fit tight. The back end does not fit at all. I wanted to return the bed, but our son had a fit. So my husband rigged it together.  So, if I had to buy it again for my son, I probably would. He loves it sooo much. But I am upset that we paid all of that money, and the bed doesn't fit together properly. Oh well, the smile on his face makes it worth every penny.
