My daughter just found out how to open my pantry door, which is located in her "playroom". Which was all safe and baby proof until she learned how to twist the door knob. So I bought these, hoping they would keep her out! Well they do, along with myself and my 13yr old. They work great, I just have very small doorknobs for some reason and these covers are fairly large. Takes a little getting used to how to grip the actual door knob within the holes of the cover.
