I LOVE LOVE this stroller for one child.  I had a surprise 6 months after my first son, with a second pregnancy....so I was lucky this can be converted into a double stroller with the rumble seat.  However, the older child in the rumble seat doesn't have any room and has to face the infant carrier or other seat.  The stroller is super easy to push with one, but gets very heavy in the front and becomes difficult to push and turn with two.  My first isn't old enough for the toddler bar, but hopefully once he is that might be a better set up.  It would be SO much better if the rumble seat could face the opposite direction so the child can see out instead of the back of another seat right in their face!
