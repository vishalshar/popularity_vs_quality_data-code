I've had this stroller for three years now.  I've used it with both my kids (now 3 and 1).  Wouldn't buy it again. Here are my thoughtsCons* Only fit my son until he was 2.  He is 3 now and 35 lbs and there is no way he would be comfortable in it.* Two pieces are VERY annoying.  Getting this in and out of the car for a quick trip to the bank, or a run into the store gets old fast!  It was also cheaper to buy another stroller than to buy the travel bag to go with this thing if you plan to travel with it on an airplane.* Folded it is BIG.  I've got a Passat Wagon and it takes up 1/2 the trunk.* Stroller will tip over easily.  Front wheels easily cause stroller to tip.  If you hit a hole in the road, you could easily dump your kid out of the stroller.* Don't try pushing this thing in the snow.  If you live in a cooler climate where it snows, small amounts of slush will make your stroller unpushable because all the slush clogs up in the areas above the wheels.* Storage space is VERY hard to access when you have the bassinet attached, is OK when the baby seat is being used.Pros* On even payment, pushes and turns like a breeze* If you are in to Style you WILL get comments and looks when pushing this thing, but I personally didn't like this.  I bought the stroller because I thought I was buying the best performing stroller on the market since I walk ALOT.  I have since learned this is not true - there are MUCH better options out there and I always felt like pushing it made me look like a snob.* Baby sits high and upright - my daughter likes that she can see what her brother is doing.  If you push it next to the table, they are close to table height.
