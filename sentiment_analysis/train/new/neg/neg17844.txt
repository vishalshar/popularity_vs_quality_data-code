I own other excellent Withings products (wireless adult scale, blood pressure monitor), but for some reason, this is not cut from the same cloth. This is a disappointing, unstable product.First, It kept switching into kg, so I would have to update the scale.Then, it wouldn't find my wi-fi network (which other devices can find)Now, it won't even reconnect over bluetooth with my iPhone.It says it's good for 10g of accuracy, but it only shows .6 ounces (20g accuracy) differences. Then, on the scale it shows one measure, and on the app it seems to round to a different measure. And in the app, you can't enter fractional ounces.This is not a thoughtful, well made, reliable product. This is an afterthought.(And they don't support Android)
