I spent a long time looking for a convenient sized and stylish buggy organiser. This one has lots of nice features but the quality of the product lets it down. Sadly the Velcro straps undo very easily if you hit a bump or a curb and the stitching in the Velcro on both sides has started to come undone after only one months use.
