I purchased this for my daughter's 1st birthday.  She was not standing, yet, so I wanted it to encourage her to stand up and she quickly learned how to stand up.  So we are pretty happy about that.  But I do have some concerns about its safty.  The beads wire goes through wooden "gates" and my daughter tries to reach for beads through the "gates". And although, she hasn't gotten her self in trouble, if she holds on to a beads through a gate and if she falls, she can break her arm.  Well, luckly, she stopped reaching for beads that way.  But I'm writing this review just to warn some future shoppers.
