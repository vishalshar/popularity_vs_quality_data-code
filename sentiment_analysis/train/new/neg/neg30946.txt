I researched this car seat a lot before purchasing.  I always take reviews with a grain of salt, but I should have listened more when others said this has no padding.  My little guys didn't need a fully padded seat, but this car seat has no padding under the cover at all.  They are just sitting on plastic.  There is a removable seat pad that goes on over the cover, but it moves around a lot and is a pain.  I suggest you spend a little more and get something more comfortable.
