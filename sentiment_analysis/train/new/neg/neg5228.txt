As a caveat, this book arrived damaged, so I returned it and decided to find something else instead.The book was decent quality, and the appearance was nice. I personally liked that it was more understated. I bought the pink rocking horses, and it was a nice, mild pink and fairly sophisticated.The book did have lots of space for entries that I liked and for pictures related to the event, including parent info, prengnacy info, birthdays, growth chart, etc. In the book I received, there was a large sections for babies first, including every major holiday (both Christmas and Hanukah), and also a lot blank first pages to enter whatever you'd like.The only thing I really didn't like about the book is that on every page, it has in small print (probably size 10 font or so) at the bottom a list of "photo suggestions," which is essentially an instruction on what photos to put on the opposite page. I really liked the suggestions, but they are permanently affixed to the baby book, and I'd prefer not to have an instruction manual in my baby book.If it weren't for those photo instructions, I would have loved this book.
