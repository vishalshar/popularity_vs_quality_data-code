I bought these sheets based on the excellent customer reviews.  I have a standard-sized crib mattress and use a waterproof mattress pad under the sheet.  Since day one I have struggled getting these sheets on.  I've only had them for maybe four months, alternating use with another set of sheets and today when I went to put them on, they ripped.I understand that sheets need to be snug, but they shouldn't be so snug that you have to pull as hard as you can to get them on, eventually tearing them.  I'm glad I only bought one set.
