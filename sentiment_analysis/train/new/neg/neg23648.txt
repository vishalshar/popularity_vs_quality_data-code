I bought this toy for my 1 and 1/2 month baby boy - expecting it to be similar to  playskools kick gym (not available now) - which my daughter used to play a lot(when she was 1 month old).In playskool toy the height and width was good - and the kicking spacewas huge - besides it used to play song and move the hanging handles on kick(ie encouragedkicking).In this one -first of all the height and width is too small for even my 1 month baby(9 pounds).Its hard to kick it (as small foot space) - and it only makes small squeaking noise(no lights or moving of top hanging handles) on kick.The only  good thing is the top hanging parts on moving - makes some lights and song. So maybe it willbe good toy  for baby to use with hand- rather then kick toy.
