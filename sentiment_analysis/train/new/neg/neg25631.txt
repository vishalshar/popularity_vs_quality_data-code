These work well and my 11-month-old can hold them fine. But the tops are a bit complicated with the clicking and spinning for disassembly and assembly. Not rocket science or anything, but just more steps in a busy parent's day. I might like them more had I not purchased Munchkin straw cups at Target that I think work better. The Munchkin animal face ones have handles and are simpler to take apart, and I think they're cheaper, too.UPDATE: After some use, I've realized that these Philips Avent cups have two more drawbacks: the straw is shorter, so harder for my baby to get a good mouth grip - she has to tilt her head. Also, the straw required a more powerful suction so my little one doesn't end up drinking as much as she does from the Munchkin ones. I wish I hadn't spend the money on these now.
