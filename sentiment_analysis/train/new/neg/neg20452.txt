I bought this because I wanted to do a nautical theme for my son's room and didn't want to spend a lot of money on bedding.  I didn't want to waste money on the bumpers since I will eventually take them out, so I liked this 3 piece set.  The blanket is cute, just like the picture, but not very soft.  I spent  more money with my first son's bedding and the quilt was a lot softer, however, it was more expensive (KidsLine Transportation).  Not a huge deal though.  What I did find disappointing was how short the bedding skirt was.  I'll have to assemble the bed and see if it looks right (again, KidsLine skirt is a lot longer so I thought it was a standard.)Overall, I'm pleased with how cute it is and the blue and red colors.
