This is just what we were looking for except for a few things...1.  On-board storage is minimal.  The basket is only rated at 5 pounds.  Who goes on a walk only carrying 5 pounds with two kids?  I was thinking that we would use this to walk downtown or to the park.  I need to carry water, snacks, a diaper bag and clothes for if it gets cold.  All that adds up to about 15 pounds.  I have to carry a backpack to make this work.2.  I am 6'2" and the handle bar is just too dang low.  If I don't walk with my arms fully extended my feet hit the rear footplate.  An adjustable length handle bar would correct this.With those two exceptions I like this stroller.  We will how long it holds up to two children 3 and a half years apart.
