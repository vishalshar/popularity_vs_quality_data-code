I was a bit disappointed in this brush. The bristles were not as soft as I thought it would be. My three month old baby was screaming and crying when I used it on her scalp. I didn't know if she was in pain or not but she cried like she was .  She did not scream like that when I use my fingertips to scrub her scalp. I will not be using this on my baby again because she does not like it. Maybe it is better for older children.UPDATE: Baby is ok with it  now ..but I only scrub very gently.  Still not sure how effective it is for  cradle cap but still wish bristles were softer.
