This basket is made pretty well overall, the bedding is really soft. I did replace the mattress and it was very hard to find the exact size of the one provided. The mattress covering was almost too big and seemed like there was a pocket of air between the cover and the foam. It made a loud crinkling noise everytime you put something in it and it didn't seem safe to me. I found a better mattress of the exact size on ebay through a UK mattress maker. I haven't had any problems attaching the hood like some others had and i bought this one primarily for the hood but I actually like it better with the hood off. Overall I'm pleased with the basket, just wish they put the same quality into the mattress..
