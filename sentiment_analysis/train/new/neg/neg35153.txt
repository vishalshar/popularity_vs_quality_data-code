The concept is great...No bouncing, no jumping but smooth & easy spinning,snug fit at the sit area, gender neutral, music and light incorporated and hight adjustable BUT I paid $89.90 for this product and not sure these are the best justifications...My 7 month old likes it for very short periods of time and with assistance to activate the toys... Maybe too early to tell yet? Will see...But what I say is... Neh...I don't know if I would have spent that much money for this little excitment...Music doesn't play long at all...2 tiny little lights flashing on one of the toys...The product's legs have a give at the hight adjustment area which makes them woblely so it makes me nervous for when my child is a little heavier...
