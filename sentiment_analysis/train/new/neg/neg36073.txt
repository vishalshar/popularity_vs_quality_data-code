It is the same size as the mini I was thinking it would be the same size as the ideal co sleeper. There is also a gap between the mattress and the co sleeper that I can not fix.I bought this one because it was the only one that was mesh all the way around. I really wanted that because my daughter like to push her face against the side of the co sleeper at night.
