This cup is good in terms of functionality. It doesn't leak, my daughter can easily hold it and drink out of it (she's 16m). However I am disappointed at its durability. I got this for her less than 2 months ago and already the elmo design is completely rubbed off the cup. I have never once put this in the dishwasher. I always hand wash it. So that's a bummer. I specifically bought this because she loves Elmo. Kind of defeats the purpose when Elmo is almost gone now.
