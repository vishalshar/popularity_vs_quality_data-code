My daughter in law got this stroller for her babyshower gift.  She loves the quality of this but, unfortunaly the front wheel popped off.  While the baby was in it!  Luckly she was buckleted in and okay.  We had no idea why this happened.  In order for this not to fall off we locked the front wheel. The only problem was that the wheel it self wouldn't move.  So, we had to make a few ajustments. This product is very easy for transportantion but, I would be very cautious.  If you didn't buy this product yet I suggest not too for your childs safty.
