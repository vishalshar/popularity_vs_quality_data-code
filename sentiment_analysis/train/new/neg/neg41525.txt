I guess this would make a great winter blanket.  The top part of this blanket is super soft, but the back part is extremely slippery!  Because of the slick material, it locks heat in causing my son to be overheated.  Also, because of the slickness, my son almost slipped out of my mother-in-law's arms!!  So if this blanket is wrapped around your child, please sit with them and not stand!  This blanket snags easily when being washed.  I wash it separately now, on delicate and I dry it on low or just hang dry it.
