I bought this backpack for trips back and forth to Grandma's and Grandpa's. However, for some reason I did not notice the dimensions! So now we have a very cute backpack that my two year old daughter LOVES, (She puts everything in it!) but not very practical for things to keep her occupied on the long car trips to and from the houses! I was going to return it but my daughter likes it so much I decided to keep it.
