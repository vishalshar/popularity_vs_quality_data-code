First of all, the product didn't get here for over two weeks, when it DID get here, the box it came in was trashed beyond reason. I've seen stuff that gets ruined in the mail, but this box was ruined before it was even shipped. The product's condition was like something you would find at a moving sale. When I plugged it in, the lights all worked (blue & red worked barely, & are very dim), but the music player sounded like it had been stepped on or something because I could barely make out the tune amid all the static & crackling. I sincerely regret not reading the reviews before purchasing from this seller. Trust me, the money you save is not worth what you get! I'm pretty sure the person who sells this stuff gets it from thrift stores or at garage sales. DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM HERE!!!
