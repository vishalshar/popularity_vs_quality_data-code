Had high hopes for this product regardless of what others reviewed.  Trust those reviews.  They serve you well.  Now I have two of these devices that easily broke at the plastic hinge.  Nothing unique about us or our toilets that may have caused them to break.  Child doesn't really care much for the toilet these days and it mostly frustrates guests as there's no clear marking on the unlatch levers.  Save your money for another mechanism.  Gave them two stars because the product did function for a little while (two months or so).  Oh, and they're really kind of unhygienic the way they wrap under the rim...goo!
