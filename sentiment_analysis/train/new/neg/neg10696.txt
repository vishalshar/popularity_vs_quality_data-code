I tried to return this item, and as of yet, no one has responded to my request. I believe they should of done a better job in respresenting the dimensions and quality of the backpack. Upon receiving the item I knew that it was too small for my nephew. In addition, I paid almost $50.00 for a product that obviously wasn't worth $10.00. With good reason, I see that since it was originally posted on Amazon that the price has dropped drastically. This backpack is in line for a 2 or 3 year old child. It's marketed as a "Doctor Who 'Tardis' PVC Front 50th anniversary Backpack exclusive Design" but what 2 or 3 year old would appreciate the Dr. Who 50 year anniversary. I believe this producted intentionaly misled consumers into making a hasty purchase based on limited information. Be sure to read closely and understand that the measurements are provided are in centimenters and not inches.
