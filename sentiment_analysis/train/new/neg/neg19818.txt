I bought these to put on my bi-fold closet doors, which my cats like to open. They worked great. Until the first time I opened the closet, forgetting that this thing was on there, and just popped it right off. The cat was nice enough to find the missing part for me, so I put it back together and locked the closet again. Next time I opened the closet, off it went again. This time the cat found the piece under the bed.We did this about a half-dozen times before the piece was lost forever. I don't know if he just can't get to it, or if he got bored with that game, but the cat won't bring me the piece, and I can't find it. So I just have the one broken button on one closet door, one whole button on the closet door, and even the little plastic strap is gone. One of these days I'll have to peel the double-stick tape off the closet doors and throw the parts away.Meanwhile, the cat is still hanging out in the closet...Oh, and it wasn't just me... I put the same item on my grandmother's closet, and hers is now in the same condition as mine.The concept is great... if they could just make it so it's not so easy to pop the covers off the buttons, or a way to help us remember that it's on there so we open it before opening the closet door and breaking the whole thing...
