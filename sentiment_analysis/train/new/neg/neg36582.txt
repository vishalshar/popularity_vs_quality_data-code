Very satisfied, sturdy and looks great. My husband said the instructions seemed like they skipped steps and it took him a while to put it together, but I think that's just part of becoming a new dad.Update; put together 6 months ago, baby is 5 months old now.The crib is great, the part that holds the mattress is not. There is the standard that most other cribs come with, metal with a sort of springy center, this one is like thick cardboard and is bowing now. I got the metal one from a friend but the location of the screws and attatchments are different. It's really unfortunate, its not safe and I can't put my baby in it. She's 5 months now and we cosleep because we can't afford a new crib.
