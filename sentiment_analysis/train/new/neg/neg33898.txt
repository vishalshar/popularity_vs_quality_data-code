I really wanted to like this cup but it has been such a pain.As a mom of four young kids we have been through a ton of sippy cups. This unfortunately is me least favorite. There are so many pieces to worry about, it's a pain to clean and my 12 month old doesn't drink well out of this cup.What I do like about this cup is how sturdy it is. You can feel the quality of each individual piece.
