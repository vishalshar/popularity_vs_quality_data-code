As my baby got older, I needed a faster flowing nipple so went from the stage 1 to stage 2 Born Free nipple. The difference was minor especially when I compared a used stage 1 to a new stage 2 nipple. I realized you could easily stick a knife into a stage 1 nipple, give it a few turns, and produce the flow of a stage 2. Save your money.
