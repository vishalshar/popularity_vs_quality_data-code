Bad quality for the price. Does not fit snuggly on our baby's Naturepedic innerspring. We washed it before we used it, the colors faded very quickly and the sheet was so loose on the mattress that we can't use it in her crib. Between these and the Americn Baby sheets we bought, the american baby ones fit so much better, and are cheaper.http://www.amazon.com/American-Baby-CompanyPercale-Fitted-Zigzag/dp/B009RLKBOS/ref=sr_1_3?s=baby-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1421658465&sr=1-3&keywords=american+baby+sheet.
