Very disappointed with this set, I got the mobile which was very cheaply made and the border that doesn't match the color of bedding at all. Tried to contact seller to return and they have flat ignored me. So I'm out money and Amazon says they'll give me a $30 gift card well I'm out more that $30. The bedding isn't terrible but you get what you pay for. Very disappointed;(. The seller refused to reply to my return request and my claim was denied. So I'm stuck with defective merchandise.
