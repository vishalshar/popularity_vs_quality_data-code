One side of the bags is not sealed at all, so instead of "bags", they are now a piece of plastic, which I have no use of. I bought it once a couple years ago and had exactly the same problem. I was hoping they would do something about it. I really hope I can use them. Just very disappointing. I will have to look for another brand.
