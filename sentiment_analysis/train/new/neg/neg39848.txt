I kind of feel bad for only giving it three stars, but "it's okay" pretty much sums up my feelings. If I could do half stars, I'd give it 3.5.To be fair, I don't really NEED a fancy-looking teething ring--I'm a SAHM so it's not like it matters what I have hanging around my neck. That said, I loved the idea because my 6mo is constantly grabbing at the silver charm necklace I usually wear and obviously she can't chew on that.The pros?+ The actual donut is a GREAT teether. I looked at a lot of teething necklace designs and settled on this one because it was very basic and looked easy for a baby to grasp.+ The breakaway clasp is a neat idea--and works. (Though, honestly, I'm not sure why you need it. Yeah yeah, safety blah blah blah but I just can't see a baby pulling hard enough to strangle you with it or anything.)+ It does NOT get tangled in your neck hair like many of the other necklaces have issues with (as described by other reviewers).The cons?- The string itself is just your basic thin ribbon with not much substance to it. I guess you don't really need that much substance...but it felt a little cheap.- The string--though it appears long--isn't really long enough to comfortably let your baby gnaw on it while you're wearing it unless she is practically glued to your chest. And since it's attached to the breakaway clasp, it's not like you can add your own string (well, you could, but then you lose the clasp). So I usually end up taking it off to let her play with it.- Then...the sting obviously gets wet--and gets wet quickly because she is hanging on to the whole thing--and doesn't dry quickly, so you're relegated to wearing a soggy string around your neck when you put it back on. No, it's not the end of the world, but it feels kinda oogy.So, personally, I probably didn't need this. I'd be better off saving the money and just stringing one of her favorite teething toys (Vulli 2 Pack Vanilla Flavored Ring Teether) myself on some plastic links.
