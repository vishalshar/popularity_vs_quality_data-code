Tried this for our twins when they were around 3 months. We ended up making a mess on one canvas so we saved the other three and are waiting until they are a little older. Someone recommended using a small paint brush to put the paint on the feet/hands. That might help. We just dipped their hands/feet in the shallow tray it came with and a tiny bit of paint but it still made a mess. The canvases are nice and bright. Would buy again just maybe think it through more instead of dipping feet.
