When I first plugged this in, it was one color and quite cute. When I went to change the color, the nightlight started flickering all different color lights, and now it won't stop no matter what I do. It's almost like a strobe light. This will give my daughter nightmares, that is if she even manages to sleep with it on. Thought about keeping it for my next big dance party or rave night, but with a toddler, those nights seem too far off.But it is quite cute like I mentioned, so if you don't get a defective one, you might enjoy it. Only other comments are that the item is not as pictured (there is product writing on the belly of the hippo), and it seemed loose on our outlets, tipping forward a bit.
