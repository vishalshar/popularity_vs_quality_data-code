I purchased the baby Einstein jumper for my grandchildren so their parents didn't have to put a big item in their cars to come visit. I bought it at Babies R Us . It took a while to put it together only to discover that when I went to set the height for the seven month old, the red handles were in a locked position so that they could not move up or down to adjust the height.  I took it back and they agreed that it was a manufacturers defect.  I liked it so I exchanged it for the same item.  Much to my amazement the second one locked in three of the red adjuster knobs.  I was so annoyed.  I took it back and they agreed this was a major issue with the item.  They don't mention that you can not stop turning the knob until it is an exact alignment to the notches on the legs.  If it gets caught in the middle of one it locks and you can not adjust the height ever again.  The whole purpose is to be able to adjust as the baby grows.  I ended up exchanging for a FIsher Price jumper that was put together in 1/4 the time and works great!
