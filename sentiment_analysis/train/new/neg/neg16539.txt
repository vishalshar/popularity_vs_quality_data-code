The bathtub letters and numbers were an instant hit with my grandchildren - ages 2 and 4.  Fortunately, the walls surrounding the tub are smooth so they had no problem adhering.  However, we were quickly dismayed to realize that we could not spell my granddaughter's name because she has a double letter "bb" in it.  The kit only has one of every letter and number - a fact I failed to realize when purchasing it.  Buying two sets would have made spelling names and more words possible.  All in all it was a good purchase.  The kids loved it.
