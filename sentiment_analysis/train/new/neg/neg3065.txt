Its ok. Im not in love with the image on the comforter . It looks sort of pixalated as if it doesn't really blend with the rest of the print.....I'm surprised I'm the only one bothered by this. The Rapunzel on the pillow looks perfect but the colors look sort of old and faded in the areas surrounding her ( that bit of orange that you see in the picture , it really stands out) . As someone else mentioned, the sheet images have distorted lips.... I own several other Disney toddler bedding and never was I disappointed. I have the princesses sheet set and I actually regret not buying that comforter instead.... I'm not sure why they didn't go with the twin and full set print , that one is just beautiful!
