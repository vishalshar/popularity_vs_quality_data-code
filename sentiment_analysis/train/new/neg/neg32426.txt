Adjusted to the smallest size, this didn't work very well with the newborn Avent bottles I have.  It seems like it will be a good fit for the large bottles.  Also, I ordered the one that was to be white, and received a blue one.  I also feel that the storage container for nipples/lids could be slightly larger to fit all of the parts for all of the bottles that fit in the organizer.  At this point, I'm keeping it because my baby is coming tomorrow and I want to get things somewhat organized and this is better than just dumping them in a basket or something.  I'm not sure that I would order again.
