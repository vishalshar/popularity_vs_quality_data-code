As long as its a door that you dont ever want to close, this is a great item to use. But if its a door that needs to be shut periodically, the panda will break from removal and reusage after a couple times. Unfortunately the way it breaks it can not be repaired with tape or glue. We had problems with my son shutting doors on his younger sister, and this was not a long lasting solution since they were bedroom doors which are closed at night. IMO roll up a long towel and drape near the hinge of a door for a more effective, long lasting, cost effective solution.
