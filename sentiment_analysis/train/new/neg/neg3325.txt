Ok but not great and some small pieces broke off too easy just with my daughter playing so its not very safe.  My 1 year old daughter wasn't thrilled but played with it a little on the airplane. The one of the pieces broke off very easily just by my daughter playing with it -- I was watching at the time, she didn't do anything but tug on the things like they are designed to do.I wouldn't buy this again but would try a similar concept if someone made one better.
