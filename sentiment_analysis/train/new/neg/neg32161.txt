2 real complaints, for an otherwise great product. Firstly, on of my tiles arrived damaged. Looks like a heavy box or some squarish object was dropped on it, making a dent in a tile that actually tore through. Secondly, I did not receive the right combination of tiles to make the pattern shown. so the diagonals were not uniform, and no combination was possible that would be. Also, the borders also could not be made correctly (i ended up having to put a purple border on a purple tile, and any adjustments ended up with a similar scenario.)Otherwise, its a decent size, with a good amount of cushioning. I also like that i can always buy a few more sets and expand.
