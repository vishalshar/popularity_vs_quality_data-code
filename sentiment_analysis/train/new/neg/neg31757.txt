My son doesn't enjoy sitting on this as much as he does the potties where you take the basin out and dump it - it just doesn't seem as comfortable.He gets the red rings on his toosh even if he's only on it for a minute or so whereas I've never noticed that issue on, say, a Fisher Price potty.I LOVE the design though, especially for hygiene reasons.If you like this brand or their clean design, look for their toilet seat insert. We have two, one for upstairs and one for downstairs, and my son loves sitting on those more than any little potty!
