These toys are cute, and seem to have a lot to offer a baby.  My baby was kind of ho-hum about it.  I still have it attached to her car seat, and every once in a while I can hear her touching it back there, but otherwise, we haven't gotten much use out of it.  I guess I did have fun playing with it when she was really small (a couple of months).
