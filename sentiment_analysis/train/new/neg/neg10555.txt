Actually broke only 3 or so months after using it.  Additionally, it takes a bit longer to heat-up milk than you would expect especially from colder milk from the fridge (Think 7 or so minutes).  I now either use hot water from the faucet or a solution that has worked well for me in the past is that if you have a cheap crock pot that has a warm setting, you can simply leave it on and the water will be the perfect milk warming temperature all day.  The latter is more energy wasteful, but saves on water wastage when compared to faucet warming and significantly reduces the time to get milk warm when compared to the Kiinde.  The latter point is key with a crying and hungry infant.Ultimately, I would officially rate this 3 stars based solely on functionality, but I'm giving this one star due to my experience and more importantly, after you purchase it, you get an email from Kiinde offering you a discount on their milk storage bags in exchange for a positive review.  I'm not a fan of these practices at all as I think it leads to skewed ratings that leave customers with misguided expectations based on "purchased" reviews.  I rely extensively on reviews and don't appreciate it when I believe manufacturers monkey with Amazon (and other) ratings.
