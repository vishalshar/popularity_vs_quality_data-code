This diaper cover looks really cute, more like little pants than a diaper cover.  But it also functions more like little pants than a diaper cover.  We lanolized it, but it still leaks a lot.  It's also got a very high waist, which makes it difficult for our newborn and his bellybutton.  We're going to use it as our extra cover for the diaper bag.  It works most of the time, but I like the Babee Greens and Loveybums covers better.
