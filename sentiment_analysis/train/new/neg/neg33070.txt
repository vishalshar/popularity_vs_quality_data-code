Durable.  Well built.  This product will fit a standard 135mm rear axle without the additional fitting required for the trailer.  Will not safely fit any axle above 135mm, including the fitting for assessories (total length of the skewer means less than how much of it actually screws into the bolt to make it safe).  I returned this one, and will buy the one 5mm larger to give me space for the fitting that came with the trailer (5mm).
