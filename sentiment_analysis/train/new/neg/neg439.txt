I was a swimmer and a rower, so have broad shoulders so this cover was too narrow for me.  Also it is hard to use a cover like this when you need to check on your baby's latch and position.  I ended up just using muslin swaddles, much cheaper and I just tuck the corner of the swaddle into my bra strap and cover her head.
