UnsafeThis is absolutely the most unsafe rear facing car seat I have ever seen.  Impossible to install tightly... even after finding a way to use my feet pressing against the seat, and my hands to tighten the belt... even after using "rolled towels" as instructed by the owners manual.  This seat in the rear position can easily be pushed from side to side, and in a rear end collision would flip back up against the back seat.  I'm amazed that there are any positive reviews for this seat.  I would love to see a video of this seat properly installed, and tight enough not to jiggle around.
