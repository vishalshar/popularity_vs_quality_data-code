I read a great deal about cloth diapers before my son was born, and came to the conclusion that Fuzzi Bunz were the way to go.  However, after using them on my son for a few months, I decided to sell them all and buy Thirsties, Primm N Proper Baby, and Mama's Simple Solutions diapers instead.  I strongly prefer my current cloth diapers.After a while microfiber stinks, even when it's clean.  Also, if your baby is a heavy wetter, like mine was, you'll need to use either hemp or Zorb.  I currently use either a Thirsties or Mama's Simple Solutions cover combined with either a Primm N Proper Baby fitted diaper, a Mama's Simple Solutions fitted, or a Mama's Simple Solutions flat with doubler.
