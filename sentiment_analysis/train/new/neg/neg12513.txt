I love the concept of this swaddle, the material is the softest out there, and the designs could not be more adorable and tasteful. Other than a regular muslin blanket, this was one of the first swaddles we used on our baby. However, as other reviewers have said, it is incredibly easy to break out of. If your baby is even remotely active, they'll sneak right out of it. Our little one was able to get out of it when she was only a week or so old, and we actually had to tie a ribbon just above her hands to try to keep her in the swaddle. That stopped working when she got to be about 3-4 weeks old, so we had to move on to other methods (the miracle swaddle, specifically, and then the double swaddle using a regular muslin blanket). I don't think we'll be able to use this swaddle again until she no longer needs her arms restrained. I would not recommend spending your money on one until you've ascertained whether your baby is an active one in a regular swaddle blanket.
