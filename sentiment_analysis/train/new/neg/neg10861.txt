Of all the baby products i have purchased from stores or on amazon, these bottles are by far the worst buy. They worked for about 3 months, but slowly they began to turn evil. I'm assuming it has something to do with the seal, but milk will not come out of the nipple 98% of the time and 95% of the time, it leaks. I've had it with them. So much so, that i am writing this review, which is a first for me as far as amazon goes. Expect to have a screaming child and milk everywhere but in his or her mouth when you buy these. Maybe not at first, but give it a few months. Milk on me, milk on the baby, on the floor, on the furniture, etc.etc. I have tried to tighten the lid, loosen the lid, dry the lid, change lids, put less milk in it, put more, beat the whole darn bottle against the nearest hard surface i could...and still, no milk. Believe the other poor reviews these bottles have gotten. I didn't. I bought them anyway and boy do i regret it! I will be headed to babies r us ASAP to buy a different brand of bottle. Spare yourself and your baby the stress and buy something else.
