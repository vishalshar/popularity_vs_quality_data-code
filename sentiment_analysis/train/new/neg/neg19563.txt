The kindercord idea is very cool. I ordered it for my trip to hong kong and china with my 8 year old daughter. It worked awesomely for about 5 minutes (really we were just testing) before some of the fabric ripped. I thought this had to be some glitch... No way they would use such poor craftmanship or weak quality fabric. No time, trip was in two days. I sewed it back up... Product ripped in every which way as if it was made of paper. It finally broke in my purse. Like I said, awesome idea and looks great. Next time they should consider using more than $0.50 to make it. This was like something I get out of the machines for kids that u put a quarter in and a bubble with a cheap toy that comes out.  I want to demand a refund because I don't want a replacement!!!
