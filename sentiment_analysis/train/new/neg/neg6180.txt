I have a 2010 Honda Civic sedan.  I put this sunshade across the rear window, after following all manufacturer's suggestions for preparing the surface, and no matter what I do, the shade doesn't stay put.  The cups lose their suction quickly, or come loose with the slightest breeze.  I'm not sure if this problem is due to the embedded heating elements in the rear window that don't allow for good suction or if it's just not a good quality product.  If anyone has found a way to make the shade stick, I'd be interested in hearing the solution.  It is also too wide (from top to bottom) and doesn't stretch taut.  I tuck it into the back seat as far as I can, but it just doesn't seem to be a good fit. It does provide adequate sun protection, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have a Honda Civic sedan.
