I really needed a stroller that I could fit two babies on it. Although I still own it, I tried to avoid using it unless I really have a need for it which sometimes I do. My biggest problem is the weight (weights about 20+ pounds), also it is a little difficult to maneuver when turning on a corner. I has some good features such as cup holders and canopies that provides shades for the babies. I consider the wheels to be not the appropriate size for the stroller, maybe with bigger wheels it would be easier to turn corners.
