Purchased this product as a gift for my daughters friend who loves unicorns and Despicable Me. We were so sadly disappointed. The unicorn is so small and not fully, it looks like a cheap toy you would get out of a skill crane machine. I would not recommend this product at all unless you want it for decorative reasons but if you are looking for a fluffy stuffed toy to cuddle with go elsewhere because this is not it!The stitching looks cheap and not straight at all its very uneven, the colors are not vibrant and clean they look almost old and faded.
