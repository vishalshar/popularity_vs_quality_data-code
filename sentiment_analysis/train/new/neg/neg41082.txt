I got 4 of these to mount the gate with railings on both sides.  Here's what you get in each package: 2 pieces of wood 5.5" x 1.5" x .75", 2 4.5" bolts with the first inch threaded, and T nuts in one of the wood blocks.Problems:  1. If your railings are 2.75-3.5" thick the included bolts will work, otherwise you'll need to buy new ones.  2. If your railings are shaped so that some parts are thicker than others, you'll need to pad the space between wood block and railing to create a level vertical plane (i.e. the gate isn't tilted vertically).  3. You're paying $5-7 for $1 of stuff.  This is particularly annoying if you're hit with the 2 issues above and have to spend time and money to get it working.
