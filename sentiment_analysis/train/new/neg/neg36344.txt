I purchased this item because I wanted something comfy for my baby that would make it easy for me to tend to him at night. Instead, my baby HATED it. There is no cushion and it just looked so uncomfortable. I think we would have had better luck with a bassinet. I was very disappointed with this item because it seemed like the perfect place for a baby. My baby did not sleep in this once!
