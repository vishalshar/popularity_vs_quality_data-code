I gave a 3 star, because it didn't meet my expectation.  The bottom didn't attach well with my stroller. It didn't cover my babies foot . The cover didn't really fit on top of my stroller as picture or some what should. The zip easy access for my baby to get in and out.. Didn't really work well with the stroller.. So this is not a choice I can try well with taking my bb out..
