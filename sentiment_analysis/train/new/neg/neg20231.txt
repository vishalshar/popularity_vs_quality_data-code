This mirror does not fit Jeep Patriot rear seats. That said I could not find any other baby mirror that did because1) the rear seats are solid (no detached head rest)2) the rear seats seem to be wider than any baby mirror I could findMy solution was to keep this mirror by Jeep (that ironically does not fit all Jeep models) and buy 3/4 inch black webbing.  I used the webbing to stitch additional length on to the strap.  In short you can make this mirror work if you want to, but it will take extra time, money, and effort.Shame on Jeep for not accommodating all models with its line of baby products, I only bought this item because I thought it would work where others failed :(
