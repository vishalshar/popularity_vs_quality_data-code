As a mom of a VERY spitty 4 month old (we're talking waterfalls of spit up at all times!) these clothes are  basically of no use to me. They are actually almost a sweatshirt material, so while very soft and cozy, they don't absorb anything! The spit up basically rolls off of the cloth and onto everything else! My daughter does enjoy throwing them around and chewing on them though, so I guess they aren't a total loss. If you want spit up clothes that really work the flannel diaper material ones are the best, but hard to find as well.
