I am disappointed with this product. I was looking for an alternative to the dr brown bottles in glass. The Dr browns are great, but it's such a hassle to wash all of the little parts of the venting mechanism and now that my baby is 6 mths I hoped I could get away with a bottle wi th less parts. This bottle is made in Mexico and the quality of of the plastic components are definitely significantly inferior to the Dr browns. My main concern however was that when my baby ate the nipple collapsed with every suck.  He is a good eater and I used the dr browns fast flow nipples with the evenflo bottle. I had to keep pulling the bottlw out of his mouth to let the nipple re inflated otherwise he wasn't getting any milk! This led to him sucking in a huge amount of air and he kept burping for an hour after the meal, which has never happened with the dr browns. I guess I'll be washing the dr browns for now until I find a better product.
