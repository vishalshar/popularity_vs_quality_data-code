I'm not sure why this product gets so many wonderful reviews.  It's okay, but in my opinion no better than the cheaper options.  I do not like that every time I use the top funneling dispenser I then have to unscrew and rescrew several lids in order to be able to make another bottle when I need it.  I always feel like I could contaminate the formula powder because I'm having to change all the lids.  I was also surprised by the light weight construction of the plastic.I do like that it's a tall cylindrical shape, like a bottle that can be stored easily in my bag right next to the actual bottles.I wish they could figure out a design where each lid funneled and you could just rotate which compartment is on top and not have to change lids on the empty and full ones.  This apparently doesn't bother most people on here, but I have a 4 year old, 2 year old, and 4 month old and this dispenser is just too inconvenient to juggle when I'm out with all of them in a public place.
