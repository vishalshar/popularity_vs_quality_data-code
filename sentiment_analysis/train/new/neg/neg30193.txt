I have some muslin blankets from Aiden + Anais and love them, so I thought I'd give these a try.  They cost less than the A+A blankets, and I like the colour/patterns, but they're not nearly as soft as the A+A.  Also, they're not square, but rectangular.  This may not be a big deal for some people, but I like the blankets to be symmetrical when the corners are folded down for swaddling, so I don't use these to swaddle--just as light throws when a thicker blanket is too much.All in all, they're fine, but I do prefer the A+A blankets to these.
