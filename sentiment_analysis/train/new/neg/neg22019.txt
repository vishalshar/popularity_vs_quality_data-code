Purchased for my 6 and 7 yr old daughters--they are about 50 lbs, and mid 50%ile height and weight.  The LAP BELT RIDES TOO LOW--on their legs, rather than over hip bones = not safe.  The "arm rests" are deeper than other boosters so it might fit a larger child, but NOT a 40-50 lb child.  I purchased to fit 3 across the back seat of my Toyota minivan because the reviewers said it was narrower.  It helped for sure, giving us an extra inch, but an adult still had to buckle and unbuckle the child because with booster seats, the buckle has to be reached outside the seat (as opposed to a harness carseat).  Advantages: v-cut base, fits in contoured/captains chairs; 15" width is narrower than most.
