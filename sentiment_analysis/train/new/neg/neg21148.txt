I purchased this and another set for my twins. Arrived on time in a nicely packed reusable storage bag. Overall the set was rather functional and the colors you see on the photo matched my set exactly. My favorite piece was the quilt, it was small enough for my daughter to pull around although it wasn't the most plush blanket, the quilt in the Classic Pink Paisley Crib set was better. I love the color theme better than the Paisley set, too. Bright colors. If you use a waterproof pad underneath the fitted sheet, prepare to fight trying to get the sheet on. Though it does fit, didn't fade like the other set, and I still use it on and off after two years. The ties on the crib bumper popped off the moment my daughter learned how to use her hands. I did not use the valences, the pillow, toy bag, bib (very thin material), and gave away the diaper bag. I honestly thought I'd use everything, even tied the diaper stacker to the crib, but nothing was ever touched. For a tight budget this is a good buy but you'll be disappointed if you expect super plush material.
