He LOVED this toy, and so did we - until the battery went out. There is no way to replace the battery, so we bought another one - and the battery went out again in less than a month. And not just out, but over the course of the week it gave sick/weak attempts to make noise, rather pitiful to listen to. No exposure to water for either one, although possibly some drool? Not so much that I would expect to kill the battery that quickly. It was disappointing for our little guy, who really did love to press the buttons for sounds.
