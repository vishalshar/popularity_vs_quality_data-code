loved this toy for about 2 weeks....until the sound stopped working for no apparent reason. The lights work even though the music isnt functioning--we changed batteries and checked connections but still no sound. For some reason the music will randomly start working again for a few hours every couple of days (just to taunt us, perhaps?) but most of the time it doesnt work at all. The walking feature is really nice and my son loves the songs--when they work. He gets upset when the music stops working, but even with the lack of sound my son still tolerates being in it because he likes the mirror and the ability to "walk" along the track. The toy is big but attractive and was pretty easy to assemble...like i said, we loved it until it stopped working properly. Most of the time our piano is silent, and for this reason, I am rather disappointed with the product.
