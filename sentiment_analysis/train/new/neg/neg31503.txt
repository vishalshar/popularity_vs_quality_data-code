I recently purchased for a baby shower gift. When I received the items, i thought the material would be much softer. Instead it felt rough. I'm hoping that with a few washings it will soften up. The booties I felt were rather large, but the baby can grow into them. The turtle details were super cute and a big hit at the shower.
