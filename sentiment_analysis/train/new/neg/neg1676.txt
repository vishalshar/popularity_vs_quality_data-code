We have had this swing for the last two months when our baby was one month old. If you have other things like a bouncer, a playpen, a bassinet playpen, a rocker etc. then finally if you want more, then buy it. Our baby only uses it rarely when he is either already sleeping or is in extremely good mood. The best use we have for it is that we can put it close to us in our home office where we can keep our baby close to us and we don't need to put him in the bassinet. But given the shape of it (which makes the baby's neck hunch, just like car seat), I prefer the bassinet or the bouncer. I find the bouncer much more useful, engaging and portable. This swing is most space-conscious (it takes the same space as a large  office chair) compared to any other swing of similar functionality and probably easier to move as well. But not very comfortable to move. A set of wheels would've been a good idea. As far as the swinging goes, you can orient it in many directions, which is good but even the lowest speed is too fast. My baby sometimes wakes up when we put him in the swing rather than the opposite that should happen! Overall, if you have nothing more important left to buy, buy this as well. But, you won't be using it much.
