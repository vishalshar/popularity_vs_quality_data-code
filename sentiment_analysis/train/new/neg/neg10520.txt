My wife and I were so excited to find these bottles. Our 14-month-old son looked ready for some kind of sippy cup, and we had already tried a number, including Nuk, which made sense given his preference for the Nuk 10-ounce milk bottles. No dice--sippy cups of all assortments annoyed him, mostly because for some reason he doesn't like to tip his head back to drink (with milk, he's usually reclined in bed in the morning or in a chair in the afternoon, but we didn't want to turn every drinking moment into a reclining event). So, the interesting thing is how quickly he took to a straw. Once we discovered he loved to sip liquids through straws, we purchased these.We followed the directions carefully, and the assembly/disassembly is not terribly onerous. So, you ask, what was the downside? Well, unless you want to boil, dry, and autoclave the straw every week (if not more often), you WILL have mold and mildew issues in the straw. I'm not sure if it has something to do with the chemicals the straw is made of, the fact it has a one-way valve that limits airflow when the straw is sitting, or something else, but hot, soapy water, blowing the straw out, and air drying did nothing. Even bleach won't completely stop it, and who wants to risk their kid drinking bleach residue? We found mold growing in the straws of four different bottles by 24-48 hours after washing (we did verify the mold was completely eradicated immediately post-washing, and scrubbed the insides of the straws with pipe cleaners). The sanitary issues were too much to stomach--I didn't want to accept them, but all the brown/green colonies growing in the straws were just too much to risk. I do think it's related to the one-way valve in the straw and would recommend against STRAWS with one-way valves for parents.
