When I first received this stroller and took it out of the box it was not what I thought it would be, but it was just going to be used at my moms house so I kept it. About a week or so I noticed that it ripped at the seam where the back of the seat connects to the side.I called amazon and was giving an refund. I still needed a stroller so I decided to order the same stroller but in a different color. When I received the pink stroller it looked like a totally different stroller. The material was completely different and it came with little zip up pockets on both sides. So far no rippes on this one. If you decide to get this stroller don't get the gray one.
