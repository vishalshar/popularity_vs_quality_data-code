I like the idea, and I give them four stars for the delivery (ie, manufacture and packaging) of these crayons.  But I only give the crayons themselves three stars because, well, these types of products are really only good for a very short time, and there are much better options for bathtime amusement out there.  My little one is very creative, and LOVES to draw, so I thought, what better than something to draw in the tub and shower?  As other reviewers of this and similar products have said over and over (and which first-time users like myself turn a blind eye to) they're just not worth it.  In the best case scenario, they'll last a dozen or so baths, leave minimal staining and your child will turn to some other toy.  For us, we created a bit of a monster, as our daughter really, truly loved having crayons in her bath, so as soon as a color turned to mush, she started asking for more.  But we quickly realized that we'd go through packs and packs of these things if we fed her habit, so we had to do our best to distract her with other bath time items, endure the odd tantrum when she realized she wasn't getting more, and wait for the phase to pass.  It did, but I'm still trying to get the last few visible remnants of her artwork off of our acrylic tub.  Not fun.
