I rely on Amazon reviews a lot, and usually they lead me in the right direction. I thought it should have a review that wasn't five stars, because I'm not sure why everyone gave it that. I found a very similar book at target tonight for 14.99, and got home to receive the one I had ordered, and felt really disappointed. There is nothing wrong with it, necessarily, it's just not worth the money. The pages are very basic, and the cute pictures are where you are meant to post pictures, so they will all be covered up anyway. There isn't really much space for things that happen in the first year,  but there are two pages dedicated to immunizations (1 whole page) and diseases (rubella, measles, mumps and whooping cough- rubella? let's hope not!)- seems strange in a limited space and event baby book.There is also a long page at the beginning for a family tree ( that I think a lot of the books have) but it's written with specific blanks that aren't going to fit a lot of families- one grandmother and grandfather, 4 siblings and six cousins. Those just aren't the blanks I'd choose, we have remarried parents, and I don't really feel like my cousin's are that important in my child's baby book, but I'd like to put our baby's cousins in the book.If you want a very simple book, that you fill in very specific traditional blanks, then you may love this book. I just found it disappointing.
