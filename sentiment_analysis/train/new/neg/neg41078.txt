Looks better in the photo than in person. Its small and material is cheap. Has no velcro closure. Theres nothing fancy about this bib. Its way overpriced!!! Once washed it looks awful. Try to iron it to remove wrinkles and still looks bad. Save your money and buy a different one. Bearington's bibs are nicer and run about the same price.
