The tub definitely provides a good cushion to keep your baby protected and to transition from a smaller infant tub to the big tub.  BUT if you baby is in that in between stage where they've outgrown their infant tub but they aren't 100% stable on their own, this may not be the tub for you.  Prior to this, we'd been bathing my son in the 4Moms Infant Tub which we were able to do in our kitchen sink.  It was great.  We were standing up and had easy access to support him with zero worries about him drowning.  Now, we are hunched over, trying to keep the kid upright, manage all of the bath items (wash cloths, shampoo, head-to-toe wash) and actually give him a bath.  Is there anything really WRONG with this product?  No.  Is it super easy and convenient?  No.  Maybe all of the transitional tubs are difficult to use but this tub made me long for the days of bathing my son in the sink with the 4Moms tub.  Also, as another note, it has a 'convenient hook' to hang it for drying.  We have an arched curtain rod (which gives extra room in the shower) but it prohibited us from hanging it off the curtain rod (the water would just go all over the floor).  We managed to hang it in the shower itself (rather precariously off the showerhead) and it was 90% dry by morning.  I don't hate the product but I certainly don't love it.
