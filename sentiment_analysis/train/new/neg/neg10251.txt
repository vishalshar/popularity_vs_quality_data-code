I bought two 8-11yr size for my 6 and 8yr old daughters. I was super excited when the package finally arrived in my mailbox. It wasn't until I had my daughters try them on did i noticed there was a problem. The neck was not wide enough to slide on their bodies from the bottom up without breaking the thread in the neckline. I wound up taking the threading out of the seat in order to sew velcro inside of it. Thank God the leotards were simply for a halloween costume and not for actual dance class.
