These cups might be great for some kids, but our daughter hated them. She ended up only being able to use straw cups initially, and then later started using soft spout sippys as well. She's nearly 2 now and still uses straw cups and soft spout sippys primarily(although we are starting regular cups too).The only reason we kept these is because the cup part with the handles is separate from the lid/spout part. When we had issues transitioning our daughter to a sippy cup from a bottle, we let her drink from a regular cup. This worked well since, without the lid, it's essentially a regular cup with handles. We didn't have to do this long, since it didn't take long for her to transition to a straw cup (from a bottle) once we tried that kind of cup.Ultimately it worked out since I read that hard spout sippy cups are not great for mouth development in babies and toddlers.
