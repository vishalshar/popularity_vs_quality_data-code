This diaper bag is super cute and very durable. However, I find it difficult to get things at the bottom of the bag easily. it does't open very wide, so I sort of have to wedge things in and then struggle to get them out. The fabric is not very flexible, which is a blessing and a curse in terms of it's durability vs. it's ease of use. The pockets on the inside and outside are a decent size, but the ones on the inside eat into the overall space inside the bag.
