It works well as a battery booster, but the case is a bit bulkier than my previous Morphie case.  Aslo, it comes in two parts.  The inner case that your phone goes into and then that slides onto the battery booster case.  The inner case is REALLY difficult to get back off the phone (I need to remove it to slide it into my armband).  You practically have to break your phone or the case to get it off.  I just noticed that the glass screen on my phone is separating a bit on one side and I think it's from trying to pry this dang inner case off of my phone.  If you will never need to remove the inner case from your phone, this probably won't be an issue for you.  But, if you need to frequently (or ever) remove the case, I would think twice about getting this Maxboost case.
