We received this "security Blanket" and  are disappointed.  We got it for our little one to use in his crib and it just wont work for that!  it has velcro on one corner of the "blanket" and as we all know velcro is SCRATCHY! and can poke a baby in the eye, face,  etc and simply not safe for babies or toddlers to sleep with!  Also, the stitching on this is not even, in fact its jagged and the result is a rippled and crumpled blanket.  I will post pictures later.Buyer beware!  It does not list in the description that this has velcro on one end, if it did we would not buy it!.  We paid $7 for it so its not worth the time or energy to return it and we will have to remove the velcro and cut the tags and see how it holds up.Save your money and get something else, we will get the Tiddliwinks (Target) as it is usually a quality  buy for $10 on sale and we will stick with those from now on!
