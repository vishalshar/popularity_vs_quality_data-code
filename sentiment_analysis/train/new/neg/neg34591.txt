This seat looks as amazingly well made as all the other Orbit products but the fact that you can NOT use the base once you face forward really hit hard. Our initial intent was to continue to make use of the seat base which resides in the car but that goes away once you face the seat forward... at that point you are not gaining anything by staying in the Orbit systems... and at that point there are too many other car seat available with much better reviews for the fact that they recline; something that seems to be a huge factor and something that was lost on us when we researched the Orbit car seat. So, we are buying a Britax Boulevard 70 CS Convertible Car Seat and saving 0ver $100 doing so.Sorry to not be using Orbit because we have really enjoyed the stroller and infant car seat. We will REALLY miss being able to swivel our girl in and out of the car because that is such an amazing feature but she is now too big and needs to face forward so that joy is a thing of the past.
