Camera emits a very large and bright power symbol as well as a large and bright circle of red dots. In a completely dark room it's enough to wake a toddler if s/he starts to stir, instead of going back to sleep.It's nice that it comes with a wall mount for each camera but their range of motion Lis very limited, especially in the downward direction (like towards the bed for example). See attached photo-- this is the farthest you can aim it downward!The pan and zoom feature is really just zoom. You can "pan" to where in the stationary image you want to zoom, but you cannot move the camera remotely. It stays in whatever fixed position you physically place it in. Image quality isn't great.The temp reading is annoying because the max temp is 86. So all summer long it's been flashing and beeping with a warning message that the temp is too high, but I can't do anything about the temp and I can't turn that feature off.There are 5 preset volume settings; a dial is much better so I'm disappointed with the 5 fixed volume options.Buttons are hard to press. It just feels kind of cheap.Battery life on the parent unit is a joke. Has never lasted through the night, not even once.I had a Summer infant one I liked better that felt like better quality.
