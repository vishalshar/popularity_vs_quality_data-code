This is the most important thing you need to know about this diaper: If your child has loose poo, beware using this diaper, even with liners.I swear my daughter waits until I put this diaper on her to poo and nearly every time, the poo works its way INTO the 'pocket' part of the diaper. See, the insert is attached and in the center, where you shove the insert in, is a big hole so wide, its hard to keep covered with an added insert. The end result is poo in very hard to get out places and its very frustrating. Let me tell you, if I had bought this at the full price, $24 and change, I would have been on the phone to amazon trying to get my money back. At the sale price I picked it up at, 14.95 it was a loss I was willing to take though because the patterns are very cute and if my daughter had solid poo, I dont think it would be such an issue to me.Also, these are a little on the large size, but thats okay for us because my daughter weighs over 30lbs.All in all, just buy with caution. Decide whether you will be okay with the potential risks (ie being a little too big or the poo issue)
