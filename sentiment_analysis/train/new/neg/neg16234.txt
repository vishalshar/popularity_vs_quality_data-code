These are honestly the worst bottles I have ever purchased! When I was pregnant with my son I was looking for a different bottle as all I ever used was playtex drop ins. Well let start with the complaints. First I formula feed and we use powder (as do so many other moms) and the ridges and crevices on the nipples hold dried milk. Its a mission to clean them. I have gone through so many nipples its crazy cause they don't come clean. The blue ring (which they no longer use now) is HORRIBLE with holding dried milk as well. It doesn't matter if you wash the bottles an hour after use or you forget it in your bag for a day it is a nightmare to clean. Lets talk about the nipple stages! Boy are they way off. Do not follow the age guidelines or you will choke your baby. My son is just over a year old and is still on stage 2! That according to them is a 3 month old. Are you kidding me? They leak if you barely tilt them its just crazy.I tried to switch my son and he wouldn't accept any other nipples so I had no choice but to continue to use them. I am now due with another baby and I refuse to use these bottles again.
