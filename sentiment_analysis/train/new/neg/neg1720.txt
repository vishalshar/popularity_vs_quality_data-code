Very disappointed.  It was almost perfect and just what I wanted - but it shrinks by many inches after you wash it (even when washed in cold water and dried on low heat). It shrank so much I could not use it at all on my standard full size crib. So this has been a complete waste of money for me.  If you have a situation where you can use this out of the package, unwashed and will never have a baby around it then you will probably be very happy, because it is nice and simple with with frills or ruffles.  Or, if your crib is slightly smaller than standard, then it may work perfectly for you.
