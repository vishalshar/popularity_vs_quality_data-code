I was so excited about this infant seat from all of my research.  When it came in the mail I was thrilled by the quality of the product, how comfortable it seemed for my baby, how light it was, and most of all the safety features.  However, it doesn't fit very well in either my 2003 Honda Accord or my husbands 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  To fit this infant seat in either one of our vehicles it must be behind the passenger seat, and the the passeger seat has to be pushed so far up that my knees touch the front dash (I'm 5'4").  Totally disappointing!
