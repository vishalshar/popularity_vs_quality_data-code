I have used a Nuby bottle before that had an appropriately sized flow hole in the nipple for cereal feedings and I loved it. The whole reason I had purchased this new bottle was to get a larger feeder and to get a new nipple as my old one had worn out and was tearing. To my great disappointment, the nipple that came with this bottle had a hole that was supposedly for the feeder, but the size of the flow hole was the same as my formula bottles' nipples, and was no where near large enough for my infant to get cereal or baby food out of no matter how runny I made it. I ended up cutting a larger hole in the nipple myself, which completely defeated one purpose for getting it as the new nipple has started to tear as well. The larger feeder was also a disappointment since the vacuum disk seems too tight in the feeder for it to push the food up the in feeder as the child sucks on it.
