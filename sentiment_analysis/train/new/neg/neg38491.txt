I received this as a shower gift and loved it. However, after cranking it up once a night every night, it quit when my daughter was ten months old. The crank won't work, and the music won't play, and numerous calls to the manufacturer have not yielded any results. For a thirty dollar mobile you would hope it would last more than a few months.UPDATE................I must admit that after contacting the company, Dolly, they very quickly sent a replacement music box for the one that had broken. They were very friendly to deal with and the shipment was prompt, I'm so thankful.
