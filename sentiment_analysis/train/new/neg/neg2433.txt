Firstly u strongly believe if this device was not faulty I would have rated it five stars. The suction on the pump is excellent. Easy to use, just sit back and relax.However this pump did not last long. If this pump was used 25 times, we got plenty uses out of it. I bought this pump for my sis in law. After using it twice the pump started cutting off. Every time she put it back on it would cut off in less than a minute. She decided to stop attempting to use it as her milk production wasn't that great anyhow. She put it back in the box and handed over to me. I had my baby two months after her. After one week if me using it two times a day I started having the same problem. At time the pump refused to come back on after it had just trip.So u now have a hardly been used costly breast pump packed up in a box.And as I am an overseas customer returning it is not an option for me as it would be very costly.
