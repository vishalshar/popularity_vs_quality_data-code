The idea of the swaddle itself is great, but I just bought this a few weeks ago for my 4 month old and it doesn't stay shut anymore. The area that the velcro attaches to, on the left hand side, won't adhere to the velcro anymore. My daughter is able to get out of it because it just opens up now as soon as she makes any move. I wish it worked longer because it would make my life easier. I now am trying to wean her out of swaddling, but the naps are MUCH shorter. I also ordered the large size in another print from the same company. She wiggles her arms out of this one through the top. I have only used it a handful of times, so it still closes, for now.
