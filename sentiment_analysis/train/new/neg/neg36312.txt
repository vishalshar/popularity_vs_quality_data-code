We usually use Grandma El's with our cloth diapers, but I'd heard good things about CJ's and wanted to give it a try.  The CJ's is OK.  It helps heal a red bottom, but not as quickly as Grandma El's.  I also found the texture to be quite grainy and wonder if that's normal.?  The grainy texture disappears after it's applied, but it feels odd.  I also chose the "warm vanilla cake" scent because it sounded yummy.  Unfortunately, I'd describe the scent as "cheap vanilla candle."  I wish I had better things to say about CJ's, but it just doesn't hold a candle (ha!) to Grandma El's in terms of effectiveness.
