I love the idea of a bassinet but this is just ridiculously small. The area in which you lay the baby in, only measures 10.5 inches across. My baby weighs 7 .4 pounds at 1.5 months of age (1% on the growth chart) and cant even stretch his arm out wide. It is, however, long enough to put a grocery bag at the foot of the bassinet with the baby in it. It also comes with attachments to the stroller. For the price it is, I'm not sure it's worth it for how long we are able to use it for.
