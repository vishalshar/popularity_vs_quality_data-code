The bedding set is very pretty but the material its made out of is paper thin i can literally see the "padding" inside of it and the sheet is so thin i can see the faint design on the crib mattress through it. also all the embroidery has loose strings and frayed bits, on one of the decorative wall hangings there was actually a chunk of the "padding" sticking out and i had to pull that off in clumps. no tear in the actual item, it looked as if it had just been sewn together with a bit sticking out.i do like the item for the pattern and the fact that it has so many textures the chocolate brown is actually a suede like material and thats a nice contrast. i just expected a bit more from an item that was supposed to have originally cost $259.99 the overall craftsmanship is lesser quality i would say than the $40 bed set i got for my son from walmart. also the quilt is VERY wide like 4-5inches wider than the crib mattress. no big deal at all just thought i would let future buyers know.Shipping was fast ..
