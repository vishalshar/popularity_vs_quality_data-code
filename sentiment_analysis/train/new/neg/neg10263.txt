I bought this thermometer about 6 months ago and loved it, but lost it so needed to purchase another. The second time I used the replacement, it stopped working and would only read 190F +. I returned it and bought another one hoping that it was just a fluke since I have liked my original so much, but the this one wouldn't even turn on. Am returning it for a refund and will try to find a different brand.
