I decided to make my son's baby food. These containers are great. I love the marker that comes with it too. They hold up in the freezer and fridge and are able to go in the dishwasher.Update: I have had these containers for 3 months now and I am extremely disappointed. Several of the lids have broken. Yesterday I was simply opening one of the containers and the lid broke. I will NOT be buying these again. It's such a shame because I really liked them until this started happening.
