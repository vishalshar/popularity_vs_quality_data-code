The bottom of this playyard is a little instable. It only has one part in the middle that holds the whole mattress. Next to that I think that the mattress itself is hard to put in. When its in it doesnt cover the whole bottom, leaving small gaps at the head and toe. Putting it up is easy, and the color combination is pretty cute.
