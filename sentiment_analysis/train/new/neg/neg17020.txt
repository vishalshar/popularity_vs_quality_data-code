Here's what I like: The fabric is REALLY soft and cuddly, which means my daughter instantly fell in love with the stuffed animal. It does have a backpack, so in theory she could store things (we'll see if that actually happens). The pack fits nicely around my 2-yr-old.The Cons: The strap for the parents is a deal-breaker. I would have returned it, but I realized I had another "Safety First" strap that I could sew on instead, so I kept it. The strap it comes with is furry fabric and pink. So in other words, there's no WAY my husband would wear it, and I felt a little silly too. But worse is that the strap that goes around the parent's wrist is huge and not adjustable. So it would easily fall off my wrist. I would have to hold it in my hand, which is just not feasible in every situation. Kinda kills the safety aspect. Also, the pack is not technically machine washable. You can only wipe it clean with a cloth. That doesnt work for me, because I like to have things clean for my child, especially if they are using it to romp around public areas. So, I'll probably throw it in the wash and hope it doesnt fall apart :)Overall, I decided to keep it because my daughter loves the snuggly pink puppy and I was able to rig it to work. Otherwise I would have returned it. I think the Eddy Bauer monkey is probably a better product, but if you have a girl, they will love this pink puppy.
