I bought one of these from Amazon... the lights and music didn't work.  Sent it back, and drove to babiesrus to pick up another one.  Same thing: lights and music didn't work.I thought I must be doing something wrong, but I had my husband try it, different batteries, etc.  No go.  Babiesrus said it must have been a "bad production batch".We kept it since my son likes the mirror, but I wouldn't have spent so much money for a plain mirror!I'd choose another til they work out the quirks.
