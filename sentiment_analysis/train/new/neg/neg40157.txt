my 19month old son had a problem with getting off the bottle. well, now that i bought the thinkbaby trainer cup my son loves it!! however, it DOES leak!!! my son sucks out of it like a bottle and doesnt really use it as a sippy cup. he thinks its just a replacement for his bottle and still relies on it to go to sleep, soothing for him i guess.  just dont give ur son or daughter this cup if they have nice clothes on and if you're going to an event..because like i wrote earlier...IT DOES LEAK! ~kat~
