My son used this cup for less then 1 month.  He wasn't especially hard on it, but considering the fact that he's a 1 year old he does drop the cup.  One of the handles broke when he dropped it.  I ended up returning the cup due to the broken handle.  If you are purchasing the cup for an older child the seal is great and I loved the cup.  I just didn't like the fact it broke right away.
