I bought this item (actually, I bought 2) for my 45# 4yr old and my 55# 6 yr old. The seats are comfortable enough, but the seat belt positioner doesn't keep the seat belt in place and it always slips out. I am returning this product and exchanging them for 5 point restraints which are safer. This way, there will be no way the seat belt can't work. I'd recommend not purchasing this seat.
