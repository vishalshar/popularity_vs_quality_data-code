I had to return these - they reeked of cheap plastic! I couldn't possibly make my or my friends' kids eat with these on. I have been buying the Baby Bjorn versions of these for 5 years for everyone I know with a baby shower, and these are a cheap rip-off! The plastic is half the thickness, the scoop part doesn't stay open (once smashed during shipping smashed forever), the neck loop doesn't lock as well, and the plastic SMELLS! It is worth the extra $5 to get the real thing in the Baby Bjorn versions (and I usually buy generic, so it takes a lot for me to recommend a name brand).  UG now I don't have a baby shower gift!!
