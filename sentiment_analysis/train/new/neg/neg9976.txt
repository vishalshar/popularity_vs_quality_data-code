The bib does keep baby's chest dry, however, since it is flexible, the 'pocket' does not open far enough to let all the food fall in it. Another problem is the wideness : the narrowest point is supposed to be at arms level so the toddler can extend his arms forward, but it is cut so high, it makes no sense. Consequently, the widest part is at arms level and the bib is in the way. Third problem : the neck adjustment : my toddler is 17 months, the bib is already at its largest adjustment and there is no room for growing. I had already bought the rigid Baby Bjorn bib with a pocket, should have bought a second one instead of this one. I gave it 3 stars because HALF the food did fall in the pocket. With the Baby Bjorn, ALL the food falls in the pocket, the narrow cut is at arms level and there is plenty of room for the neck to grow.
