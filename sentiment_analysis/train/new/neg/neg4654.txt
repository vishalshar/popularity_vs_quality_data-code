I really wanted this to work because I think it is a great idea. Sadly, though, my daughter didn't have much of an interest in it. She loves to chew on similar things and has her favorite teethers, but this is definitely not one of them. She didn't really use it much at all when I wore it and I would end up why I was wearing a teether around my neck if it is not even going to be used! Honestly, though, I believe I am the only one who knew it was a teether because it does look like a nice necklace.It is probably the black color that is the reason she didn't really want it. All her other teethers are real bright colors, which are a lot more fun to look at!
