My three year old daughter is tall and thin.  She weighed 26 pounds at her last doctor's appt (last week).  In her gymnastics class for three year olds, she looks to be about four inches taller than most.  Due to chronic UTIs, potty training has had a few set backs, but we are finally making progress.  She has some Hanna Andersson panties, but after a few accidents, we decided we needed some training panties first, and started with these.  The Hanna panties are around 18 dollars for three pairs, and the training panties around 25, so I wanted to try this cheaper alternative.  I ordered the 3T, and received a pink pair, a striped pair and a flowered pair, and they are cute, and the fabric is soft.  However, they look a little like boy shorts (underwear sold for women that somewhat resemble tight, short legged boxers).  And the big drawback, the legs are tight.  As I said above, my daughter is thin, always in the 95% for height, and around 40% for weight.  She tried on the striped pair, and said, these are shorts, so she tried the flowered pair next, and said, these are tight and shorts too, and so she put on the last pair, the pink ones.  She said, I guess I'll just call them shorts, and off she went to go play with the Barbies again.  So while they seem to be pretty nice, if you are buying them for a child who has a little baby chub on her legs, these probably aren't going to fit at all.
