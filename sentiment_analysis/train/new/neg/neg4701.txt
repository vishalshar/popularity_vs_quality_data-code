We purchased three of these banister guards for the banister surrounding the tiled stairway our split-level home.We had hoped these would be pretty inconspicuous, but we could tell pretty quickly upon opening one up that they weren't going to be very attractive. For one, they're not totally clear. Secondly, they reflect light. Thirdly... they're just big sheets of plastic (obviously) - but somehow we imagined that it would look nicer. Nope, they look like a big sheet of plastic.Plus, installation is a bit weird. It involves using a super chintzy hole-punch and zip ties (plus screws, for the end posts against the wall.) Zip ties also aren't great looking.So, we ended up returning these and simply sewing a fabric banister guard that ended up being much cheaper and much more attractive (and it didn't take very long at all.) Because, if you think about it, all you need is a rectangular piece of very sturdy fabric, well attached to the banister. (Though I take NO responsibility for that last statement, proceed at your own risk! A fabric banister guard could be a death trap, what do I know; it just seems to have worked for us.)So, these weren't right for us, but they would probably work well to keep your banister safe - you just may not end up liking how they look.
