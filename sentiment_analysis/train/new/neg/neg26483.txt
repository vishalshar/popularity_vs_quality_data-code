Honestly, I thought these were adorable and what a great idea!! However, my baby does not sit still for me to keep these in place long enough for an entire diaper change! The way my baby squirms these are usually on the floor or NOT covering the fire hose at some point (and some days it was at that crucial moment when the flood gates opened). Honestly, I give it 1 star for a great idea, and another star for a cute pattern... but I say cover the weewee with a wipe! It works just as well, stays in place thanks to being wet, and is easy to throw away if it does get sprinkled on!
