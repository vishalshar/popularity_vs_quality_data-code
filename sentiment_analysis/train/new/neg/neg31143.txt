I'm torn as to whether to rate the product poorly or not b/c of this, but I want to bring it to everyone's attention...these could be more versatile. Our house is 7 years old and I feel like our closet hardware is fairly common. It is the white wire shelving with the thin bar that is part of the shelving (as opposed to a separate thicker pole like I've seen in some older or custom houses). There are too tall and the distance between the shelf and the "pole" forces these to hang crooked and not slide freely.
