While I do like the final look of this crib when assembled, getting it to that point was a nightmare. The first one that I ordered came with a number of the the panels for the changing table with holes punched through them.  I got a replacement but with that one, one of the two crib rails was improperly cut so it wouldn't fit as it. After deciding not to go through trying to get a replacement part I decided to try to fix the part myself. I was able to fix this on my own with a set of $10 wood chisels from my local home improvement site. And at this point the crib does look good.While I ended up liking the look of the final crib, the trouble with the quality of the parts isn't worth the hassle even when it is deeply discounted
