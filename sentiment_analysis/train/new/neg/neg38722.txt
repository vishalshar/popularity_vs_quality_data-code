I bought it to be helpful when I am travelling. I didnt want to juggle a bowl and a spoon with a squirmy baby when on a flight, But Alas!! this product failed badly - If you press lightly - the puree wont come out and If you apply a little more pressure it just sprays the puree all over. You have to keep the pressure balanced - not ideal when you add a baby to the equation.
