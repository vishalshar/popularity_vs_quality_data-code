This was smaller than I thought.  I have a bottle bag from Kohls but the zipper broke on that.  I was looking for a bottle bag that would fit an ice pack so I could bring it to daycare, and also with an extra compartment for food. -- I use Avent wide mouth bottles.  3 bottle fit, but the extra compartment is not big enough to hold baby food containers.  The zipper also sticks on this, so I returned it back to Amazon.
