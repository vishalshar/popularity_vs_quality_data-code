Great looking potty training seat, goes with anything and isnt annoying to look.  My daughter just didnt think it was comfortable.  She would get red marks on her thighs from the seat after sitting on it a short time, and complained of it being uncomfortable and pinching her skin.  The grippers on the bottom and ease of cleaning were nice, but my child just wouldnt use it because she was never comfortable on it.  She is tall for her age and this may be better suited for potty training a small 2 year old.
