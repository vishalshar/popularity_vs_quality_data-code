I thought this would be about the size of an average bathroom garbage can, but it is smaller.  I didn't want the prevailing mesh style bath toy storage and wanted it in the room but not in the tub so this fit the order.  The design concept of a drainable inside layer is great, but it could be about 1.5-2 times bigger.  You cant fit too many toys in there, it's as if you need two of them, but then spending >$40 to store toys that didn't even cost that much is a silly price point.  This grey should be called tan...it is quite brown/beige to be called grey and thus does not match any of the actual grey in my bathroom!  At least it is modern and simple, not loud and childish like all the very toys you are trying to put away!
