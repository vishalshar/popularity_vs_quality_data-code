These are some of the best plates I've found so far. Unfortunately, I had high hopes that the non-slip and edgeless features would keep the food on the plate and the plate on the table. No such luck at all. (see cons)While they are easy for my 1 year old to flip, pick up, spin, and otherwise dump, they also are the ones she actually eats off for more time before she starts playing with them. They also actually get clean in the dishwasher (top rack, vertical orientation like a normal plate) which is super awesome!Pros:Perfect size for my 1 year oldGreat colors and good sized divided sectionsQuality product - no sharp plastic bits or rough seamsThey get clean in the dishwasher - the depressions are all curved so food doesn't get caught in corners or suchMy 1 year old likes themCons:My kid pinched the section divider and picked it up in about 2.5 secondsTHEN she slid it to the edge of the table and flipped it casually[edited to add:] After about 6-7 months of use, the plastic is showing some wear and tear, specifically pitting. If I don't rinse all the food off before they go in the dishwasher, the dish doesn't get clean... so I'm essentially washing them by hand and considering putting them aside for camping/travel use only.
