This animal bag is a clever solution to the problem of storing overabundant stuffed animals and it worked for a few weeks before the bag split along a seam, the zippers are excellent but the sewing on the seams is not strong enough.  It is not an inexpensive item and I am disappointed that it has fallen apart...
