So I got the bed today and was so excited to put it together for my little man because I think its super cute!Packaging was awesome I got it out the box nothing was broken!But the frustration begin soon after taking the bed out the box  when I was screwing in the middle board to hold the mattress nothing was labeled which would of made a world of difference then the smaller boards to also hold the mattress would not stay in place at all I tried so many different ways trying to hold them in place and it was not happening at all not to mention none of them were the same size which is the reason why they wouldn't stay in place!So I finally just screwed the bigger board all the way in and had to slide the lil ones into there right place and they still kept coming out!That was the most time consuming part of putting the bed together the head board and foot board was pretty much a breeze when I got pass the boards to hold the mattress!Then I went to go put my son mattress on and as soon as it touch the boards one of them broke so I'm not happy about it at all...So I'm going to be contacting the company tomorrow and see if I can get extra boards because all I did was lay the mattress down and it broke I couldn't imagine with him sleeping on it!If I wasn't pregnant I would pack it all back up and return it but I guess you get what you pay for next time I'll pay the extra buck & get better!
