I bought these bassinets for my daughter and my newly grand daughters (twins) and both boxes came with missing pieces, I bought both of these bassinets at $39.95 and the next day they went up to $119.95 which is $80.00 more, are they crazy. I would not put my cat in these death traps that are missing peices and parts. I refuss to make it work or rigg it and then putting my grand children in it. Maybe the company should do what is expected and send you a complete order and supply you with any missing parts and not have to send the whole order back after you have tried to put it together and have it half way done, that is stupid. I am not happy at all and the money was and is not the issue, it is the crap that a company will sell you then you can sit and spin!
