It's a sippy. This isn't rocket science.  The only thing I don't like about these are the lack of an air-intake.  My son will drink from this but every 4-5 sips i have to pull it out of his mouth (which he is NOT a fan of) to let air back into the sippy so he doesn't break a blood vessel in his mouth from sucking so hard. I would recommend finding a sippy with more than just the holes on the mouthpiece to save the headache.
