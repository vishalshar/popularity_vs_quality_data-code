The straps on this car seat are oddly arranged.  The across the lap straps are spaced in such a way that the straps come up over the top of the thigh rather than across the waist.  The strap opening is very low on the over the shoulder straps... when you have the car seat in the rear facing position, you are only supposed to be using the very lowest opening. The over the shoulder straps begin way down in the middle of my baby's back. My baby is 9 months, but he is tall and heavy, so we are still rear facing although he weighs 23 pounds. The straps are adjustable, but only once you are using the foward facing placement.  The car seat looks nice, and although I have complaints... my baby does seem comfortable.  He is happy to be in this bigger seat as he can now see out the window.
