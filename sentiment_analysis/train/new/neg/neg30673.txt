Adorable and my 10 week old daughter loves it.  She looks at it and smiles at it.  Unfortunately though after just 2 weeks, the clip started to not work.  It's lost it's spring tension and so it doesn't grip strongly anymore.  Disappointed about that.  Hasn't been due to any wear and tear either as my daughter doesn't yet even try to reach for her toys.
