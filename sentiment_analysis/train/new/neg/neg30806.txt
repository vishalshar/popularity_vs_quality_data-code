Bought these for the beach, and our 11-month old loves them. I love that they are not made in China! I do wonder about their durability - before we even used them, there was a huge crack in the biggest (red) bucket, which prevents it from holding sand/water/etc. I'm pretty sure it arrived damaged, and I just didn't notice until we got to the beach. I'd order another set if they weren't so pricey!
