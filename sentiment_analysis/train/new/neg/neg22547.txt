I purchased this product because I was looking for a nice wooden toy for my baby. In the picture, it looked very nice with vivid colors and well handcrafted. However, when I took the toy out of the box, it was very disappointing. Not only were the colors completely different in hue, they were dull and faint. The non colored blocks were also a strange brownish color. The worst part, though was that the pieces had rough edges and places were splinters were coming off !! I couldn't believe it !! This was supposedly a toy for a 12 month old baby who would surely put these pieces in his mouth and grab the pieces with his hands, risking getting a splinter in his skin or cutting himself. Since I live out of the country, I had to sand the rough edges myself and sand off the areas were the splinters were. The colors then faded even more.. However the product can now be used by my baby. It's a shame because the idea behind it, is great. The company just needs quality control of their products.
