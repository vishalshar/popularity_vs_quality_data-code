This thermometer is okay, but it doesn't consistently turn on when I first put it in the water.  Sometimes I have to lift it in and out a couple of times to get it to stay on and give me a temperature reading. Another negative is that it doesn't have an on/off button. Once I get the bath at the right temperature,I can't turn it off and let the baby use it as a toy, because as he lifts it in and out of the water, it blinks on and off, wearing down the battery.  The Babies R Us brand turtle thermometer doesnt' have these issues and I plan to get another of those when this one dies.
