I am kicking myself for not reading the 1 star reviews.  My 1 star review is giving too much credit.  UGH!  What a ripoff!  Seriously!?!?  All these are?  Tiny animal tissue paper cutouts.  If you own a Cricut, do it yourself for a couple bucks.  Or forget the cutesy shapes and just cut small squares from colored tissue paper.  Take the 9 bucks and buy yourself lunch at In N Out.  You'll still have money left over!!  And you'll leave satisfied instead of feeling like a total fool.
