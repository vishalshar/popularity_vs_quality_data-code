These function great as storage for puree and foods, but please don't advertise them as 7oz containers when they can barely hold more than 5oz.  I specifically bought these because I needed a container to hold 6 to 8oz of solid food for our baby's meals.  I'm back to defrosting and cleaning two containers of food for the additional ounces of food.  Annoying.
