These are cute, but way too thick and short. They're hard to hold for both grown-ups and little kids. The spoon doesn't comfortably fit in my 2-year-old's mouth, and she's in the 99th percentile of size for her age. The handles are too big around for her hands, too. Even though it's cute that it matches the bags, I wouldn't buy it again.
