I ordered this item and it arrived broken (shipped via FedEx). I was frantic to get a playpen setup for our new puppy, so I immediately ordered a second, identical playpen and that one ALSO arrived broken (shipped via UPS). We have had the same UPS guy for years and items rarely arrive broken, so I can't blame the carrier alone. The connectors are plastic, and several shattered in transit (perhaps this has to do with the fact that it is winter and the plastic is made brittle by the cold, but perhaps not...). Now I have two heavy playpens to return, plus 4 extension units that currently connect to nothing. I think we have about $600 worth of useless playpen in our living room right now.
