I purchased this product hopping that it would stop my 3 year old from sucking his 2 middle fingers (a habit since he was about 3 months old). We told him it was Spider-Man's glove which helped prepare him to put it on. It worked for about a night with the single strap. By the next day, he figured out how to take it off. So we tried 2 straps (as the manufacturer recomends). This worked for about a day and then he took it off. We tightened the 2 straps one tick more, and this worked for about a week (unfortunately it was too tight and caused a lot of chaffing). In school, the teachers could not adequately dry it , and he got a fungal infection on his fingers. Breaking skin, and it spread all the way down his hand. Obviously at this point we removed the product. The broken skin and blisters certainly discouraged him from sucking for a couple of days. But now he's back to his habit 100%.
