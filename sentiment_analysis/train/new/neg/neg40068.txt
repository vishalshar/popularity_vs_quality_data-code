My son was such a DROOLER while teething!! I finally decided to try an amber necklace to see if it would help cut down on the number of wardrobe changes we had a day. My husband and I swear we did see a reduction in the drool, but who knows if it was just coincidence. Anyways, we stuck with this necklace for about 2 months at which time my son realized if he pulled hard enough he could get it off.  It wasn't worth the risk any longer and we stopped using it.  But I have it tucked away for baby #2!
