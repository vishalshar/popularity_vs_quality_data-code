I ordered this as a combination diaper bag/purse about a year and a half ago.  My normal purse prior to having children was rather large, and after reading the product description I felt this bag would be great to combine everything into one.  I would have liked to view it in person prior to purchasing but that wasn't an option.  Had I seen it first I probably wouldn't have bought it.  The amount of storage in the bag isn't what you'd think you'd get in a bag this size.The bag consists of three sections, with the center section being by far the most spacious.  One of the outside sections is used in lieu of my purse (that now only contains my wallet, keys and cell phone), while the other two are used for baby items.  The two outside sections are tall, but narrow, and would be much more useful if they extended a bit more away from the bag.  There is quite a bit of space in the outer sections, but the zipper on top is restrictive in terms of allowing you to find what you're looking for (especially if the middle section is stuffed full).  The middle section is pretty terrible in terms of organization.  They include a removable insert, but for me it eats up too much valuable storage space.  I am constantly digging for whatever it is I am looking for, nothing is just readily available.I have kept the bag this long because of the price I paid.  I now have two kids under two and am looking for something else that will easily attach to the stroller, as this one will not.  The construction quality is great - the material on the body and inside is very nice and has held up well - but, the straps do not appear to be real leather (they have started to crack and peel).  This bag is great for throwing a few things in while on the run, but not (for me) as the one and only purse/diaper bag.  Overall, I like this brand, but not this particular style and I would not recommend it to a friend.
