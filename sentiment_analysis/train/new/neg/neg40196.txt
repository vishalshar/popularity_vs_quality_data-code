I wish so much that I had read the reviews of this stroller before I registered for it.  A friend recommended it to me and I went ahead and registered for it without reading up on what other parents had to say.  I've had it now for 10 months and it is driving me CRAZY!1. Poor Steering: There is something about steering this stroller on floors that are slippery.  We didn't have this problem in the beginning, but I suspect it's because we used this stroller outdoors on the pavement.  The plastic wheels wore down to a point where using it indoors (like a mall or stores with linoleum floors) is impossible and so frustrating.2. Frustrating Open and Close: Opening this stroller has given me some serious bruises on my shins.  The way you have to flick the stroller open with so much force is awkward and annoying.  And the fact that you have to use two hands to disengage two separate clasps is infuriating because you have to do both at the same time or else it locks back into place.  Closing the dang thing is even a bigger joke because you have to pull up with two hands, kick down with one foot, and still have to bend over to fold the thing up.  And after all this, it's not even that light!!3. Storage Basket:  This storage basket is a serious joke because the opening is so small you can only really stuff soft things like clothing or flat things like a cereal box into it.  Plus the cheap plastic sheet that separates your stuff and the road is not very effective.4. Hanging Your Diaper Bag:  If you've got a messenger style diaper bag rest assured that the handle will not serve you well.  Your diaper bag will slide down and crush the sun shade.  if you've got a diaper bag with handles forget about it.5. Sunshade: It will only cover the very top of your child's head if they are completely reclined.I HATE this stroller so I'm writing to warn all prospective buyers: look for something else!
