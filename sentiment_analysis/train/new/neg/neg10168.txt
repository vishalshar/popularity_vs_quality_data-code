I purchased this for my 7 year old son who has ADHD to help him from chewing on his collars.  I did not think that he was a heavy chewer, but after giving him the necklace he asked if it wouldn't break if he chewed on it.  I told him no, that it was safe for him to chew on and it wouldn't break apart.  Apparently he took that as a challenge and within 10 minutes of him chewing on it, he was able to bite a good size chunk off of it.  Guess I will need to look for a more durable chew necklace.I would recommend only for people who know that their child is not a heavy chewer or are under close supervision until you know that they will not bite through the necklace, but I think this is a warning for any device that is marketed as chew-safe for children.
