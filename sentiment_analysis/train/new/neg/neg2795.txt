I really wanted to like these.  I wanted to extend my investment in my Born Free bottles so I got these "trainer" spouts.  When they came, one of the spouts didn't have much of a hole at all in it - I would need to take an x-acto knife to it to make it usable.  I tried the other one that looked like it would work, and my daughter happily sucked away at it for 10 minutes.  The only problem was that she didn't get a drop out of the bottle.  It's impossible to get any liquid through - it's basically a glorified pacifier.  I didn't bother to send it back because it's more trouble than it's worth, but I don't recommend them to anyone else.
