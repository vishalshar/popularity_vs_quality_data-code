My sister had a pod seat for my niece, and she seemed to love it, so when I saw this one online, I thought my little girl would love it.  While the tray that is included with place mats and a toy is a nice touch, I was not that pleased with the actual seat.  The foam is coated in a very slick, slippery coating that makes sitting up difficult for my daughter, and the dip in the back of the seat is very shallow.  I was hoping this one would have a deeper dip in the seat and a more powdery coating on the foam to facilitate sitting upright, like the one my sister purchased.  Instead my daughter slips and slides everytime I use it.
