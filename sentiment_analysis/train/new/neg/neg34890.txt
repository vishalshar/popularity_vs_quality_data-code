Thanks to the "diagnosis" of a flat nipple when my daughter was born, nipple shields have become my best friend.  I love that I can still offer my baby breastmilk by way of nursing, even if she can't latch naturally.  This was my third nipple shield I got, because I like to have backups wherever I may need them; I have one in my bag on the go, one in my bedroom, and one in the living room.  I got a Medela nipple shield in the hospital, and the base was shaped more like a kidney, so that her nose would rest on my skin while she fed.  I did not realize when purchasing, but this one is fully circular.  Because of that, my daughter's nose now rests on plastic when she feeds and she has a harder time staying latched.  She squirms and chokes as the plastic covers her only airway of her nostrils.With that being said, I love my other Medela nipple shield with the nose carve out as it has a long nipple and my daughter can easily nurse.  I recommend to skip this version, but check out the other one, if you are in need.
