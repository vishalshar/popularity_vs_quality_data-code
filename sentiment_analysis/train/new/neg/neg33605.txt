Based on the reviews, I thought this was some sort of miracle chair. My daughter hated being in this from day 1. Admittedly, she was NOT an 'easy' baby (also hated her car seat and snugabunny swing), but she never was able to sleep in this, even if she was already asleep when we placed her in it--she would immediately wake up screaming. So of course trying to set her down for a few minutes even if she was awake didn't work either. While the material is soft, it is not especially padded or cushioned. It doesn't rock very easily either. Overall this was a waste of money for us and I wish we hadn't bought it.
