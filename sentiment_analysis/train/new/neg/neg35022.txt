i thought these would be nice to have when I've premade a bottle before heading out the door. My main complaint is that they do not fit over the blue and white pieces that come with Dr. Brown bottles, so you have to have a separate bag to keep them clean. Also, the nipples don't fit over it either so it's really only functional use is for storing a bottle in the fridge in which case I only ever keep one fridgerated at a time so I do not need 4. Good quality and fast shipping though!
