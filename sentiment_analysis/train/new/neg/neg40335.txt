These cups are ok- they're good to stick in the diaper bag for "just in case". They do tend to leak from the straw, especially when shaken. My girl loves her seltzer and anything carbonated will ooze up the straw. But they work in a pinch, and a little leak is better than the whole cup being dumped on her (because she likes to do it herself!) :)
