I BOT THIS BABY MONITOR FOR MY DAUGHTER IN SEP 2013. THIS WAS FOR HER FIRST BABY. BABY WAS BORN DEC 20, 2013 @ 10:20PM. SHE DIDNT COME HOME FROM HOSPITAL TILL THE 23RD OF DEC. CHARGED BABY MONITOR LIKE IT SAID TO, TURNED IT ON. IT DID NOT WORK. WENT OUT TO BUY NEW BATTERS FOR IT. STILL DOESN'T WORK. CAN'T RETURN IT CAUCE THE LAST DAY TO RETURN PRODUCT WAS THE DAY MY DAUGHTER WAS IN HOSPITAL HAVING HER BABY. THIS WAS A GIFT. MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE OPENED IT & TRYED IT OUT FIRST. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO RIP OPEN PACKAGEING TO MAKE THE GIFT LOOK LIKE IT WAS BOT FROM A YARD SALE. SO NOW I'M OUT THE $80 IT COST TO BUY THIS MONITOR AND I HAD TO SPEND $120 BUCKS TO BUY A OTHER MONITOR. THIS REALLY SUCKS. I WILL NEVER BUY ELECTRONICS FOR GIFTS FROM HERE AGAIN..... IT'S A LOT CHEEPER IN THE LONG RUN TO BUY IT FROM STORE THAN IT IS FROM HERE......
