I have to admit that I selected two of these chairs for our twins because Phil and Ted's is known for their thoughtful, minimalist design.  Perhaps these chairs are a bit too minimalist.They are constructed of quality material, but offer no support for the children who sit in them.  Their backs rest against a metal tube which is the frame of the chair.  The bottom is only connected to the frame through the fabric, so the design precludes back support.In addition, the chairs are secured with wing nuts that tighten to the underside of the table.  While they are very strong, they are exceedingly difficult to remove. In our chairs, the metal pad that distributes the load of the bolt to the table often falls off when removing the chairs.Perhaps most aggravating is the inability to properly clean the fabric since it cannot detach from the metal frame. It's no secret that babies can be messy.  Soft foods and liquids seeping into the nylon fabric (and foam in the bottom) is inevitable.  Spot cleaning is not sufficient for cleaning these chairs.  The only success I have had so far is to completely soak them, including the foam in the seat.  Because of the foam, they do not dry properly and risk developing mildew.There isn't much they could change in the design to address these issues without virtually remaking the design.  A liner would be of great benefit, especially if it offered some back support.  Everything we have used to line the seats with interfere with the safety strap system.  But then, the straps don't stay on babies shoulders well and either come off on their own, or are easily slipped off by a baby.I wish I had better things to say about this product.  We've owned our chairs for over a year, and whatever virtues they had when new have disappeared entirely from my memory.
