I looked far and wide to find an eco-friendly stuffed animal for my son.  I was happy to find this little cute monkey.  But, after only a few months, the threading that links the head to the neck is showing A LOT.  Frankly, I don't know how long it is going to stay connected.  It wouldn't be a big deal if this toy was played with a lot or my son had had it for a long time but that is not the case.  It's rather disappointing.
