So...I absolutely love this bag! But I'm sure you're wondering why I gave it 3 stars then!?! Because it would be perfect if the shoulder strap was the appropriate length! This first of all is a diaper bag which means you need both your hands! I would and should be so nice to put this across your chest and have it stay comfortably at your hip! But the strap is TOO short!  :( so instead it's on your shoulder like a purse. Other wise the bag is incredible and the amount of space is awesome!!
