Pros & Cons of these bottlesPros- low price- BPA free- wide mouth makes it easy to dump formula into bottle- lid snaps onto bottom of bottle, so you don't lose it if you are out and about and feeding your babyCons- The bottles leak when not in use.  I had an entire 4 oz bottle of water dump out in my diaper bag.  Lid and nipple were both on correctly.  It is from the air vents at the base of the nipple.- The bottles leak while feeding your baby. If one of the air vents happens to be down, milk pours out of the base of the nipple.  It does better if you rotate the vent more to the side, but it still leaks some.  I would never feed my baby without a bib or burp cloth when using these bottles, or he would be all wet.- It would be nice if they included a set of faster flow nipples for when the baby gets older.  I haven't been able to find these at any local store...only on-line.- Formula dispenser is not a good shape for getting formula into the bottles.  Formula powder spills everywhere when you try to dump it in.Conclusion: I nursed exclusively for the first 6 months, so I started using these 3 months ago.  I probably won't switch, since we will be on to cow's milk and done with bottles in 3 months, but if I had it to do again from the start, I would buy different bottles b/c of the leaking.  I tend to use the Medela bottles that came with my breast pump more than these.
