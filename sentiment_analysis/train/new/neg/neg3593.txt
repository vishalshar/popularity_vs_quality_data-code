This diaper was much bigger and bulkier than I thought it would be. It's supposedly a one-size, but my daughter is almost 4 months old and it's too big for her.  With an extra insert or liner for absorbancy, it might make a good overnight diaper, but I haven't tried it yet.  Hopefully she will grow into it, but I just don't like the bulkiness on her right now.  I would not recommend this diaper for babies under 6 months.
