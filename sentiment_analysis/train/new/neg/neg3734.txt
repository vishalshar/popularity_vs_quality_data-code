well the mirror can break and thats bad.... you cant have the lights without the music which is lame... and the remote broke after 3 uses so if i turn it on i have to move my seat and flip the switch off and on, and that makes me mad but i did not feel like returning it AGAIN. but my son does like it so if he falls asleep when it is playing the first time its cool.
