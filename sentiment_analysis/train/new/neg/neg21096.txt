The product works well to have my child eat at he table with us without wrecking our table. But the lip on the top layer is too high for my 22 months old so we are using the bottom tray without the top layer. Also the clamp part traps all the nasty food bits and grime and it is almost impossible or to scrub it clean. For he price, I expected it to be better.
