these are tiny!only 12 tiny strips of tape!pay very close attention to the product dimensions 2x1x1 -- they barely cover a corner!included are 12 pieces of tape that barely hold down these corners - i had to get extra double sided tape to make them workthe new ones that toys r us started selling are only 5.99 and are twice as big (but are pre-taped and only have 2 pieces of tape on the top part)
