We got the smaller sized square drying rack 3 years ago when we had our first child. Now that we're having another child, we decided to upgrade to the larger size, since we love the other one.Since both lawn drying racks are green, we assumed they were the same color, but we were wrong, The original smaller one we had was a vibrant green, this one is more a '50s avocado and much less appealing. And the worst part is that the two look horrible together if we wanted to use them in combination.
