I began placing my son on this at about five or six weeks and he enjoyed watching the bird "fly" and listening to the music.  By the time he was two months he tried reaching for the toys and it was clear he wanted to figure out how to grab them. From two to four months he began grabbing the toys and enjoyed "talking" to the bird.  He would coo and babble for a good twenty mintues!  However, he's a strong little guy and at four months he was on his mat while I was folding laundry (able to see him of course)and managed to pull the bird off and it hit him in the eye!  He was more startled than anything and his eye was watery and red.  I thought maybe it was a fluke (stupid I know) and because he enjoys being on the mat I reattached the bird the next day and placed him on it again.  Immediately he reached up, grabbed at the bird and again it fell on him.  Needless to say, I have removed the arch and am just using the quilted mat with the links attached to let him roll around on.  At least I can continue to use it to some degree although he misses the dangling toys.  It's an adorable play mat and works great before they can start grabbing.  However at $49.99 I would expect more than four months use out of it.
