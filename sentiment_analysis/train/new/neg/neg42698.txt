Didn't quite like how wide and tall it is... but it's ok. You have to try it a few different ways around the crib to make the ties fit in the crib bars. Or as another reviewer suggested you may have to detach the ties and re-attache them to fit your crib - but that would be a huge inconveniece, they are quite a few ties! It's just too tall for my crib but they work. The fabric feels really scratchy too but again, your child won't really be sleeping "on" this, just next to it. I figured I would use it for a while.
