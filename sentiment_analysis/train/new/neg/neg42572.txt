I had purchased similar burp cloths at babies r us and thought these were it. Not! Lol! While still good, the fabric of these particular is a bit thin. There seems to be a pocket between the two layers, making t less durable than similar Aden and Anais products. They're also about an inch all around too big, making it difficult to take along in the diaper bag, so these usually stay home. I like the botton up option, but again a bit too big for a small infant to wear as a bib, maybe once he's a toddler it'll work better as a bib.
