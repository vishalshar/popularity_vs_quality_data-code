Overall I have been very pleased with this gate.Pros:Wider than many of the gates you will find. (We have a very wide stair opening.Screws to the wall rather than pressure mounted for added security at top of stiars.No bottom bar to step over.Durable paint finish in neutral whiteAlarm for added security as children get olderVery tall! (great for active or tall toddlers)Swings easilyOperate one-handedCons:Release latch/alarm portion of the gate is plastic and has worn down some with the extremely high use that it gets (our kitchen is on one floor and our living room is on another....it gets used A LOT!!) It is less secure and I might be worried were it not for the alarm allowing me to hear if she has opened the gate.Overall I am very happy with this gate. I wish the latch portion of the gate was made of metal to stand up to greater use but that is my only complaint. Because of this only I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars.****I am now ammending this review. The metal part of the gate is still holding up great. However, the plastic parts have worn down and even our dog can push the gate open with her nose (she is strong and pushes hard). Also, the stop to keep it from swinging in (toward the stairs) broke off. I am gonig to try to pursue replacement parts but I don't kow if it is possible. It's a great idea but those plastic parts just don't hold up to the constant use that it gets in our home. Our kitchen is on one floor and our living room on the other so we use it very many times per day.
