These bottles look and feel very cheap. Ive purchased many bottles of different brands and this one has to be one of the worst ones by far. Nonetheless, it does the job, thats the only pro. Its good for its intended use - to feed the baby. Unfortunately, when I purchased it for my little one I was transitioning him to a sippy cup so in the end found no use for it.It sucks because most of his bottles/ sippy cups that I love are Nuby brand, it just seems they failed on this product. But if you are looking for a bottle or sippy cup definitely look into Nuby's other items.
