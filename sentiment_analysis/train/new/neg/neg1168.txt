Despite setting the receivers per the instructions (one receiver is supposedly sound activated while the other one is supposed to be on all the time), the receiver would intermittently stop receiving/working for for apparent reason for several minutes at a time and then start working again. Because we were counting on this monitor to be able to hear our baby on the other side of the house, we had to return it. I was concerned that the baby would be crying and we'd be sleeping away. We weren't even able to use it for one night.
