Fits like a glove but it lasted me three weeks before I threw it away.  It tore quickly and became yellow and foggy in color.  Could not be wiped clean, my daughter couldn't clearly see through the plastic.  It was permanently fogged and looked dirty.  I wish I would have taken pictures before throwing it away.  The pics in the other review similar to mine explains it all.  So disappointed, a waste of money!  Better off buying the cheaper non brand name, so if it tears or gets ugly I don't feel bad throwing it away.
