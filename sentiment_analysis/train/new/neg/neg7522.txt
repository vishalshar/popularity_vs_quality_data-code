Leaked the first use. Bought this for potty training my son. He's a deep sleeper and didn't wake up when he had to go so he peed in the bed and in the morning this was soaked and leaked through onto the sheet. One plus is that it keeps the wet spot more contained than if he had just gone on the sheet, but I was disappointed that it wasn't truly waterproof as advertised.
