These bottles are on the more expensive side at an average of $10/bottle. The current price of $75 for 5 in a set box from the 3rd party seller is ridiculous.As for the performance of the bottles, overall they were just ok. It wasn't so troublesome that it led me to seek alternatives.The bottles do LEAK a little. I would say 95% of the time they were fine and didn't leak. However, the venting system is designed to let air in. If air can get in, milk can get out. How much leaks depends on how close you attach the silicon valve to the white bottle cap. At the top of the valve stem, you will see three lines from the center to the outer edge to let air in. If you tighten the collar too tight to the glass bottle, the hard glass of the bottle will penetrate and break through the plastic collars. So do not OVER TIGHTEN the collars to prevent leaking. The leaking isn't so bad. No more than your baby drool or spit up.So despite all these minor issues, I would probably go with Born Free again since I haven't researched other glass alternatives. They're ok and get the job done. Born Free got their marketing dollars worth.
