My daughter is 18 months old, which equates to the amount of time I've been using this dresser. In that time, TWO of the drawers have broken, the first one broke around 8 months in, the second drawer broke this week. The issue is that the fronts of the drawers (or the drawer faces) have come off partially. They are only held in by two cheap wooden dowels and one cam lock. The cam lock keeps coming loose, causing the drawer face to dislodge. My husband has put them back together and re-locked the cam locks but they always come out again within a few days.My daughter thinks it's fun to open and close the drawers (as most toddlers do), and once while she was doing this one of the drawers broke (again) and the cam lock fell to the ground. She immediately picked it up. Huge choking hazard.If I could give any advice to a first time mom considering this dresser- DON'T. Spend a little more money and get something of nicer quality.We have the matching crib, which is nice and hasn't been a problem, but this dresser is cheap crap.
