I ordered this nanobag because it looked like a good solution for traveling during the winter months for my youngest child. Its a high quality product but I returned it because I found it impractical to use. Ultimately a traditional bunting and blanket is the better way to go because an additional blanket can be added or removed as needed to control his temperature . The nanobag caused my little guy to sweat even when used in 30 degree weather ,with light clothes on underneath , and its zippered closures on the back uncomfortably pressed into my baby's back. I also tried leaving the carseat in the car and just taking him in the nanobag but that also didn't work well because you must then open the bag in the cold to put the carseat restraints on and off. All the rave reveiws seem rather suspect after experiencing this product firsthand.
