This is a terribly made piece of junk.The mobile pieces interfere with each-other while the device spins, so I had to sew the cloth leaves "up" to prevent them from stopping the mobile rotation.The "night light" is not at all what is pictured in the photos - it is a round circle of light in the middle of the display - like a concentric circle within that circle - there is no nice "glow" on the edges as in the photos.And as of now - after about 2 weeks of mild use, it has stopped working completely.
