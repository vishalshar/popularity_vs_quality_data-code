My daughter has been becoming more adventurous of late, so I've been looking for something to keep her out of the kitchen (and the trash). Money is tight, as it is for many parents, so I needed something that wouldn't hurt the wallet too much but would still do the job. The North States Supergate Top-Notch Gate largely gets the job done.Actually using the thing is tedious. It's easy to know how to use, but actually using it really does require two hands, especially it you have any kind of molding around the bottom of your doorways as I have in my kitchen (you have to hold it in place above the molding with one hand, while using the other to bring down the locking bar. The "memory-lock" feature might sound good in theory, but it just doesn't work as well as you think, as adjusting it often causes the memory bar to come undone. Maybe I still need to get the hang of it, but that aspect of it has been a disappointment thus far. At this point, we've resorted to just stepping over it, which is easy enough since it's fairly low to the ground.The good thing is that it does work. Once you've got the gate into place, it has a tight, snug fit. My daughter has slapped at it a bit, leaned on it a little more, and it's keeping her out (and not getting her hurt, which is as important as anything). Ultimately, it does what it's designed to do. It's ugly and sometimes a pain to actually use, but the North States Supergate Top-Notch Gate does keep my little one out of the kitchen and away from the trash, oven and cabinets. If it were easier to actually adjust, I could probably recommend it a whole lot more. As it is, I'll deal with having to hop into and out of my kitchen.
