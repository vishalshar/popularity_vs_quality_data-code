The handles are a bit bulky but I like the size and shape of the spoon part itself.  I am maybe also a bit concerned about how long they will last as you can see in the photo, it is clearly a metal "spoon" inside this rubbery casing, I guess we will see with continued use and washing if the metal starts ripping through.
