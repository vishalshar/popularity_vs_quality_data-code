This bathtub cut my baby's little toe and foot! The green insert has sharp edges around the drain holes and my baby cut himself while moving his little legs during bath time. I noticed him crying which he never does during baths and realized that there was blood around that area. So very disappointed by how cheaply this product is made. Had to return the product immediately. SAVE YOURSELF TROUBLE AND DO NOT BUY. I cannot understand how this product has so many positive reviews...
