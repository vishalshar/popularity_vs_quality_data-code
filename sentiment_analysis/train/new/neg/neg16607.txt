First, let me just say that in general I adore Lunchskins products. The small snack and sandwich baggies are great, and the material is fantastic.  I wash them in the laundry - super easy - and they hold up very well.  I am a mother of three school-aged children.But these lunch totes have two huge design flaws.  First, the size is just a bit too roomy.  The dimensions of the flat bottom part are such that there's too much extra space so it's unsteady and always flopping onto its side.  The contents don't stay packed/stacked snuggly.  Once it's in a kid's backpack, it's a total free for all as to which way it will turn itself.  I would prefer something more along the lines of the size of a brown paper bag which keeps the contents packed/stacked securely and rests securely on it's bottom flat part.Second, and MOST important, the carrying handle comes out of one side, such that in order for the handle to be useful the bag's flap must be folded closed.  This limits how high you can pack the contents inside.  I am unable to fit a standard RubberMaid sandwich holder on the bottom with a standard thermos milk container on top of it - they prohibit the flap from closing.  So everything is kind of put in sideways, which only exacerbates the problem of the bag flopping onto its side.If they could stitch the carrying handle onto the side edges of the bag, such that the handle can always be utilized whether the flap is closed a little or a lot (and perhaps reduce the size of the footprint for a more sturdy, snug effect), this would truly be the best lunch bag ever.
