I purchased these when we converted our son's IKEA crib into a toddler bed. It can be tough to find three-piece sheet sets in this size, and we decided to try these sheets and another set by Skip Hop. I ended up buying a second set of the Skip Hop sheets and leaving these in the drawer after the first use.The texture of these sheets feels great -- very nice and soft -- but after the first time my son slept on them, they looked really gross. He's a stomach sleeper, so it's only natural for him to get a few spots of drool here and there as he sleeps. I'm not sure if the texture or color of these sheets is to blame, but after one night there were so many highly visible, light-colored spots from where he'd rubbed his mouth, eyes, or whatever, I felt like I had to take them off the bed and wash them. I don't feel like I'm a huge clean freak, but the spots were so crusty-looking and distracting, I was seriously grossed out. No other sheets I've used, on my own bed or my kid's bed, have done this.
