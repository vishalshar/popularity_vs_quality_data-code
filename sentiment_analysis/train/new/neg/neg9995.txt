I bought a Lambs & Ivy Dream Teddy six-piece crib set (exactly like this one but a different pattern) a while back. Today I washed it because we're working on our nursery. I read the instructions on all the pieces carefully. I did not washthe diaper stacker. Each piece states to "machine wash cold; tumble dry low." I washed the quilt, bumper, fitted sheet, valance, and bed skirt on cold delicate. I did not dry the quilt or bumper because I was afraid of the stuffing bunching - I laid them flat to dry, but depsite this the bumper still bunched in one place and now doesn't want to fit correctly.I dried the fitted sheet, valance, and bed skirt on cool heat for a short time. The valance and fitted sheet came out very wrinkled. After 15 minutes of ironing the valance is still wrinkled. The fitted sheet was nearly impossible to iron. I was thinking to myself, how can I go through this each week when I wash it? It's baby bedding, for heaven's sakes. How can it wash this poorly? I have a couple of replacement Koala baby sheets, and they washed and dried wonderfully, no wrinkles. This sheet, on the other hand, is part of an expensive set, and it won't iron out.But wait...I'm saving the best for last. The best skirt bunched in the middle; the mesh material melted in the drier and stuck together. When I tried to pull it apart, it tore!!! I'm so mad -you can't buy this skirt separately, and I paid a lot for the set.I'm going to call the manufacturer tomorrow. I'm absolutely furious - what a huge waste of money!
