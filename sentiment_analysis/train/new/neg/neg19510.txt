this is the first time that I write a review. I was so astonished that last night when I finished feeding my baby without the light on I saw the rattle is luminous. It definitely contains Fluorescent agent which is proved to be harmful to an adult, not mentioning a baby. And the product states"safe for chewing"! Can't imagine that!
