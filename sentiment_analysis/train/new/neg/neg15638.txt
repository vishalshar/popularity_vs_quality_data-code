I bought this to keep a door open so the cat could use the litter box.  Our house is a little older (from around 1910's) and apparently the doors are a little thinner (just a little under 1 1/2 in. thick) than most of the ones that are made today.  While the device seems to sit and stay on top of the door, it is loose.  It works, but because the angle by which the thing grasps the door is not rectangular, the foam has started ripping within a couple weeks of it being used.  We've had it for about a month now and both sides has begun ripping and I don't expect it to last more than another 1-2 months.  I can see that it would probably be better if the door was thicker, but it was marketed for most any door.  Thin older doors do not apparently fit into that category.
