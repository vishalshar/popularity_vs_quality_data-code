Does not match the DaVinci Kalani Dresser and Crib that I also bought.  It's more of a red color than the other two items.  Of the three pieces I bought it is my least favorite as some of the construction pieces are engineered to a minimum level.  Other than that the piece is pretty solid when put together.  At the end of the day, I have no doubt that the baby will not care about the color and now that it is assembled it should get the job done.
