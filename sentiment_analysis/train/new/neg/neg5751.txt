I bought this seat for my 17 month old daughter after she had 2 strokes and cant sit up unassisted. As you can imagine, shes way too long for this seat but I had to get something for her. I put a towel under her head so the edge doesnt hurt her. She slides down a lot especially now as shes getting more movement back. Im sure for a newborn this seat would work much better. And hopefully she can sit on the toddler side soon and hopefully that will work better. Ive always used different seats with my girls, but those would def be way too small for her so I went with this one. Im sure this review wont help many ppl but I thought it might help someone.
