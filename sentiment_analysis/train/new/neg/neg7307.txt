Well I've never owned an bouncy seat before so I cannot give this less than three stars... since this may be more common than I know.  BUT this seat is QUITE noisy in the vibration mode.  And the music is definately nothing special.  After I purchased this seat I played with the boppy version at babies r us and was much more impressed.  It is double the cost, but in the end for a product that gets used so often I feel it's probably worth it.  I do however feel the design in fun and the toys are cute.  My baby isn't here yet, so maybe it will turn out to be okay... or not.  Hope so though!  One more note... when putting it together, my husband (who is a pro a putting stuff together) had trouble with one of the pieces clicking in and staying put.  However once the fabric was on the seat it seemed to secure everthing.  But can't say it wasn't annoying.  For the price this is a decent seat.  You get what you pay for.
