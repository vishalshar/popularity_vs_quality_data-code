Don't buy this stool for use in the bathroom. I am here looking up this product in my order history to make sure I don't buy from this manufacturer again.I bought this stool for my kids to use in the bathroom to help them reach the faucet.  I chose it because of the height.  However, this stool disintegrated after about a year from the water dripping on it.  The lid never closed and stayed open like it is shown in the picture, even with nothing inside.  The storage compartment couldn't really hold anything substantial. It was only big enough for about two rubber duckies.  It is not made of real wood, as the description states, but a particle board.  I think that is why it only lasted a few months before the steps started cracking, bubbling, and splicing apart.  I think it would've been fine for use in a dry place, but the lid not closing was extremely annoying and not very safe for toddlers climbing up on it.
