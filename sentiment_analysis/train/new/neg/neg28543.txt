I really like this but, I have found a few things I don't like. If you are putting on a wood table, make sure to put something under it or it will ruin your table for sure. You have to clean the bottom plate like every time you use it if you have the slightest bit hard water. Mine always looks nasty no matter what I do. I does do what it is suppose to do but doesn't feel like there is a good enough seal for me to fully trust. It was definitely not worth how much I have spent on it. I think it is overpriced and under made. It fits up to 6 bottles depending on the size and width of the bottles. I use nuby and dr brown and have now issues fitting them all in.
