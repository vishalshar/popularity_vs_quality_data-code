As other people have said, this mobile is not a universal fit for all cribs. We were able to make it work, but only because the side rails of our crib won't be used in the future. The only way we were able to get this to fit was by scratching the wood. If our side rails were going to be used as our cribs converts in the future we wouldn't have kept this item. Also, the music doesn't last long as others have mentioned. All in all the mobile is cute and definitely matches the Bananafish Lovebird set, but hopefully they'll modify this to better meet people's needs.
