I hate this car seat. It's bulky and heavy. The handle is hard to hold. My baby gets very hot in it and I think it is due to the fabric of the cover. This is for the second baby; first baby had a Baby Trend that was also crazy heavy but I am now sorry I gave it away now.  Another reason I don't like this Safety 1st seat is that the canopy is basically useless and a nuisance.
