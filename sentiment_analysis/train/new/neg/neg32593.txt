I bought this because of its positive reviews but as of now, my toddler can't use it because of the kind of booster seat that we have in the car.  It's kinda restrict my toddler's head from relaxing because it's too bulky around his neck. It looks great but the cushion doesn't feel good, too hard for child's neck.
