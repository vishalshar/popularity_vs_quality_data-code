the rubber is now thicker and less pliable than the yellow and pink ones we have for the other kid.  it doesn't travel as well because this rubber is too firm, so it doesn't roll up like it should.  the suction feet also don't adhere as well to tables since the rubber is less sticky if that makes sense.  try to find another manufacture.  our pink and green ones have the same hey diddle diddle logo words and drawing, but its as if this "brand" came off the same stamp line, but with different product material.  bad buy.
