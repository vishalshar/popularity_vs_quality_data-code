I'm a huge fan of these sleep sacks. I started buying them a couple of years ago when my son was a year and he wore one until he was three (he's a big kid). I bought these this winter when my daughter was born and they were not as high quality the larger/older bags I own. The lining does not appear to be the softer material and I doesn't seem as thick. Maybe that is on behalf of infants but I was a little disappointed. Will buy the next size up next winter and see what I get!
