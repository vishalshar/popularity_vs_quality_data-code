After reading Spectra's response to some of the negative reviews here, I've contacted them to see about getting a replacement.  I'll update when I get a response.  Meanwhile, my experience with this pump has not been great.  With my first child, I had a Medela pump, which worked great.  I breastfed and pumped at work for almost two years.  It was quiet enough to use in my office with the door closed and not feel like passersby were hearing my pump.  I could even talk on the phone with it running.  Not so with the Spectra; it's very loud.  The suction is also not sufficient, even on Max.  With the Medela, if I turned it up past medium, it would be painful (room to increase suction if needed).  I've disassembled and washed all the parts and tubing and it hasn't improved the suction.  I regret not having gone with the same model of Medela that I used with my first child.  I am probably going to end up with one anyway because you can't just NOT pump for a couple days while waiting for a replacement... I'm now going to have to head over to Babies R Us and buy what's available in person because at this point it's sort of an emergency.
