We had previously purchased the One Step Ahead tub from Amazon (before it became very expensive on this site--you can still get it directly from One Step Ahead), and I like the One Step Ahead one better.  It seems sturdier and the sides are taller so it holds more water.  That being said, my kid prefers the pictures of the animals on this tub to the aquatic creatures on the One Step Ahead tub.  This one lasted us about 5 months before it consistently failed to hold air and had to be replaced.
