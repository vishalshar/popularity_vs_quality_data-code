The good: it is a lever knob lock that allows the lever to be turned from the opposite side. It required no adjustment on our levers. It kind of worked at first. Installed on the inside of the master bedroom door it kept the dogs out during the day (German Shepherd bumps the levers UP with his nose, and once installed the levers can only be rotated DOWN on the opposite side), kept dogs in the bedroom at night and out of the kitchen trash, and kids could still get in at night if they needed us.The bad: big and ugly, as I mentioned, clicks pretty loudly when it automatically re- engages itself when you let go of the door handle (not good if spouse is a soft sleeper), kids (2 and 3) figured out how to operate unlock it within less than a week, and the adhesive installation was not strong enough to withstand repeated attempts by the German Shepherd to bump the lever open. Once he figured out that it was wiggling a little bit, it was all over, and he knew he could open the door at will if he bumped it hard enough. I almost screwed the locking portion to the door, but bought a $8 keyed round knob at Wal Mart instead.
