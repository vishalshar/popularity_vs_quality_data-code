We tried to love this high chair because of all the amazing reviews, but it just wasn't for us. The plastic is very cheap and flimsy and the legs of the high chair were slightly off making the chair rock slightly and not stand sturdy at all. We tried adjusting it many times but it would still rock. With the quality of this chair, I think it should cost about $50, not $150. For $150 we expected something of much high quality and were very disappointed. Also, trying to move this high chair was very hard. The legs stick out all over the place and while trying to carry my 8 month old it just got really old. This chair is NOT meant to be moved. (we'd sit him in it while working on projects in the house or while watching TV and with the constant moving of the chair, the legs seemed to get even more flimsy.) We predict this chair would last about 6 months or less before breaking so we decided to return it for something of higher quality materials and something that could move easily from room to room, and something I could move while holding my baby. Also, this chair is very low for a high chair. It barely reaches the height of our standard table.
