I have mixed feelings about these caddies.  First I ordered the bee, it seemed a bit smaller than I expected, but I liked it and it fit a reasonable amount of small infant toys. I decided I needed another, so this time I got the mouse.  The issue is the mouse is even SMALLER :(So buyers beware!  These are not standard sizing!  They are very cute and well made, but you never know what size you may get!
