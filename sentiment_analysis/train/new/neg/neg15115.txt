We really loved the color schemes offered on the PlaySpot Floor Mat by Skip Hop, and the ability to arrange the squares into different shapes and sizes was a plus as well. The foam was sturdy but soft, and easy to clean. The one negative takeaway is that it's really easy for kids to take apart, and in our case, once they figured that out, it was the end of our soft, cushioned play area. I'm giving it three stars because it is a quality product, and it looked great, but in the end, it didn't hold up to my toddlers.
