I got these wrist rattles for my at the time 2 month old son. I do not know if it was just the one that I received but only one of the wrist rattles actually rattled. They are a good size for his wrists but I was disappointed that only one rattled. He doesn't really pay too much attention to them but it is fun for me to rattle his hands with it and maybe with mrie time he will notice the rattles more.
