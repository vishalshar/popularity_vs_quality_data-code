It's ok. I didn't read the description/comments thoroughly so I was a bit disappointed. I thought it had a lid that screwed ob on locked the icky things inside until you could dispose of it properly, it does not do that. But that's my fault for not researching it more. It's expensive for what it is. I'd rather buy a cheaper small potty and bring bags with some paper towels in it to keep in the car.
