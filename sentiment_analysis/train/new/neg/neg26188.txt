We bought the entire Windsor line because we love the pattern and are wildly impressed with how well the stroller handles.  The problem is with the bears.  Our baby would watch them (like she watches the ceiling fan) and when they would fall to the back, she would get mad.  Once, the mobile fell off completely.  I never put it back one because I am afraid it will hit her.  She has used the swing daily since birth and now at 4 months, she still likes it.  We also like the music and volume feature.  I don't think the swing is loud at all.  I am disappointed in the performance of the mobile, but otherwise I think the swing was worth what we paid.
