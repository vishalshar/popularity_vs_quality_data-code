I ordered elephants and butterflies (think, pink) and got blue pacifiers. I am not one for strict gender colors, but I use the blue and pink pacifiers to differentiate between which are my son's and which are my daughter's pacifiers.I ended up buying mine at Buy Buy Baby and gifting these at a baby shower.
