purchased this 68 pound rocker to help soothe our 18 month old.  Really excited about various aspects of this rocker.  First order arrived... and assembles with little difficulty.  Then the surprise:  left side only... the vertical wood spindles were swaying... in other words the weight was not entirely transferring to the metal gliding parts, but rather the chair was gliding by also swaying the wood supports in their vertical holes... outcome:  predictable noise and squeaks.... and you can imagine that over time... the holes would be larger from the rocking... and safety / collapse may become a real concern...okay... no problem:  just a random bad item.... after all the right side supports didn't have this problem.  So, I ordered a replacement and made the scary effort of packaging up a 68 lb item for return via UPS.  Seriously, do you think a typical UPS driver is ready to lift a 68 lb package... and most UPS stores avoid this item... (however, I made it happen, the free return was nice).now for my identical replacement...  really excited again... (wow, baby is so heavy... we needed this solution badly :)and the replacement??  the same problem... i mean the exactly same problem... left side only, vertical wood supports, made even louder noise, and there appears to be a crack in one wood support.my situation... i ruined the packaging, so i wasn't able to return.... and now i'm the proud owner of a brand new squeaking glider... (ps.  packaging for a 68 lb item would be a big expensive box)i'm really disappointed in the lost money... and surprise that not more reviews have indicated this defect.  perhaps there was a bad batch produced... but now I'm evaluating (yet again) the glider options... i guess we'll be forced to go to a furniture store and deal with the sales pitch behaviors
