These are very cute magnets. Our daughter loves playing with them. I wish they also made regular animals like cats and dogs.-------- edited review may 2014Our daughter still loves these magnets but unfortunately they are coming apart in lots of little pieces. The plasticky-lining is flaking off taking the image along with it. Not the best quality after all.  Moves from 4 stars to just 2. :(
