3 stars , because if you are creative this works. It needed a lot of work to rememble the true Elvis. Otherwise it's an evil  Knievel  costume. My son is 12mo and chubby thighs legs,  so I ordered a size 18 month. It was way too big, that was my error in choosing wrong size.I removed the cape, hot glued the collar up, hemmed the legs, and glued lots of bedazzle beads . Took just a few hours. I searched everywhere for a realistic looking Elvis costume for a baby. Unless you want to spend over $100 they don't exist. So this was great as a pattern for the costume. I just needed a white jumpsuit with a zipper to transform into an Elvis costume. The jumpsuit alone I would rate five stars. EVERYONE loved his costume, and immediately knew exactly who he was despite his red hair.
