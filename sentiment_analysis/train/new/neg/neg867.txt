We have 2 bassinets for our twins and both bassinets have defective features.  On one the vibrating and the music don't work.  On the other one the music doesn't work and the mobile bears rotate for 10 seconds and then stop.We keep replacing batteries in the inconveniently located batteries compartment, some of the screws for the compartment on One of the bassinets were also defective so it took us forever to open it.  All this work just to replace batteries !The mattress is thin but we put a wedge underneath each to elevate the babies'heads because one had reflux. The wedge gives the extra padding.I have tried to tuck the wheels in to switch to the rocking mode but It was so hard I gave up.My father-in law took 3 hours to assemble the first one and 1h30 for the second one.The 2 features we used other than regular bassinets were co-sleeper for the first 2 months, this feature is a must for a beastfeeding mother of twins born by C-section, and a standard co-sleeper wouldn't have fit on either side of our bed. The other was using it off the base, It was very convenient to put them in the trunk of the van and bring them to Grandma's and to the Hotel.  The twins got to actually sleep in the same beds as at home and there was no bulky space taking pack
