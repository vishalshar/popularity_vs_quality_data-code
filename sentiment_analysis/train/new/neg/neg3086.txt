I purchased this about a year ago and wished these reviews were here earlier. I felt compelled to come back and write this review as I was weeding through old toys for trash/donations and I'm tossing this doll already. There are better learn to dress dolls & toys out there, don't bother with this one. Cheap plastic zipper was very difficult from the start, then broke. The buckle is soft flimsy fabric and difficult for a child. The purple paw is just a piece of fabric that flaps up and down that says open & closed, it's useless. The button came off and was lost soon after getting it and I agree with another poster that the laces are a bit too small to teach a child with. Besides, the laces are fraying b/c just like everything else on this toy, it is cheaply made. We never learned a thing with this doll, don't waste your money.
