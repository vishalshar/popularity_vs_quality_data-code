I need to agree with some of the other reviewers it is very important that you keep the mirror firmly fastened to the seat. Make sure that you don't accidently don't bump the mirror and inadvertently loosen in when putting in the car seat.A few points- It takes a little trial-and-error to get the mirror aimed correctly so that it lines up with the baby's face and your rear-view mirror. We have to adjust it whenever we have a new driver in the car.- Remember it is totally useless in the dark. I know that this may seem obvious, but you do need a fair amount of light in order to see the baby.Final Verdict - As long as you keep it fastened tightly - I am not too worried about the mirror being a safety risk. However, it isn't very robust in terms of being able to see the baby clearly for a variety of angles. While it is not a perfect product I am not sure if there is anything better on the market or how it could be substantially improved.3 stars
