There are a few details of this necklace that are NOT as described.1. The description says it is 11 to 14 inches. It is actually almost 30 inches and about 28 inches from one end of the beads to the other.2. The item also says it is adjustable. This is only sort of true. You can move the clasp closer to the start of the beads, re-knot the cord and then cut the excess off. I was imagining a necklace that I could make longer or shorter depending on what I was wearing.I tried contacting the seller via Facebook, but their responses were extremely unhelpful. I was told that if I wanted a longer necklace to let them know and they could make another one (exact opposite of what I asked). The solution listed above for adjusting the necklace was their response to my question about how the necklace adjusted.I did give it a a few starts because it does look exactly like it is pictured and it would work really nicely as a teething necklace. However, it is way too long in my opinion and I will be returning it.
