I want to like this a lot more than I actually do. I love that it is silicone (the mesh ones gross me out!) and fits nicely in baby's hand. We have used it for avocado and various frozen fruits, but only a very small amount of food can be placed in the silicone compartment because of the large plastic bulb (which isn't pictured) that protrudes into it. I understand that it is there to push the food to the top, making it easier for baby to get, however a tablespoon (3 frozen raspberries or one 1-inch cube of mango which has to be further chopped up to fit) of food is gone quickly!
