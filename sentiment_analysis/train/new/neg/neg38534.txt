Rarely do I leave reviews, but I felt since there were so few negative reviews, that I had to leave one for other people to take into consideration.  We had trouble getting our breastfed baby to transition to a bottle when it was time for me to go back to work.  We were ultimately successful with the mimijumi bottle, but they are so expensive that I only bought one and borrowed two others from a friend in hopes that I could transition my son to a more reasonably priced bottle once he got used to it.  This MAM was our next step and at first it seemed great, but daycare has just informed me of two issues: 1) the bottle leaks when reheating and/or the water you're using to heat gets into the bottle (this doesn't surprise me as one time I didn't have the bottle assembled correctly and it did leak all over) and 2) it takes a long time to reheat because of the thicker base layer.  Ultimately I'm going to try to now transition to Dr. Brown's and Avent which we already have my older [not picky about his bottle] son.  This bottle and the mimijumi were good steps to get to a regular bottle, but I'm not planning on using it long-term due to its limitations.
