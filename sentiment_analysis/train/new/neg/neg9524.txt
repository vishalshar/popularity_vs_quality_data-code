After tons of research and reading reviews, I bought this mat for my two year old going into daycare/school. Thank goodness I had bought the thick blue/red mat for this to go on top. Otherwise she might as well have been sleeping on the floor. After taking much time to find a thicker mat made in the USA, I swapped this out for use at home or grandma's while taking the new one to school. The pillow is okay and held up but it doesn't get washed that often. On a good note, it has held up well in the weekly washes with no repairing needed. The velcro is just starting to loosen.
