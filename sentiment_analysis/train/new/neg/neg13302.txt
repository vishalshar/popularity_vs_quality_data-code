I own the Uppababy Vista stroller and saw that the reviews for the Uppababy cup holder were mediocre.  I decided to order the Valco Universal Cup Holder as it was cheaper and had better reviews.  This cup holder is durable and has an adjustable enclosure loop that allows it to attach to a variety of strollers.  While it did fit on the Uppababy fine, it was a hassle to put it on and take it off (not difficult or too incredibly time consuming, just one more step when trying to get out the door with baby).  If I had a drink with an open lip (like a take out coffee cup) it ended up spilling out the top and dripping down the sides if we went over any bumps at all (sidewalk, door jams, etc).  I ended up ordering a universal stroller organizer with cup holder(s) that fits my needs better.
