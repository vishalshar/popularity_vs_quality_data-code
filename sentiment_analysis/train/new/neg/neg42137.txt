When I noticed my son was getting attached to his puppy lovey, I ordered a bunch of them so we would have extras in the inevitable case that he lost one (or two). I've been really disappointed with the quality of the latest ones I bought, though. One had its entire muzzle area come off after being washed once. I thought it was a fluke and sewed it back on. Just today I noticed that the ear on another one has come off. A couple of the others have loose, hanging strings; which I think is pretty unacceptable for a product meant for a baby/small child. We've had he new ones for only a few weeks, and they each have been washed 3-4 times at most. My son isn't particularly rough on them, either.
