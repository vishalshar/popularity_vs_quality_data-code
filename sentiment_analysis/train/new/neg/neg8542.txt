This product is a fun way to hear the baby hicccup and kick. I haven't heard the heartbeat of the baby yet, but there's still plenty of time because I'm only 29 weeks. My advice is not to get your hopes up if you don't hear the baby's heartbeat. My friends have the same product and are about 24 weeks...they were able to hear their baby. I think the position of the baby is a very important factor and not necessarily the fault of the device.
