I have two of these that we use for our twins when we are visiting family or go camping.  When they were infants we had on one set-up in our living room with the changing table attachment, which worked great.  This is a good product and they are easy to set-up, but folding them back up is a battle.  At first I thought one was defective, but they are both like that.  You need to pull up on the center first before unlocking the sides, but dang it...I still struggle a lot with them.  It's hard to find the push button to get them to fold down.  I really wish I would have done my research on these a little more before deciding on these.
