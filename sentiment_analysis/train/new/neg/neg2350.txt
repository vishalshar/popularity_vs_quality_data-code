I bought this pacifier animal because my exclusively breast-fed 8 month old daughter only takes the mam pacifiers and this product adapts to any pacifier unlike the others. It functions fine as far as keeping the pacifier attached to it and she seems to kind of like it BUT it's really small. It's probably about 6 inches in length and compared to what I was expecting (a small/medium sized stuffed animal that she could cuddle with NOT something so miniature.) I felt like the ad was a little misleading for that reason.
