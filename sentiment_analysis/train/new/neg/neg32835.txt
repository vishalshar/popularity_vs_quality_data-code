These bottles are nice but they're kind of pricey. More pros than cons.Pros: made out of silicone, natural shaped nipple, easy to clean, built in vents, minimal parts to clean.Cons: it's hard to get the baby to drink till the very last drop (don't want to waste any of that liquid gold). You have to tilt the baby and bottle all the way back to get the last of the milk out of the nipple. Get build up (of milk?) on the inside of the nipple and bottles if you don't sterilize the parts regularly.
