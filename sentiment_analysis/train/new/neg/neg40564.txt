Warning: These are NOT the Kissaluv wipes that are pictured, and I don't think they are actually Kissaluv wipes at all. As many reviewers have mentioned, the designs are completely different from what is pictured, and they are also unlabeled and at least one was already coming apart at the seams. Furthermore, we bought the real Kissaluv wipes 4 years ago when we had our first baby, and the ones that we just received (which we are promptly returning) are made with a completely different material (not organic feeling at all, in fact it seems synthetic as it stretches), are a different size, color/design (as already mentioned) and don't have any tags or labels on them like the originals do. Very shady, sewfineonline. Very shady.
