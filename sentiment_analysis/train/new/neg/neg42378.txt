Great quality product but, this specific tog is way too warm.  Remember you are going to have the heat on during the winter months so you won't need this high of a tog level.  I didn't realize that obvious fact when I purchased this product.  I would recommend Grobag (much better quality than the other products offering the same service) but, consider another tog level if you leave your house at a comfortable (60s) temperature.
