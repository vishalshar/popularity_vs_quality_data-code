I bought these for them being BPA free but i really regret it. The bottles are good making of course but they leak almost every time if you don't align the bottle and the cap in a certain way then flip it over to see if they leak or not. I do this several times before i get it right. I honestly don't recommend them at all. I bought Medela bottles after i tried the ones that came with breast pump and they are of very good quality. Buy anything but Avent bottles in general. If you cannot do without them, buy just one and see if you;re comfortable with them.
