This pendent is such a great concept. My 5 year old with ASD has sensory issues and is constantly chewing on everything. This necklace was a big hit the minute we received it. However on day one my son chewed through the plastic clasp. That was an easy fix, we just tired the strings of the necklace together.He wore it every day at school the first week and even his teacher commented on how good it was for him instead of the usual chewing of erasers and pencils. It also helped calm him. But after a week of use he chewed right through the thing! I don't know what chewy pendant would be durable enough for him but I'll keep looking.
