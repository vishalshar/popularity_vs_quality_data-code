I think this product might be good for babies/toddlers who's teeth are first appearing, but not for older toddlers. The brush and gel do not clean very well. I bought this for my 2 year old and it was completely worthless. The toothbrush's bristles are very long and flimsy. I think it's meant to be more "gentle" rather than effective. The gel was gone after 3 strokes across his front teeth. Like I said, good for babies who's teeth are just barely coming in and need a quick little swipe across them. Not good for toddlers who's teeth and gums need a good scrubbing.
