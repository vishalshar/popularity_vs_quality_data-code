Worked well for about a year, but then one of the pairs broke when the plastic split and the metal came apart from the handle. The second pair is still going strong, but is now showing signs of rust. And I never immerse these in water. Simply wipe down with baby wipes after use when out, followed by a wipe-down to dry with a clean napkin.
