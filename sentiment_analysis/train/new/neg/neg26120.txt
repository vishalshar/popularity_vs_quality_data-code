We have an Ovia monitor, but it was always dying with our newborn. This was tough to find (not sure why) but it has made life a lot easier. Now instead of moving around the plug, we keep one charger upstairs and this dock downstairs. It has worked well and I've had no issues.It stands the monitor up so it's easy to see. In my opinion Levana should include a second charger with all monitors.
