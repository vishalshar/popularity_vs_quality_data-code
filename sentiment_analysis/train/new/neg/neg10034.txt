This is just "okay" for us. Our 6 month old plays in it, but isn't over amused. I mainly chose this one over others because it looked easy to fold and put away when done, but you actually have to partially disassemble. Needless to say we don't want to do that every day, so it stays in our living room as clutter because it also can't fit through a doorway...
