My 1.5 year old son loved these sippy cups. I also liked these cups. However, after some uses, he chews on the spout and the spout lets the liquid pour out and he doesn't like that, plus it creates a big mess. I tried to go online/look at stores and get replacement spouts but the only place I could find them was on munchkin.com. Since, I do not want to pay [...] and [...]for shipping for 2 spouts, it is more economical to use the Nuby brand. My son also uses the Nuby sippy cups and I can order the replacement spouts for with free shipping.I wish Munchkin would make buying the replacement spouts easier!
