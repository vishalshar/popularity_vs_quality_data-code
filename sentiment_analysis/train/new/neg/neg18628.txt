There is absolutely nothing redeeming I can say about this product, as it was a huge disappointment.  My wife and I were out about over the holidays doing some shopping, and our daughter got hungry while we were on the road, we attempted to use this thing to heat 4 ounces of milk in a glass bottle, that had been in the diaper bag freezer pouch for at least an hour, and 20 minutes after my daughter screaming in absolutely agony from hunger pains, the bottle was lukewarm, while the warmer itself was impossible to hold because it was so hot.  We tried using a plastic bottle the first time we tried it, and was also unsatisfied with the outcome, but thought that maybe because it was a plastic bottle, but the glass bottle did not fair any better.
