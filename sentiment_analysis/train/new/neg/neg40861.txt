His bag is lovely and I get plenty of compliments.  I've been using it for ten months and it is holding up well.  The changing pad that comes with it doesn't fold, so it takes up a lot of space.  You'll want to trash it and find yourself one that does fold.  The bag has a couple dividers and compartments, but with all the baby stuff I have to carry around, I wish it had more organization and another pocket on the outside so I don't have to dig through all the baby stuff to find my wallet, keys, sunglasses, etc.  if you have a small wallet, you'll probably be ok with the one exterior pocket.  It has a little compartment for a small bottle, but it doesn't hold the wide doctor browns bottles that we use.
