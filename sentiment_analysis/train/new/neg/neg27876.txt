Really, really wanted to love the Ergo, but it just didn't work for us.  My broad-shouldered husband found it impossible to fasten the back strap and get it into position properly, and my son HATED it.  Despite being at the 95% percentile for height, at 3 months old, sitting on the pillow from the infant insert, he was still far down in the carrier and couldn't look around.  The top edge of the carrier sort of rubbed on his head/face and really bothered him.  Since the carrier was primarily for my husband to carry my son, and it didn't work for either of them, back it went.We ended up with the Bjorn Comfort carrier, which at first I avoided since the "baby danglers" are supposed to be less good for the baby's spine, etc., but in the end, what works is what works, and both my husband and my son are very happy with the Bjorn.  I have to say that I also like it, too (and I'm a Moby Wrap kind of gal).  It's much easier to get on and off, adjusts quickly between my husband and myself, and is very easy to get my son and and out of.  My son doesn't fuss at all, as long as he's "dangling" and facing out.  He doesn't spend hours and hours in it every day, so I'm not too worried about his spine.  The Ergo did do a slightly better job at putting his weight on our hips, but overall, the Bjorn won out for us.
