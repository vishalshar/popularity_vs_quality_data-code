the sizing on this is very awkward.  i ordered according to the sizing chart - a s/m.  i am 5'4", was 145 lbs prepregnancy and usually an 8/10, so this should have been fine.i am now nearly seven months pregnant with twins, and 180 lbs, all belly.  i have a very supportive belly band tube that was a takeaway from the hospital from when i was there for monitoring.  i find it very comfortable, and was looking for something else to mimic it.  i though the boppy maternity support band would work, but when i tried it on, the velcro only just matched up.  the serious stretch to get to that point thinned the side of the band that has the softer velcro on it, so that the super fierce side of the velcro had unmatched edges hanging off.  and i mean super fierce.  it would tear apart any clothing it came into contact with while wearing it, and scratch any unprotected skin.  the unmatched softer velcro then had a weird ripple to it.  after trying and retrying a couple of times to get it to lay right, i heard a distinct snap of a stitch letting go, and took this off.i will hold onto it for postpartum as it is marketed as a binder of sorts as well.  perhaps it will be more helpful on that end of this journey, but it definitely isn't getting the job done right now.
