I bought this due to the fab reviews found here. I was very disappointed with the product. I took it on a difficult hike with lots of inclines. My son is 25 pounds& 32". I am 5'6" & 110 pounds. I consider myself in very good shape. I have carried heavy packs on my back many times.My son loved riding in the thing. He never fussed. However, I had to stop several times & take him off me! I had terrible pain in my shoulders & neck. (pain that lasted days after the hike) I felt no support from the waist belt at all. I tried various adjustments without help. (there are 3 waist height adjustments yet the shoulder belts just did not sit right on my small frame)I suppose if you were taking a gentle stroll through an airport or shopping mall- this may work, but for the serious hiker & those that are small like myself- I do not recommend it. I also found it difficult to put on/ take off as a solo hiker.I gave it 3 stars due to the fact my 6 foot tall husky hubby found it very comfortable.I will be selling this on EBay & buying a Kelty.
