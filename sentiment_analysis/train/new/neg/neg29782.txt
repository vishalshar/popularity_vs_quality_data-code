I finally got my boy and didn't think he should have to endure the pink bouncer I had so I was so excited to order this one. It was different than any I had seen and so entertaining and interactive. It shipped great and came in a timely fashion. The colors are bright and the little toys that come with it especially the singing crab is adorable. There are two settings on him one that plays the music and the other setting allows the child to bat at it to make it sing. I really like this feature. It's lightweight and sturdy. My qualms I have with this bouncer is that I wish it vibrated a little harder. Sometimes I can't tell if it's vibrating or not. My other problem and this is huge is that when you turn on the vibrator it doesn't have a automatic turn off like if it's been going for a while it won't stop to conserve battery so if I forget to turn it to the off position, which happens a lot since I can't tell if it's vibrating or not unless I look at the button, then it will vibrate all day and all night and then when I want to use it the battery is dead. I would not buy this again for that reason but other than going through batteries all the time it's a good seat.
