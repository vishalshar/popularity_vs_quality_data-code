I was looking for simple non-disposable lidded "sippy" cups with few parts where the cups could actually be used as cups.  These are very sturdy and have no extra parts or regulators to wash or lose.  The only downsides are: I wish the cups held 8 oz, the lids do leak if knocked over as the mouthpiece is just a slit opening, the lids are very tight.  And the really big flaw is that some of my cups arrived with extra plastic stuck in the inside of the cup, as if the cup was pulled off of its mold in the assembly leaving hair like strings of plastic floating around the cup.  It's almost impossible to see in cup when dry but my son thought hair was floating in his milk the first time we used the cup.  Not a big deal, but I'd hate for a baby to swallow the plastic if a parent didn't see it when initially cleaning the cups from the packaging.
