I ordered two. After displaying a cake on one, I picked up the stand to move it and the "rod" going up into the rotating glass just snapped, it broke as described by other reviewers. I haven't used the other one I purchased out of fear of it breaking while a cake is sitting on it. Otherwise I would have given this 5 stars - it rotates very smoothly and looks really good. Mine did rotate slightly off balance but was easily fixed by placing the cake just slightly off-center.
