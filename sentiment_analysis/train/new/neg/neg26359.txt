I see others that had this same issue:  I loved these at first - we have three front windows that have about a 15-foot drop to the driveway.  They looked like metal and I thought they'd be solid - but two have broken with relatively moderate (normal) opening pressure.  In both cases, someone just forgot it was on, and when they opened - the 'finger' mechanism just broke.  Cheap.I used the velcro wedges and though they're 'low tech' - they absolutely work, and have withstood repeated forgetful attempts to open the window.I have no budget when it comes to my child's safety, so it wasn't the cost - these are just not reliable, and I would think reputable stores would simply cease selling them.
