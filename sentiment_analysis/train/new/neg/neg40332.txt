My husband and I are adopting from China and were very excited to find this bedding.  The design is gender neutral (which is what we are looking for) and the pandas are a great way to incorporate our child's native culture into her room.  The price is also excellent!  Far less than other similar bedding sets.  The quality of the bedding, however, is terrible.-The first comforter we received had so many pulled threads that at least 25% of the bamboo design had been pulled out.  We exchanged it and the stitching on the second comforter seems to be fine.  As a side note, customer service was EXCELLENT!  They were very pleasant and quick to respond.  I had the new comforter within days.-The valance is not wide enough to fit across our windows and I don't think our windows are particularly wide, either.-The bib is a joke (not a big deal).-The pillow is a joke (also not a big deal).-The stuffing in the quilt and the bumper is kind of lumpy and I haven't even washed them yet.My biggest problem right now is the colors that they chose to use for the fabrics.  You can't see it in the photos, but there are two different greens.  1. The sage-y microfiber edging on the comforter. 2. A lime-y green color that they use to edge the valances, dust ruffle, and as a backing on the bumper.  The problem I am having is that these colors don't coordinate at all.  I want to paint the room a sage-y green, but it looks horrible with the lime-y green.  Brown seems like the best option, but I don't really want to paint my little girl's room brown.If you like the design and are OK with replacing the bedding sooner rather than later, go for it!  The design is cute and it is inexpensive.  If you are more like me and buy for quality and then hang on to things for a long time, you might want to look elsewhere.  Unfortunately, these seem to be one of the few panda-themed baby bedding options out there.
