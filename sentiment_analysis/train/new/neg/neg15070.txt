I ordered exactly the item you see in the picture - a set of two pretty, clear pacifiers, and when I got my package in the mail, it turned out to be a set of two soothies, pink and purple. AND it was for 3+ months. How do you make such a horrible mistake? I started communication to fix the mistake but went into labor shortly after and got understandably busy then and honestly I just never bothered to return it. I'm fine with the soothie brand. I'm just annoyed that this would happen to anyone. Inexcusable.
