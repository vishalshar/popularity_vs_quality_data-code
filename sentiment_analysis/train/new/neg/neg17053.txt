I have several lambskin rugs in my house in various places,  and they are all thick and plush,  like you can't resist scrunching your toes in them.  This one is one third the thickness of the others, which were all sourced from New Zealand. It's clean and soft,  and the fur is very fine, but it's thin.  It would probably be fine for most uses,  except a bedside rug for you to smoosh your feet into at the end of a hard day.
