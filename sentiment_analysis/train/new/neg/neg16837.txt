So I bought this pillow, thinking it would help support my babies while I nursed. It did quite the opposite. I had to sit in a straight backed chair, that I couldn't even slide all the way into, also had to stay extremely still otherwise one of the babies would roll right off of the pillow, plus I had to lean forward for them to even reach my chest. The only part even worth anything would be the cover that goes around your neck, and even that was uncomfortable. I have had better luck just using two regular pillows propped up on each side and have nursed that way. Bottom line, if you absolutely have to have a nursing pillow, DO NOT waste your money on this particular one.
