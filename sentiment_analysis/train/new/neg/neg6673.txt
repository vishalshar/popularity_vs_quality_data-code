my son was looking for one of these stuffed animals but i decided to try out this less expensive one. the display is pretty good and i like the different colors. you can choose the solid color or it rotates between them.  the top button used to change the color doesn't always respond to the tap, or it goes too far and skips ahead 2 colors. the battery pack is covered by this flap that seems to come undone due to the small velcro square.but overall, it works at night when my son needs extra light in his room and he seems to have fun with it.
