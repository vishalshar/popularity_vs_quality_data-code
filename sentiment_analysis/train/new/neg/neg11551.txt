My 4 month old granddaughter had trouble keeping her pacifier in her mouth, as well as getting it back in her mouth without help.  I thought these might make it easier for her to get back into her mouth by herself.  My daughter says they're rather heavy and actually make it harder for her to keep in her mouth.  I'm a little disappointed considering I paid $30 for the set.  I imagine as she gets a little older they may be easier for her to use and enjoy.
