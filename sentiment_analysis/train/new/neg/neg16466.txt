Bought this carrier in February of 2013.  All in all I probably would have gone with something else. It is well built yet really more of a short period carrier.  Hardly "Performance".  I intended to possibly use it for short hikes but I really never had the confidence that it was the right one for a few miles in and out.  It is well built and well padded but baby positioning is awkward in most positions.  I was never really fully able to get into a position where baby could look around comfortably.  The chest position was really the only comfortable one.  Even then, the straps blocked the side views.  Would have loved a backpack position but never found one where he could really look around.  I think the carriers that look like chairs that rest on the shoulder would be ideal for that sort of venture.  This carrier did do the job for short walks around the block or to the mall.  It was very hot however and the padding was a trade off for heat.  Nice carrier for that baby that is just sitting up.  A developed neck muscle is necessary for this one.PROS:Well Built and SturdyPouch holds "hoody" for sunny daysChest, back and side style positionsShoulder straps well padded and nice waist paddingCons:Material not very breath-able and sometimes hotTop of pouch pushes infant inwardBack position never worked correctly after much trial and errorNo forward chest facing position
