The Dekor plus is a larger size decor, and is identical right down to only saying "Dekor" on the front.  The height of these is just a bit different, but the width of the Decor is about ten inches while the Dekor Plus is about fourteen.  Also, the Diaper Dekor has a round diaper opening, while the Dekor Plus has a square diaper opening.If only they would say "Dekor Plus" on the Dekor Plus.
