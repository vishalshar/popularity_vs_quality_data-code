This changing pad is very small. After one machine wash, the pad now looks very old. The elastic band which is there to tie the pad is really disturbing in the middle of the pad while changing the baby...we dont like it.We brought this with great expectation but it didn't help us at all. It is made of cloth (and not vinyl or anything which you can easily wash and dry). So it is not convenient unless you have 4 or 5 pieces of the same diaper changer. Everytime the changer pad gets dirty while changing the baby, you have no option other than putting it for washing and then you will not have a diaper changer until you have it washed and dried. Better buy few Vinyl sheets which you can easily wash and dry in the patio. That will be evey cheaper.
