I have a 2.5 year old son so, as you can imagine, we have gone through a lot of sippy cups. Now that he's older and he loves straws, we wanted to try these. Hands down the worst, most useless cups I have ever used.To begin, they are not leak-proof. We're working on holding a cup upright, but in the meantime I would hope that these cups wouldn't just gush liquid when tilted. But they do. The rubbery part on the top moves a lot and, if not perfectly aligned with the edge of the lid, it will release a steady drip of liquid.The second most annoying part of these cups is the pressure issue. After a few sips, that rubbery part on top starts to be pulled in and you can no longer pull the liquid through the straw. I've had to teach my son to squeeze the straw in order to even out the pressure.My son hates these cups and cries when we use them (when the others are being washed). They're a pain in general and if he hates them too, then I'm done with them. Junk junk junk.Our absolute favorites are the Gerber Graduates spill proof cups. Easy to put together (cup/lid/small piece that fits in lid), never ever spills and my son loves them. And the best part about them is that internal piece that fits on the lid doesn't come loose. We've noticed with other sippies (Tommee Tippee, for instance) that those internal pieces slip out of place after a little use and liquid doesn't flow freely. With those cups I'm constantly opening them, pushing the piece back in place and putting the lid back on. Not with Gerber. I'm just going to buy more of those and bed done with this madness.
