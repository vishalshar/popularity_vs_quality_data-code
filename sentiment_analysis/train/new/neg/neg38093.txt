The toys are nice on this.  It does keep my baby entertained for 15 mins or so, and safely.  However, for a busy mom who likes things clean, this is NOT working well.  It is very difficult to clean.  One spit up and it goes into hard to reach areas between the green base and the snapped on toys.  The toys do not pop back off easy, if at all.For me, things need to be relatively quick to clean.  So I give this a 3 star, just for being a huge pain.  Otherwise, I like it. I do like that the seat comes off to be machine washed.I do wish there was something the baby could pull close to chew on, besides the plastic balls.Never have used the walker part as it goes to fast on bare floors.
