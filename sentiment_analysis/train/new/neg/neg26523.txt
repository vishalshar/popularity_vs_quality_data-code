I love that this thing holds a ton, but it leaks. The reason it leaks is because one end is held down when you start to place the lid on, then 2 sides are held down with the clips to keep the lid down, that leaves one side left. It stays lifted at all times because all of the other side are held closed. I even got a replacement to see if it was just a faulty one, same problem. If this could be fixed then it would be perfect!
