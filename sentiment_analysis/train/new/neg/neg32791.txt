I bought this for naptime at grandma's, because my baby naps in a starlight cradle swing at home but its gargantuan... was hoping for same sounds because she loves the track with bird sounds... doesn't have the same sounds. It does take up way less space and fits thru doorways and is light and easy to move around.  The cradle motion is a shorter path than the starlight full size, as others have mentioned, but my baby still likes it just fine.Things I wish I had known prior to purchase tho:  the sounds only stay on for 20min. There is no way to change this.  Also the swing only stays on for 4 hours. These two things make it not very useful for me. Especially on a plug in model, I want to be able to have the sounds and swing on indefinitely.  And there is a weird thing with the sounds where you push the button and a song comes on, push it again and it turns off, push it again and a nature sound comes on, push it again and it turns off again, etc...I.e. there is a blank space in between every sound or song. And they are very randomly ordered. And the songs seem to be medleys, which I also didn't like.At least the swing works and its nice that the seat rotates and the thing is very compact.  But it's not a replacement for the starlight swing which is way more user friendly.
