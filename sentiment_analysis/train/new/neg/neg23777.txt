I loved the model previous to this one, I never had any problems that is why I purchased this item. This item however is a pain in the neck. I will turn the receiver on at night so I can wake up to the baby if needed but when I randomly wake up throughout the night the receiver has stopped picking up the signal and I get nothing, no sounds not even static. I have to turn it off and back on to get it to work again. I am so frustrated I want to buy a new monitor. I wish my old one never stopped working after 12 years of use.
