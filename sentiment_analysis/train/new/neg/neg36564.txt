if you are traveling on an airplane this works pretty well - easy enough to change from stroller to seat and back - it rolled down the aisle of one of our flights but was too wide to fit down the aisle of the other; still have no idea how it works as a booster seat for eating at a tabletwo main issues: its kind of a pain in the neck to strap in and remove from rent-a-car all the time but the alternative is to travel with a both a plane/car seat AND a strollerandthe forward facing config w the seat belt/strap in front of the child always seemed like we were doing it wrong - for the seat to be tight in the car or on the plane the strap was pretty tight across our 17 mo old son's chest - just didnt seem 'safe'in the end it was fine for a week - although i am not sure i wouldnt go with the lightweight stroller/separate car/plane seat if i had it to do all over again
