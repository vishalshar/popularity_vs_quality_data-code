I have found only one problem with this stroller. When our son was 3 months old, the stroller became too short for him to lie comfortably in. And he couldn't sit yet in it. Note that the boy was not tall for his age. We had to buy Bumbleride Indie which was 4 times as expensive as Graco Vie, but large enough for the baby to lie even when he was 10 months old.
