We received the item in a very beautiful look exactly in the website pic. So we fell in love and we immediately wash it first so we can use it to our baby. But to our surprise, the thread are all coming off! Just one gentle wash everything is ruined. We did not even use it yet! Soooo disappointed! See the pic! I want to return this monster towel!
