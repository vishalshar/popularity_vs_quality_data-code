I was extremely dissapointed with this purchase. This bed is NOT cozy & SECURE. The sides fall down unless the canopy is attached. Also, Amazon states that all baby item returns are free. Well, unless you scroll down the page and click on the On Step Ahead shipping it goes unnoticed that it is NOT One Step Ahead's policy. So if you receive something that is totally mis-represented YOU have to pay to return it!!!! Just be aware of this when ordering from One Step Ahead on Amazon.
