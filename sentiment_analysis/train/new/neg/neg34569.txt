I received the bottles and sterilized them for three minutes and after the first sterilization I found them all melted together. I was very disappointed that I was never able to use them.  I really liked the design and thought that they would be a good substitute for nursing.  Next time I try a product out I will just try one at a time so it will minimize costs of a faulty product.
