I got these thinking I was going to use them to freeze, but soon discovered that they were horrible to thaw in the fridge. It is so much easier to freeze in bags as they can be thawed in a matter of minutes by running under warm water.The positive on these was that I used them to pump into almost exclusively. Pumping into bags is so inaccurate when you are trying to see exactly how much you are pumping. Maybe I am just OCD about it, but I wanted to know exactly how much I was getting from each side and per pumping and these were perfect for that. I didn't use for storage or freezing, but I still found these helpful.
