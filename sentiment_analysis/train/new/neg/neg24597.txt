Was initially very pleased upon receiving the mattress, tested it out to make sure it fit in our crib well, and it did. No gaps whatsoever. Removed the outermost cover for washing and unzipped the inner zipper out of curiosity to see what the inner workings of the mattress looked like and much to my surprise discovered that the 'latex' is dark grey!! In the pictures in the amazon description as well as the Naturalmat website the latex is off-white. I have never seen a dark grey latex mattress (my husband and I sleep on an organic latex mattress as well) and am concerned that this is not in fact latex foam. I have a call placed to the Naturalmat headquarters but they will be out of the office until Monday. I washed the outer cover hot (manufacturer states it can be washed at 140F and tumble tried low and it shrunk so much that it was nearly impossible to wrestle the mattress back in and once it was successfully zippered in it compressed the mattress so much that it will not lay flat and now there is a 2in gap between the mattress and the crib slats. With a new cover this issue would be resolved Have yet to decide if I will be keeping, will wait to hear from Naturalmat.
