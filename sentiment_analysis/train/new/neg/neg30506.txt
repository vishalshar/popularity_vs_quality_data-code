Was originally looking for a cute and warm toddler blanket that was not covered in licensed characters (not my thing for my DD). Came across this set at a great price so I bought the entire set. The quality is very good, what I would expect from Zutano, and I love love love the blanket with the super cute owl. My only gripe is the colors on the sheet set. There are odd green colors (split pea green, dark split pea green) which are abundant and out of place with the rest of the colors. I kept the entire set because I got it at a great price and I do love the blanket; however the sheet set will be a backup.
