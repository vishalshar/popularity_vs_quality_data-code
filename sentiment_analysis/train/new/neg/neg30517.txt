DO NOT BUY THINK BABY PRODUCTS!  The products leak and they do not take calls.  You must email them and if they do get back to you they have a terrible refund/replacement policy.  Basically, once they get your money you are on your own.  That would be okay if the product was reliable but they start leaking after a few cleanings.  You have been warned.
