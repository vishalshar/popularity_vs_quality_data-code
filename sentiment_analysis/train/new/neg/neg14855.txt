The clip bent so it doesn't really grab onto material anymore - kinda defeats the purpose of having it.  Since the clip easily comes off whatever you clip it to, my son insists on putting the ribbon and the metal clip in his mouth in addition to the "binky."  I didn't really think it was a big deal until I noticed RUST on the clip!  Went straight in the trash!
