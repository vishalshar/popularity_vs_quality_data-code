I bought these pins in 6 different colors. Some colors (Green, Blue, Orange) are excellent -- very strong, sturdy, sharp. Others (Red, Yellow, Purple) had very thin and bendable metal, allowing them to actually pop open during use on several occasions!!! I ordered two sets of each of the six colors, and my quality observations were consistent within the color....
