I got these as a colorful change from our usual cloth diapers that we use as burp cloths.  The fabric is good, medium weight (for cloth diaper/burp cloths) but it shrinks up quite a bit in the wash.  I would get again, though, just to have the colors.  I just wish Gerber would make their other cloth diapers in colors like this.
