This high chair is great because of its portability. Loved that it was light-weight, easily folds up, & that when it's set up (but not in use) there's a pocket in the back where you can keep the tray so that it doesn't end up getting lost or left behind. Now for the bad.So far there's only two things I've noticed:1. The tray is difficult to take off or put on.2. The high chair isn't as "high" as a regular high chair. This was a real bummer because I'm only 5'4" & usually with normal high chairs my baby sits high enough that I don't feel like I have to stoop down to feed him. This may correct itself as he gets older because right now he is only 7 mths.
