This is a nicely hand-crafted piece that, unfortunately, features a significant design flaw for the Hannah Baby baskets it's designed to hold. As seen in the photo, the moses basket has 2 handles that wrap underneath the basket itself. This rocker has a center bar running the length of the basket that is flush with the top of the two cross bars (forming an H), but since it is flush, the handles cause the basket to bow upwards down the center, which causes the baby to roll to one side or the other. Removing the center bar allows the basket to sag with the baby instead, so there is no solution - this flaw is built into the stand.If you have a basket that is completely flat on the bottom, this is a great piece to have - puts the baby right at bed level. If you have one of the Hannah Baby baskets this rocker is designed to hold, however, there is no easy fix. The center bar needs to be dropped about 1/2" to accommodate the handles; it's a simple oversight, but a disappointing one.
