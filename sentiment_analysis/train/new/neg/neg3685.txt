The nipples are great, not too wide and not too small either. They make the shape of the nipple part flat instead of round, which my son likes. We tried tons of nipples and he was very picky. The thing I don't like about these bottles is that they leak from the bottom - you have to screw it on TIGHT to prevent leakages. When I go to wash the bottles and unscrew the bottoms I have to struggle to get them off - that's how tight I have to get them on there so they won't leak. Also, I'm not sure if it's the material since these are polypropylene or the workmanship, but the plastic is thicker at the sites where you screw on the top and the bottoms and they just don't attach right. You have to play with it a little to get them on there straight enough to twist them into place without them going on slanted. I loved the ventaires but won't use polycarbonate. Other than the minor complaints I'm staying with these since my son seems to love them.
