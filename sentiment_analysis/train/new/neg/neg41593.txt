I received two blue car-themed pacifiers.  While I'm all for girls playing with cars and such, this wasn't what I'd ordered or as described even within the 'designs may vary' disclaimer.  However, they're an excellent replacement for the only other pacifier my daughter will take, which had been discontinued.  Just be aware that it's a super surprise in terms of design.
