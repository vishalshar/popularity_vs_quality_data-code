it goes through about 8 c batteries a week...after about one week of using this product, the swing only worked half the time, or it would not swing at the set speed....now, my daughter is 2 weeks old, and the swing doesnt work at all....i bought this product trusting the brand name, and was impressed by the lower price...but now i wish i had just spent the extra $30 and got a better swing...DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!
