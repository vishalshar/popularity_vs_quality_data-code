I was initially really excited about these sippy cups because my babies (twins) took to them really quickly.  Probably becaue the spout felt very similar to the nipple on their bottles.  It made the transition away from bottles easier.  Unfortunately they didn't last very long.  We used them for about 2 weeks and because the spout was so soft, the kids started to nibble on the tips and after a few days I noticed tiny holes in the spout getting larger and larger with every use.  Now the milk just pours right out and the spill proof spout is no longer spill proof.  I don't want to bother buying replacement spouts because they are almost the same cost as the entire learner cup.  I feel like I wasted my money on this product because I didn't get much use out of it -- 2 weeks was definitely not worth the money.
