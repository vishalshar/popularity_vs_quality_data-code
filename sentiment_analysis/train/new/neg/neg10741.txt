The Safety First Pacifier Medicine Dispenser seemed like a great idea when we first ordered it, I was pregnant with our first baby. I recalled trying to give my siblings medicine growing up and the struggle it was. However after we had the baby and attempted to use it we noticed some design flaws.The first being that the nipple for the pacifier part was extremely hard, unlike any pacifier i have ever seen a baby actually take. This seemed to make it difficult for our son to keepin like mouth unlike is normal pacifier, it also seemed to be uncomfortable for his little mouth.Second issue was that the medicine cup in the back of the pacifier was difficult to get off and on, which made lots of spills if it had medicine in it.The third issue was that the medicine would leak around the edges of the dispenser. You would think with it being so hard to take off it would be sealed, but it wasn't.Fourth issue, was that baby had to be laying flat on his or her back to have the medicine dispense properly into the hard nipple. The nipple was free flow so the medicine would just pour out of it, meaning baby would choke and cough if it was in his or her mouth.The end results were that the baby still needed medicine. You and baby needed to shower and wash your clothes which are no covered in medicine. I would just suggest using the baby syringe seems easier and some what less messy.
