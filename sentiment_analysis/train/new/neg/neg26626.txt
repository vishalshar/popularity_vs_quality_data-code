These ice mats pop VERY easily. If you fold the mat and then freeze it, you'll find that the cubes along or next to the fold have popped. As I have limited freezer space, I tried cutting the mat so that I would not need to fold it. Unfortunately, the cubes were not properly sealed into the compartments, so the cubes on either side of the cut immediately leaked.The mat itself is good if you can freeze it without popping any cubes. I drape Thermos ice mats on my head when I have a migraine, as they stay frozen for a good while and can be bent around my head. I would recommend this mat if you can freeze and use it without needing to bend or cut it into smaller sections. I opted for the smaller Thermos Ice Mat, 9 Cube, and not one cube has popped as yet!
