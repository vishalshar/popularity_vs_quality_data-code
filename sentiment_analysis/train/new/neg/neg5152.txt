I give this product a 2 because while it is beautiful, I only have half the decals up and its peeling badly. I laid the decals out flat for 2 days, I washed and dried my walls and my hands are clean. I did everything the directions said to do. I do have textured walls with gloss paint on them. I read on Google to use a bow dryer on the decals if they start peeling and it's supposed to make them stick better. I am testing a flower to see if it helps. And right now I will not be wasting my time putting the other half up if this is just going to peel off. I'm 36 days away from my due date and was hoping this would be a beautiful addition to the nursery above the crib.
