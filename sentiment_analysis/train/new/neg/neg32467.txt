Too small for my bassinet and there is a gap around the edges. Will use it for a few weeks but once she can move I will have to take it out. I have the delta playtime bassinet and another reviewer said it fit but it doesn't! Very disappointed. Would have just bought the more expensive bassinet if I knew it wouldn't be snug.
