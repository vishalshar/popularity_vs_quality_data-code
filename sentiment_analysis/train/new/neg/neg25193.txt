Not so Sticky! So we bought these because the description seemed to say a lot about the quality and great adhesion compared to others. They did not work well for us. After installing these on a low wood chest in the nursery our 8 month old at the time, she is 10 months now, immediately crawled over to the chest they were stuck on and she grabbed them with her mouth and pulled them right off like an animal! I tried reattaching them and then applied some new ones, no luck. She simply removed them again, this time with her little baby fingers. The wood surface was clean and well prepared for the application and were applied as directed. Honestly no other corner protectors have stood the test either. Baby does love to chew on them though. So now the danger corners of the chest are exposed and we will have to just risk it...or move the chest out of the nursery.
