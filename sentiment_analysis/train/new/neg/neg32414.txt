These bags fit my small diaper pail perfectly, but are not waterproof. To be fair, I keep this in the bathroom & put the poopy diapers in it after I've sprayed them (pockets with inserts removed), so they are pretty wet. When I take the bag out on laundry day, there's a little puddle in the bottom of the pail. I have to quickly put it inside my other larger diaper bag (Bum Genius) so it doesn't leak on the floor. I always drip dry these, so I don't think it's something I've done. I've only had these bags about 4 months so it's not from overuse either. They would probably work fine if using for a day trip, but are not really waterproof & don't work for saturated diapers. I'm glad I didn't pay a lot of money for these.
