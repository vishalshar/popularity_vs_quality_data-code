In keeping with our desire to have simple, natural items for our baby, and avoid plastic as much as possible, I got this set of maple teethers.I really really wanted to like them, and I do. They are excellent quality, smooth and a satisfying weight without being too heavy. Sadly, my little one didn't really like them too much. He chewed on them a little bit, but they were (I think) a little too thick for him, and he ended up chewing on other stuff instead of these. I'm thinking I'll try to use them later with wooden blocks as a different kind of toy. I was sad he didn't end up liking them!
