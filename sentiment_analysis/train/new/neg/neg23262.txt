I own three of these toilets.  The first two I purchased are wonderful.  The one at my house and the babysitters works perfectly.  The boy splash guard does what it is supposed to do. It is removable, but it didn't take long to teach my son not to touch it.  I purchased a third toilet to keep at grandma's house and was incredibly disappointed to receive a toilet with a molded seat and splash guard.  We have had more accidents with this toilet because the guard is not concave enough and high enough.  My poor mother (grandma) has messes to clean up all of the time and my son has to get a change of clothes regularly.This toilet is fine for a girl, but buyer beware for boys.
