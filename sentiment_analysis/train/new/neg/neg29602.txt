My baby is 7 months old. I bought these for her before she was born because it seemed like a good price compared to other diapers. The colors are great (except the neutral colors, I hated those and returned them b/c they looked bad). I can't say these are "one size fits all" diapers. When my baby was born she was a little over 7 pounds. These diapers were way too big for her.  I used pre-folds for her first 3 months then started her on these diapers. I like them however they do leak a bit when she stays in them for longer periods of time (nap time). I continue to use pre-folds during her nap times and over night because these diapers cannot handle multiple wettings. They're great for during the day when I know I can change her often. The snaps work well although it's not as easy as the velcro bum genius diapers I have. These are great if you need some extra, day time diapers for a good price, but I wouldn't base my whole collection of cloth diapers on them.
