I researched bags carefully before deciding to purchase this bag for use with my daughter. We cloth diapers, so I needed a bag with a lot of room. The picture of the bag showed a functional, cute, stylish diaper bag. I washed it for the first time after a couple of months and the bag faded so much that it looked five years old! I use free/clear detergent, so there wasn't anything harsh I used to wash it. Also, the velcro wore out very quickly which made the top part useless -- my items were falling out constantly which was a pain. Overall, poor quality, cheap construction. Will never recommend or buy again! My cheaper Eddie Bauer bag is way better constructed and sturdy.
