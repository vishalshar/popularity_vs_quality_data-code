I ordered this potty with high hopes. While it IS easy to clean and one solid piece of material, it is SUPER TINY!!  My son, 22mo, barely fits on it!! It also seems fairly flimsy. I know they are like $5 at the ikea store but you can't order online. I figured it would be nice to not have a million pieces to collect germs, but won't do me much good if he can barely fit on it. :( I would say if you child s over 25 lb don't even other buying this.
