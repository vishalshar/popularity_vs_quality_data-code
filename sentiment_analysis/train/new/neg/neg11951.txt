I really wanted to love this bag but unfortunately I couldn't deal with it.  It's true, the top opening is small but the bottom of the bag is wide, therefore, it's hard to see what's in the bottom of the bag and difficult to take things out.  In addition, the zipper pull as well as the buckles are quite bad in quality wise.  It's like some painted gold on top of heavy plastic.  If skip hop could improve it's quality by investing in better zipper pulls as well as buckles by using heavy metal, it would be a great hit because aesthetic wise, it looks good.
