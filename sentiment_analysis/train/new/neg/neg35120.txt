I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because the adjustable elastic strap on the sides of legs is kind of hard to adjust vs. the cloth diapers that have the adjustable snaps(like BumGenius). Also my average size 4 month old (11lbs) had a bad bruise on his left thigh from the diaper cutting into his thigh. It's been 2 months and it's fading but still there.  Even after adjusting it bigger diaper still slightly cuts into baby's thighs.  I really really wish that CharlieBanana would change that because I do LOVE the designs as well as the fact that these diapers are fast drying in the sun.  But unfortunately I ended up going with BumGenius Diapers.I still use these for going out briefly but not for night time.
