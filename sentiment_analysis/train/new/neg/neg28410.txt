don't bother with this thing, its cheaply made, the parts do not snap together as shown (in comparison to the original exersaucer)  so save the trouble, having a girl? want to deck her out girly style -  we did/are....  Babies R Us has a purple version that comes with a floor mat for tummy time too.... its about $30 more, but you save on a floor mat in the end...
