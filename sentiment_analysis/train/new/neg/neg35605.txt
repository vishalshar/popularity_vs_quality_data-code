I loved this set when I purchased it. It's colors are beautiful and are something my baby could grow with. I was unhappy with the white fabric on the set. It looks like Aida cloth (the material used to do cross stitching). I washed the item once on cold and gentle and the white fabric seperated from the blue and white squares creating holes in the comforter. I have had this happen with 2 sets. I exchanged the second set for a different style and brand.Beautiful set, just wanted to let others know about that since durability is important with frequent use and washings that baby items require.
