I bought two of these from Walmart in 2014 as Christmas stocking stuffers for my twin boys, who were 2 years old at the time. I could tell upon removing them from the packaging that they were complete junk. Opening and closing is challenging, even for me, so we used them ONLY with Elmo's mouth in open position, which made them no longer portable. My boys loved them regardless. I only ever hand washed, as per instructions, and the eyes soon rubbed off of one snack sphere; I used a black Sharpie to resolve the issue. My twins have finally detached from these horrific things, so I'm writing a review and removing them from the cupboard! If your children are Elmo fans, I highly recommend the Elmo fork and spoon set by Munchkin. I bought theses at the same time and they are still going strong and still well loved. We've also got the Elmo Toddler Bowls by Munchkin and those are equally awesome.
