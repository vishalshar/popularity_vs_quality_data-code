I purchased the this product in 2011 i only used it for about a year and put it away i recently pulled it out to give to my friend who has a baby when i went to rinse out the inside of it i noticed the enamel was flaked off, i looked more on the inside and also it was flaking off on the one side of the wall, now i did not notice this when i put it away i really never looked inside of it when i did use it. I called up the company and told them and they said it could be mineral deposits and i said no way it is black and i put my finger inside and wiped and there was silver flakes on my finger, they asked me to send them a picture and so i did within five minuets a manager calls me and tells me he is sorry but my warranty is over the one year limit, i said i did not care about the warranty or a replacement i said this is a problem there is the enamel paint flaking off where i put the water that goes in the baby food and this could be a problem he said no they do extensive testing and dont have this problem and that he is sending me a base that they have out of good gesture i said fine send me a base but this is a problem that i am sure will not be looked into. So i am informing all who have purchased this look inside with a flash light and make sure it is not flaking like mine.
