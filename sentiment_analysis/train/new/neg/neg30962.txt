The bag just barely fit a Chicco Lightway, but it did fit fine. The bag protected the stroller from damage pretty well on 4 flight legs, but the bag itself is now toast, especially near the wheels are completely torn up. Each leg added a more damage. I will likely buy a new one and try to re-enforce the problem areas before my next flight. But given the cost and the fact it did protect my stroller I think overall it was a good value.I also had no problem using the integrated stuff sack. The trick is stuff the bag into the sack, do not try to fold it. Start with the fabric nearest the bag and work your way out.
