This is my first review but wanted to spare anyone else my disappointment in this swaddler.I purchased this as my son began to outgrow the smaller size swaddlers that we used (he could even work his way out of the 42" square flannel that had previously worked so well). He still needed his arms swaddled or he woke himself up with flailing arms. I was pleased to find an easy-to-use swaddle in larger sizes.The only point of attachment for the two flaps is one small piece of velcro located midway between shoulder and navel. Immediately, one arm worked above attachment and one below. The result is an uncomfortable (swaddle tightens as matterial twists above and below arms), wide awake, struggling baby. If there were two points of attachment with velcro the flaps may stay in place. Since it does me no good as is, I'll try to sew on more velcro.The product description says this item "allows for a seamless transition from swaddling to a wearable blanket" but I never figured out what to do with the flaps when you have the baby zipped up in the bags. Perhaps they meant for the flaps to velcro together behind the baby but that gets all lumpy. I saw a fleece version of this and the flaps attached by velcro so using the bag with out the flaps was dome by removing them completely.The Kiddopotamus & Co. Cotton Knit SwaddleMe - Blue (Large)that we purchased at the same time has worked much better for us. It's been his primary swaddle for the last month and he's just starting to outgrow the legroom. I liked the zipper on this Summer Infant model, too bad it didn't work for us.
