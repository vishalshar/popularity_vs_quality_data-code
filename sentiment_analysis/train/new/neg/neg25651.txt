This bouncer is pretty stationary, it has almost no bounce. If you are interested in a bouncer that is made well and so bouncy that your baby can bounce their self with active movement (my baby likes to move and kick) and you can easily bounce with your foot if need be, check out the BabyBjorn.  I love that bouncer, I did not like the price tag it came with, but it has been more that worth it for us. It has no option for vibration or music like this one does but if your baby is just interested in the bouncy movement like mine is, it's a good choice.
