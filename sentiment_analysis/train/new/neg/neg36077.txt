I like the length of this sleep sack and the quality of material.  I don't like the care instructions and am afraid it will shrink if I dry it.  It's my fault for buying something with such finicky washing instructions but air drying a baby item is just not realistic - no one has time for that, especially if your baby spits up as much as mine does.
