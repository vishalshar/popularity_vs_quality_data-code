This thermometer can take room, surface, and body temperatures. I have found the room and surface temperatures to be mostly accurate. However the body temperature is WAY off. I will try calibrating it, but so far it's been off by up to 2-3 degrees, which is a huge range for a body temperature. It has even given me two wildly different readings 1 minute apart, when taken in the same room, same person, same spot on the body. It said my daughter was 99 then 101. Another thermometer that's proven itself accurate many times kept her at 102 through several checks.The only thing it has been useful so far is checking the brooder temperature for my baby chicks to make sure they're warm enough. The surface temperature seems accurate and consistent, as does the room temperature. But the body temperature has such a wide variance I just cannot recommend it for that purpose.
