very dissapointed. our daughter has sevral BUILT NY lunch bags. From this series we bought 3 of the munchler lunch bags: dog (lefty), pink panda (bo) and rabbit (Meadow). the Zipper on the rabbit was a tough zip from the start. after the 3rd use, the Zipper came apart and popped. really too bad, as it is such a cute Snack bag.
