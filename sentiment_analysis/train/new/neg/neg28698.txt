We purchased these seat covers for our minivan. I did not have high expectations for the price, but I was still disappointed. One of the covers ripped while it was being installed and was rendered completely useless. The other also ripped but we were able to leave it there to protect against our youngest wiping his feet on the back of my seat. I would not recommend these; and if I had it to do again I would have spent a few more dollars for something that (hopefully) would not tear during installation.
