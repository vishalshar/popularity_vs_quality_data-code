The fabric of the blankets is soft and snuggly, and while they are small, I knew that and was ok with it.  Unfortunately the quality of the hemming is awful.  The blankets are just rough cut and have surging around the edges, they're not folded over or anything to prevent them from fraying.  After one wash much of the surging has pulled out and the blankets are basically just 2x2 squares of unhemmed fabric.  As I didn't wash them until after the return period expired, I now just need to repair them, which means having to re-hem 5 out of the 6 blankets.  I'm unimpressed.  If the hemming was as nice as the flannel, they would have been terrific.
