I love the pacifiers. However I was unhappy with the service.  I have a little boy and they sent me pink pacifiers.  When I asked about it they said they wouldn't mail me the blue ones. All I wanted was to exchange the pink for blue ones and they wouldn't do it.  They were very rude. I will never purchase from this particular seller.
