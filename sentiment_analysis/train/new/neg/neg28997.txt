The bear does exactly what we ordered it to do. The heartbeat/womb sounds helped our first daughter to sleep and she still sleeps with her heartbeat bear (she's almost 3) and this is baby number 2's. I do wish the volume could be turned down more. The bear is also a darker chocolate brown than I anticipated based off the items picture which was disappointing for me.Edit - Once the womb noise times out, restarting it is a hassle. Just turning the switch to off and then back on does not work. It requires turning the switch to off multiple times to get it restart the womb noise. Sometimes it takes two times. Sometimes it takes seven. It's not reliable and I wish I would have purchased a different heartbeat bear.
