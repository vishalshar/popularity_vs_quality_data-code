This pump didn't work at all for the first pne I ordered. Customer service was amazing and sent me a whole brand new package. The new pump worked one time and was very uncomfortable (I used the power cord). The second time didn't work at all again so I used my hospital pump. My husband had bought me this one for extra convenience and quietness. Although customer service was awesome, I do not recommend this pump at all.
