I have used this bag with my infant Graco SafeSeat Step 1, and my (huge) Graco SafeSeat Step 2.I don't know what the right answer is for traveling with a car seat.  This is an okay solution.  I was hoping it'd be a heavy canvas, but it's more of a cheap duffle bag material.  The first time we used it, it got holes in it and the strap popped off while I was carrying it.  It's a battle to get the seat in and out of the bag.  But the carseat got to my destinations and back without damage, so I supposed it accomplished its purposeI don't know what the right solution is, but I hope someone comes up with a product better than this one.
