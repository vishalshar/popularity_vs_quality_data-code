This nipple on the bottle helped cause and maintain my breast feeding issues. The lactation specialist recommended it so when I used it  the milk flowed so much that my son got extra frustrated with my new low supply of milk and refused my breast.  I didn't realize it was a nipple that was too fast until I switched to dr. Browns and I noticed he tales much longer, is not gaggun and it is not dipping down his neck.  Those are symptoms of the flow being too fast which didn't cross my mind if supposedly he controls the flow so yeah he had to suck for milk to come out but with every suck so much came out.  He would spit half of it out after he finished and he would eat above his recommended feeding because he was still hungry because he ate so fast. I'm really upset about this and how it affected my breast feeding journey.
