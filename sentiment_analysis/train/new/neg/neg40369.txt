I love the graphic design of this and find the features of it usefull. We use it every day, my newborn naps in it in the living room.Putting it together requires a lot of previous experience putting things together or an engineering brain. The directions are vague and have poor diagrams or pictures. But that is my only complaint. But it is a big annoyance trying to figure out how to build it in the first place.We haven't transported it yet, so I can't comment on how that part will go.
