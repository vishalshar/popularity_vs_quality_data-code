It's a beautiful chair and looks great in my daughter's room BUT it's not the best. It's a small scale chair which I read on other reviews before purchasing. I'm 5'4 so I wasn't worried. I don't mind it being small but what I don't like is trying to rock my daughter to sleep and the front of the chair hits the bottom. It makes me feel like I'm going to fall out. It will be great for her as she becomes a toddler but I wouldn't recommend it if you're needing it to feed or rock your baby.
