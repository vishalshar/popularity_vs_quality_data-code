This unit arrived with a few scratches in the finish, not due to shipping. Some of the scratches will not be visible once in the baby's room, others I plan on retouching. Typical of MDB product...Altogether, the storage unit is fine.Please note: In the instructions, the bottom panel diagram is labeled incorrectly. Images of the bottom and center panels should be switched. It was confusing at first, but once I figured out the error, everything else moved quickly. The initial confusion was definitely frustrating - MDB needs to correct this! I have designed and typed out thorough instructions in my line of work and this sort of thing is a problem.
