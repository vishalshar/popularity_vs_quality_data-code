The "spoon" part of this seems too shallow for my daughter to get any real food on it when she scoops, so she just gives up and continues eating with her hands.  She loves them, however, and will often continue to hold it in one hand while eating the food with her other hand.  She is currently 16 months, so maybe she'll be able to use them better when she is older and has more control?A big influence for us is that it is made out of recycled materials, and we've been trying to avoid "virgin" plastics to help the environment.  I would have loved to have gotten a wooden spoon or pewter (and preferably Made in USA), but they both too expensive.
