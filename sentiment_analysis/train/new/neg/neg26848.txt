We have another haba baby toy (Kringelring) and my 5 month old baby absolutely loves it. She loves it so much that I thought I'd order something similar but new and fun for a long upcoming car trip. The Pixie is a very nice looking toy, and that's the best I can say of it.  It was not a good fit for us for 3 reasons. Keep in mind I am very concious about chemicals on toys and I also follow the basic "If it can fit inside a paper towel tube, it can choke a baby" rule.1. The "handle" piece is substantially thicker than the Kringelring, making it hard for her tiny hands to hold well.2. The other downside to the thicker piece is that it's so clunky that my baby accidentally knocked herself in the head with it pretty hard.3. The thing that bothered me most is that there is glue holding some of the small pieces on. The glue is visible and that means it would be in my babies mouth. Also, I worry about something accidentally becoming unglued and coming off inside her mouth.#3 Is a twofold problem for me, the chemical issue and the "paper towel tube rule" issue made this toy a no. I could have dealt with #1 & #2 and held onto the toy until she was older, but #3 was a deal breaker. I actually didn't even notice it before I handed it to her, it never crossed my mind to check for glued on pieces since the Kringelring is so well made. Thankfully I noticed and took it away. I'm pretty stunned that something with tiny pieces glued on would be sold for baby's. Granted, Germany has stricter guide lines as far as toxins in toys than the U.S. does but I still couldn't give it to my baby knowing something may come unglued from mouthing and chewing.
