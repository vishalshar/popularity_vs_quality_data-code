I bought this little puppy toy as a  birthday gift for my daughter.Shipping took 9 days (through USPS) and it became a late gift :(A big reason I chose this toy is because it is supposed to be able to bark. But apparently the battery was already out the first day it arrived - The barking sound is so so so ~~ low. Nobody can hear it without pressing ears very closely.To be honest, I was very disappointed.Gave it rating 3 out 5 - because it does look cute and my daughter likes it. If it can bark, I will give it 5 out 5.So be alert: It may have potential battery issue and there is no way to change the battery (I have contacted the seller). I am considering cut it out, change the battery, and seal it back.
