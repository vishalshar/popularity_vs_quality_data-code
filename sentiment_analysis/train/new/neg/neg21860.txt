I've got the sassy "pals" for my granddaughter, and she loved them. What was my surprise when my daughter told me their color started to run, specially the blue, which ended up on the baby's skin! I brought them back home to return them, but missed the deadline. The other reviewers don't mentioned anything like this, so I assume it must have been a bad batch. Just be aware!...PS - Since I've wrote this review, I have contacted Sassy, who sent me an envelope to send back the defective toys for Quality Control inspection. They also sent me a set of Stay Clean Silly Squirts, which my granddaughter enjoys. I was very pleased with their promptness, and their level of customer service.
