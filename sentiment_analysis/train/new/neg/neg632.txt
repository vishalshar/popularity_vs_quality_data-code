This is a really useful insert but I can't use it because it smells horrible! I washed it with Downy Unstopables and let it air out for over a month and it still smells like chemicals! I stuck my nursing cover-up, nursing pads, diapers and burp cloth in  it  and now they have the same smell... Don't know how else to make the smell go away.
