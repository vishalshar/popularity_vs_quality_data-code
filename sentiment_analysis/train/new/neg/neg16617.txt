The good: It's a sturdy crib, and was easy to put together, with a little headscratching.The stickers on our crib were placed on the wrong parts, so we had to take it apart and re-do it.  One LARGE sticker was placed on the wrong side, so it is kind of ugly as it is on the outside of the crib.  Also, the pieces put together are not flush, so it looks poorly constructed if you look closely.  I guess that's what you get for the price-but it is sturdy enough for my son.
