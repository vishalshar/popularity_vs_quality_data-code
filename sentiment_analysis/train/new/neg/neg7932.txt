This is an ok stroller.  I love the way it looks but that's about it.  The sunshade is useless and covers nothing on the baby unless we have our backs to the sun.  It is also difficult to figure out the recline and each side works independently so it takes time to get the baby even on both sides.  The basket is ok but you can't fold up the stroller if anything is in the basket.  Not great for a packrat like me.  The worst though is that the wheels squeak.  Obviously this is a recurring issue for Maclaren strollers because they have trouble shooting for it on their website. I have followed their advice for remedying this but to no avail.  They still squeak.  It can be nervewracking and it is embarassing to walk down the street squeaking away while the neighbors look on.  Bottom line: The wheels should not squeak on a stroller that costs this much.Maclaren needs to fix this problem pronto.
