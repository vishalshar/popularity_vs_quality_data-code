i loved these at first because the bamboo was so soft and absorbent, and you could stuff the pocket to add absorbency if you needed it. These will fit a chunky baby for a long time because there are a ton of waist snaps and room to grow there, however we are at 7 months and all the rise snaps are unsnapped and it barely fits like its supposed to. These have been retired in favor of other diapers more fitted to my long waisted baby.
