I saw another parent with this at a tourist attraction and thought it was so cute I had to have one.  It really is adorable, but not what I need at all.  I wanted a somewhat smaller bag now that my toddler is getting older, and we no longer need all the bottle paraphanalia and tiny baby stuff you carry around with a newborn that you never really use but are afraid to leave the house without. The diaper pad is almost too big for the bag, and once that is in there not a lot of stuff fits in it-after I put in a munchkin snack container, a couple of really small toys, extra juice box and my wallet, the bag is almost bursting and has trouble closing.  Forget extra clothes, or squeezing his jacket in there while we're indoors.  The diapers and wipes have to go in the back side pocket.  Within two days the magnet to keep the bag closed tore out of the liner.  The side pockets are also a little small-I have to really work to get his sippie cups in there, and my 16 oz water bottle (smaller than a Tervis) doesn't fit at all, which made me sad.  I still use it for small trips because it really is cute and it's comfortable to wear across your shoulder, but if you're going to be out all day, forget it.  And don't even bother if it's overnight-my purse holds more.  :(
