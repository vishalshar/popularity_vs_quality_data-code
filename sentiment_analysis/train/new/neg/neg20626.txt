The sling is too tight so the only way baby can be in the water is if the bath is completely full of water, otherwise they just hang above the water and get cold.  The head support underneath is very hard and is right where baby's head goes.  It's really big and doesn't store very well.  Haven't tried it without the sling yet, baby is only a few weeks old.
