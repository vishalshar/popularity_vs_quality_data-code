After much searching for a bath toy that would amuse my 16 month old son, I found this. It looked like there was enough here to amuse him during a 10 minute bath, and different cars running up and down on a track should be fun, right? Wrong.The cars don't move freely on the track, and the purple 'washer' things at one end stop them, and it's difficult to pull the car through. The other side of the track has these sponge-like grips that stop the cars from going anywhere on that side (not sure what they're supposed to represent). The orange sprayer at the bottom is very awkward since you need to submerge part of the track to fill it, something most small children won't even bother with.Overall, I don't recommend this, nor do I discourage anyone from buying it. It is what it is...a cheesy little bath toy that's kinda big and bulky, but doesn't do anything spectacular. Your child may love it, but they're most likely gonna play with the three little cars and forget about the track. Well, time to start my search for a fun bath toy all over again!
