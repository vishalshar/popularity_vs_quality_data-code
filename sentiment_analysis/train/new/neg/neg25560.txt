Swing away arms do not stay aside. They swing right back which isn't what I expected. Bought this thinking that when my baby is asleep I could get her out much easier without toys in the way. Also only one arm plays music (only when pulled in one direction) and it's only 2 songs and one monkey noise which gets annoying. The penguin also will not stay upright and that's what my baby always chooses to look at when it's facing her. Otherwise it's a cute well made bouncer with bright colors and cute animals. So far my 3 month old is happy and comfortable in it.
