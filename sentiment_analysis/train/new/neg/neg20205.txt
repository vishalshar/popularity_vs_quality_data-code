I was VERY Excited to purchase this pillow! I was so hopeful to actually get SOME sleep!Getting the big box delivered to my front door, it was like Christmas! I opened the box, took the giant pillow out of the wrapper and put it on my bed. It looked much flatter than the picture. I thought maybe it just needed to "rest" and fluff up after being stuffed in a box for so long.I left it for a few hours. Climbing into bed that night, I was so excited to sleep with my new pillow.I wiggled around to get comfy... but just could NOT find that "ahhh" spot. I laid in bed for a few hours in utter discomfort. Giving the pillow a chance... but finally got up and got my body pillow and another smaller pillow. I put the body pillow under the top of this pregnancy pillow, and the small pillow on top and laid back down. FINALLY I was comfy enough to sleep.The woman in the picture here is obviously a small doll, or pixie. I am 5'5" and the pillow ends at my thigh. There is NOT enough pillow to wrap between my legs. It is so flat... not enough stuffing, that my baby belly squishes the pillow completely FLAT.Wish I didn't spend $80 on this! Beings at it is NON REFUNDABLE... I have tried to contact them for a refund/exchange/return, and even though the product was delivered clearly defective, they do NOT care.Just a FYI, the company that sells this pillow is NOT accredited by the BBB, if you visit the BBB website you can search for "Baby Age" and you will find that they have a 'F' rating MANY complaints.Bummed out! What a waste!.
