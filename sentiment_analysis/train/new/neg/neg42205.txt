I ordered this sunshade for a trip to Hawaii to use with our travel stroller (Mountain Buggy Nano) since we were expecting a lot of sun and the shade on most lightweight strollers leave something to be desired.  So this canopy does its job as a shade well- attaches relatively easily, provides a lot of shade and seems well made.  The part that was NOT well thought out and is a deal breaker for me is that when you remove it (which I imagine you have to when everytime you fold most travel strollers) it needs to be put in the storage bag to stay closed.  The bag is not attached to the shade so it becomes this ultimate quest to find the little bag (which adds to the chaos of traveling with kids) wrestle with the springy shade to jam it in there and then still have to deal with the kid, the stroller, etc.  Every. Time. You. Want. To. Fold. The. Stroller.  The bag needs to be ATTACHED to the shade and there needs to be a streamlined way to fold it (I realize there are limits to these things but I've had those collapsible springy laundry baskets in college that folded 100x easier than this into its attached pouch).  Since you are likely using this with a travel stroller and when you travel you need to fold the stroller a lot, this was a deal breaker for me.  Its fine if you just leave it on the stroller but likely not how it will be used
