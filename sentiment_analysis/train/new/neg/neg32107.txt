I love Dr. Brown bottles but the brush they have is sub par.  It does do a good job of cleaning but is poorly constructed. The sponge tip is great but tears and wears in a short amount of time. The Achilles heel of this brush is how the brush head is attached to the handle, by two braided wires. If you like to scrub hard to get a good clean, the wire will bend to and fro and eventually just snap off.  To be fair, I'm a bit OCD with how I clean and I do have twins which means double the cleaning but I'm still disappointed by the product.
