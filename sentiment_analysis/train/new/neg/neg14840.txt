This product--when ordered from Amazon seller Play 'N Nature--is counterfeit and stamped "PRC," People's Republic of China. It is not made in Europe as claimed. Illegal and DANGEROUS. It is supposed to be for teething infants!!! First, the product did not arrive in retail packaging. Second, the insert & product description say "made in EU," but on close inspection the product is stamped "PRC." This means People's Republic of China is the place of manufacture, at least when ordered from Play 'N Nature. BEWARE.
