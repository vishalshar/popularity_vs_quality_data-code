I was excited to see these on sale this year after Black Friday. So I figured that I'd get 2, as my twins will most likely need them when we're out and about. The first thing I noticed was how the straps seem to be very close together at the base of the animal head. I thought perhaps it wouldn't matter; that the animal would weight down a little. Nope. I loosened the straps up quite a bit, and the straps still sat right on my twins' necks. I let them crawl around with them on. They thought it was a fun game. Why not let them get used to them? Not even 20 minutes wearing them, they have red marks from friction of these packs. Not really sure I'm going to even keep them after that. The twins seem to like the animals as just something to play with, so we'll see.
