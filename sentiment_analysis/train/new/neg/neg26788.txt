our crib is a Carters Brookline crib, purchased from walmart in 2013, in chocolate. It has since been discontinued. So finding a toddler conversion kit was hard. So I found this one by summer infant. Reading the other reviews, I found that this set was compatable with our crib. The colors match perfectly. The way this looks is beautiful!The flaws:Installation was simple, only issue was one of the special threaded screws was messed up so while I was installing, it ruined the inner hole thread and now the screw won't go in all the way. All the others went in just fine. Despite this, the rail is just fine and sturdy. (I've included a pic of the screw)When I purchased this set I knew that the rail was short but I didn't really realize how short until I actually installed. It would be awesome if the rail was 3-4 inches longer to keep my son from rolling off. We've had this set up for a week and my son falls out every night. Luckily we have a soft rug to soften his landing. He will get used to it, just hard to see him on the floor in the mornings. It's actually quite funny because he doesn't even wake up when it happens so that's why we aren't too bothered.Overall, it looks beautiful, I would recommend it to others, just make sure you inspect hardware before installing to prevent damaging what you already have. If your little ones roll around a lot during the night I would suggest another rail, or have something soft for them to land on.
