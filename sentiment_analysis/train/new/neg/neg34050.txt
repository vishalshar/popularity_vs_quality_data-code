I used Medela milk storage bags for the first 5 months of pumping and never had any problems.  I switched to Gerber Seal n' Go bags to save money.  Now that I have used up my supply of frozen milk in Medela bags I have moved on the the frozen milk in the Gerber bags.  I HAVE HAD ALMOST 20 BAGS LEAK AS THEY TWAWED.  The bags are flawed at the corners and leak.  I have called Gerber customer service twice now and they have been unsympathetic and repeatedly suggested that it was a problem on my end with how I stored them.  I kept the milk upright when freezing, kept them in a storage container in a deep freeze for under 6 months and thawed the milk in warm water in a bowl.  I froze the milk as they suggested and in the EXACT same manner as the milk in Medela bags and THE MEDELA BAGS NEVER LEAKED.  I have checked the lot numbers on the base of the bags and I have had milk leak from bags from two different boxes so it wasn't just that one box was flawed.  The customer service was terrible. The first time I called they said that they would send out coupons (which they never did) and the second time I called the lady said she would transfer me to someone else but just hung up on me.  My adivice is: FOR SOMETHING AS PRECIOUS AS BREASTMILK, DO NOT TRY TO SAVE MONEY BY BUYING AN INFERIOR PRODUCT TO STORE IT IN.
