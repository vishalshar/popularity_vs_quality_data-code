There are two tiny tabs that are supposed to push in on opposite sides to grip the door knob and allow you to turn it...but they don't work. They are too small to apply any real force, and they are not roughed up on the inside, so unless your doorknob is made of a very rough material, they just slide around without actually turning the knob. If you have one of those multiple-sided glass doorknobs, they might work with that, but any normal doorknob is not going to turn with these.The little flap in the center, that's supposed to give you access so you can use a key or turn the inner set to lock the door is too small to get your fingers into, and the flap is nearly impossible to snap back into place unless you hold the cover and press the flap very hard.Finally, after a very short time, my daughter figured out that the cover is not held together very well and she could just pull on it and it would come apart at the seams and fall off. So it even fails at its dedicated usage...keeping small children from getting out the door.If I'd paid any more for these, I would have returned them. As it is, I just threw them in the trash.Don't make the same mistake I did...don't buy this product.
