I had been eyeing the Bumble Bags for a while and when I saw the Jennifer Weekender, I thought it would be a great bag to use for myself and/or for my baby.  So I ordered it and I was disappointed, to say the least.  The outside fabric and the inside lining do not line up, causing the seam to pucker, and where the magnets come together is not properly lined up, and the pockets sit crooked.  The inside of the bag ( I chose the blue and brown print) was a very dark brown and it was very hard to see inside the bag and my things would easily get lost.  It comes with a small pouch inside and a changing pad, which is nice, but the changing pad is not padded at all.  I would never place my baby on it.  Overall, the quality was not what I anticipated and I felt that it is not worth the money.  I had really thought I would love the bag, but it left a lot to be desired.  Thank goodness for Amazon and their hassle free returns!!!
