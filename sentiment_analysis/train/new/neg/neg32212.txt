The batteries that came with it were worn out.  I replaced the batteries and it works okay- when I check it with an oral thermometer it is ususally close but once and only once it was 3 degrees off and the child had a 102 temp instead of 98.7  which is what the Kidzmed Vera temp reported.  will continue to0 use it first and then recheck if necessary.  The convience is perfect for my small children and children with disabities-I'm a school nurse.
