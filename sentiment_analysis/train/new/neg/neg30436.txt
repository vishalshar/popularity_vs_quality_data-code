It did not play "YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE". It played "OH TANNENBAUM"!  I read recent reviews that looked like they had fixed the wrong song issue, but they have not. It seems the sellers have had ample time to get the right product or make it known that the song is still wrong. Also the little turtle on top and the music box it's connected to are not securely fixed inside the stuffed animal. Therefore you have to squeeze on the box inside the turtle to keep it from spinning round and round rather than winding. I bought it for a seven-year-old who likes turtles. She fell in love with it. Otherwise, I would have sent it back!
