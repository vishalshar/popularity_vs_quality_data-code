They were so cheap I couldn't resist getting them. It really was too good to be true. They were misshapen, the mesh had runs and just overall disappointing. I put them in some out of the way spots where you don't see them up close. (Not  sure if these are still available, but the ones I would recommend are BugsNBloom ones. Pricey$$, but really nice.)
