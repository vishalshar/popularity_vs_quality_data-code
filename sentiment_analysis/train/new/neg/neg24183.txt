I bought this for my grandson's visit, and cannot believe the reviews that say the installation is easy. We used it rear facing, watched you tube videos and read the instruction booklet and still couldn't the lower anchor connector strap to tighten up. The car seat was also not stable  or level.Luckily, I had an app't already set up to have the installation checked by trained employees of our local car dealer(that's the only place around here that I could get an app't, don't do it at fire or police, or hospital)  It took two people  over 1/2 hr to get it in properly, they have 30 hrs ea. of training, Now I can't get it out of my car, I finally got the strap to loosen up, after fighting with it for quite a while, and now I can't get the hooks to release from the anchors. I wish I could return it.
