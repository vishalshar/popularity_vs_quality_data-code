I purchased this pair of so-called wet bags several months ago to tote our soiled cloth diapers home from when we are out and about in my bag. I was lured in by the economical cost (2 for lower price than 1 for some other brand bags) and lots of good reviews.In my opinion, they do not contain wet or stink very well. Honestly I've had better luck with using plastic grocery bags over these Kushies' bags! They are made of one layer of what seems to be slightly "water-resistant" material with and have a drawstring closure on the top. I have found that they will leak if anything truly wet is in the bag. I've put a rinsed out cloth diaper in one bag, hung it up in my bathroom, only to find a small puddle underneath it later. Damp, wrung out items do okay, but the way the bag is constructed, moisture from the wet or damp items wicks out of the bag through the Kushies brand tag on the side for sure and possibly through the side seams also. The other issue is that if you carry something smelly in these bags (say a soiled cloth diaper, even just a wet one) it will make whatever it leans against, say like the inside of your purse or diaper bag, smell like what's in the bag. Not cool to take a "wet" bag out of your purse and find a wet spot and stink in its place!To me failing at those things - not containing wetness or smell = failure as a wet bag. Spend a bit more and try a small Planet Wise wet bag (like Planet Wise Diaper Wet Bag - Gypsy Wave Small). I have bought 3 different sized PW ones since this ill-advised purchase, and none of them have yet to fail me through daily use and several washings per week these past few months. The PlanetWise ones have shamed these Kushies in comparison. Sometimes you get what you pay for, as for me I feel as though I got even less than what I expecting with these Kushies bags.
