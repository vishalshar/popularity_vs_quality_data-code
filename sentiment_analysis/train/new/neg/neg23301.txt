We bought this bag because we would fly frequently, usually with a plane change involved and didn't want to lug the car seat along through the airport, along with all the necessities for the kids.  The first time we used it, the bottom got all torn up, as if holes were worn in it form the conveyer belts.  We ended up using duct tape on the inside and outside of the bottom to reinforce it so that we could still use it.  The strap and zipper held up great.  I'm not sure if the bottom was flimsy or got chewed up in transport.
