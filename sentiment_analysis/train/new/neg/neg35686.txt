I bought this high chair about 16 months ago. The chair design is horrible in just about every way. The tray is 2 pieces so food gets stuck between them and the only way to clean it properly is to unscrew the two pieces. The two piece design also causes water to get trapped in between the pieces and I'm sure if left unnoticed will grow mold. The tray covers do not protect the most dirtied areas of the chair. I also have no idea why a selling point to this chair is dishwasher safe, it won't fit in the standard dishwashers I've seen.  Cleaning the chair part is just as annoying as the rest, it's easier for me to just take the entire chair into the backyard and hose it down because the chair has crevices that food gets stuck in and there is no way to clean them out without force. Chicco makes great strollers and car seats but this is a complete fail.
