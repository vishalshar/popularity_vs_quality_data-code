If there was an option to give this product 0 stars, I totally would. Because it is a fine example of declining quality of seemingly everything these days. Let me explain. I initially considered this gate because of the good reviews it received on the Amazon. Also, a friend of mine had this gate for a year, and it works very well for her. A no-brainer, I thought. Not so! As it turns out, I should have payed closer attention to the dates of the good and bad reviews on this gate. Almost all of the good ones are for prior years, and almost all of the bad ones are for this year, 2011. The "bad" reviews say that this gate broke within weeks or days of use...Guess what? That's exactly what happened to mine as well! Used it for about two weeks, and one day it just slipped off the wall, and when we tried to put it back, it would not work - the mechanism that controls the desired length of the top rod simply stopped working, and there was no way to fix it. DON'T waste your money - there are better alternatives out there! (hopefully....)
