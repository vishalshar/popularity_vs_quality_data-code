These have totally fallen apart after 2 uses.  I loved them when I first got them, since they were exactly what I was looking for as far as being soft soled.  However, whatever material is used to make them just cannot stand up to actual wear, particularly pool/splash pad wear.  I would not buy them again and they certainly did not even last us the summer, so I'll be on the hunt for other soft sole toddler water shoes.
