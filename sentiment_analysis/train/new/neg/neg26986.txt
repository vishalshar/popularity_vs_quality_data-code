This product is all right, but for travel and to fit almost every kind of chair imaginable...I would recommend for a bit more $ the TOTSEAT. Unfortunately, it is made in China and the Leachco (I think) is made in the USA. But I also am not thrilled with the Noah's ark emblazoned on this product...I prefer non-denominational stuff...my child doesn't need to be a branded with religious icons, hahaha!
