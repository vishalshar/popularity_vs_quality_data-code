I was dead set on having a doorway jumper for our son, I'd done a lot of research and settled on the Graco Bumper Jumper, I was so excited about it that I unpacked it as soon as we got home threw away the box and got all ready to mount it to the door frame only to find out that clamp is too small to fit the door frames in our house built in 1915.  I tried multiple models that I could purchase locally, I tried the Evenflo Doorway Jumper that I got from my local Walmart and I tried the Baby Einstein Sea & Discovery Door Jumper that I could get from my local Target and neither model fit over our trim so I ended up ordering this one as several of the reviews mentioned that it fit the trim on older homes.  The good news is the clamp fits our door frames... the bad news is that my son doesn't seem to be able to get the hang of this one. He'd been using the jumparoo at daycare  for a couple of weeks prior to this purchase and loved it so I didn't think there would be any problem with him using this but I was wrong  He has a horrible lean as soon as you put him into it.At the time he was just over 6 months old and was still getting the hang of sitting independently so I thought maybe he just doesn't have the body control yet to use this one so we waited... tried it again at 7 months same thing, tried packing towels and blankets around him to give him some more support and still no luck.  Tried it again at 8 months... same thing.In the meantime we brought that Graco Bumper Jumper to my parents house and it works every bit as good as I'd hoped he was able to jump in it with ease and steady himself no problem.  I really wish they offered a larger clip size for those of us with older homes with wide trim boards.For our house we're looking at buying a stationary jumparoo because this just isn't working and our son loves to jump.
