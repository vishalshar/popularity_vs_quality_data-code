I purchased two safeseat step 2 toddler seats in stellar. Several weeks after our purchase we took the cover off of one and found that a large chunk of the "saftey foam" came off too. We figured it might have been that way from shipping and had the seat replaced.  However, with the next seat we had them placed in the middle and door seat in a Durango. An adult leaned over the middle seat,to reach the door seat, and the foam popped off of that seat too. The foam is bulky and easy to damage, in our opinion. Also our two yr olds had  no leg room in the first row of our 04 Quest if either front seat reclined.
