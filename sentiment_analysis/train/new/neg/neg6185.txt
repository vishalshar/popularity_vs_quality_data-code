It's solid, workable solution to the common problem, How do I bathe my kid? The tub is about seven inches deep, which is probably sufficient until your kid gets big enough to use the tub like a normal person. The toys that are included are a nice touch, and the color scheme is acceptably muted.There are a couple of frills that I would have like to have had included. First, there should be some sort of anti-slip surface molded into the bottom of the tub. Realistically, toddlers get excited and then stand up...and then slip and fall. So a little more thought would have been justified. Second, the utilitarian nature of the tub is exposed when you don't add the newborn sling (more on that in a moment...). There is no design painted on the interior or exterior surface of the tub. You licensed Finding Nemo! Use the characters! Paint that stoner turtle on the bottom of the tub, for pete's sake!As far as the infant sling goes... it's a nice nylon sling that allows you to, theoretically, bathe an infant without them being fully immersed in a tub of water. There are two reasons (okay, I just thought of a third) that I would throw this away the instant you receive the tub, just in case a foolish caretaker or babysitter gets overly ambitious and wants to bathe your kind. First, it's hard to get off and a nightmare to get on. Second, the sling holds your baby off the surface of the tub. In the air. Even though you should NEVER EVER LEAVE YOUR YOUNG CHILD ALONE IN A BATHTUB EVER!!!, there are people who don't pay as much attention as they should. And the baby might fall off. More disconcertingly, however, is the third problem. Third, this sling, if you are foolish enough to use it, could easily allow your kid's head to get trapped between the sling and the wall of the tub. And that's kind of begging to lose a child to a bathtub. Just throw it out, and enjoy your unpainted, poorly decorative tub with two janky little toys.
