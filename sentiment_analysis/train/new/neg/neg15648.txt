This is a good idea in theory.. in reality it is a little cumbersome. It is difficult to whip on and off.. and let's face it. With a small baby you need to be able to get to them! Too exopensive for a sub par product. I actually don't think there are many accesories that work well with this stroller.. I just sold mine.
