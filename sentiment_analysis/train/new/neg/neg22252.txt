We tried this to keep our screen door closed. I followed the directions, but the adhesive backing wouldn't stick. I ended up using Gorilla Glue to glue it to the surface. BEWARE if you do that - don't make the same mistake I did. The glue will seep into the holes in the back and will glue the tabs you use to release the strap - meaning, you can't unlock it and it will be stuck. Yikes. Good concept, but the strap wasn't flexible enough and the adhesive wasn't strong enough for us.
