Although the description says this dispenser holds enough milk powder for 8 oz feed, it seems to be very tight.I need to press down and compact the formula powder to put in all the milk (ie... 6 scoops of formula).  If it was bigger, then it would be right to claim that it holds for 8oz powder.Also the PC material for this dispenser seems a bit fragile, I suppose that I need to be extra careful not to drop it or knock it.... as I think it might just break if I handle it too rough.Perhaps the manufacturer can consider using a more durable and BPA-free plastic for this product.
