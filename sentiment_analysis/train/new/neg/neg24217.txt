It works well enough, but is very tight on knee and foot space so if your child is tall for there age this will probably not be particularly comfortable for them for long periods (we got it for a trip down to disneyland).  Getting in and out also required parental help often times.  In our case our 4 year old found the rear seat very cramped, though she is on the taller side. Our two year old found it comfortable. Note that the sunshade does not provide much coverage for this rear seat.  We ended up putting a little blanket over the sunshade to the handle bars.
