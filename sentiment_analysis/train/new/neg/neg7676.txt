Products like this are really hit or miss. Our son just does not like these and will not wear them. They sit really close to his eyes. I have continually tried for six months. I finally gave up and found another product that has more space between his eyes and the sunglasses.Overall the product is very well made and looks great. Maybe your child will love them. A co-worker highly recommended them because his children love them.They just don't work for us.
