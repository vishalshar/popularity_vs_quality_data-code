I am not sure why this item got a 4 star average rating. I will not recommend this car seat to anyone. Although I've reviewed a Graco car seat combo before and gave it a 5 star rating, this one does not even deserve any stars. It has major flaws that would lead to injury and even death. The harness chest clip is so easy to unbuckle. The straps do not adjust evenly and it's hard to pull straps to tighten them. It takes forever and a lot of trouble to install it. And...the red harness release button does not always work. I will not put any child in that car seat knowing he or she might get stuck in there in case of an emergency. Product part had a recall. Look for something else because your kid is worth it.
