I really wanted to love this bottle. My little guy was having a tough time transitioning from boobie to bottle so I thought this would be the perfect compromise.  I never even got that far.  The bottle leaked all of my expressed milk out of the bottom while I was heating it up.  Then, when I turned it over to see if I could tighten it more, milk came spraying out of the nipple. Overall poor design and anything that wastes my time but more importantly my milk is a huge disappointment.
