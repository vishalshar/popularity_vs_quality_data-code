I have owned this massager for 2 years and use it infrequently.  Recently it stopped working.  I could hear the motor running, but the massage plate was not moving.  Im pretty good at fixing things so I opened it up, and discovered that the foot plate connects to the the motor via a fairly thin circle of plastic.  After 2 years of occasional use, that plastic piece had snapped.  There was no easy way to fix it without a replacement foot plate.  I consider this a design defect; that plastic circle should be thicker and thus stronger.  I contacted Medi-Rub (the manufacturer) to ask if they could send me a replacement foot plate, and I told them the massager was only 2 years old.  They said it would cost me $50.  Considering how expensive this unit was, I am pretty disappointed.  I will try another brand... and I recommend avoiding this unit.
