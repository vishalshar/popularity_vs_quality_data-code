I bought this as a gift to my sister in-law who is having her first baby and has no clue about bottles. I have had two and used Avent but..... when she opened these as a gift they were yellow and 1 four ounce bottle and 2 of the big ones! I paid 30.00 dollars for a set that I was suppose to get 5 bottles! My Avent bottles from Babies R Us was never yellow. I was embarrassed and I would never let my soon to be niece use these!
