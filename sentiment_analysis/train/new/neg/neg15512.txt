This is a simple little bath toy that makes noise when it hits the water.  Unfortunatly, you have to be very careful to remove it from the water and dry it off when done with a bath because some metal on the back corrodes.  My son isn't rough on toys and it stopped "ringing" after about 15 baths.  BUT, he liked it a lot while it worked.
