These diapers are useless. They do not absorb anything and you will be gaureteed leakage of both pee and poop, even for non-blowout number two's. I have these and Bummis and to put them in the same product category is a joke. Bummis are made of absorbant cotton, and with a reasonable frequency of diaper changes, rash cream and bathing my baby never has diape rash. The gerber diapers (this product), however, are made of cheap non-absorbent plastic and leave everything against your child's skin, or out onto their clothes. It saddens me to think that as gerber is such a well known brand, this product may be the first stop for parents interested in cloth diapering. How many tonnes of landfill waste have been caused by this product turning people off the idea of reusable diapers?
