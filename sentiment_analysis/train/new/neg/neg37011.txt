So I received this lamp today and since I had read other reviews I quickly unpacked it to see if mine would have the same pull chain issues. It does. The chain is just too long and the bee sits on pooh's face. I've contacted the manufacturer about this since the problem obviously originates there. Mine also came broken. The honey bee was missing one antenna. I was very disappointed but the lamp is so cute I'm hoping for a quick resolution. Update on this. Manufacturer says they checked all their stock and every lamp has the same problem and that my only resolution is to return the lamp to Amazon and buy something different. I thanked them for informing me of their quality control issues. I will be hesitating before purchasing anything further from this manufacturer.
