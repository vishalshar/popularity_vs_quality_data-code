Twice we have tried ordering this diaper bag, and both times it arrived defective. The whole reason we liked this bag was for the easy access wipes container. But it does not latch properly, it just pops right back open. So we have returned the item for good and are looking for something else instead. Otherwise it seemed decently made, although the messenger strap looks really uncomfortable to wear on your shoulder if the bag was at all heavy. I was going to make a pad for it, but we're just going to buy a different diaper bag.
