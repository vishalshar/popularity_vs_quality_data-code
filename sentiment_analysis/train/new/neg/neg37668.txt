We received 2 of these and were thrilled, thinking we would save our seats from harm. When we had our seats installed by a certified car seat technician (not all police officers are certified techs), we were told not to use these mats. They can A) void your carseat's warranty and B) be very dangerous as they may cause your seat to slip, even if it seems tight. The technician would NOT install our seats with these, so we took them back. I would rather have a safe child and dented seats than an injured or dead child and perfect seats.Another reviewer mentioned the Might Tite - again, we were told do not use this product as it is not tested to work with carseats and could come loose in an accident.
