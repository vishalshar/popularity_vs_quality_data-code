For me this is one of those situations that if you have a storage area underneath the stroller it's best to use that, because anytime you put extra weight on the back handles of the stroller it's going to flip once the child is removed.  But for the purpose of the review these handles did work well for holding additional shopping bags or a purse on our standard stroller handles, but on the umbrella stroller handles we weren't able to attach them securely on the upper part of the handle, so they went lower which ended up allowing some bags to drag and touch the ground.
