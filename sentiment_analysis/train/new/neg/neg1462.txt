Our son loves (LOVES) it. I find it annoying. He loves to roll it at airports and around the house. But on trips he gets tired and then job falls to me. The handle is too short for it to be comfortable for an adult to roll, and the strap that is meant for adults to use often ends up dragging on the ground or when I do have it across my chest I find the handle mechanism digging into my back... There must be a way to make this nicer. Having said that the kid is happy.
