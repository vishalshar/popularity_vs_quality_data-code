Almost does what it says.  Probably works well with the old style wider juice boxes, but most juice boxes today are very narrow and do not fit either way in this holder.  I just had to stuff a paper towel down to hold the box in place.  Otherwise it is just going to fall out.  Would not buy again, especially at this price.  Maybe worth â‰ˆ$3.00.
