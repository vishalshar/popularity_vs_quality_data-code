I have own this stroller for about a year and a half.  At first I loved it!  It is beautiful!  But once you start to use it, the wheels start to squeak and the steering is horrible!  I now have the hardest time opening my stroller and getting my toddler around in it.  I don't use it everyday only for trips. I purchased this stroller with the idea that it would last me until by child was to big to sit in it.  But I am now looking for yet another stroller to replace this one.  My daughter loves to sit in this and can nap in it, so it is very comfy but I have the hardest time taking her any where in it. The company is great to work with the will try and send you new wheels as they are stating that the wheels need to be replaced. They will work for a few strolls than the will start to squeak again.  I have a bumble ride indie and this stroller is amazing!! I just was looking for something a little more compact and easy to travel with.
