When my daughter was a newborn this was just awful for her. The sides were too high and she slouched to the side. Because of the high sides and slouching I was afraid she would press her face into the side. I was able to roll up a blanket to put on each side of her to hold her up, but the sides were too high to easily get her out. By about 2 months she fit much better.I like that it's easy for me to take around the house so I can have her with me while I do laundry, or if she wakes up too early and I need to take a shower I can have her right outside the open bathroom door and beside me while I put on make up. But she doesn't like it much. She is willing to tolerate it for a while for my little tasks but not for long. I think it might be uncomfortable. It's just a hard plastic bucket with a slightly cushioned fabric covering.
