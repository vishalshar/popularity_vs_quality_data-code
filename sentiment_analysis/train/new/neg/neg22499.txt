I ordered this product even after reading reviews indicating the material in the package is not enough to adequately surround a small table.  I tried to put it around a table about 3'x4' and sure enough, there was not enough material.  The item sticks to tables using double sided tape and is easy enough to put on.  I have not tried to remove it yet, so I don't know if it will cause problems or not.  I ended up using two packs for the one table.  My son has bumped his head against it a couple of times since installation and been fine.  Then again, he bumps his head on stuff pretty often and seems none the worse for wear too, so don't know if it's saying much.
