The first use of this at the beach and all of the fiberglass poles broke. My baby was just sitting in it and I noticed that they looked like they had "popped" out. Nope. They had broken off and made a splintery sharp pole. I am so upset. My baby could have been hurt by this!! Do NOT purchase. What junk for the price.
