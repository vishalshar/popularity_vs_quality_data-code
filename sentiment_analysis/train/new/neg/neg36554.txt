I want to love these more because of all the great reviews. The overall footprint is on the small side so good for toddler but also holds enough for the 6-7yr old if it is filled since the wells are deep. Love the recycled concept. These trays are very hard plastic. Surface not super slick/smooth on interior as shine in photo would lead you to believe. Curves of bowl and hard plastic make this slide very easily across a wood table. Not so great. Cleans well on top rack of dishwasher no problems. It's a preference thing I suppose. They aren't bad. I like the stack-ability. Was disappointed that the color was off. The pink i received isn't as bright but a muddy almost purplish almost mauve but still pink shade.
