I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas..  The pull cord is less than eight inches long. It's way too short for her to pull this behind her while walking. The toy is adorable, however, I woud have returned it had I not removed it from the packaging before I realized that the cord was ridiculously short. Highly disappointed.
