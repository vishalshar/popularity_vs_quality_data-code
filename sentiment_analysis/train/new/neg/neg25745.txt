I have never given a one star review and I hate to with this product.  We assembled and my son tried it and loved it!  However, the tread keeps slipping to the right.  The direction on how to fix this problem are erroneous.  We have tried several times, but the tread keeps slipping to the right, when my son tries to use it  My husband got a blood blister and a nail came off Randall the rest were cracked when trying to rectify the problem with the tread.  It is a shame because my son loves to use it.  It will be a huge pain to disassemble and return and a huge disappointment to my son.  .  The directions give a phone number to call if you need technical support, but they are closed until January 4th.  This does not help someone who tried to purchase this as THE gift for their son for the holidays!  Really bad timing, and while everyone deserves a holiday, you'd think that they would have better customer service sense and at least take some calls between xmas and January 4th.  This review "might" change after discussion with the company but right now, I am more than upset with this purchase.
