I have bought 2 of these bibs, and have only had a problem with the polka dot patterned one.  The instructions say they're machine washable, but the print started coming off after I hand washed it with regular dishwashing detergent.  Then, the washing machine took the rest of the color off the bib.  It's effective at keeping the baby clean and I was always surprised at how much food was caught in the front pocket, but, for the price, I'd expect it to stay looking new as well.  I've had it replaced twice now, and will just get a refund this time. This didn't happen with the flower pattern.
