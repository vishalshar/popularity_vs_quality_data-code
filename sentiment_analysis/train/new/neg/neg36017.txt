My daughter turned one just two days ago.  She weighs 19 pounds.  She's in the 50th percentile for her weight and very small in stature.  I took this birthday toy out of the box today and gave it to her to play with.  Within the first three minutes I heard her screaming and crying.  I ran over to see that her hand was STUCK in the triangular door. I tried to remove her hand but it was very, very hard. Ultimately I had to crush her fingers together and just pull, with the door scratching her skin as I yanked it out.  I will not give this toy to my child to play with again and I suggest you don't get drawn in by the cheap price. They have probably gotten a lot of complaints about this and that's why it's so cheap now and Amazon has run down its stock. STAY AWAY FROM IT!
