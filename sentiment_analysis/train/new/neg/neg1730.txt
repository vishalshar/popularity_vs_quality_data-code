I wanted to love this diaper bag. It is the size I wanted, has a number of pockets for storage, came with extra bags helpful for organization, and looks stylish. I love the all soft construction for ease of washing. The downside is that after only a few months of use the stitching is coming out where the shoulder strap and stroller straps attach to the bag. For over $100 this should not happen after so little use, I didn't even wash the bag yet. I attempted to contact the company about this and they never replied to me. Disappointed in the quality of this product for the money and 7 A.M. ENFANT customer service.
