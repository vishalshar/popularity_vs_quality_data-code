The product is very good including six bottles, a machine, an ice bag, 3 ice boxes and a travel bag.  But the power of the two suctions is different, one is heaver than the other.  The delivery is very bad, I bought it on Jan 25 and got it on Feb 11.  The seller sent the product three days after I bought it and the product was transferred within the U.S. for 7 days long (from Mount Juliet, Nashville, Miami, Isc Miami FL, Miami, West Palm Beach, Louisville, Anchorage), I don't understand why it was transferred so many places within the U.S. before sending to Hong Kong.  And the delivery timing is completely different from what the seller told. I am very disappointed for this.
