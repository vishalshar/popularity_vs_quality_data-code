This product has a ton of great reviews on many different websites. I looked for one of these trays to add to my daughters stroller for months before I bought this one. Maybe its the type of stroller my daughter has (Britax) but it does not fit that well. The straps are adjustable which is a great feature, but it doesn't sit itself flat like you see in the picture. If we have a drink in the older, it can easily spill (and has) all over the stroller. It's not a bad product. I can still fit my water bottles or phone and keys in it, but with how it sits on our stroller, I wouldn't recommend this product. We still use it just because I don't want to be disappointed getting another one, and it serves its purpose as long as I don't have a to go drink in it, but its just okay. Again, maybe my stroller is just a little too big for this, but you shouldn't advertise that it works great for any type of stroller if it really doesn't.
