The inexpensive price of this dresser is NOT worth the trouble to assemble and the low quality of the finished product. A couple of the panels came with scratches on them. The instructions were confusing (e.g., the picture indicated that you should attach the drawer track in the middle of the drawer, but it should have been flush with the outer edge). The pre-drilled holes were not in the correct spot, so drilling into them pushed the screws through the back of the dresser. Parts were missing (e.g., screws). The finished product has wobbly drawers, even though they're on track, and a wobbly cupboard door. Basically, it's cheap. I'm going to contact Stork for either a refund or a return for a new dresser, which is something I don't exactly have time and energy for with a baby on the way.
