When It was time for my baby to give solids I researched for hours and hours the highchairs and thought I found the perfect high chair that had all the options that I've been looking for. We live in a small apartment, so it was very important that the chair was folding and didn't take much space. While this chair reclines well(loved that feature if you have a small baby who can't sit well yet), folds into a very slim form there are things that I came to really hate and overall I think this is not a good highchair. The fabric is not easy to wipe kinds. It is a strange fabric that is more suitable for clothing than highchair. It does not wipe easily, it even kind of catches on to the rag and won't allow it to smoothly glide over. Stains very easily. We wash ours quite often as a result. But the part that pisses me off the most is this: Today is the third time I heard my baby scream in pain and when I looked closely I found her arm caught in this awkward space between the chair, tray and a chair leg. I don't know what idiot designed this chair but I am upset!!! I am attaching the photos. And once her arm get's caught in there, there is now way to remove it for her without screaming and asking for my help. And I have to carefully take her RED, SWALLEN arm out. I wonder if there was a recall on this chair????
