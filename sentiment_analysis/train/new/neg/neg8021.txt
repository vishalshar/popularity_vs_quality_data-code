Be very careful with this sleep sack...the fabric around the neck is not stretchy, and was so tight on my baby's neck that it left a mark.  I don't think she has a super-fat neck or anything and it was scary when I realized it was choking her. Thankfully I noticed it as I was putting her to sleep, and was able to take it off right away. Just be careful.
