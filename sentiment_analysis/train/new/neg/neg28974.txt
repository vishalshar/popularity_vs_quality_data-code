I had been looking for a construction-themed crib sheet for my son for a while, no luck, and then this thing popped up on amazon.It is just terribly terribly cute, and my boy loves it.  My complaint is this:  it is super super stretchy.  This is good when you're just putting it on a crib mattress -- you don't have to wrestle with it the way you do with some less stretchy sheets -- but it is so stretchy that there are ripples/ridges in it once it is installed.  Not taut and smooth.A decent value for the money but still, pretty imperfect.
