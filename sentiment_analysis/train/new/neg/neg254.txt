The Early Years Baby Tea Party Set arrived today and I'm very disappointed in the quality.  The teapot is described as "playing 'I'm a Little Teapot'"...yeah, right...perhaps if the teapot is held very closely against one's ear, then you'll be able to hear the cheapest, tin-sound barely recognizable as the "Teapot" song! For the cost ($24), this product is very over-priced. The 'song/sound quality' is exactly like dollar-store items, and is worth only $1 not $24. Made in China at a low cost + sold to American consumers at a huge profit = totally unfair!
