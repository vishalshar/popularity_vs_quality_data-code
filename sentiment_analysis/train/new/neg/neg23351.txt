The construction and materials are decent enough for the price, maybe a step above IKEA type furnishings.  Instructions were adequate to get the job done, but I have put together many of these type of things so someone with less experience may get a little frustrated at times.  I was dissappointed that there were no filler buttons to cover the screw holes, am trying to make those myself to hide the screws, it would be an easy thing to include with their finish but maybe they don't because if they were not put in right could come out and would be a choking hazard. The hanger system for the mattress is a little iffy, but at least it is adjustable in height.  The rolling bin for under-crib storage is not much for quality but at least they provide it, it will crush pretty easily should we decide to dumpster it!  The finish looks good new and it matched the 4 drawer dresser and changing station well, time will tell how it holds up.  Overall I think it is worth what I paid, not a Henredon but not a piece of diaper filler either.  As part of a set it was a quick way to get the baby's room ready to go. Consumer Reports gave it a very low rating but no supporting information as to why, if I figure it out will let you know!
