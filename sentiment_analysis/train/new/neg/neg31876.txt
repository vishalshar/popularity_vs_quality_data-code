This is a cheap product.  It does not work for what it is intended for.  The net would not stand up on its own no matter how tight it was, and kept falling over.  Even with the ends connected to posts in the ground, there was always slack and it did not prevent items from getting past it and into the street.  It was a waste of money.  The pipe on the end bent when an object rolled into the net and the item was no longer it its original condition.  The need to return it in its original packaging and condition is also ridiculous.  One cannot test it out without taking it out of its original packaging and be expected to return it in its original condition.  The fact that it would cost more to return the item than just buy a new item is also ridiculous - having to pay for shipping and a restocking fee.
