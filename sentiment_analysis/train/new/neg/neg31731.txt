I was very disappointed in this product- I had heard so many great things about this brand! Although the mobile is beautifully balanced and spins well, the mobile itself is made out of very cheap, flimsy plastic, which might not be so bad if the propellers didn't all rip. I'm just wondering how long this product will last, as nothing "clicks" into place. The only reason I gave this product more than one star is because it does hang so beautifully.
