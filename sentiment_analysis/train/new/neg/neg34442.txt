Item sent is cute, but it only has the high contrast black and white on one item. Disappointed that none of the bugs match the photo. One is yellow, blue and orange and the bug rattles softly. One is green, black and red and the green portion that attaches to the velcro crinkles. The last is orange, green and purple and attaches to the velcro with a black and white striped barrel (like the lady bug in the picture). This one makes a louder tinkle-ly sound. The wings are not crinkly like they were in the older version.
