I got this swing because it has a big open seat that my baby could grow into and be able to use as he gets larger, because a lot of swings have plastic seats and are outgrown before the baby reaches one year old. The seat is pretty much what I expected but I felt that the material was cheap and so is the harness. The real disappointment came in the swing itself, you select the swing speed and then per instructions, push the swing to start it. The swing doesn't seem to really have speed settings but just maintains the speed in which you push it. For example, at the lowest setting I could push the swing slightly and it would stay at that speed, but I could also push the swing harder on the lowest setting and it would swing faster. Who wants a swing you have to manually push to start? Am I at the playground? Next is the stability of the swing seat. It's very shaky upon start up, as if the motor is having difficulty and the swivel seat does not lock in place, it just clicks from one position to the other, so if baby was in the swing in the side to side position and you bump into it, it gets knocked out of that position very easily. Lock-in position is important for safety and the "click" seat is designed to change the direction of the seat with ease, but just bumping into it and it moves is poor construction. The seat is also wobbly because of poor support bars and the adjustable seat moves a total of one inch lower than the upright position. Finally, the music box music is awful, high pitched tones with tunes that are attempting to have more "modern" sounding themes. Packaging was fair however what wasn't covered with foam wrapping was scratched up. Needless to say, I returned this swing and I don't recommend it, such poor quality for the price.
