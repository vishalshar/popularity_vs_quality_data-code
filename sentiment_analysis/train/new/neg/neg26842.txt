It's hard plastic....I thought the clear parts would be squishy but the whole thing is pretty hard. Also, can you see the small scraps of rubber sticking out on the blue and purple parts! Those need to be cut off! It's like they have zero quality inspection and that makes me sad because munchkin has such interesting products.
