I was so psyched to get these for my one year old.  We have other Boon brand toys that are really fun and creative.  I love the colors of these creatures, but that's it.  I am SO disappointed in them.  They don't fit together and are basically just cups with holes that aren't fun.  They advertise them that you'll switch them around but that's not possible.  The pieces match up but do not stay together, making them very frustrating to play with- for me and for my kid.  Skip this item for sure.
