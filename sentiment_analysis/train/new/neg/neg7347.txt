The product without the case, I'd give 5 stars to!!  I love the table toppers, they are excellent for when dining out anywhere, you just stick them to the table and you don't have to worry about how clean the table may or may not be and the mess can folded right up into the topper and thrown in the garbage.  The travel case here is much larger than it needs to be.  It would take up a lot of unnecessary space in your bag.  The regular product just comes in a zip loc type bag, which is fine by itself and takes up much less space  :)
