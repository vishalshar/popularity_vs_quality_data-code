nice color and pattern, however the mattress cover runs a bit short, not sure if its because it got shrink after washing. Also if you have one of those cribs that has a bit thicker wood bar, you might want to reconsidered, because the bumper string sometimes runs a bit short. In our case, for all bars at four sides of  cribs, the string is ok, long enough to tight a knob, but at each of the corner, because there were two bars side by side, we were not able to tight them, so as a result the bumper did not fit nicely as a fitted rectangular. So definitely check your crib before purchase.
