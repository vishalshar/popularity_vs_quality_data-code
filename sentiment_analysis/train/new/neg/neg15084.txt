I purchased these to use on my changing table at home as we have had a few "accidents", as all new moms can relate to. However, they are very short - shaped more like a square than a rectangle. They are waterproof and cute with the Sesame Street characters, but would not be very practical when my baby starts wiggling around more. I recommend Munchkin Arm & Hammer Disposable Changing Pad - 10 Pack, as they are larger.
