I purchased these bath toys for my son. With just under 1 month of use I found one of the toys to be filled with water. It appears that a hole came from a tiny air bubble in the rubber. Upon inspection of the other bath toy items in this pack, the tiny air bubbles were there as well so I can only expect more holes in the future. For the price of these toys the quality should be much better. I cannot see the remainder of the set lasting much longer. I'm very disappointed.
