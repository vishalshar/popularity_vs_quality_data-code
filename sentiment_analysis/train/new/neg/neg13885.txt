I use mostly cotton prefolds and covers for my baby but I purchased a few of these on sale with the idea that I could use them for babysitters and others inexperienced with cloth diapering.  These diapers are simply not worth the cost.  First, they have a fundamental design flaw in that the liner comes all the way to the top of the cover material -- which means the liner material, which is getting soaked with your baby's urine, is touching the baby's clothes.  This causes the diapers to leak if they are not changed immediately after the baby urinates, which is simply not practical.  I simply never have these leaking problems with prefolds, although you will have the occasional blowout with prefolds just as you will have with any diaper.  Second, I find pocket diapers awkward to use because the inserts are annoying to put in before you diaper the baby and even more annoying to fish out before you launder the dirty diaper.  These diapers are especially annoying to stuff and remove because the inserts stick to the material of the pocket. Not to mention the fact that pocket diapers force you to wash a cover with ever dirty diaper, which just doesn't make sense, while regular covers are reusable until soiled.In short, while I am a big fan of cloth diapering, I do not recommend these diapers.  You can have half a dozen prefolds and a cover for the cost of one of these diapers, and you have a much more effective diapering system than these diapers.
