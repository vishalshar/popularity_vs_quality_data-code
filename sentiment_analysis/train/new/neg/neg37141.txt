When they first arrived, my 1 year old loved them. Within a week of using them, they started leaking. It didn't start at first, but within using it for few days I started noticing my lo pants wet in the car seat. First I though he wet himself, but than I realized, it is the cup. Not just one, both of them. Very disappointing, since Munchkin is usually my brand of choice.
