This cup was very expensive and not worth a penny. First there are way too many parts to assemble. Then once assembled it leaked really bad no matter what I did. Just a note I read one review that said the baby version does not leak but the toddler trainer cup does leak. I got the toddler trainer cup because I wanted a hard spout. The only cups I reccommend are Playtex and Avent. Avent does leak worse than the playtex but they are the only so called leak proof cup that I found with a hard spout for those teething babies and toddlers with handles. My son had to have a cup with handles but was constantly chewing through the soft spouts.I found that the avent brand is pretty leak proof but sometimes you need to readjust them. Playtex are still the best leak proof cups in my opinion they just don't make one that suits my son.
