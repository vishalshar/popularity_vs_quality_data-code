Very thin, brightly colored washcloths. Only one side has that soft, terry-cloth feel, with the other being a flat, smooth "B-side" of the cloth.  I believe I've seen mothers clean up babies with this type of thing after a diaper change, and it would probably be fine for that.  I use these for warm compresses that my ophthalmologist recommended for an eye condition, and due to the thinness, they don't seem to retain the warmth well.  Still, there's something appealing about the brightly-colored designs and the fact that there are ten of them -- if they don't work for your intended purpose, you'd likely find some other use for them.
