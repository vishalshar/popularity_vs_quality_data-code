I don't think I'd buy this again or give it as a baby gift just because I didn't use all of the items within the package and wasn't impressed by the quality.I've used the medicine nurser, nasal aspirator, thermometer and the nail clippers out of this kit so far.The nasal aspirator was useless in my opinion. It was virtually impossible to get enough suction to get the snot out of baby's nose and it wasn't for lack of trying. My baby didn't take to the medicine nurser so I can't really attest to how well that one works.I'd recommend the Summer Infant Complete Nursery Care Kit over this one.
