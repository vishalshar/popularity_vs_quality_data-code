Updated review, 12/23/15, 3 stars:I've been using these spoons exclusively for about 5 or 6 months now and they are great! The soft silicone helps keeps my son's little baby teeth protected as he bites down on the spoon and learns how to eat. While I can't attribute his healthy appetite to these spoons, I think they definitely help the overall process of feeding him. About a month ago, we lost one of the spoons while on vacation and my husband ended up ordering more of these OXO spoons online. He ordered the blue ones again and what we received were a much lighter shade of blue than the ugly one we received months ago in the photo shown from my original post/review! I'm not sure if OXO changed the color or if they have a lack of consistency in their manufacturing. However, the blue, while not as light as what is shown in the main product photo, definitely has a resemblance to the color that they are advertising. It was not a disgusting shade of blue that we had previously received. Based on the functionality of the spoon and the color of the new spoons we purchased, I'm changing my rating to 3-stars from 1-star previously.Original review, 1 star:I feel compelled to write my first Amazon review bc I was so disappointed when I received these spoons! Not for the functionality, but for the color! It looks like a vibrant aqua color in the photo, but when I received it, it was a dark ugly blue-green. It was definitely not as advertised! I'm returning these ASAP and trying the green instead.
