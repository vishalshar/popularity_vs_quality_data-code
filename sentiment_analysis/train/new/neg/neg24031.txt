This cup is SO ANNOYING! I bought it for similar reasons that I'm sure other may consider- because it's cute and reasonably priced. I wish that I would not have spent the few dollars that I did on this cup. It is cute and it is reasonably priced, but it is such an inconvenient product. The rubber nipple piece that is placed into the larger plastic top is nearly impossible to remove for cleaning. If you are able to remove it for cleaning, then I bid you good luck in getting it back into its plastic top. In addition,  this cup leaks ALL THE TIME! Sure, the nipple is no spill but mine seems to always leak on the side. This morning my son was completely covered in water after he was able to pull the top lid loose enough to get a water leak. He is 1 year old. This should not be possible. 2 stars. 1 because it is cute and 1 because it is reasonably priced. That is all.
