I really liked the look of this plate and loved the fact that it's BPA-free.  I returned it because it did not stick/suction to my son's high chair tray very well and that was the whole point in buying it.  I thought I finally had the plate secured to the tray and felt comfortable enough to put spaghetti and veggies in it and set it in front of my 15 months old.  Within less than 5 seconds he'd managed to get the plate off the tray and spaghetti, of course, went everywhere.  I did not try the warming feature so I cannot attest to that.
