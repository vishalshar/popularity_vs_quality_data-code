The only reason this didn't get a 1 is because my daughter absolutely loves her new bed. So, there's the silver lining. But the whole set is 100% polyester. I can't think of another word to describe how it feels besides disgusting. It slides around on her mattress. We live in Texas and it gets hot, even at night. I wish I had just returned this set and gotten cotton sheets and a throw blanket instead. It also would have been cheaper... Parents, save your money. Find other YGG decor to fill your kid's room.
