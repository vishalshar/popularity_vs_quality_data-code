I ordered three of these covers in different colors at the same time. The red one was the only one that had double leg gussets, so it worked better than the other two. I anticipated using the same cover for several diaper changes before needing to change it out. I heard people say that you could just wipe out the inside if the child had peed and reuse it until they pooped. However, I found that since the piping around the leg holes was made of material that absorbs liquid, the leg holes were often wet once the child peed. I was never able to reuse the covers, so I switched to pocket diapers. Also these didn't fit my son until he was about 15 lbs. They were bigger than expected even snapped to the smallest size.
