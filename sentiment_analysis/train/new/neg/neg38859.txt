I loved the idea, and the chart and stickers are very cute. My toddler find stickers motivating and it seemed like the perfect potty training tool. But toddlers are finicky little creatures, and I cannot tell you how torturous it was to have the stickers constantly falling off! They are made of some kind of cardboard material and the adhesive is not strong, so they don't stick well. My obsessive-compulsive two-and-a-half-year old was constantly picking them up off the floor trying to stick them back on the chart, where they wouldn't stay stuck! Putting stickers on the chart became a long and frustrating affair for both of us. I bought a 20 pack of colorful paper rewards charts at a local retailer along with some sheets of sparkly stars (all the same color, of course, so my toddler and I couldn't battle over the color choices), and that has worked splendidly. Save your money, and buy something less fancy that doesn't become an additional source of frustration- who needs that when potty training?!
