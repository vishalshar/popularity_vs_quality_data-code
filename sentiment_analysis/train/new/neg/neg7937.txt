There were no reviews on Amazon.com, but I found some on Target. A few were negative, but most people recommended this high chair, so we thought we'd give it a try. We just put it together and liked the overall look to it, however, there is one major problem. There is a piece (non-removable without taking apart the high chair) under the tray that keeps the baby from falling through the bottom, but the space between that piece and the back is so small (about 8-10 inches,) we couldn't get our 9-month-old daughter into the high chair! She had straightened her legs and went stiff so we couldn't bend them, but even if she went limp, it would have been a challenge. They probably designed it that way so the tray would sit closer to the baby, preventing food from falling into their lap, but if they moved that piece forward by a couple of inches, it would be so much easier and still allow the tray to sit close. Also, the wood scratches fairly easily, so we weren't sure how great it would look after a couple of months of use. A nice thing about the chair though is that the height is perfect for sitting with the baby and feeding them. We were so excited to get this, so it was very disappointing that it doesn't work for us.A side note: The return policy says that you can only return unopened merchandise. The customer service rep told me that it doesn't apply to this. We were a little concerned when we decided to return it since we obviously had opened the box :)
