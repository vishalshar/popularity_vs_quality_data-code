I fully thought after all the reviews this would be a great enhancement to making my daughters lunches. Great concept but realistically they don't cut sandwiches of any kind up efficiently. I've tried room temperature bread, refrigerated bread, toast and it just breaks it up. Forget trying to cut up a completed PB&J or ham/butter or ham/mayo or turkey of same...just squishes everything into a mess. As small as the pieces come out if cutting a sole piece of bread there is no way I'm going to cut each meat up then make the sandwiches. Cold pizza is about the only thing that works remotely.The one thing they are is is easy to clean. Disappointed to say the least.
