I was excited for these especially to take with me on my trip to Bali with my 8 month old and after hand washing them over a few weeks the inside silicone ring that is in the lid came out. Once that came out it's impossible to put this ring back in the lid and therefore the product is never fully air-sealed again leaking all over my bag. Over time the silicone ring came out of almost all of them. This ring is a choking hazard and I had to throw them away worried my curious now 9 month old would eat them.
