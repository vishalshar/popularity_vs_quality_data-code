I purchased this stroller to replace the Joovy Groove stroller that somebody stole from the back of my truck.  I spent a lot of time reading the reviews on all of the strollers of this type and approximate price range and although I was very happy with the Joovy Groove, I decided to try something different.  Now I wish I had purchased the Joovy Groove again rather than buying this one.  The Joovy stroller has a much sturdier feel to the stroller and has a "tighter" ride than this Baby Cargo stroller.  This stroller feels "loose" to me.  Much of the time that I fold it, the top of the stroller folds in on itself and comes off the sides of the stroller where the top just clips on.  These two things make me give the stroller three stars.  It just feels like a much cheaper stroller than the Joovy.  If I could sell this stroller for half of what I paid, I would buy another Joovy to replace this one.  In fact, since writing this review, I put a Joovy in my cart.  I'll sleep on it a few days and will decide whether to buy another one and give this one away or not.  It's very tempting to do it now.
