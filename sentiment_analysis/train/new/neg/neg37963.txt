I was hoping for a competitor to Summer Infant's wifi devices, because their video quality is poor but both my wife and I really like being able to observe nap time from outside the home.Unfortunately, this system's advertising is deceptive, and it only provides internet streaming when the monitor is docked.  Which defeats the entire purpose, as we want to BOTH have a video monitor in the house and a remote access option.  As far as I know, there remains no alternative to Summer Infant if you want both a smartphone app and a dedicated handheld monitor.  Bummer.
