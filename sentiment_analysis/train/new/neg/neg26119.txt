Purchased for my son's lunch box bottle.  He already has an R2D2 Thermos Funtanier bottle and he likes it very much.  So I wanted to get a backup in case he forgot his at school.Overall this product is OK. However, the manufacturer made design changes in the product that make parts incompatible with the same bottle purchased a couple of weeks ago.Plus:1- design makes it easy to spot among of other bottles.2- easy to clean3- good thermal insulation (for cold drinks only).4- metal container should last a while.Negatives:1- somewhat expensive ($$).2- a little on the heavy side for small kids (2 yr old lost interest due to weight, 4yr old has no problem).3- metal can be ding/dent easier than anticipated. (so won't last a long time looking nice)4- image is printed on metal and scratches easily,My problem with this item (and the replacement straws):1- Straw replacements have different models not clarified in the product description - I found there are at least 3 different designs for the cap seal/straw assembly.  They vary in the seal size, the spout seal height and straw length.  **Warning**None of these variations are made clear in the description of the replacement straw product description. If you purchase replacement straws they may not fit your existing bottles.  (Even if the description indicates they will).2-  The cap of the bottle has a (slightly) different diameters.  So can not use them on the same R2D2 bottles we purchased before.3- The straw seals have different heights (see photos), and they can not be swapped between bottles.4- because the seals have different designs, the straws can not be swapped unless one of them is cut a little.  But, then it will not reach the bottom of the other bottle.If you are interested in buying more than one of this item with the intent of swapping parts between them.  Purchase them all at once.  Otherwise, there is no assurance you will get the same bottle design.
