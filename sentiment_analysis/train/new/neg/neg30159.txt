This product is useful for certain purposes but has its flaws. I initially purchased it when my son was 5 months old for use in his exersaucer.  However, the high and stiff front prevented him from reaching the toys easily and I stopped using it there.  I then tried it in his jumperoo and it did the job of keeping him from flopping over.  Yet it is a bit bulky and seems to "mummify" my son so that he can't really move his arms.  Moreover, it is kind of a pain to put on and my son gets annoyed and cranky during the process so lately I've simply stopped using it.  The best use for this product is in the playground baby swing.  It helps him sit comfortably and upright in those bucket seats. Of course, a rolled up blanket or two would serve the same purpose. Had I known then what I know now, I probably would not have purchased this item, since it gets only occasional use.
