This toy was a gift. I purchased it in advance. When I gave the gift it had a piece of metal sticking out of it. I tried to exchange it but was told that it was two days past the 90 days. My husband was able to cut off the metal off so that it is not dangerous. However, I would have preferred to exchange.
