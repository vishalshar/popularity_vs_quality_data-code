I was so excited to get these ties and start taking picture of my baby boy wearing one every month.  To my surprise, you actually have to cut each tie out by hand.  They do not peel off the sheet like you would expect a professional sticker to do.  Honestly, what new parent has time to hand cut a tie out every month?  If I had wanted to do that, I could have printed out my own stickers for less than what these cost.  It's such a cute idea, but I can't help feeling a little ripped off.  The paper is really flimsy too.
