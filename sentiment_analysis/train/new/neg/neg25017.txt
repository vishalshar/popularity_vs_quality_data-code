I ordered this because the picture made it look like it was a larger wrap that covers the whole baby. The material is stiff and might soften up after a few washes, and the wrap is rather short, especially if your baby is a fiesty one like mine. It sort of reminds me of a large skirt with a tie. I have tried to purchase cheaper wraps just to try them out, but now realize that it's best to just get a decent one that covers well even if it's a bit more expensive - I now have 2 useless wraps and I could have put that money together for 1 good one! Live and learn.
