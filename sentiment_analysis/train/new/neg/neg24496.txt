First step, look at the directions to get a general sense of how it should look (proceed to laugh at the fact that there are no images of how it should look). Then, throw the directions away unless you want to work on your French. I actually read the directions and then proceeded to put it together backwards. Either I'm dyslexic or it is a lot easier to put the braces on the wall first. Next, pick up the spacers they include and throw them as far into your neighbors yard as you can because they are cheap. I just screwed the gate together, like literally screwed both sides together. It looks better and is more solid. Second step, go to a hardware store and purchase some real screws because the screws they send with the product break. Don't think it can happen to you because you'll be gentle? Yeah, I thought that too and I broke two of them, got fed up, went out to the garage and used real screws.I'm giving it three stars because my wife is happy and says it looks great. It was a real pain to assemble using the directions.  Follow my advice and let the baby play with the directions. Babies love crinkly paper! Most home assembly projects take me 1 beer to finish. This was a 2 beer project because I spent the first beer following the directions. But hey, two beers!Good luck!
