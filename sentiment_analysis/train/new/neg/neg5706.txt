Bought this because it had everything that I thought I wanted in a stroller. But there are several things that I hated about it. First, the worst part about it is how HEAVY it is. Seriously, when it's empty it's not that bad, but add a toddler, an infant in a carseat, a diaper bag and some snacks and it is a workout. It is long and this made it hard to navigate when it felt so heavy. I have a tall 3 year old and he did not fit well in the front seat. The cup holder broke after a month, and popped out when I closed it. It does have lots of cup holders and pockets, and the basket is very large which is nice. I also did like how the seats reclined. But the canopies do not shade them hardly at all. And the second worst part about it is that when it is folded down it is huge! It takes up so much space in the car. I would not buy this again. We got rid of it after a few short months and got a Britax b-agile double. Love it!
