Researched the product heavily and when it worked, it was great. Gradually, night vision got weaker and weaker until it no longer worked. Six weeks was the life of this product. We called Motorola customer service and were told we'd receive emailed instructions on returning for a replacement. The phone agent said they could ship a replacement and send a box for the defective unit. Turns out this was untrue. Shipping it back, even after only six weeks, is the buyer's reponsibility to pay for and pack up. And then there is a 2-3 week turnaround time. I guess Motorola expects us to buy another baby monitor during the interim. I really like it but for what we paid ($250 for system with extra camera) I expect a little more goodwill. Don't make this mistake.  Maybe our defective unit is in the minority but it's a hassle when it happens to you.
