I purchased this product to use with our 6 month old. The assembly was very easy to put together. However, it can be difficult putting your child in the seat because their legs can often miss the holes. The chair is supposed to swivel, but with this product being new, it makes it very hard for our daughter to turn, so we often have to do it for her. The last issue we have is that the two toys that hang from the "leafs" often hit our daughter's head while she's jumping. Other than that, this product is good, but is slightly overpriced. We've used it for the past few months on/off and now that our daughter is getting larger and more mobile, this jumperoo is less appealing to her. But it is perfect for getting her acclimated to standing and utilizing her legs more. I don't think I would purchase this product again unless it were discounted.
