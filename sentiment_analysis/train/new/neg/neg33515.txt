This bottle dryer gets the job done and works well considering its low price, however, I do have one complaint. The water gathers at the bottom of the drying rack and even if you empty the water out after each use, the rack itself gets dirty and slimy. You can easily wash it out, though. Despite the pain of having to frequently wash the drying rack, I would still buy this product again as the price is so low it is worth the added work. If you choose this bottle rack you must be sure to wash it regularly.
