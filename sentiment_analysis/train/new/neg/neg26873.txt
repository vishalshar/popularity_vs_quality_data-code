We own several of these and this one is nothing like our others. It has the Naturepedic tags, but it's nowhere near the  right color (it is yellow, not natural off white) or fabric (claims cotton, is most definitely not cotton)  as any of our other ones.  None of our Naturepedic stuff has ever come in a sateen shiny finish (the real Naturepedics are a soft brushed cotton feel, not slick and shiny).  I included a pic of one of the ones we already own on the right, and the shiny yellow (most likely polyester) one from this order on the left.
