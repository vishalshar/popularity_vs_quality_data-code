These are horrible.  I typically get our seventh generation wipes at the mass merchandiser with the bullseye.  I decided to order these because they were cheaper on here  and I had a gift card.  While I thought the wipes would be the same, they are not. These have a scent to them, which they shouldn't unless they were made with essential oils and they are not. They leave the skin sticky which is obviously ridiculous. They are not as thick and durable as I expected them to be. Totally disappointed.  I thought, because this was an "Amazon exclusive," that these would be the same quality of wipes that I find in stores, if not better. Not at all.  Just spend the $2 extra and get the regular ones or go to Tarjay and get them for $9.99. Totally surprised. This was the first time I have ever actually been disappointed to a point of returning over the last seven+ years of ordering from Amazon! Will likely start a return because I cannot fathom using 350 of these and getting ticked and sticky every time.
