I purchased this unit to replace an air purifier/fan that I have been using in my son's room as white noise.  I'm not impressed with the sound quality of the white noise options of this sound machine.  Compared to a fan, the sounds are much higher pitched and seemed to be more stimulating than calming.The music feature is nice as is the option to hook up an mp3 player.FYI - The timer is optional.  It will run continuously which is nice.  (I couldn't find this is the product description anywhere.)
