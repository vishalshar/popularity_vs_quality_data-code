Not much good to say about this product. It has a nice design and fits well in the freezer. The rubber feels soft like it should be easy to remove frozen food and it seems like it should not tear. But this is only how it appears.....First time we made baby food, we froze it in this tray and when the time came to remove it, we couldn't. My wife was having trouble so she called me over to try. I tried like crazy to pop it out from the bottom. Couldn't do it. We ended up flexing the rubber back and forth until the food finally came out and we noticed a big tear in it. The next day we tried to get another portion out and the exact same thing happened. Right now there are a couple cups still intact, but what a waste. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of these trays.NOTE: Before writing this review I took a look at other reviews. Seems like most of the reviews since around January 2014 have been negative. Makes me wonder if they changed the rubber formula to something inferior to what all those other people who left glowing reviews got.....
