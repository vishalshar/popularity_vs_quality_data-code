its comical, whenever anybody sees it they lagh but the pacifier itself is a bit stiff, it was hard for my sister kid to get used to it, he would always spit it out, but whenever his favorite was missing he seemed to like it, but i think he just likes beeing the center of attention, haha, jkjk. the plastic arounf the pacifier, in my case and orange setting, is of good material, not flimsy at all. Overall i think this is a good substitute pacifier.
