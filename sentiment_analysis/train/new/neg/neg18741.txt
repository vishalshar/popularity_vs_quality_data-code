I bought this because I liked the idea of the camera head having rotation capabilities. I read other reviews talking about how it goes Out of Range sometimes. I thought I could work around it, apparently not.Here's everything that just sucked about this product:1. Video quality is awful. It's hard to tell if my daughter is awake unless she's sitting/standing.2. Battery life is awful.3. Incapable of taking the battery out of the monitor to reset. You have to just let it die, which, if at 100% battery life, it'll take less than 4 hours. (That's giving it credit).4. Gives "out of range warning", even if standing right next to the camera! Now, three months later, no amount of resetting, or manually setting the cameras, will reconnect it.Now, we've got to invest in a THIRD baby monitor set because I thought this was a value buy. I say just spend your money on something better. This'll just crap out of you shortly after you buy it.
