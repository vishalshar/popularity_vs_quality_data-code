I have used these bottles for a week and noticed some problems that are unmentioned in the others reviews. Whether this is because Evenflo changed their design or manufacturers I am not sure. But potential customers should know that I found these bottles really problematic. First, these bottles LEAK when the baby sucks on them hard. I initially noticed this when I found my baby's clothes wet after feeding. I thought it was just tap water at first but found that when I pressed on the base of the nipple, water leaks from the the nipple holder located right above it. Second, for reasons unfathomable to me, the ounce metric measurement for these bottles are different from my other Medela and Avent bottles. These problems make these bottles really unsatisfactory. Buyers Beware.
