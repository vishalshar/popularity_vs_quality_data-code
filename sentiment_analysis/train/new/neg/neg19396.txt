All the amazing reviews for this product are true. It is lightweight, doesn't attract mold, it's cute... but it doesn't stay on the spout. Our spout does not have a shower diverter on it, FYI.  This cover will fall off with any slight bump. And because it is so cute, my child loves to pull on it, which means it comes right off and then there's no protection from the sharp edged spout.  It becomes a struggle between her pulling off the cover and me putting it back on. Boo. Plus the seam at the top of the cover looks like it could tear easily.I sooo wanted to love this. Maybe if you have a shower diverter it will stay on better.
