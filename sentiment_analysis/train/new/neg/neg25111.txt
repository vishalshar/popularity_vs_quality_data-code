I put together this playard yesterday and haven't started using it yet, but I'm already a bit disappointed.  I had the Rainforest collection playard for my older child, which had been recalled over a year ago.  I loved everything about it.  So when this Precious collection playard became available, I gladly bought it for my soon to be born second child, thinking that these would be essentially the same.  The first annoying thing for me about this playard is that the picture on the mesh is only on one side and so is the attachment for the diaper stacker.  The way I need to position the playard in my living room ends up having the picture towards the wall (I need the changing table and hence the diaper stacker on my right), which makes the playard a lot less attractive.  Second, I'm not crazy about the way the changing table needs to be fitted.  The Rainforest playard had little plastic things into which the changing table clicked.  With this playard, I'm afraid at some point the fabric on the playard will start tearing if the changing table needs to be removed frequently.Lastly, I only today realized that the mobile is not battery operated.  My son really loved the lights and melodies on his Rainforest playard.  I'll have to see if I can use it on this one.  All in all, I'm a bit disappointed that Fisher-Price decided to cut corners on this product while increasing its price from the previous model.
