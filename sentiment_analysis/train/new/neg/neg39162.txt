The reason for the 3 stars is The sheepskin I ordered had longer hair than expected.  Other shorn sheepskins that I've seen are short like a shorn sheep texture, this one is longer hair.  It is soft and squishy.  When I contacted the seller I was told that the slightly longer hair is how they are receiving the "shorn" lambskins from the manufacturer.  I'm trying to decide if I should return it or not.
