I was really excited about this lamp shade until it arrived. Because it was sown on, they didn't line up the material right so there were wrinkles all around the stitching. Thought that I could look past that, but when I put it on our lamp, noticed that there were several long pieces of thread thrown around in between the fabric that you can see when the light is on. Additionally, we were using a normal sized bulb in our lamp and this lamp shade sits too low on the lamp to cover half the bulb, so there is really no point to it. When I contacted the seller, I was not offered any replacement options only to return and pay for my own shipping without any refund of the previous shipping. So I would be paying more in shipping than for the actual item.
