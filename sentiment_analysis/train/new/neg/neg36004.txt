I like the fact that it came with a video.  The color was true to the picture - very attractive and the fabric was of good quality...slight rough...  I found it impossible to put my child in it however.  Either in the video or somewhere on the packaging the manufacturer states this process takes process.  That's an understatement to me.  I tried watching the video, while standing in front of a full length mirror, with a stuffed animal, and with my child.  It just wasn't pleasant.  I tried quite a few times.  I tried with another adult.  My baby nor I were comfortable.  This item was returned.  Perhaps I just didn't try hard enough...but as a new mommy, messing around with this contraption was the last thing I needed, I felt.
