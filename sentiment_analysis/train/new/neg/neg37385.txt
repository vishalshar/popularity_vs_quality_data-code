I am terrible at getting reviews written.  I want to be better because I utilize them so much myself.  I feel compelled to have to write a review on these cups.  They are WAY WAY to wide.  As an adult I can barely hold on to them.  If you are buying them for your child, don't do it.  There is no possible way my son will be able to use these without spilling the entire contents as it slips from his grip.  Buyer be warned.  I wish I would have heeded the warnings I had seen in the reviews.  Oh well, live and learn I guess.
