This is our second yellow duck.  When my daughter was born we bought multiple Wubbanubs and have turned multiple people onto them.  They are a great product that keep her binkies from rolling away, and make it much easier to keep track of them.  She is very attached to the little stuffed animals and I see it being helpful when it is time to take the binkies.  We plan to cut the binky off and let her keep the little animals.  I really, really loved this product, but the first ones we got two years ago were just so much better.  These ones are lighter and smaller.  Previously the stuffed animal had a heavier material in about half of it, which weighted it down and made it feel more snuggly.  The shape was nicer too... more rounded and duck-like.  The new one is nice.  It is still functional and serves its purpose, and my daughter loves it since losing her favorite duckie, I am just disappointed about how much easier it gets tossed around and falls out of cribs and carseats because the stuffy is no longer as weighted.
