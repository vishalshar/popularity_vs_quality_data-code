We bought this thermometer thinking it would be a good choice based upon the client based reviews that wasn't extremely expensive. Upon arrival I decided to test it out on myself using the forehead attachment, I got significantly different readings one right after the other varying by 3.6 degrees. Thinking that the ear scanning attachment was the way to go, I proceeded to take 2 measurements in the same ear, back to back and also got a significant discrepancy of greater than 4 degrees. It didn't matter if the thermometer was in the exact same place when the reading was taken, it still varied by several degrees.Based upon the discrepancies shown when trying to take the temperature of a non-squirming adult, I don't see how you would be able to get an accurate reading on a constantly moving little one. And when you factor in the false negative readings the thermometer gives, it would provide you with a false, safe reading when your little one actually has a temperature. That is completely unacceptable.DON'T BUY IT!
