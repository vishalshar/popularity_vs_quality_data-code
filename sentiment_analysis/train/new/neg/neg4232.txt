my son ordered this blanket, what a rip off.  it was not even as big as a placemat especially for the price he paid for it using his Christmas money.  manufacturer charging $9 for this blanket, not even worth a $1.  things are never what they seem when you order it online and when you actually receive it.  I have learned that ordering online is not good.  You should see it, hold it, check it out in person otherwise you are sure to be disappointed.  live and learn.
