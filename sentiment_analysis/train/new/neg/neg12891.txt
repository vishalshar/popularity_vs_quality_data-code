Love this brand. Normally have had great success. This, however isn't the greatest. Our baby slides off with the smallest movement and doesn't seem to enjoy baths as much. However it folds and was AMAZING to travel with it. So I would probably still keep it for traveling. Just to have a bathtub if needed. Just not the best for every day use, that's for sure. We got the fisher price 3in 1 tub and LOVE IT!
