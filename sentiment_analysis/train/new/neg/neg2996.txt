We bought this chair because we eat out quite a bit and travel.  We used the chair at home and tested it out a lot before we felt safe enough to use it.  While the chair itself is safe and comfortable, beware of false securities.  You must be sure that the table you attach it to is either screwed into the ground or extremely substantial to avoid an accident. We will be retiring this chair after a table tipped over with our daughter attached to it.  Luckily, the metal frame of the chair kept her safe, but we were so scared that we will never use it again.  The chair is well-designed, but we weren't careful enough so I'm writing this just to warn people not to feel too safe:)
