I was excited to buy these safety features but I got disappointed when my 22 month old twins were able to pull out the socket safety plugs and rotate the knobs with the safety on them.  It turns out my knobs are oval and fit completely right in the safety.  A slight attempt at turning with persistence can open the doors.  The drawer latches require screwing to make holes in the cabinet drawers.  I could not use this product for house proofing.
