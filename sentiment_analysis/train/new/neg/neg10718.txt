Like most of the parents, I would like to have my baby ride on the front of my wife's bike since she got the tricycle, else I will put it on mine. I bought this item based on those good reviews. It got the cool look and quality; however, it fails on the design. The single clamp design will only work with the man bike frame cause it can sit fat on the horizontal bar. It requires one more clamp to the front for lady bike frame to stable it. I am not going to have my baby sit on this.It's very disappointed that there is no good front bike carrier out there...
