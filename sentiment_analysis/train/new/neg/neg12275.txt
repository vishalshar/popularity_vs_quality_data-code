I dont think it was worth it...I worried about baby having a blanket to breathe through in case they got caught in it but this wasnt that much of any kind of stress reliever. It is what it is...you have to watch your baby around blankets and mesh is not going to make much of a difference. Just adjust their clothing and room temperature to help them stay warm/cool.
