I bought this mobile a few months ago for my now 8 week old son. We did a cowboy theme and it looks cute with his crib.Pros:Very cute cowboy theme.The little lullaby is very cute and plays long enough (about 4 minutes) to get my son calm and drift off to sleep.Cons:The mobile doesn't attach very nicely to our crib. We have a sleigh style crib and my husband needed to get creative in order to get this mobile to stay attached to the crib.For the price you can't beat it especially for a cowboy or western themed nursery!
