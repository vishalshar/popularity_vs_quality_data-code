It cannot be reclined while baby/child is seated in it. It is extremely bulky (but quite sturdy), and, thus, terribly challenging to buckle in and remove. We lugged this massive seat with us on trip where we had to fly and then get a rental car. It took us 30 mins (no exaggeration) to get it buckled into an unfamiliar car. It was also very heavy to carry from baggage claim, and I won't be taking it on any future trips.
