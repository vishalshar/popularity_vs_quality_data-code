I was hoping these swaddles would solve two problems I had with traditional swaddle blankets:1) I hoped they would be easier to use. While I've become pretty adept at swaddling my children using a blanket, I find swaddle blankets a bit fussy. In other words, if you don't have them laid out just so, it's impossible to get a perfectly tight swaddle. Moreover, the cumbersome process of swaddling--with all of the folding and tucking and whatnot--always woke up my son, which is particularly frustrating when you just want to go to bed or get back to bed yourself. My son would be OUT COLD, but all the jostling to get him swaddled would wake him right up.2) I hoped they would better contain my son. Both of my children are seriously strong wigglers, able to bust out of even a perfect swaddle using a blanket. I wanted a product my son wouldn't be able to bust out of.I thought this product would solve both problems, but it only solves one--the second one. I find these SwaddleMe's are just as cumbersome as a traditional swaddle blanket. Four out of five nights the process of trying to get my son into the SwaddleMe wakes him up and I have to start the nursing/bedtime process all over again. Not fun. But once I get him in, he *usually* can't bust out of it. I do think he sleeps longer and more soundly as a result.
