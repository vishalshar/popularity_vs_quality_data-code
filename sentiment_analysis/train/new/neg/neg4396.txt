Loved the colors and different shape of these silicone beads. It looks like the beads go all the way around the necklace in the picture and the description says the beads go half way around. I sent it back because the one I received the beads didn't even go half way around. There was too much empty space on the cord of the necklace for me. I wanted something that had been all the way around so I decided to go with a different brand, even though it was more expensive.
