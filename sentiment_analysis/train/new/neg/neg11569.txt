so i ordered this rain cover for my stroller and i got to use it a few days ago. i have to say the design is a little off. its a pain to have to keep bending down to open or close the Velcro that attaches the cover to the stroller ...another thing i disliked is that it has the little holes for air to flow through in the area that it does.... my sons feet kept getting wet. it rained a few days and i had to go out and my sons feet kept getting wet hes only 3 months old)and the whole area by the handle bar did too. i think they should redesign the whole cover.
