I have had this product and use it in the bathtub. I noticed it does fall down occasionally and have to put it back up. I do like the convenience of this while I shave. It was time to wash it and I soaked it in a basin with Joy dish detergent overnight and removed the excess debris.I noticed there was still some pink mold on the outside of it and soaked it longer. Wearing gloves I opened the side of the suction cup where itslides open. It was full of black mold. I had to remove the water and then add Ajax with bleach scouring powder since Clorox is too strong for me to breath. You will have to gently remove it wearing gloves and it all comes off. I am currently still soaking it again overnight. I'm sure it will come off.The only solution I have for this is to soak this on a regular basis so as it not to build up. Mold loves wet enclosed spaces and it is a breeding ground for this. But you just have to maintain it with an overnight soak and mildly with your finger wearing gloves remove the mold or with a paper towel. Always wear gloves when you are dealing with this type of cleaning.
