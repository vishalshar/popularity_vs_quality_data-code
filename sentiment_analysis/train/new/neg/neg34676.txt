This is a great idea but it does NOT 'fit' the Peg Perego Primo Viaggio as advertised.  Unless you are happy with your carseat just sitting in the stroller that is!  I paid a lot of money for a carseat with side impact protection so having it just rest on there was not for me. There is a cheesy belt that comes with to 'secure' it.  If the carseat had clipped in like it does on the Pliko P3 I would have have been happy to keep it.
