Really love the look of this design, especially for a baby girl's nursery that is not too pink or "princessy."After washing for a newborn, even with vinegar and dye soaking fabric sheets, the red dye ran in pink splotches in several places.  Also because the fabric is 100% cotton, ironing every piece with fabric starch is necessary.We kept the bedding, but we are disappointed in the quality.
