I Do NOT recommend buying. This was purchased for my babies room while we were waiting for the military to ship our belongings to our new post. My husband set it up exactly how he was supposed to. I just used it for diapers, wipes, lotion, onesies, socks... Things like that. My 3yo went to grab a diaper off the top, she hardly touched it and the who thing fell right on top of her. We had nothing heavy in it so she wasn't hurt but it sure did scare her. Threw it out the same day. Not sturdy. I know parents don't want to take chances with the safety on their little ones. Badger basket has way nicer/stronger products. This was a waste of money and a safety hazard.
