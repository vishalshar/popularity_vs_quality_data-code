Since I've only used this one nursing cover I'm not sure if better options are available, but I hope so. The wire at the top of the cover is supposed to allow you to see your baby while breast feeding, but I found that it often collapsed downward, leaving me feeling exposed. This happened especially often while trying to get the baby latched. The material seemed very lightweight when I first received it, but it definitely gets hot and stuffy under there. It does pack up small and is easy to cart around in a purse, but there are probably better nursing covers for your money.
