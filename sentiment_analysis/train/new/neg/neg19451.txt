Due to the glowing reviews on here, I purchased this bag to use as a diaper bag.The bag came, shipped from Amazon, folded in half, and squished into a way too small box, along with three items.  Because it was folded, the handles came damaged, with the seams ripped in numerous areas.  There was no way to repair it, as it's thread on vinyl.Makes me wonder how long will this bag really hold up then?The fabric inside, pink, is chintzy too... Cheap material.The print outside is cute, but anything Hello Kitty is cute... Kitty's face with little "milk" containers.Obviously, since it was damaged, I had to return the thing...I wasn't going to order it again, because for the price here, it didn't justify for the less then stellar quality.Then at the bull's eye website, I saw the same bag, for a fraction of the cost here, so I ordered it there.The bag has decent amounts of pockets, is a big enough size, but too big to be used as an on the go bag, as I would have to keep this strictly on my shoulders, and can you imagine a loaded bag and carrying a hefty 25lb squirming baby as well as trying to keep this on my shoulders?  Thus, this bag would pretty much be used either as a stroller bag, or a bag to go, rather then on the go.
