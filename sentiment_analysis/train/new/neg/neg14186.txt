I didn't return it and kept giving it a chance to try on the road. However, I gave up and switch to another product. The buckle to tie behind the seat is a joke that you have to find your own way to tie it. The velcro is a smart idea to comfort you but I am not sure if they hold the belt lower enough to protect you from accident. Also, it feels so tired to connect and disconnect both velcro from the belt every time when you get on the car. Bad design!
