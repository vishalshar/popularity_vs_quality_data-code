I fell in love with this crib at our local Babies "R" Us store & I was thrilled to receive it as a gift.Then the problems began:1. The crib was ordered online from this site, but it didn't show up. As it was a gift, I couldn't access the order information to find out where it was & the in-store staff have no access to the online info either. We were finally able to track the order to somewhere in the midwest-Amazon said they would reship.2. The crib arrived & it was as beautiful as I remembered & remarkably easy to put together-One person could probably handle it-until we got to the last bolt-the hole was misdrilled & didn't line up-we couldn't finish putting it together. (I'm sure you're thinking we should have redrilled it ourselves, but the hole is reinforced with a metal insert)3. We called around to our local stores & they were out of stock & had no idea when they would receive more-we considered sending it back, but the thing is HUGE & the baby was coming soon4. My husband called the manufacturer and was told that there would be at least a six week waiting period.... so we waited ....and waited5. We called the manufacturer again and after 30 minutes were told they didn't know when more would be arriving, when we asked to speak to a supervisor, they suddenly found another one in the warehouse.6. The new panel arrived, we opened it, only to find that this piece was also WRONG!!!In the end my husband redrilled the hole anyway-the crib feels sturdy enough-but this was way too much work for such an expensive item.
