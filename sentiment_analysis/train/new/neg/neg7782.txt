I was disappointed with the quality of the fabric.  It was thin and flimsy.  Colors looked a little better online (a little more bold/crisp).  But overall, it was still worth it (half-priced/sale).  It was the color scheme I was looking for in a gender neutral playroom.  One valance was plenty for our one window (36 inches wide).  Hangs well.
