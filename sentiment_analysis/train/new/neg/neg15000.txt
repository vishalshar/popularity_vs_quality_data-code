I do have a thicker sheet for the pack n play that I bought at Babies R Us, but I struggled to spend about $15 for sheet. So when I found these for under $10 I scooped it up! It fits my Graco Pack n Play perfectly, it's soft and washes easily. The only downside is that it is thinner than I thought it would be.  It will be great in the summer, or for when she is just playing in there, but for winter sleeping, I do like my thicker one better.
