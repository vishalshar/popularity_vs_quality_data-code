The main cover fit my toilet, but the piece that hooks it up to my toiled does NOT work. I had my husband even saw it down to try make it fit, but we ended up throwing it away due to not fitting. Although it didn't mesh well with our toilet seat, it is much easier to clean than a regular toilet ring that pulls apart & has less mess.
