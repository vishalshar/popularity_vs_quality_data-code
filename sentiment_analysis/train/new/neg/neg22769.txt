The side supports are great but the head support is too flat and wide to give adequate support to a newborn's head in a car seat.  Traditional head support products that come with two adjustable head support cushions are much more practical and provide much better support.  This product is beautiful and very soft but comes short when it comes to performance.  Also, be aware that if you delivered your baby at a U.S. Army hospital, they will not allow you to have this product in your car seat when you take your baby home as this product does not comply with safety regulations observed by the military.  We ended up using this product in our daughter's baby swing when she was 2 months old and it was useful.
