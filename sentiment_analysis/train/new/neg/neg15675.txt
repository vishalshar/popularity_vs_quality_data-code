This dish was too small for my daughter and she had a hard time getting the food out. The spoon is shallow and you can't spear food with the plastic fork. Regular Gerber toddler utensils work much better than these. Maybe it would work if you were spoon feeding purees. We had much more luck with the suction cup Boon bowl and still use them at 22 months.
