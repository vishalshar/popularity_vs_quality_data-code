Seems like a lot of people like this, and I don't want to rag on it. It was very comfortable and not difficult to use. The idea of getting the kid in on your own is daunting at first, but really doesn't take that long to get the hang of. The problem was just that the product has absolutely no give. It's the size it is and that's it. Even with the newborn insert, my baby still felt a little unstable and wobbly, and I think that's why she didn't like it. Consequently, it rarely got used, and by the time she was big enough to be secure in it, she just wasn't used to it and wouldn't accept being carried in it.For me, however, it was incredibly comfortable. I loved it. I just wish my kid would've loved it, too. Maybe if the baby pocket area incorporated a little bit of material to help it stretch. Not a lot, like a Moby, but maybe more like stretchy jeans or something. Then it could get away with being a bit smaller in the pocket area because it would stretch to accommodate the child's body.
