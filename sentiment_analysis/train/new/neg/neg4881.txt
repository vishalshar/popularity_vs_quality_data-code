I absolutely love all of the orbit g2 line except for this seat. i have had many car seats for my kids and this is by far the bulkiest, least ergonomic seat i have ever purchased. I should have heeded the 3 star warning. the angle at which the seat is makes it hard for my son to get comfortable to sit let alone nap. He screams miserably everytime he sits in it. its very very cramped also. the head pads on the side are huge. its really disappointing bc i have spent all of this money and it will be taking a trip to our local charity having never been used longer than 5 minutes. its really that awful. i really hope they come out with a better design bc the product is very nice looking. it just doesnt work well at all. sorry orbit but i am very disappointed hope you come out with a roomier better angled seat for my next one.
