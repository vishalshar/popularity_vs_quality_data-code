We wanted to get a crib for our daughter that she could have forever.  When it came time to convert the crib to a full size headboard/footboard we were in for a rude awakening.  Not only did it take 4 months to receive the product, the hardware on the bed rails was not made correctly leaving my husband to re-do the hardware himself. Unless your ready to have a 3 hour project when its time to assemble the bed rails, I don't recommend purchasing this.
