I bought this item in August of 2012 and my 7 month old daughter used it regularly for about 2 months.  One day she was in it and was leaning forward and the back leg gave out and my daughter was pinned forward!!  She was so scared and her legs could have been pinned under the exersaucer, but thankfully I got to her before she completely fell over!  So disappointed in this product.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  I bought this particular one because it had great reviews.  Maybe I just got a defective one, but I have advised all of my friends not to buy this product!
