This clip has a few distinguishing features.1. The pacifier end has a rubbery plastic loop that is meant to snap over the wide middle part of a pacifier. This part is attached to the strap with a loop and some velcro, making it removable.2. The clip end is all plastic and uses a slide mechanism to secure to clothing or other thin objects. The clip is secure when properly attached.3. The strap is narrow - only about 1/4" wide.For our use we could not fit any of our pacifiers into the plastic loop, so we discarded it and secure the pacifiers with the velcro loop at that end. The plastic clip is rather large and awkward to use. Even with my large, yet dexterous hands, I have difficulty securing it one-handed, unlike the more traditional metal clips. The strap is also a biut shorter than competing products.Overall, for the price we paid, it's a decent product, particularly in a 2-pack. However we still prefer a more traditional strap that is longer and easier to secure one-handed.
