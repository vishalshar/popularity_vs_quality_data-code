I purchased this item after having a tough time getting my daughter comfortable in her bassinet and reading success stories posted on this site. Yet when the item arrived there are huge stickers all over it warning parents to not let their child sleep on the product. I was so worried that I never used it and ended up getting rid of it. On the positive side, it is nice and soft and looked comfy!
