Bought this to clean our Zoli straw cup because the Zoli brand straw cleaner and replacement straws cost more than the cups at that time (they have since become available for an almost-reasonable price again).The straw brush will work for cleaning the Zoli straw, but it's a bit tight. You really have to jam it in there and pull pretty hard to get it back out. I was always afraid I was going to rip the silicone straw. Instead, I ended up ripping the brush out from the plastic holder on the end.The rounder brush works GREAT for cleaning breast pump parts! Bonus!The poky thing I thought would work well for unblocking the spouts of our Take & Toss sippy cups, but doesn't actually. The holes are quite a bit smaller than this tool. So far I haven't found a great use for this one.
