So disappointed in these snack cups. Great concept, terrible execution. We already had the ones that don't have a lid, it's been hugely entertaining for my toddler, especially on long car rides and flights, or when she needs a snack. So this one seemed like a brilliant design - a lid to put on the top to keep the snacks fresh, plus prevent crumbs from coming out all over your bag when you throw it in there on the go. Added bonus is the "strap" connecting the lid to the cup becomes a handle when you attach the lid to the bottom of the cup. However, the plastic used for the slotted cover where your child's hand goes into the cup to grab the snacks is so stiff, my daughter literally CRIES when she tries to pull her hand out. She loves the other ones, the plastic is much softer and more flexible and doesn't hurt when she puts her hand in and out. This snack cup is unusable. Major bummer for this Munchkin fan.
