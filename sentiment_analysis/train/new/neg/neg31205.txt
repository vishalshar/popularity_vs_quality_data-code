This item looks and feels nice but has some flaws that keep me from really liking it.  The first being is that the hard plastic caterpillar piece is screwed together with the screws visible in the recessed holes, I'm concerned that these could become loose and fall out at some point. The second probably depends more on the baby but this toy is pretty big and your little one is going to need big enough hands and mouth to get the most use out of it.
