I got this cup mainly to put my toddler's smoothies in. She likes the cup and overall, I do as well. The lids fit tight and the straw makes a good seal that prevents spilling if it's knocked over. However, if you move the straw up and down at all in the cup or put the slightest pressure on the outside of the cup, the liquid in it overflows through the top of straw. It makes quite the mess.
