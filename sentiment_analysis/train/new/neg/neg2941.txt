Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the connectors that come standard with your "pump in style" motor are available to purchase separately. Compared with what you get in your starter kit, these are much harder to clean and you have to pull the tubing to disassemble them (the tubing connector end gets impossible to reach once inserted). If you have a friend with original parts try hand-me-downs before buying these.
