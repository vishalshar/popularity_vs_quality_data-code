i just received my Sugarbooger Children's Closet Dividers..it is nice and everything butin the image of the product that i ordered they had the blue poke dot and they called it the peek-a-boo blueso i was expecting what i saw in the image however they sent me the actually peek-a-boo design with a little baby illustration and i am not a big fan of those type of drawing...other than that the product is nice for organizing my expected baby closet.
