I used these for a game we played at my daughter's baby shower and for that, they worked fine.  However, practically speaking, they don't work as well.  First, they open "backwards" to any other diaper pins I have ever used.  Second, I use them to pin socks together when being washed so I don't lose one.  About 1/3 of them melt enough that I have to break them open and then obviously have to throw it away.  I've never had this happen before when I bought diaper pins.
