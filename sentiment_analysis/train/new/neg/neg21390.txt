Is actually too big to use on a plane. It sticks out into the seats next to you, taking up others' space. I disliked the piece that went around my back;it made me unable to sit back against the seat. Doesn't work great if you are a larger woman--the strap reached around my middle to snap closed, but because I had to extend it so much, it made the design of the cushion sit no where near on me where it was supposed to. Used once, and tried to use it again on a 2nd flight, but it was so cumbersome and invasive that I deflated it and put it back in my bag. Won't use again.
