PROS:-It's a placemat.CONS:-Doesn't stick to wood tables(I didn't think it would be a problem since our hook-on high chair would secure it to the table, but since it doesn't lay flat and sits off the table due to the suction cups underneath, our curious 7-month-old spent every meal pulling up the edges and trying to figure out how to get it to his mouth).-The cutesy little design is raised making a zillion nooks and crannies for food to get stuck in if you don't run the whole thing under water immediately after using (not practical with a hook-on high chair).-The reservoir doesn't interface well with a hook-on high chair, and doesn't interface with the Bjorn soft bibs.-Doesn't lay flat, even with hook-on high chair arms on top of it for 2 weeks.
