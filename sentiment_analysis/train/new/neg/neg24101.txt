Old school, bulky, tricky to install. You must have absolutely ideal consitions for it to install correctly. Go get the magnetic ones, they are a dream! I am a DIY pro, but installing these made me curse. I tried it on two different wood cabinets ( freestanding rather than kitchen cabinets) neither worked well. The first cabinet has a frame that is flush with the front of the door, this made is so the space to get your finger in to push the lever too small too get a finger in. I am using a pair of scissors in the drawer next to it to open the other door. The second install was on another wood cabinet, without a face frame. I had limited options on where do locat it on the small drawer. The interior catchmakes it so the drawer won't fully close. Also damages the cabinet in a few different ways trying to get them installed. I have also added photos of my 2 wood cabinets for visuals. Buy a more vertitile, innovative product.
