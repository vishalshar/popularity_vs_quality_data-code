First the positives. For a baby gate these look great. Unlike many gates there is no ledge to step over (trip on or stub your toes on). The feature of being able to easily temporarily remove the gate is also very nice.Now the problems. First of all installation can be a bit of a pain especially around stairs. The way you install them is to screw a vertical mount into the wall and then from the top slide the gate in. So if there is something above where you want the gate to go that sticks out from the wall (like the railing on some stairs) you will have to do extra work to get it installed. We had to remove the railing on our stairs to get it installed. We even had to remove a light switch over another one of these as the gates will not slip on with even the slightest tilt. Lastly if you install in drywall don't use the included drywall anchors. We did but after a week and a half of use they were pulling out from the wall. I got some better anchors and that seemed to fix the issue.I added a few photos to show where we had extra issues mounting it. In the one picture you can see where I had to cut a spare piece of wood to sit behind the mounting bracket in order to get enough clearance out from the mounding at the top of the wall to slide in the other piece.Overall if where you want to put the gate is completely unobstructed from above then this gate is pretty nice. Still trickier to install than most gates but that's just due to the design (it's not one piece)
