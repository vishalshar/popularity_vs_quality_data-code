I was mostly disappointed with the shipping time of this product.  From the day I ordered it, it didn't get processed from the shipper's facility until 8 days later!! Almost as if it was forgotten.  Once it was picked up by UPS, shipping was 3-4 days.  So we waited 2 weeks for this to arrive to us!Aside from the shipping issues we had, when we recieved the product it was not exactly what we had expected.  It was a LOT thinner then we had imagined it to be.  The "mat" is more like a comforter in thickness and feel.  The blanket part of the mat that is attached (what has Dora on it) is also thin but wide enough to provide ample coverage.  The size of this napmat is for a toddler, our daughter is 3 yrs old and 35 lbs.  Our niece of 4 years old, 40 lbs., does not fit in it.  Her feet hang out.  My daughter loved the napmat, but she plays too much in it, and moves around pulling the blanket part causing the mat to twist over (probably due to it's thin quality, if it was a thick actual mat, it wouldn't move when she pulls on the blanket.)  I am impressed with how cute it rolls up and makes for easy travel.
