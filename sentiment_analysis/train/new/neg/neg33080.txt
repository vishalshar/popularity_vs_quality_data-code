Really like the idea of this and I'll keep trying--I'd rather skip having to clean sippy cups like I've had to clean bottles.  They're just as annoying to clean.  However, my baby  hasn't caught on yet.  However, it's only been a few weeks. Update--nearly 11 months now--and she she'll drink from it if I hold the cup.  I'm not sure this is worth it.  But I'm still hopeful.
