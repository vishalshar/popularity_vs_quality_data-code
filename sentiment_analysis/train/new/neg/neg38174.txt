Not impressed. This backpack fails on several main factors. The shoulder straps should be padded. it cuts into the childs shoulders.if you were to pull on the leash it lifts the backpack up so high the chest strap could literally choke the child.My main reason for liking this backpack was it was a neutral black color for my little boy to wear and wasn't a cheesy style like most harness backpacks. I feel completely stupid holding onto the leash strap in public.im going to continue working on getting my son to stay with me and hold my hand. i never use the backpack but i did put it on him and test out its functionality to see if he liked wearing it. he seemed ok with it.If you are looking for a backpack specifically used for the harness/leash option i do not suggest this backpack.The zippers are smooth and function well. There is reflective stitching along all the areas where the backpack was stitched together for extra safety during night walking. the backpack is a good size for smaller children. My son is 15 months old and there is room for him to grow into it.
