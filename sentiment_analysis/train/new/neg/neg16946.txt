The description is not complete!  I am returning it.  There is a warning label on the ends of the crib and on the bottom (See attached photo of bottom of crib label).  It appears that most people are using a 3" mattress (per reviews) and some a 5" mattress with this crib.  This violates the Consumer Product Safety Commission information that is on the warning label and not in the crib description. I, like most people, purchased a mattress that violates the safety regulation.  It is also critical that the mattress fit snuggly in the crib, so make sure that the CPSC minimum crib dimension is also met. The CPSC safety regulation states (see attached photo) - "CAUTION; ANY MATTRESS USED IN THIS CRIB MUST BE AT LEAST 23-5/8" (600MM) BY 37-3/4" (959MM) WITH A THICKNESS NOT EXCEEDING 2" (51MM). THE CRIB CONFORMS TO APPLICABLE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION.".  I feel that a 2" mattress is not enough support except for a very small baby.  Therefore, I wouldn't have used this crib for long, making it no better than the Pack N Play cribs.  I have to return the crib, mattress and all bedding that was purchased to fit it.  I bought a full size crib and mattress.  In addition only 3 of the 4 wheels had a locking mechanism.
