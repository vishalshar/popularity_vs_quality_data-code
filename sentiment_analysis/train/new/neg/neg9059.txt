We found it odd that some purchasers of this product found it very easy to set up, while others found it impossible.  Indeed, we could not get the railing latches to lock, and were just about to return the product, when we realized what the problem was: sometimes, it is delivered to the customer with the circular floor joint ("unlock device") ALREADY LATCHED, thus making it IMPOSSIBLE to straighten out and latch the side rails. Thus, the instructions to set up the product SHOULD begin like this: "1. Make sure the circular floor joint is unlocked, by turning the semi-circular plastic tab to the right.  This should cause the floor to raise up, rather like a pyramidal tent."
