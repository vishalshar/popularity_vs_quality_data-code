Mattel has recalled the Rainforest version of the Open Top Take-Along Swing but not this one.  According to Fisher-Price, the Rainforest Model numbers K7203, K7192 and K7195 were recalled due to entrapment hazards.  When I called about this swing, they said the design was slightly changed and the seat of the Rainforest did not "cradle" the baby as much as this one, allowing the infants to shift to the side in the swing, and become entrapped.  The baby can get caught between the seat and frame.  Our 4 months old son has had an issue with his leg being potentially caught between the seat and frame while the seat is swinging.  Fisher Price was very willing to accept back the swing and offer a refund.  I have always purchased, and will continue to purchase, Fisher-Price products.  But this is one product that should also be included in the recall.
