Its ok.  This is my second lock after the first one broke complete.  The good news about it breaking is that it taught me that it's possible to remove without damaging the lid.  I gently pried up one side with a screw driver and once it started to peel off, it wasn't to hard to remove.  Big negative is that it failed in the first place.Pros: it does safely lock the toilet.  Comes off the lid without leaving residue or damage.Cons the first one failed.  Be sure that you don't install this too close to the tank otherwise there won't be enough room for the arm to swing into place and lock.  The attached picture shows mine and its a bit too close (and sometimes won't fully lock).
