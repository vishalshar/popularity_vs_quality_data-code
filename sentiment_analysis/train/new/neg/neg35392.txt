This bowl does not super suction. I'm not even sure that I would categorize its suctioning capabilities as average. It's aerodynamic, lightweight and will fly all the way to your living room though. It's the lid that click-locks, the double suction cup base is the second worst thing about this bowl. Affixing containers of food to a high chair is like leaving the remote on the coffee table - it's an impossible dream. Suctioning things to a high chair stops mealtime entirely until the offending dish has been removed, explored and emptied. My eleven month old viewed it as a challenge to be ripped from the tray - until he figured out how to pop the suction cup loose.The worst part about this bowl is that it's clear. Do not buy transparent dishes. Your child will discover that they can put their face inside of them and turn the world yellow. This is neither good or as precociously adorable as you might imagine (unless you're a grandmother). I would have returned the bowl on sheer principle, but it landed on the dog and she ate all of the organic quinoa I'd prepared from the bowl. Using regular bowls, I've discovered that without the challenge of the super-suction feature, Master Luke will actually just eat from the bowl before dropping it on the floor.As you're still reading this review, I know you're looking for some glimmer of hope that there is a product that will suck better than this one. Or that maybe I'm just not that smart and didn't use the bowl as instructed. Give it up. I'm on my third brand of suction bowl and the dogs are the clear winners. And the manufacturers of suction bowls. On a side note - the Munchkin 360' miracle cup is awesome and worth the money. Fewer than four parts and the valves don't dislodge on impact. All your dreams don't have to die.
