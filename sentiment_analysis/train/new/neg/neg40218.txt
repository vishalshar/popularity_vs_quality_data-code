We are not even finished putting this together. The first piece we assembled already cracked and is falling apart. I should've listened to reviews! And I'm so upset bc I would return if I could but I'm 9 months pregnant and have no idea how I would reassemble the damaged box it came in, and lift the tremendously heavy and huge box into my car to return! This is a piece of particle-board-shit. And I'm just so disappointed.Update* upon further assembly almost every piece was damaged! How am I supposed to trust this piece of trash to hold my newborn baby? God forbid it got wet... It would disintegrate! I will find a way to get this garbage out of my house. SO ANGRY.
