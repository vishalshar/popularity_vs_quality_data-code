I bought them about one week ago to replace my other NUK pacifier (they trap water like crazy). I like the one-piece design b/c you won't get any dirt or water or lint or hair trapped. However, I don;t know what type of silicone they use, it stinks! Now they have been sitting on my desk for a couple of days and the smell seems to go away...a little...I like the orthodontic design, but just can't bear that plastic smell.
