I brought two of the Original Bongo Bags.  The Natural colored one was perfect; however the Cheetah bag was not.  Both bags were to zip shut, but the Cheetah bag does not zip. When I roll the bags down the stairs to the laundry room I am having to gather laundry all over the stairwell.  I am not pleased with the false advertisement on this product.
