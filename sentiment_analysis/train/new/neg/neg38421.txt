We tried every bottle, my baby just refused. These are a nice shape, feel good in the hand. The idea seemed great, and I really wanted her to accept these. Unfortunately, I think the nipple was a bit too short and difficult for her to latch on to. I wish there was a bit more of a taper to the tip, rather than being so sudden.  Also, if you're sending to day care or preparing bottles in advance, these are difficult to heat. You must heat the milk in another container, or find somewhere to purchase a warming cap/lid.  Also, you have to have the bottle completely upright before removing the lid, or they will leak. If you know how to use properly, they seem to work great - just make sure you follow instructions or you'll be covered in milk.  (other bottles we tried, Mam, Nuby, mOmma, Dr Browns, Tommee Tippee, Avent, Playtex... I think if your little one is stubborn, it may come down to their will rather than the right bottle)
