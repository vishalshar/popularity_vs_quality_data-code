This was a wonderful tub for about 2 months. We used it daily as my baby was too big for an infant tub but still too small for our big garden tub. Then one day for no reason it sprung a leak in one of the seams. I was highly disappointed. I think this is probably best as a travel tub and not durable enough for daily use.
