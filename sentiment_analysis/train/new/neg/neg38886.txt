I purchased this item last October for a younger baby cousin's birthday. My cousin had tons of other plush toys, but this one was special since it literally symbolized the "Lamb of God...who takes away the sins of the world." As pure, innocent, and clean as this little lamb is, it certainly brings joy to those you give it to with its rhythmical "jack-in-box-style" music of "Jesus Loves me This I Know." I appreciated the lyrics of the tune attached to a small card clipped on the plush toy. The cotton is very soft and huggable, but I would just watch out for the big knob on the back of the toy which can be dangerous to some toddlers.Great product and gift for the young ones! God bless!
