I thought this would be a fun growing toy but is just plain boring. The teether has no texture, the mirror is so so, the phone has nothing to it, and the two pieces of money are the only interesting thing. The purse itself has a bow that you press for some sounds & the handle folds over. There is a fisher price version that I have replaced this with & we like so much more.
