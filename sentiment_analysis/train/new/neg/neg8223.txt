I ordered this Stokke car seat adapter for our new Xplory stroller and purchased also Graco Snugride car seat, so it will be easy for us to transfer our newborn baby from carseat to stroller. If I install it on stroller I can put the car seat only front-faced, which is not good, because I need to see what my little baby is doing.
