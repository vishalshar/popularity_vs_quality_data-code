After having a horrible experience with a Levana Safe and See, and disappointment with the Mobi, I had very high hopes for this Motorola. I wanted to love it. Sadly after 2 nights it stopped working and it is in a box and going back to Amazon.Pros:1. Excellent picture quality on a big 3.5" screen2.  The pan/ tilt function worked brilliantly3.  Good battery lifeCons:1. The previous version of this monitor (the MBP 30) had voice activation (VOX). Motorola decided to remove the technology for the new version.  VOX is a very basic feature of higher end monitors and was a MUST for me.2. Feel like turning the volume up a notch int he middle of the night? Too bad. You can't adjust the volume without navigating through the internal menu, thus you have to turn on a light in your bedroom (the buttons are not back lit) and thumb through several screens. Try doing that at 4 AM.  No thanks.3.  The screen stopped transmitting images on night 2.  You see, the unit has a screen saver function when the battery is in use, where the screen goes black.  One time the screen blacked out,  and never went back.  I have unplugged/ replugged the unit, taken out the battery, pushed every damn button.  It just stopped working.Honestly, if Motorola added VOX to this monitor, and fixed a few glitches, it could corner the market.  The quality of the video blew those non tech co monitors (Levana, Summers Infant, Mobi) out of the water. But for now, I will remain as frustrated as ever in my search for the perfect baby monitor.***UPDATEI'm getting a lot of peer pressure (!!!) from other customers on Amazon to change my reviews to more than 1 star.  I'm sorry but the monitor stopped working after 2 days. In my humble opinion, a $209 that stops working after 2 days is not worthy of more stars.
