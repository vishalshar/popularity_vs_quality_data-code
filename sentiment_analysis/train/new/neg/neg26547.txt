This is a really cute calendar with a page of adorable stickers. I like the way the pages are laid out with a spot for a photo and plenty of room to journal as well as a place to record growth.  The paper it is printed on feels nice and heavy and the colors appear to be true to the ones on this site.On the downside, although it has 13 months, there are only 12 month labels and some of the labels aren't long enough to cover the space for the label where it is printed "place month sticker here" or something like that.  The stickers for the calendar are so big that it makes it almost impossible to write anything else in those squares.
