The First Years American Red Cross Soft Tip Nasal Aspirator looked great since it would be easier to clean comapared to the Soft Tip Nasal Aspirators you recieve from the hospital. However once my husband and I recieved the First Years American Red Cross Soft Tip Nasal Aspirator and tried to use it on our baby, my husband and I noticed some flaws.One flaw being that the Soft Tip on the First Years American Red Cross Soft Tip Nasal Aspirator was twice the size of our small babies nose, or at least thats how it seemed. Trying to get the Soft Tip to be able to suck boogers out seemed quite difficult without breaking out babies nose.The Second flaw being that the First Years American Red Cross Soft Tip Nasal Aspirator was extremely hard to push to get suction going. Without being able to squish the First Years American Red Cross Soft Tip Nasal Aspirator like any other nose aspirator means that alot less boogies are being sucked out.With not being able to fit the soft tip on the First Years American Red Cross Soft Tip Nasal Aspirator into the babies nose and not being able to get suction on the First Years American Red Cross Soft Tip Nasal Aspirator due to it being too difficult, the cleaning feature it pointless. The First Years American Red Cross Soft Tip Nasal Aspirator does not get dirty since you can't use it so it never needs to be cleaned.
