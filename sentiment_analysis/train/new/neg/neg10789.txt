I had to recently return this to Amazon for a refund because it kept collapsing on our daughter and would fold up around her like a burrito! DANGEROUS! It really is a bummer because she LOVED the playmat and ALL of the toys. SOOOOOOOO cute and really the most adorable playgym we found. Several of the toys were her favorites and I am so sad we had to return them. But the toys were heavy and if she kicked or grabbed the arches (which I think were positioned to close together), the whole thing would fall over (top heavy from the toys being heavy) and wrap around her. We finally returned it for safety and are looking for another one.With my son we had another Baby Einstein ocean style playgym and it had a music box that hung in between the arches (on the side) so it didn't allow it to fold up and collapse like this one.
