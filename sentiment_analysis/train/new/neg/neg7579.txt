I ordered enough of these for all of my lower cabinets and installed them. For the most part it was easy and quick installation but there were two of them that didn't lock at all after I installed them (the same way that I installed the rest of them, I have no idea if it was me or the lock). They ended up breaking in the process of me trying to get them to lock and then readjusting them. For as much as I paid for these, it was upsetting to have to replace two of them.A couple days after I installed them, I hear my daughter banging around in the kitchen and I go in there and one of the cabinets that had previously locked perfectly was wide open and she was chewing on a bottle of jet dry. I figured I had somehow not closed it all the way but then I couldn't get it to lock at all. Then for the next day it wouldn't lock. So I figured it was broken, but then the next day it locked just fine. Since then there is another one that periodically doesn't lock.I'm not sure what to say about them, some of them work perfectly and are great, but I have no idea when one of them is not going to lock. If I can't rely on them, what good are they? I'm going to call a handiman and have him install handles so I can put the cheap plastic locks on them that I know will work.
