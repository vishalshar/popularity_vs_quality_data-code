I just used this bag for less than a month and the outer layer was torn off at some areas. Not big enough for me to keep all my gal's items. But i love the small pouch and the bottle bag. Only suitable for few hours outing and not the whole day as it is not that big enough to put all the necessary items for whole day outing.
