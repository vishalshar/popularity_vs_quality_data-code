These have a strap at the top to keep the back from flopping down.  This was of no use to me as I have to take the headrest (where the strap should attach) out to install car seats in our minivan.  Additionally, the headrest strap has a metal closure that I was afraid would scratch up my leather seat if I left the headrest strap hanging down behind the mat or dangling over the seat back.  As long as you don't have to remove your headrest during car seat installation, this would be a nice mat; however, I returned these in favor of the Summer Infant Elite DuoMat.
