I read the reviews about the smell but since most of the reviews were positive I hoped that was an old (solved) problem. The chest arrive and was spacious and cute. My tot liked opening the lid and would not get hurt running into it. But the smell was noxious! It smells like just produced toxic plastic. I aired it out for 2 weeks (!) in another room. Then taking drastic measures (realizing that it ruins the chance of return but hoping to keep this oh so cute box) i dunked it into a cold bath. After it dried (which it did without any problems btw) it still smelled. So did the toys left in it overnight. Sadly the chest went to the curb...
