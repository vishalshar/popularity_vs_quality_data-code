I washed this towel by itself before initial use, and dried it by itself.  Then, after his bath, I dried my baby in this towel and he was completely covered in pills from the towel.  I didn't notice it so much at first, but then when I applied baby's lotion, I felt all the pills "scrubbing" his skin. He had to be rinsed again. I have since washed and dried the towel again and will give it one more try.  If it continues to shed all over my baby's skin it is going back to where it came from.  $20 is too much for a shedding towel.  The other reviewers at the time I purchased this towel did not mention anything about this so I was willing to buy and try something new vs. my usual Aden + Anais towel.  But not again from Jumping Pills, I mean Jumping Beans!  I am disappointed. Even if this towel passes the test after the second wash, I still say forget this brand.  Aden + Anais are the best if you want a large baby towel that is soft, high quality, and doesn't pill at all.
