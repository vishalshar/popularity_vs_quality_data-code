I was looking for a sleep sack that was one size fits all.  Meaning it would fit until my grand baby was at least 18 months.  My other grand baby had these.  The " Carter's sleeping Bag-White Pink Zebra Print Label-One Size" implies what I wanted.  It is my fault I did not read further but none of the other sleep bags said "one size". So now she has 3 9 month bags to add to her collection....very disappointed.
