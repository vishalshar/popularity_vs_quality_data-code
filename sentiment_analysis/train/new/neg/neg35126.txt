A little disappointed.  It's really 7 inches tall, not the 11 inches posted for height.  Calling this large is a stretch. Mine has a rip in the ear so I'm not impressed with quality control either.  I need it for Christmas so I will fashion a bandage for that ear.  Yeahhhhh I needed one more project.
