This was a good idea for eating out, didn't have to worry about my daughter pushing her plate off the table or worry about the germs on the table surface. I would forget to take it with me, wish there was a carry case or something to store it in. It's very sticky, if it was in my purse everything would stick to it, gum, crumbs and coins. Overall it's a good product if you remember to take it with you.
