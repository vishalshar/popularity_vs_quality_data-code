I'm gonna try to talk about this so that ppl new to cloth diapering (CDing) won't have to look up add'l terms : pBut ok, there is a pad w one side birds eye cotton & the other side a really soft material that is sewn on, a soaker.This diaper has dual openings, the front & the back so that if you want you can stuff an add'l liner, or insert to absorb even more. Great feature!The con: it seems SO Bulky! Even with out an add'l insert. I have a boy so I would stuff the attached soaker more towards the front but it just seems so bulky & uncomfortable :(ExpensivePro: BEAUTIFUL pattern, I mean beautiful!Attached soakerDual openingsCan use as a pocket diaper too.I REALLY wanted this pattern & overlooked price but now that I've seen other diapers w this same pattern I'm gonna try to sell this one to get a differnt type of cloth diaper.
