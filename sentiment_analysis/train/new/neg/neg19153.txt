So far, I agree with both the compliments and the complaints of other reviewers.  I bought these for use on a sheet of glass loosely sitting on top of a square card table, and I needed something to keep the glass from moving and to protect me from clumsily lumbering into its sharp corners.  So far, these cushions are doing an excellent job on both counts.  I don't have children, but my concerns are probably familiar to those with toddlers:  I have a mid size parrot, and parrots are notorious for scanning the room for things that might be fun to taste, put in their mouth, chew, and ultimately leave as a pile of rubble on the floor.  I realize that, except for stainless steel, nothing is really parrot-proof to a determined bird.  Unfortunately, the blue tint in these silicon cushions is like a siren call to her, and she just can't resist that raised edge.  I'm hoping she'll lose interest before too long.  If they survive her childlike curiosity, these should serve their purpose pretty well.
