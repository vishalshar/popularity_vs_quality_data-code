It gets really water logged & sinks, if the tub isn't as full that's not a huge issue. You can wash it in the washing machine, but that's kind of a hassle. If you don't though, it will probably mold. It takes a long time to dry after a bath, and splashes water droplets everywhere as it hangs to dry. Wouldn't be a huge issue if you have soft water that leaves less water residue. It seems to keep my baby comfy and happy, but I'll go with something else next time that's a little easier to maintain.
