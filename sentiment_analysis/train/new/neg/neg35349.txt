Well, we bought this mattress for the baby on the way. Our 19 month old has a Simmons Beautyrest mattress and I have to be honest this one does not compare, but the Simmons also cost around $200! We switched out our daughters for this one figuring that she would be in it for a shorter amount of time. It is not very good quality and is NOT firm at all. We'll see how long it lasts, if we end up keeping it. I know money is tight for a lot of people right now and I think this is a decent mattress for the price, but if you can, get the better mattress.5/1/11-So I have had this mattress for 2 days now and we are returning it. I had originally given it 3 stars, but took one away. We switched the mattress out for my 19 month old and the 2 nights that she slept on it she slept horribly. She has not slept that bad since she started sleeping in her own room. I finally took her in bed with us last night just so we all could get some sleep. Hope this helps :)
