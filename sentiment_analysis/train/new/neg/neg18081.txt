If you are looking for a lightweight stroller, definitely buy something else.The Keekaroo is a full featured umbrella stroller. We are pretty happy with it because it has certain features I couldn't live without (basket, reclined seat).  The reason I give it 3 stars is that with the baby in it, it gets hard to push (and no, there is nothing wrong with the wheels - the wheels are in perfect condition).  Our son is only 8 months old, so I imagine by the time he is a toddler we might be too frustrated with pushing the keekaroo.CONS:It's heavy - about 15 lbs.  You can easily put it in the trunk, but it would be a pain to collapse and lug through a restaurant.Because it's heavy, it has a bit of a drag when you push it, especially with baby in it.You have to crouch to open and close it. Makes me feel unsafe in a parking lot.Harnass is REALLY CHEAP!  It's only a three point harnass, and the material is so thin that it gets folded in half as it comes through the loops.  It's quite bad.PROS:seat recline (about 30 degrees)basket holds our large diaper bag (we have the Diaper Dude bag)- largest basket I've seen on an umbrellathe lower portion of the seat adjusts to our son's legsgreat sunshade - the best I've seen on an umbrella, and you can unattach it and move it to match the sun's angle (although this makes it flop around and you have to adjust it every 5 minutes)good looks - nice foam handles and good fabricsBOTTOM LINE:Not sure if I'd buy it again. It looks great, and I do like some of the extra features, but that push problem is a big issue for us.  Our other stroller is a BOB so maybe I'm just used to their amazing (and expensive) construction (I can push it with one finger).  I imagine the Keekaroo's push is quite comparable to a Gracco or other full sized, midprice stroller.Hope this helps!
