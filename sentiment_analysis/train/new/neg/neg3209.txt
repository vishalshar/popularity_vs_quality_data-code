I ordered this one to use organic and good quality diaper.Pros : Its very good quality and Easy to use. Buttons are good with multiple adjustments.Stains are going away if you wash it immedtely.I loved all the colours and designCons : Once i didnt rinse my diaper poop immediately,i did it after 10 minutes and the stains didnt go away even after multiple washing still it exist and at time some  pee smells comes after heavy washing. i faced this issue couple of time.
