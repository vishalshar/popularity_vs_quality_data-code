Not impressed!! I attached these to our closet doors perfectly but when you actually go to open your closet door with the sides of this product properly pressed down the door runs into the middle area and can't slide open! The only way this product works is if the two doors of your closet have a huge gap in between them, our closet is very standard and these did not work, what a disappointment. I do not recommend this product.
