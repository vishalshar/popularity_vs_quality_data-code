In Terms of Price- 5 stars. Can't complain, it is a big package for the price. However I have the following minor issues with them.-The cutlery is a bit too babyish for my almost 2 year old...the forks don't 'pierce' as well as some (I go with Ikea cutlery). Perfect for beginners though.-The ridges on the cups & bowls kind of sucks if you put them in the dishwasher (it collects water in the ridges upside down)...Another problem with the dishwasher is...don't put any of it in there. They might be dishwasher safe...but they totally do not belong in the dishwasher...they are so flimsy they are tossed all around and usually when my wash is finished, they are turned the other way up, full of dirty water. Even the cutlery, it is thrown about and ends up at the bottom of my washer. I've started washing it all by hand so I can avoid this.- The sippy cup lid is for beginner drinkers- it barely allows any liquid through, which again---good for some, not so good for toddlers.I love the bowls (big and small) with their lids the most- I use them for snacks at the playground, even I just throw a couple in my bag in case there are other kids playing with my son and he doesn't want to share his snack :p
