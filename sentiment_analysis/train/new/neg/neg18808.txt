I've tried MANY sippy/straw cups for my 1yo, and while I have my favorites and my less than favorites, this was the first one I actually put right into the trash. The main reason is that it is near impossible to drink out of. I read the reviews and saw that others had mentioned that, but I own several other cups that people said the same thing about and my daughter has no problem with them, so I figured this would be the same. Boy was I wrong! I almost didn't even give it to her because I could barely pull liquid from it, but I decided to let her be the judge. When I gave it to her, she kept trying it then handing it back saying "water" because she thought it was closed or empty. Here was the real shocker - despite the effort it takes to suck liquid out, it still leaks!! That's when it found its way straight to the garbage can. The only redeeming factor of this cup was the lid. I like that it's attached and easy for little ones to open and close. Unfortunately, without being able to drink from it when it is open, it still wasn't worth keeping. For what it's worth, my (and my daughter's) absolute favorite cups have been the Zoli Bot and the Tommee Tippee ones (both their sippy and straw cups).
