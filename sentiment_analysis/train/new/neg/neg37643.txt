This bag is cute but not made well. The metal on straps turns the straps black. And actually looks like its about to split. Also, the cloth messenger strap is tearing. This shouldn't be happening since its hardly ever used. The bottom is cloth and very hard to keep clean. In the pics it was leather. Also, the edges are tearing on bottom. I am a bag collector and take care of them. This is not a good quality bag at all. PPB and ju ju be are definitely better! This bag is also heavy. The front pocket is roomy but again the cloth can't be cleaned. Cute bag but just not worth what I paid for it.
