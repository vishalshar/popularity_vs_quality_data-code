I was excited about purchasing this diaper clutch but was a bit disappointed when it arrived. It is a great idea in theory, but it just wasn't for me. The quality overall seems decent, although the metal hardware is cheap and already came worn looking, so that made me think it would only get worse over time. I would like my products to come in perfect condition since they are brand new! I am a bit of a perfectionist so I am sure this wouldn't bother some people. I ended up getting a Ju Ju Be diaper bag and some accessory bags from them that will fulfill my needs for a small diaper essential clutch. Ju Ju Be products are excellent quality and seem like they will last a long time. If you want a good organizing diaper clutch and aren't worried about super high quality, then this would work, I just preferred something else.
