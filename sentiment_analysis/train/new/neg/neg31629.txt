If your child is big enough to stand or walk, do NOT buy this.  My son can bend it in half and it is very flimsy :(It HAS to be in a 4 piece square, a 6 piece hexagon, or the 8 piece octagon or else it will not stand up.  I was hoping to be able to do a 2x2 square (8 pieces), but you cannot do that or the sides just bend and wobble.Even with the pads on the bottoms of it, it slides around, there is nothing I can do to stop it.  I tried pinning the bottom of a blanket to it, which helped slightly, but it just is not well made enough.
