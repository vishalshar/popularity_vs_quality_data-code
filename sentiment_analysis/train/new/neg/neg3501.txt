These were great the first few months, but now my babies are drinking 7.5-8 ounces and even though the "don't fill past this line" is at 8.5 ounces, these things leak like crazy at every time! If I don't stop baby from drinking and catch the leak before it drips, then her shoulders are soaked. I bought the bottles based on what people told me to buy - so I never tried a cheaper bottle. Looking back, that was probably a mistake - always cheapest first then upgrade later if needed!
