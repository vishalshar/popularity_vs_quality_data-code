I bought these sippy cups for my two year old because I thought he would like having a cup that looks like moms coffee cup.  He shows no preference to these cups over any of his other cups.They don't really leak, but when he takes a drink it leaves a small amount in the spout between the sipper and the valve that drips all over the place.  I do not like them and have put them away for now.  After reading some of the other reviews I have decided to keep them for when he is older and we can use them as a travel mug without the valve.
