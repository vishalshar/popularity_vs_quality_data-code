This potty is the one our daughter wanted so we bought it and it has worked great for us. It resembles a regular toilet and doesn't look as tacky as some potties.Pee alway goes in the bowl and the seat seems comfortable for little ones. (we have never used the pee guard it looked pretty worthless)I would definitely not use it as a step stool as the lid is not very sturdy or a good shape for standing on. It does function well as lid.The seat does NOT work on a regular toilet, it does not sit on the toilet securely. If you just need a potty I would recommend this. If youwant more features(step stool, transition seat) I would recommend a different potty.
