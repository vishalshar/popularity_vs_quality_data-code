These sheets are very soft but did not work for us. the fist time I put one on the daycare crib mattress it ripped because these fit pretty snug and the daycare mattresses are very thick. We kept using the second one for a while. I like the fabric but it is really easy to rip them from the middle when trying to put them on. They did not work on our Pack and play mattress because it is too soft and the sheet makes the mattress curve up.
