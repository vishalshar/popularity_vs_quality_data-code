A friend gave us the fleece Kiddopotamus which we loved. I loved the idea of a cotton one because we had a summer baby and didn't want him to get too hot in the summertime. The cotton version stretches too much and our little one kicked himself out of it every night, so we ended up using the fleece ones afterall.  He couldn't kick himself out of the fleece one because it didn't stretch like the cotton ones. :(
