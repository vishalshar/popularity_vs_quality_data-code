I am unsure of why this product did not work for me. I am very large chested (42H) so these may have been too small. I can't really say. I found the product did not fit snugly into my medela breast pump (hospital grade) either. I also used a sort of tube top with holes cut out of them to hold the pump flanges to my breast to allow me to double pump hands free, sort of a ghetto, diy version of Easy Expression Bustier Hands Free Pumping Bra. This worked well with just the medela flanges but adding the Pumpin Pals made me not get the suction required to pump effectivly. I am disappointed because breast pumping has been a painful experience and I wanted to make it easier on my poor sore breast. Had to go back to pushing and pressing my breast with the 36mm medela flanges. This product may work better for someone with small breasts.
