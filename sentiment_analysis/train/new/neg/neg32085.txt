We used these "lovies" for my now three year old so we orders new ones when we had another baby. The packaging was terrible. They were folded down small and then plastic tags were punched through the fabric in at least 6 places. These plastic tags ripped the delicate fabric and created runs that cannot be fixed. The tags were on so tight that it was tricky to cut with scissors and ripping it out made it worse. By the time I got them out is the wrapping there were a bunch of holes and runs throughout. Dumb packaging and now the items are ruined. It was completely unnecessary to pin them down so much.  I had to throw them out. Frustrated.
