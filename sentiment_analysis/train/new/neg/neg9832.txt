We had the dog hanging on the crib and our 7 month old daughter would play with it when she woke up in the mornings. Recently, while she was playing with it, the ring that she pulls on to make the music play broke off. The toy is now broken. It is impossible to fix and just dangles limply on the side of the crib. The tag does say to pull gently, but that is hard to control in the hands of an infant. I'm glad she is too young to understand it is broken or we would have had tears.
