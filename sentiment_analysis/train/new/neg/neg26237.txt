bought these for my son at 18 mo - and they were way too tight even with the extra extension panels I bought. My son is now 2.5yr old and tall and skinny panels fit well enough to pull up and down but the diaper still leave red marks on his butt and hips ( the snapping section on the side is just to thick and hard and he hates them because they hurt he says. He is 31lbs and almost as tall as his 4yr old sister not a chunky kid!!  I have tried antsy pants, flip trainers and blueberry trainers. Antsy pants don't have soft side panels leaves indentions from the threading, don't lay flat and leak, flip trainers don't have a hidden soaker so it tends to curl and fold and cause leaks. Blueberry trainers are cool but not very absorbent they only hold SMALL accidentsâ€¦ my daughter and son have both tried them but even though it would prevent puddles from walmart's floor it still soaked through enough to get their pants wet and still have to change. So this one still beats those in my opinion it is still my go to trainer when I take him out in public for short periods of time since it gets uncomfortable for him it is the best at absorbency and easy cleaning etc. this works good at naps and holding an accident or two but I have to use a flip insert at night but its still not too bulky and works better than putting a diaper on him (because he likes the huggies/pampers pull ups) so it keeps him motivated and not regress back to just liking his pull ups :)
