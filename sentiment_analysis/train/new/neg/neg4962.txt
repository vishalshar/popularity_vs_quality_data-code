I was not allowed to use this on the plane at all. I knew I couldn't use it for take off and landing but we were not allowed to use it when the seat belt light came on either. Stupid! Of course my child is safer with this on rather than just sitting on my lap but they would not budge. So unless you think you want your child belted to you when the seatbelt light is not on there is no point in having this.
