These are the perfect size for toddlers and the large, grippy handles and little reservoir around the popsicle are also great features for little hands. However, the plastic of the molds is really low quality for the job it's tasked with. The molds snap together along two edges and when you unsnap them for washing, or any other reason, they crack and break if they've recently come out of the freezer. The first mold broke the day we got it and now, about three weeks after I bought them, all four of the molds are cracked where the pieces snap together and two of them are actually broken, so there are jagged edges. I've learned not to unsnap them unless it's absolutely necessary, but that's pretty stupid design for something that's clearly meant to be used individually if you choose. Unless the manufacturer is going to use higher quality plastic that can handle being manipulated after freezing, they should just make a single mold. I'm going to keep the handles after the molds are rendered totally useless, because I think I'll be able to reuse them with little paper cups or something else. That's a pretty sad commentary, though.
