Bought the blue and green nipple expecting Latex nipple, because that's what the item description listed them as. (Crazy, right?) Upon receiving the item the green and blue assortment are silicon nipples.  Go figure. Apparently the pink and green assortment are the only latex nipples available.  Giving one star bc the item description should be an easy change for the company, yet they choose not to. Major hassle for three latex nipples.
