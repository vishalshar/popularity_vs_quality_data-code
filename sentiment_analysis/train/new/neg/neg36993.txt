The 2 star review is probably a little low because these are in fact waterproof play mats.  The reason I give it two stars is because of you look at the first picture you see 5 light blocks,  5 dark blue blocks,  and 6 grey blocks.  While realistically, that's not what you get.  Look at,  I believe the 3rd picture and you'll see the true amount of colors you get.  6 light blue,  6 grey, 4 dark blue.  This is silly but for someone who is very symmetrical this is crazy. I'll tell you why. ...the biggest issue I've noticed so far is that because of this misproportioned blocks,  there are special side pieces and those special side pieces have 4 special corner pieces. If you got the shown amount,  you would have a corner in each color or in theory every corner the same but instead I have one light blue corner,  one dark blue corner and one grey corner,  then the kicker, another light blue corner that is the wrong angle so you either have to turn upside down and have one side not have the bumpy texture or leave it off and not have a corner -_-. Irritated by this.  Also, i can't have the stars in the middle make sense because 4 of the light blue have dark blue stars while the last two light blue blocks have grey center stars!! Otherwise, blocks are as one would think. If not anal about symmetry and being promised something you don't actually get,  and just need cheap easy blocks,  so far these are what I would expect.  The center stars do seem to pop out a little more then I would like.
