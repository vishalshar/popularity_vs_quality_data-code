This tummy pad was so cute I just had to get it. My daughter played on it a few times but moved onto more interactive toys after a few weeks. It is great for tummy time but once they get tired of laying on their bellies this toy just gets shoved back in the bag. Did I mention it's adorable though?! Lol.
