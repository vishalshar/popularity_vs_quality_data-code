I like this stroller, but right away I have to say that the carrying abilities are near none.  There is a basket of sorts underneath, but it's hard to get anything more than a diaper in and out of it.  Not much space because of the folding mechanism behind and below the basket.  There is space up at the handles--a large zippered pouch and a cup holder, all made of fabric. (I put my keys and cell phone in there usually.  Space for snacks and other items too.)The stroller folds easily (not one handed though) and is light.  The harness works well and is simple to adjust.  We've had it for 6 months now and our little girl loves watching her older brothers play or bike ride while she rides in the stroller.  The canopy is rather small and doesn't shade much, but we are hat-wearers anyway.
