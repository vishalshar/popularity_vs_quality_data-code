This is my second diaper bag. I bought this one mainly because it seems bigger than my previous one. When my baby began eating solid food, I found that I need to bring more stuff with me when we go out - Bowls, spoons, baby food, bib, sippy cup, more baby food. This bag is indeed roomy. There are lots of pockets and it is easy to organize your things. I love the side pockets. The color is great too and its easy to clean. This bag however isn't what I hoped it would be. There is no zipper to close the main compartment- which would have been very useful in keeping smaller items safe and secure inside the bag. The flap is not enough to keep things securely inside and when you are in a rush and things get busy, you toss this bag in your car, and your things fly out. I am also disappointed with the shoulder strap. When I want to shorten the strap, I realize the shoulder pad (which prevents the buckle from hurting your shoulders, when you carry the bag)is not wide enough to allow the buckle to pass through. When I tried to adjust the strap, the buckle tore the sides of the shoulder pad. Now my brand new bag looks old and because of the damage, I do not think I can return it. Very disappointed and sad with this purchase. I do not recommend it if you like to wear your bag high (shorter straps) and if you carry lots of smaller items (keys, lip balm, diaper rash cream, baby sunscrean, smaller toys etc). I hope this review will help other shoppers.
