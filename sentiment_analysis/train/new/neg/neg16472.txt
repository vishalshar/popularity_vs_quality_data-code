This mobile is adorable and looks absolutely perfect for my classic Winnie the Pooh nursery.  I was very excited when it arrived!  Unfortunately, once I put it together and turned it on the animals get stuck on the long arm support as it spins and it stops spinning.  Sometimes it will push through and keep spinning, but it will consistently get stuck on one of the next two animals and do the same thing.  The music slows down slightly when the spinning slows down, and it will speed up a bit once it's freed and moving at regular speed again.  I am so disappointed; it is so cute and the only classic Pooh mobile I have found.  This design flaw, though, is a dealbreaker for me.  The spinning part of the mobile needs to be extended further away from the arm support.  I wonder if you leave the fabric cover for the arm off if the animals would still get stuck, but I can't imagine it would fix the problem.  If you're reading this review and you happen to be one of its designers, a volume button wouldn't hurt either.  I love the music, but it's a bit loud.  Overall this is not even close to worth keeping for me, and I am disappointed to have to return it.
