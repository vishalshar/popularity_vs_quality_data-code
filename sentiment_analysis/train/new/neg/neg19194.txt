I purchased 4 of these bottles to use for pumping while at work.  I assumed because they are 8 ounces like the other medela bottles (the ones with colored writing and measurements) that they would also be the same height.  WRONG.  These are slightly taller which makes it hard to put in the medela cooler with the ice pack.  It barely zips up and I am afraid if I were to use them daily the zipper would likely break.  We still use these as extra bottles for feeding or pumping at home but I do not take them with me to work to use with the cooler.  As a side note these bottles are the sterile ones that they use in the NICU.  There is nothing wrong with them but they do not have the clearly marked colored volume markings like the other Medela bottles.  Just something else to be aware of.
