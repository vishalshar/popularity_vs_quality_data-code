The idea of playing with tactual and visual stimulation is appealing, but it should be reserved for two-dimensional puzzles. The bumps on these block restrict any possible piling to two or three unstable lineups, as the lack of contact makes them highly unstable. Kids -and adults- get very frustrated trying to pile them up, and it's not even that kind of good frustration that teaches patience. I now use them only as a kind of 2D Tetris game, moving, rotating, and flipping shapes to come up with bigger simpler figures that will accommodate all the different blocks.
