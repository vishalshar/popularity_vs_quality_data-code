I liked the idea of this product, but they only sent me two of the three lids. They forgot to include the one that I thought would be the most useful -the cover lid to keep snacks fresh and contained in my diaper bag. The sippy cup lid is really silly, it looks like it should screw on, but there are no threads on the cup to screw it into, so it leaks. It would be much better if they just offered the pie replacement lid and two cover lids. I guess it is good to have an extra pie lid, but as I didn't receive the cover lid I was very disappointed.
