I got one of these for my son back when I first tried to potty train him. I couldn't believe what a piece of garbage it was once he had put his bare bottom on it (thus I didn't think returning it seemed quite right). How is any kid over 18 months supposed to fit all the required parts over this tiny hole? I don't think even a girl could keep her various parts on it at once, and any parent who's been there knows that they frequently pee while trying to poo, so there you are. I ended up tossing the top and keeping the step stool for use with the potty seat I went and bought to fit on the toilet instead. We still have the step stool, in fact, and I intend to pick up a baby bjorn seat for our youngest to use with it.
