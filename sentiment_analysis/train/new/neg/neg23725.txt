These bottles are very convenient because they are so easy to clean. I throw out the liner, rinse the bottle, and wash the 3 top parts, ring, nipple and cap. Once all of the air is pushed out, laying the bottle on the side during feeding breaks keeps the air out.Pros:-Easy to clean.-Easy to push air out of the bottle.-Easy for baby to hold because of its shape.Cons:-Cap can be hard to pull off.-The bottle is contoured differently from Playtex liners. This makes it hard to add the powder to 8 ounces of water. It sometimes overflows if I don't mix it before adding all of the scoops of powder.-The measurements on the bottle do not match the measurements on the liners.
