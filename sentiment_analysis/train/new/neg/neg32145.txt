Pretty disappointed, doesn't pick up well at all- even my own heartbeat is very hard to hear. Im about18 weeks and did not know when buying the recommended gestational age is 28 weeks min. This may have had an impact on hearing my baby, but considering it was difficult too hear my own or a two year olds, i can't give this a strong recommendation.
