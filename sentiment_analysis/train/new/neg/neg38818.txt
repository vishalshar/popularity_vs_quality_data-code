The toy organizer I received is not the same one that is in the picture (which we currently have).  I had bought this to replace the one that I have as it was starting to mold (it's a few years old) and I couldn't get it clean anymore.  However, when I received the item the frog was completely different.  The spout cover doesn't fit my shower fixture so I can't use it.  Not that big of a deal since I actually bought it for the organizer but it would have been nice to use had it actually fit.  I had to cut the opening of the organizer for the toys to fit and for my kids to be able to get them out easily.  I have not had a problem with the organizer staying on my acrylic tub.  It does sometimes slide down but it generally stays where I put it.  Not worth returning but I would not have bought it had I known it was not as pictured :(
