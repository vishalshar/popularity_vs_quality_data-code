I ordered these because my daughter is having trouble taking a bottle b/c she has been strictly breastfed (she is 2 mos. old).  She loves the soothie pacifier so I thought these would work for her.  Even though they say they are medium/fast flow...I found it to be too slow for her.  She is used to the milk coming out fast when she is nursing and that is why I ordered the faster flow.  Still, she was sucking for so long just to take in an ounce.  I found the nuk bottles with the medium flow nipple to work much better for her.  But, for a baby not used to breastfeeding these might be great...
