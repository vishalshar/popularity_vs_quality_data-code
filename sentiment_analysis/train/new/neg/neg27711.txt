I generally like Dr. Brown's bottles, although admittedly they do leak on a consistent basis. But by far the most frustrating aspect of these bottles are the impossible-to-read labels found on the underside of the nipple. My twins alternate between level 1 (for breastmilk), Level 2 (for formula), and the Y cut (for formula thickened with cereal). It is ridiculously difficult to read the transparent raised label on the underside of the nipple, especially when it is a bleary-eyed attempt in the middle of the night.If I didn't get these for free from a friend, I never would have stuck with the brand.
