With boys 6, 4, and 18months, we bought 2 Twilight Ladybugs and One Twilight Carz.The Ladybugs brought utter joy to the two younger ones - great execution on the product, and 3 colors of light to choose - Red, Blue, and Green (The blue and green are especially bright and clear).The Twilight Carz was broken right out of the box (I'll let you imagine the drama from an utterly disappointed 6 year old). The Blue light never worked, and the headlights don't go on an off as other reviewers report that they are supposed to do, so this obviously a defective unit. The red light does work, but is VERY weak when compared to the Ladybugs; the Carz stars don't even shine on the ceiling. Very simply, this is a poorly engineered product with poor quality control.One KEY point with the Twilight Carz is that it only has 2 colors to shine stars with - Blue and Red. They didn't include the brightest color, Green. (Probably justifying the exclusion to themselves with head and tail lights - but those don't project, which is the point of this toy.) As I work in product development (not for this company) I recognize this as a product that isn't ready to be marketed yet.
