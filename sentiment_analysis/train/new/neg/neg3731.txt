Overall we're not happy with this humidifier. The only thing it really has going for it is that it's cute and has a child-centric design and it's ultrasonic filterless operation.First off, the mist this thing emits is extremely heavy, it's definitely cool; but it's too thick and immediately deposits onto any solid surface. The cord is entirely too short to allow for optimal placement of the unit away from other furniture and surfaces. We initially set it up in the nursery next to a chair, I checked on the unit about 30 minutes later and the arm of the chair was completely saturated and soaked! The floor was damp as well. I've never owned a humidifier that left this type of moisture deposit. Typically the mist dissipates and humidifies the air. I did verify that the humidity levels in the room weren't already high.Around use #4, the unit failed to turn on. I had to unplug and wait a few minutes and switch outlets before it would work again. Within an hour it had shut itself off again. I don't trust that this unit will have an extended life span. We'll probably return it and purchase a standard looking unit from a reliable manufacturer.
