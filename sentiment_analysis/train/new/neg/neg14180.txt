This pump was absolutely sad. But, before I get to that, let me explain my little story. So, I was borrowing a little electric pump from a friend and decided that I needed to get my own. I wanted one that was a double simply because it sounded faster and easier. I love Lansinoh for their nipple cream and their storage bags so when I found this pump at this price it seemed like a no-brainer. Unfortunately, the pump didn't get here until 3 days after the estimated arrival date. Strike one. The pump really well the first time, but when I went to use it a second time, it had totally pooped out. No suction whatsoever. I might have just got a lemon pump, but that was frustrating enough to give it Strike two. And last of all, the returning process was ridiculous! I was obviously just a number to Lansinoh. Long story short, they made me repeat myself twice and call them two times to even get into the process of returning it. Strike three.So here's what I did: I returned the pump and kept the extra parts (they don't have you return those for sanitary purposes.) I ordered an Ameda Purely Yours, great pump, but bad suction. Not as bad as Lansinoh, but not great either. So, at my wits end and out of sheer desperation for a pump that worked, I combined the two. I put the spare parts from my Lansinoh (e.g. the shield and flange) onto the tubing from the Ameda and HOLY CRAB CAKES! It is amazing. It works like a champion.So, in short, here's what I would do if I were you (or me doing this over again): Buy the Ameda Purely Yours as well as the spare parts to a Lansioh pump. The shields from Lansinoh are so comfortable and way nicer than the Ameda's. It's a complicated process, but for a mom that's frustration was "up to here", it was a relief to finally be able to pump as much as my breasts contained in less that 30 minutes.
