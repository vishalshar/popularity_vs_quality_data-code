No where in the description does this product say it has a vinyl layer...only polyester and polypropylene. I had purchased this because I thought it was vinyl-free. As soon as I received the product, right on the package it says one of the layers is 100% waterproof vinyl, so I am sending them back. I know from previous experience that vinyl makes baby sweat, plus it is toxic and non-breathable. I prefer the newer style of waterproof pads that are breathable while still being waterproof.They are a wonderful design in theory in that it isn't fitted and doesn't wrap around the bed so you can quickly change it (exactly what I wanted in that aspect), but the fact that it is just another vinyl product does not work for me at all. Just wanted to warn others that may be deceived since the description on here does not disclose the complete material content.
