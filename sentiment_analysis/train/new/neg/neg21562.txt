Really like this book, however, had a mildew smell when I got it, perhaps why its being discontinued.  Washed it and set it out in sunlight, turning the pages each day, so the sunlight could air them out, finally after a week or so the smell went away.  Baby now can enjoy a clean smelling and cute book.  Love the floppy yarn hair on the front cover.
