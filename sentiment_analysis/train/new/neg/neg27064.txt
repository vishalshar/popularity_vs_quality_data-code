This is the same price as the Fisher-Price Healthy Deluxe Booster Seat and looks the same, and I bought it thinking that it was the same. Do yourself a favor and buy Item model number BMD97 instead of this one. The BMD97 model has a removable snap-on tray that you can stick in the dishwasher, and a removable snap-on lid to keep the tray clean when you travel with it, it is also height-adjustable. This one is not.
