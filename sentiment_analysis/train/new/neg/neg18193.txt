I saw the rock n play listed on a couple of new mom "must have" lists and immediately came to Amazon to look them up. We purchased this rock n play and used it for the first 3 months. My daughter slept great in it, then I did a little more research and saw that this is NOT recommended by pediatricians to be used for sleeping at night. It is to be used under supervision like a swing, so there would be no point in having both. I was obviously torn because my daughter slept so well in it through the night, but safety is most important so we transitioned her to the crib. I agree with another reviewer that it makes transitioning to the crib much harder, as my daughter went from waking only a couple times a night to more sleepless nights. So, use with caution...it seems babies do sleep well in it, but it is not meant to be used as a bassinet.
