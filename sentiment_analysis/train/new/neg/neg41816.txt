I bought this item for my godson who loves music.  I first put it on his playpen and he was really happy with it.  The only problem was when I tried to attach it to the crib I found that the straps were too short.  The crib has a 2-3 inch ledge at the very top.  I contacted Munchkin customer service and although they responded quickly, they were not very helpful at all.  In fact, I was told to go and get longer straps:(  Seems like it needs to be more versatile to fit wider cribs.  Also, I am a little concerned that a very active baby could get to the mp3 player on the other side (not very secure).  overall, a great concept.  I would love to see an updated version to address these concerns.
