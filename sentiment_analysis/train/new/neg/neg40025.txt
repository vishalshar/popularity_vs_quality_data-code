Combi generally makes excellent baby products.  My wife and I really like our Connection infant car seat and our Flash stroller.  This stroller, however, is extremely disappointing for no other reason than the poorly designed restraint buckle.  It is constructed of obviously cheap plastic and won't unclip unless you press very very hard on the release button and pull like heck.  Although I'm disappointed in the Urban, I will still consider buying other Combi strollers, which are generally well-designed, well-built, good looking, and quick folding, in the future.April 21, 2008 Update:  My wife and I purchased a Combi Cosmo stroller from BRU this past weekend.  The buckle works fine and we are very impressed with the quality.
