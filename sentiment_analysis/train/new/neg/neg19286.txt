If I could give this toy zero stars, I would.  The first one arrived and I put new batteries in it and it wouldn't power on.  To make sure my batteries weren't faulty, I put another set of batteries in.  The toy still wouldn't power on.  A replacement toy was quickly shipped out by Amazon.  The replacement toy powered on when the power button was pushed- but it got STUCK!  The only way of getting the power button out to power it off was with a small screwdriver!It's a shame because this is such a cute toy/concept.  But it's a piece of crap.
