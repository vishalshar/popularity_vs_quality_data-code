Got this because my first choice was on backorder, so now I have two, which I figured wasn't a bad thing. This is a good, basic potty at a great price, but there are a couple limitations: 1) the seat snaps in rather than just sitting on top. My daughter can't really decide whether she wants to go in the potty or use the seat on the big people toilet. Making the switch takes a little longer than it should because the seat snaps in/out, and she can't do it herself. 2) the seat sloshes around a bit on the big toilet - no grippers or anything - which makes my daughter nervous. It's a very straightforward design and easy to clean, though.
