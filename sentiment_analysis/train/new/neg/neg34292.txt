I expected more from Fisher Price.  Let me start by noting I borrowed an older Fisher Price Backpack from a friend while caring for her children.  I loved it and inspired this purchase.  But this bag I received was terrible and is on it's way back.The designer of this backpack has likely never used a diaper bag.  The backpack straps are thin and cut into my shoulders with just the basic of contents.  The material is cheaply made and started pilling almost immediately.  Then the inside material began tearing on the first use.  Note please that I care for our belongings and am not "rough" in a way that would put an object through unnecessary abuse. The poor reviews on the diaper bag I entirely agree.  However, it's a good looking bag, and the compartments are perfectly set for accessibility.  Try again with your older model Fisher Price.  THAT was a winner, not this model.
