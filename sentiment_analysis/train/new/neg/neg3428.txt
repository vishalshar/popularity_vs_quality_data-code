Overall, I am very pleased with this stroller.  It is very well designed and I love the fact that it can be used from birth until about 4 years old.  Because it reclines all the way flat, we were taking our newborn for walks around the block when he was just 2 weeks old.  The shade is completely adjustable and does a great job blocking the sun.  For the few drawbacks, I must point out that the tires are very soft & the tread will wear away rather quickly.  Our son is now 7 months old and we have completely worn away one of the tires so that the steel belting is showing through and is now flat - we will have to order a relacement.  Another thing is that the shade doen't completely lay flush to the frame when in the up (normal) position - there have been a few times that my son has wedged his hand between the frame and the shade's support bar in a painful way.  I would say that overall it is a very goog stroller, however, I wish 3.5 stars was an option - for the price I was expecting a near flawless product, which this is not.UPDATE: my son is now 18 months old and we have gone through 3 sets of tires (7 tires in total: 6 rear & 1 front tire) as well as 4 inner tubes at a cost of more than $150. Since the tires are an unusual size alternative replacements are unavailable and one must purchase them through the manufacturer (I've tried many online bicycle parts websites to no avail). Downgraded review to 3 stars.  If anyone has had their stroller for over a year & uses it regularly please comment if they have/have not had the same problem.
