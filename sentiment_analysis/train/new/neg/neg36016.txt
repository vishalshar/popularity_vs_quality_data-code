I tried using it quite a few times. It just seems like I could never get it to work correctly. It would pull some breastmilk out, but very little to none even after 5-10 minutes of use.It would not even cover the bottom of the bottle. The bottle is small.It would just be droplets all over the suction and bottle. I am not 100% sure how much should come out when I use a manual pump. I know it is definitely a lot slower than the electrical ones. I highly doubt it is as bad as what I experienced. It seems to have been waste of money.
