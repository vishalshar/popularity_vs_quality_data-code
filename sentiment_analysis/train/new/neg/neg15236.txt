I so wanted these to work since I pump because right now I warm up the milk in the medela bottle then pour it into the bottle. The Mam bottles take a long time to warm up.When baby was newly born, he would gag sometimes because the nipple is so long. After 3 months, he felt frustrated at some point because he is used to MAM nipples. More importantly, I saw a lot of air bubbles go into the bottle as baby was sucking. They stayed and didn't pop (they do with Mam).
