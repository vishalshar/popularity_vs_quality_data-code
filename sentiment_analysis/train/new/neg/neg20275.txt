Great concept but needs work. First, my biggest complaint is that the fisher price apps are in portrait presentation however the screen sits in landscape presentation so my baby would have to turn his head sideways to see it correctly. There should be an option to rotate the screen. Secondly, the chair needs to bounce or something. It's just stationary. So far my baby has enjoyed sleeping in it for it is very plush.
