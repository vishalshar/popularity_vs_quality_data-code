I bought these to go with the chair.  Promptly returned.  The bottom piece is too bulky for the seat of the chair and it does not work well with the straps.  It makes the straps very hard to use.  The top piece fits into the holes built into the back of the chair but it is not strapped on and constantly falls off and my child pulls it off and throws it.  Neither piece has straps.  The price of $69 is way overpriced for cushions that do not work.  Terrible design, would not recommend.
