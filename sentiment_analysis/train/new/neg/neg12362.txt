I personally love this item but my daughter does not. I think it is adorable, but our daughter completely ignores the toy and does not use it. It has become more of a decorative piece in her playroom. Every time I attempt to have her on the toy she feels unstable and acts like she is falling off the back. The arch to the mouses back is too steep and slippery for her to enjoy the ride.
