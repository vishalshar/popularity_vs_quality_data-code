I ordered this for my son, he is 2.5 and about 35 lbs to wear at night. He has outgrown disposables but is still in need for diapers as he is no where near being potty trained due to his speech delay issues. I was excited to try this item based on a few of the positive reviews, trying to disregard the negative. However upon opening the package and pulling this HUGE thing out... no way in the world this will work for my son. Its bulky and stiff and god forbid you need to add any other inserts inside because they will without a doubt leak out the side the way this is made. Do yourself a favor do not order this item... maybe the ulta lite is better but i will not be trying it. The search continues for diapers for him since this is not it.
