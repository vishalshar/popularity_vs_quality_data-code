FYI these are "Aden by Aden and Anais", the company's lower quality line.  The description doesn't indicate that (although if you enter the model number and brand name in a google search, you can find this out -- something I hadn't thought necessary before I ordered).  Having a set from the higher quality line, I am disappointed in these.  I'd give the higher quality line five stars.  These are okay.  I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could since they are thinner than the other line, less absorbent (they float and need to be held under water and squeezed to get them to absorb), and definitely rougher on baby's skin (and on mine when I tested them).  All-in-all I'd say it's worth buying the slightly more expensive, but higher quality ones.
