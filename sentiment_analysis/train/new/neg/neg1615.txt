I thought this was a decent stroller, light and easy to fold. The recline option was great for diaper changing on the go. After using it about 6 times (as it is our third stroller we only use to travel) the aluminum bars underneath cracked and it folded in on my 2 month old!!! I called customer service and they couldn't help me due to it being over a year since I bought it and when I asked to speak with a supervisor was told to call back later!
