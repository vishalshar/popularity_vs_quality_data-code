I thought I would love this given the rave reviews I've heard (and read) about them over the past few years, but it doesn't really work as I expected.  I feel like the stuffed animal makes it easier for my flailing child to pull the pacifier out of his mouth making him more upset.  While it's nice that when it does fall out it doesn't go very far, I've found that the standard soothie pacifier tends to stays in his mouth better when upset.  The only time I've found this works as intended is when he's swaddled and even then it doesn't stay where he can easily pull it back in.  Perhaps a different animal would have worked better, but I'm not willing to throw out the extra cash to try it.  It's definitely adorable when in use, especially when he holds it, but I'll stick with the soothie for now.
