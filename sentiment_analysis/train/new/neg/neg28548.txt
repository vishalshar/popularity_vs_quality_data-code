I did my research when looking for a cart cover for our 5-month-old, and could not decide between this or the Buggy Bagg. We ordered both & here are some things I noted about the two:RITZY SITZY:-nice patterns, soft fabric-wide leg holes (good for two children to sit in it at once)-has its own safety strap-fits most carts-hard to install, especially while holding a child-toy loops, small pockets-can be used to cover highchair, although we never tried-does not cover EVERY part of cart-child who can not sit up independently may have hard time staying up-machine washableBUGGY BAGG:-great box-like design, keeps toys from going on ground when dropped-holds bottles, toys, etc.-VERY easy to install. Simply place bag in cart & unzip!-has its own safety strap-large zipper pouch for keys, phone, etc.-covers all of cart, has velcro cover for bar in between legs as well-fits large carts easily, small carts it is a little big for but still works-comes with attached soft pillow which helps baby who can't sit up yet stay up-machine washableAfter using both, we decided that we absolutely loved the Buggy Bagg. It costs about $20 more, but well worth it for the extra features. The Ritzy Sitzy is nice and has beautiful fabric, but, in my opinion, it is not worth $65. If you needed a cover to use with 2 children, it may be worth it, but if you are just looking for a simple cover there are a lot of cheaper ones that are just as nice.
