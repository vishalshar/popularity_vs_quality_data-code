Ok, so I was deciding between these and the Little Green Pouches and totally bought these because they have adorable animals on them and I a big sucker for that.  They aren't a bad product but I am sad to report that the Little Green Pouches are much better designed although totally boring looking.  Here is why:1. The Squooshi pouches have curves and the food gets stuck in them.  So, you are going to have to try to clean puree out of the animal shoulder area.  Bad times!2. Not dishwasher safe.  WHAT?  If you have a baby and you also have a dishwasher, seriously don't buy stuff that does not go in the dishwasher.  You do not have time for that BS anymore.3. They fill at the bottom.  This means that they don't have a nice resting base like the store bought ones and the Green Pouches.  The base allowed my baby to feed himself the store bought ones but these I have to hold for him. Also, if you don't seal them well enough you end up squeezing puree all over the place.4. Although they are supposed to be BPA free, they are made in China and the Green Pouches are (I think) made in America.It's kind of like the Green Pouches people bought these, fixed all the problems and then created the Green Pouch. But didn't make them cute.  I wonder how old this baby will get before I get over always picking the cute thing!
