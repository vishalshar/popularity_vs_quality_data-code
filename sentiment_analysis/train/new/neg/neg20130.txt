Bought this item in late 2011 through a very popular brick and mortar store. Was looking for an "organic" changing pad as I was trying to bring as little polyester fiber/plastics into my baby's room. I think anyone looking for a natural alternative would be remiss to purchase this. As stated by another reviewer, it is only 16% organic fill, the other 84% is poly. we were planning on cutting the outside (obviously man-made) plastic outer cover off and sew an organic cover for one. But when we took the vinyl-y cover off we were surprised to see the "organic cotton filling" was comprised of a small rectangular strip of cotton. The product is obviously advertised to mislead and the manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves. You get what you pay for. I'll try and attach pictures.
