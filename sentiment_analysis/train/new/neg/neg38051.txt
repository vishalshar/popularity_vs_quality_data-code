We bought this crib because we lived in Manhattan when I got pregnant and needed to stay in our 1 bedroom apartment for 9 months of my son's life. We needed something with a small footprint. We considered a bassinet or mini crib but figured then we might have to buy a crib anyway before the 9 months was up. We had no idea how fast our son would grow. We liked that it was on wheels and could fit through door ways. It has lived up to its expectations on all of those fronts but failed miserably on the most fundamental aspect....structure. We continually have to tighten the bolts in it. Just today I went into my son's room to find him w/ one of the bolts in his mouth!!!! I was sure I had left a positive review of this thing and wanted to come delete it. It looks like I never bothered to review it and I am glad that I am just now reviewing it as I've had it for a while (my son is now 16+ months) & grown to hate this thing. You'd think for 800$ it would stay together! We have many items we have had to assemble at home as we are avid Ikea shoppers....but never have we had an Ikea item fall apart. P.S. If you decide to buy it anyway you can find inexpensive & unique sheets (sans bumper) on etsy.comEdit: So I contacted Stokke about the screws coming out and they said that it is expected of me to regularly maintain by tightening the screws. Well I had another son. We got an Ikea crib for 100$ and I am not expected to tighten the screws and it is a million times sturdier. The foot print in the Ikea crib isn't much bigger. DO NOT BUY THIS. For 800$ you can get 8 cribs that are better.
