The frame of our City Select has cracked all the way through above one of the rear wheels just below the cross bar.  I contacted customer service which stated that this is not a "manufacture defect" and that I could purchase a replacement frame but they are back ordered 4-5 weeks.  We loved our City Mini and moved up to the City Select when we had a second child.  Not as easy to fold and pack but very happy with the features of this stroller.  We live in a city so we take our stroller everywhere.  Yes, we probably put more miles and curbs on our stroller than a family who drives more.  That being said, if this isn't a "manufacture defect" then it is a design defect because we only used our stroller for the designed purpose (ie strolling our children).  If you don't demand a lot from your stroller, this is a great one.  If you are a city dweller, beware.
