I purchased this roll thinking it was basically the same thing as the Prince Lionhart version of the product. Well, I was wrong. Although we eventually got it to work, the double-sided tape is cheap and really difficult to get the film separated from. It took almost an hour to edge our coffee table fighting with the peel-and-stick tape. The 3M tape that comes with the Prince Lionhart is super easy and quick, and otherwise the two products seem to be the same so I'd skip this and go with the easier to apply version.
