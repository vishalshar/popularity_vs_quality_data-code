I'll start by saying  how confused I am as to why so many people gave this item more than 2 stars. If this product worked the way it was supposed to, it would indeed have my 5 star rating. HOwever, that is not the case.I bought this, like most parents, because I wanted something that would hold our endless number of bath toys in or near the bathtub. I didn't want to find something to put them in that I'd have to store somewhere and take up  more closet space. So, I purchased this thinking this would kill two birds with one stone: storage but not using up storage space.WRONG- the suction cups are worthless. I read a ton of reviews and everyone's issue is that they have plastic inside their shower and that's why the suction cups didn't hold up. They said if they had ceramic, it wouldn't be a problem. I have ceramic- barely textured. Doesn't stick. I put it on the window, doesn't stick. I put it on our wall that has an eggshell coat, doesn't stick. Honestly, I have no clue WHAT it will stick to. Which, basically defeats the purpose because now, I STILL have to find somewhere to keep the toys until I can go spend yet another few dollars and trip to the store (which, I purchased this online specifically so I didn't have to get out) to buy new suction cups. Hence, pointless.
