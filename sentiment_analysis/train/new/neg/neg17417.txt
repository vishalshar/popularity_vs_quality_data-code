The cover is too light weight and not strong enough for every day use.Pros:* gently hugs the combi models* expands to fit the combi travel system nicely* huge ventilation for baby* not a lot of plastic usedCons:- No real way to hold on to stroller besides the minor elastic scrunch- two small velcro tabs at the bottom fail to hold on to model it's made for- literally blew away in mild weather, the snow hasn't begun to fall- air ventilations may have been too big since my son would get wet and cold with all weather types inside of the cover and that is with my additional safety pin attachments so it wouldn't blow away.- not warm overall- not for every day useWould suggest more stable ties or snaps at the bottom and top of the cover for future models.
