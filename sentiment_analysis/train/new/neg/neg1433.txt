Two problems:  #1  the post office sent the cards back requiring additional postage above the Forever stamp because nonmachinable  (the square size).  #2  The cards were not funny but stupid - I could only use a couple of the sayings without looking stupid myself.  The only thing that was good was the paper stock - it was good quality.  But when ordering, I would have liked to be able to read the text before deciding and also an alert that it would require extra postage  $.23 more than the Forever stamp.
