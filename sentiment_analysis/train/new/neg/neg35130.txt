UPDATE --Well, now my warranty of one year has run out and the monitor (not the camera) portion of the unit is broken. I contacted the company and even sent the camera back in to be fixed at my cost, but they sent an extimate that was VERY VERY high in response and suggested that I buy one of their "Refurbished" cameras instead at an even higher cost. Would no longer recommend this monitor! It only worked for a year and a couple of months. Not worth the money.I have never written a review before but I felt the need to because I am so happy with this monitor. It was our third try on a video monitor and we were about to give up because the other two were terrible. I am very pleased with the quality of the picture and sound. I also had to contact customer service and they called me back on a Saturday to walk me through a question I had. This was also cheaper than some of the other monitors we tried and works much better!
