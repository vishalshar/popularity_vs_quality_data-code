Doesn't really work that well. My wife watched the videos on how to use it and we tried several times, but couldn't really get it to work as it claimed. It also clims to have a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, but that also does noit work. We missed the Amazon Return Window by a a small margin, so we reached out to Miracle Blanket directly, with no response. Just know that this is not a Satisfaction Guaranteed Item.
