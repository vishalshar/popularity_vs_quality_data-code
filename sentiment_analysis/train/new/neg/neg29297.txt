I bought this bag thinking it would be a great bag for my two toddlers. It started out fine but as a few months went by the handles started pulling apart from the purse and the leather started showing wear. I thought that with the other reviews this bag would have been a wise choice.I emailed them about the problem that I was having with this bag and they accused me of lying right off the bat. That's not really how your should approach any email with a customer.If you want to buy this bag purchase it from someone else!!!!!I had this bag and it lasted for 5 months. They won't replace it or refund me because it wasn't 2 weeks after I reported it. It just seems that a diaper bag should last longer than that.So you have 2 weeks and then after that there is nothing you can do.BewareDon't buy this bag.. It looks nice and stylish however it's just a piece of junk.Buy something else
