Yes, They are Small, but my Car Seats Fit On them just fine. (Eddie Bauer Deluxe Convertible Car Seat, Granite Front Facing, and Graco Snugride 35 Infant Car Seat in Edgemont-red & Black) For the Convertable Car Seat, the back of the Carseat still digs into the seat back...But doesn't appear to be as damaging as the weight from the bottom would be on my leather seats. So That's Fine.I am Extremely Dissapointed with the pockets. I was planning on keeping things like board books, Drawing Pads, Diapers, Small pack of Wipes, Snacks like Granola Bars. HA! They are very small and the mesh hardly stretches! I tried stuffing a Size 3 Diaper in the center pocket, and it is very squished! A small book would not fit. The pockets are only good enough for stuff like matchbox cars, pacifiers or a small box of crayons. So...Kind of Useless.
