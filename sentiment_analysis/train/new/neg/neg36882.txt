What can I say. The device looked promising. The hardware is great but the software app is terrible. The audio and video are never in sync. The audio has a 2-5sec delay. Using local mode verses remote mode is cumbersome. Doesn't always recognize the camera when logging in causing you hit refresh repeatedly. The camera itself makes a loud click when switching from day time to night time viewing, probably due to the engineers using a relay instead of solid state electronics for the switching. The temperature probe seems to pick up the camera heat and is always a few degrees warmer than the actual room temperature. Some times the audio fails to transmit forcing you to restart the app which can be worrisome at night.
