Let me be clear, LEGIT Ergobaby carriers are fantastic!  The one I purchased from this dealer, however, was a fake.  I never considered it would be a counterfeit until having my second child and looking at new carrier options.  I ran into some how-to posts for identifying fake ERGObaby carriers.  Mine, purchased from this seller, was indeed a counterfeit.I'm not insinuating that the seller knowingly sold counterfeit products.  Perhaps this hasn't been brought to their attention before.  Had I known counterfeiting ERGObaby carriers was such a big business, I would have been more diligent (saving myself $ and regret).  How did I identify it as fake?1.  The label, while close to the ergobaby logo, doesn't bear the "organic" writing or orange leaf.2.  The buckles to not say "stealth".3.  The straps that attach to buckles are black.4.  The warning label, while in the right position, is single language with washing instructions instead of dual language with washing symbols and company address.5.  No serial number in pocket.Please be sure to give this carrier a good look-over before putting your child in it.  If it's fake, return it and report it.
