I've had this bag for the last 7 months. Its been in constant use for about 5 months. I have to say I am disappointed in this bag.  Space wise, it fits everything we need to carry with us for a day or even a weekend away.  However It already has a hole in it from where a handle pulls at the seam when I lift it.  Its definitely not going to last until the munchkin was out of diapers.  Totally bummed.
