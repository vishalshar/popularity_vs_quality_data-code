I had a surprise baby after my twins were born. I had a top of the line twin stroller for my two year old twins and needed something affordable that would fit the twins and the newborn. I ordered this stroller and I was extremely disappointed. Part of it was sticking out of the box when it arrived. It was very heavy to push and as others said, the middle seat is very tight. In addition, it is very hard to push -- it pulls to the left quite significantly. It is worth spending the extra money in order to buy a stroller that is easy to push, and large enough to hold three children as they grow.
