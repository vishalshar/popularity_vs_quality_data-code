I was aware of some of the problem areas other people had pointed out and bought it anyway. In some reviews people said that there is no strap on the bottom of the product, so that it dangles and hits their kids' feet. Well, when I opened the package, it most definitely had a strap on the bottom! The bottom strap is the same kind of clip on strap at the top, and since I rarely have passengers, I don't need to worry about somebody snagging the strap when they sit down or anything.I also own the same sippy cup that's pictured in the cup holder, as well as the car seat I own has two built-in cup holders, so I am not faced with the dilemma of cups falling out.There is no way a toddler still in a car seat (kids under 4) will be able to reach the bottom two areas under the cup holders closest to the floor. That should be common sense right there. In my situation, with my daughter being almost 2 and still in a car seat, she is not able to reach across to the top compartments unless she wiggles her way out of the car seat straps, which she is good at doing anyway. So I have her favorite toys all stored in the top mesh compartment, and can easily reach them to give them to her while driving. The cup holders on the organizer will probably end up holding snacks or other small accessories like socks and shoes.Overall, this is a great thing to have for a child who isn't required to be in a car seat anymore. For children 5 and over this is a great way to keep crayons and toys off the floor, if your child can be conditioned to remember to put stuff back in the organizer!
