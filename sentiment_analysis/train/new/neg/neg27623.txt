This thermometer registard a temp of 96.5 on my child when they were burning up, I used my other thermometer under the arm that takes several minutes and my child had a temp of 103.6.  I have tried this several times and still this one reads much lower.  I have read, read and read the instructions and follow to a T and still the same results.  Spend more money and get a more reliable one.
