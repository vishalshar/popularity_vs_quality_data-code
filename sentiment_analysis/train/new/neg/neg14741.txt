At first, I was thrilled with this- more refills for my diaper genie for less money! They arrived and they fit in the genie- awesome!The issue is that the plastic is thinner than the traditional genie refills. I didn't have any issues with ripping- the problem that the thinness caused is that the plastic slips down too quickly in the genie. Basically, I'd end up with a bag that would have a diaper, long space, then another diaper, and so on. When the genie was full, I'd have to shake this bag full of diapers to get them all to settle together and then decide where to snip off the plastic and tie. And when there are blowout diapers (which is often now that my son is experimenting with solids), it just wasn't worth the mess and effort to save the bag. I think that I ended up being able to dispose of less diapers in these 4 refills than I normally would in 3 refills of the traditional diaper genie bags. And it was much more of a hassle to deal with. I definitely won't buy them again!
