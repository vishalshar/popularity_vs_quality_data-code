I guess I am one of the few people who don't love this nursing pillow. Perhaps it is b/c I used a boppy three years ago with my first child. I purchased this one thinking it would be helpful to be attached to me while I cared for my three year old and infant. I kept knocking into my three year old with the pillow! My infant couldn't get comfy at all on this pillow while nursing. The one thing I did like about it is the storage compartment (pocket) for different things.I bought this b/c my boppy seemed to be a little saggy and had seen better days. But in the end, I returned this and bought a new cover (which I know it doesn't really matter, but personally I think the covers are much nicer (pattern wise, etc.) for the boppy) for my original boppy and it is working great.
