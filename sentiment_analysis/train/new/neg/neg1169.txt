Well its a nice size but its not exactlty as shown in the picture not as sturdy, the instructions are a little hard to understand the changer part you have to make holes yourself to be able to attach it to the bath so thats a little inconvenient the box did come complety open broken up so its definalty not what i expected but it does the job
