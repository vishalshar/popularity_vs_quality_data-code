I bought this for a student at school - we are at that point in the year where funding is low so I purchased this myself out of pocket at the referral of the occupational therapist for a student with a significant problem with chewing on his pencils. From the moment it arrived I couldn't get this to turn on. I put the batteries in correctly, turned the "dial" correctly - it isn't exactly rocket science- but it wouldn't work. I was carrying it  around in my purse "dead" for several days because I'm one of those people who always means to return things, but never actually does, and out of the blue one day my purse starts vibrating on the floor of my bedroom. I discovered this had randomly -magically!- turned on in my purse. So I played with the dial for a little bit, practiced setting the intensity of the vibration and turned it off. Since then, this product has not turned on again. I never actually got around to returning this product, so it is still being carried around in my purse. I'm curious if it will randomly go on again. Hopefully that won't turn out to be an embarrassing situation!Overall, I cannot recommend this product. I am still looking for a similar product for that student.
