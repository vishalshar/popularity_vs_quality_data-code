The idea is very cool.  Installed super easy and fast.  As other reviews have mentioned, it is thin and breaks easily.  The first part to break will be the strap around the headrest.  But with my super dooper handyman skills....I safety pinned it back together.  The outside of the whole item has a frame around it that is tougher so I have the safety pin around that and then into the fabric of the tie.  I did put about 3 or 4 pins on each side.  My son hasn't even noticed the pins and he can't reach them anyways.  I did the other side as a preventative measure.  It probably doesn't look the best, but it works and I have not had a problem since.  The bottom of the item does slide esily too most times.  It is always off a little to one side or the other rather than staying centered.  Okay, the next part to rip is the net.....but luckily that little snap in the middle still makes it usable.  My son keep his sunglasses in there and randon small toys.  He loves it.  And when you are trying to get them loaded up and have full hands, it is so handy just to throw whatever you have (that they insist on you carring of course)in the net, then buckle them up, then take it out of the net and toss it on their lap before closing the door. Even though it is cheap and is 100% guarenteed to break, I would buy it again.  There aren't many options for this and this is descent.  I have it in a midsize SUV (Mitsubishi Endeavor) and it fit great. The next one I get, I will safety pin first as reinforcement so hopefully it never has a chance to really break.  That baby is only 4 months so I have some time still.
