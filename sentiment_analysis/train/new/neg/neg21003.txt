I think this is a very cute toy and a great idea, however, when I put this on the stroller as soon as my daughter touches the monkey's hand the toy falls off.  The whole point of the tail is to wrap it around so it doesn't fall off.  The head is on the heavier side for this toy so it is not really well balanced.  What I did is put velcro on the hands to keep it from falling everytime she touches it.
