This would have been a great accessory for the Tripp Trapp chair were it not for the poorly-chosen material. Apparently, the baby rails sold in Europe are made of wood, whereas the ones available to the U.S. market appear to be some sort of melamine-like plastic. Although it seems very durable, it is surprisingly susceptible to cracking and chipping. We purchased ours about 6 months ago, and numerous small cracks have already developed along the front-facing edge. A small chunk has actually broken off, leaving a sharp-edged notch.If enough customers report this problem to Stokke USA, maybe they will produce an improved version.Follow-up (10/2008): Stokke replaced our baby rail with a new one. The new rail is tougher and seems unlikely to crack. Based on the new rail, I'd rate this product four stars.
