I don't know what world this is considered easy to clean in, but once my daughter started feeding herself if was over. There's creases and crevices all over the chair. The arms, the post between the legs, the buckles for the straps.. To really thoroughly clean this chair I have to take it apart with a screw driver. Not fun, not fast, not easy.Five washes in the machine and the chair cover was shredded, too.I'm in the market for a new chair. My daughter is ten months, began eating in chair at five months.. So five months of use and this chair is done.
