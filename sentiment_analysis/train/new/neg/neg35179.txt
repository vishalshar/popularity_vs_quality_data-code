I'm giving this two stars instead of one because I simply think it is super cute, however, I'm not sure if this bag is for every day use.  The material seemed great until I looked at handle to the bag and it is shredding.  I'm hoping it's just defective and NOT because of wear and tear considering it's February 28th and I bought it at the beginning of January.  I'm so sad because I LOVE this bag and soo many compliments on it.
