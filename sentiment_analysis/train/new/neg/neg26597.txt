I understand why people love there Ergo, but for me it's just too big. I could never get it tight enough and always felt like my baby was falling out. I'm 5' 105lbs. I could not get the shoulder straps buckled without strain and my husband couldn't get it to buckle at all and he's a yogi who can do a reverse prayer. We are returning it today. I got a very nice padded Mai Tai instead that's fully adjustable and perfect for my build.
