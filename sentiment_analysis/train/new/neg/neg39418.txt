I was so excited to get this for my son.  It looks cute, the colors are great, the animals are fun, the price was great...BUT it's just too short.  I'd put my son on the mat, but the animals were so low, it seemed like they were attacking him.  He didn't have to reach for them, they were already on his face.  I thought maybe I was putting up the bars wrong (although the instructions were simple for how to put it up), but I tried several changes, and it still didn't work.  The mat itself is a little on the small side, too.  Next time I'll be getting something taller and bigger.
