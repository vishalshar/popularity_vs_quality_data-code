I ordered this on a Wednesday, it arrived that Friday, and it broke on Sunday. It's cheap, brittle plastic. Despite the hinge break, just enough remains for me able to use this, it is a good size. And there is no way on Earth my 15 month old could break into it, although every time I turn the lock it feels like the whole safe is going to break into pieces. But that hinge is going to snap all of the way off pretty soon, so I went out to my local hardware store and bought a toolbox. The closures are secure, more secure that this safe, and I have the option to add a small padlock when my son gets older. It cost $12. And the medicine safe? I use to to store cosmetics. Well, until it finally falls apart, which won't be long.
