It's a bit early to review the actual product, as we've only had it for two days and my daughter hasn't quite warmed to it yet.  She seemed interested the first night, not so much yesterday.  I'll post an updated review once she's had a chance to really use the product, but in the mean time, I can say that it was simple to assemble and that the quality appears to be good.That said, I need to point out that Amazon's battery information is incorrect.  This item does NOT use 4 D batteries.  It requires 1 D and 3 AAs.  I had purchased 4 D batteries, since they're not included with the product; once it arrived, my husband and I were scrambling to scrounge up the AAs from various other devices so that she could actually use it.Edited to add:I downgraded this from 4 stars to 3 now that it's become clear that my daughter really doesn't have any interest in it.  It's too bad, because it seems like a nice enough product:  no complaints about the design, appearance, quality, etc.  But no matter how many times we tried, she never really got into it.  She would kick, the seat would move and the music would play, but she always had this bored expression, like she was just killing time until we gave her something better to do.  I can't really fault the product, but I can't say it was a winner for us.  We're packing it away in the hopes that our next baby enjoys it more.
