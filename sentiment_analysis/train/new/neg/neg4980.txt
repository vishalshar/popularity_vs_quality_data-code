I thought it was really cute looking but we never got much use out of it. My little man didn't really like it when he was first born. I think it overwhelmed him and he was much happier hanging out on a plain blanket with no toys overhead. He started crawling really early so by the time he was ok with all stuff overhead he was big enough to crawl away from it. It never really held his intrest. Overall it is a cute product and there is nothing wrong with it but it wasn't very useful for my child.
