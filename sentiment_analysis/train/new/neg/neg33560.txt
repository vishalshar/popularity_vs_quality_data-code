Love this hiking bag but the large compartment in the back came with the zipper broken before we were even able to use it. I unpacked the item the day of our hike and as I went to pack it up I noticed the back zipper was broken. That was very inconvenient because I kept having to check and make sure my daughters snacks and diapers were not falling out. I had to use the storage because I had no other place to put her stuff so it sucked having to keep making sure nothing was falling out.
