I bought this knowing it was cheap, and I figured I would give it a shot. I do believe it would work fine, it just didn't work well for what I was using it for. I desired it for quick accurate measurements of woodworking items. It feels cheap, and is cheap so you can't expect much more than that. My biggest complaint is I could never get it to turn off. I would turn it off, and it seemed like setting it down would kick it back on. So it drained my battery. It comes with another so I tossed that in to drain it again. When measuring, it never quite seemed to settle in on a true measurement which was also frustrating. After about a week I ended up getting frustrated and I tossed it against something and haven't seen it since. It's jumpy, never turns off, and is cheap. If you could live with that then buy it. If not, buy something more than 20 bucks. After all it is a precision measuring tool. And precision never is done well cheaply.
