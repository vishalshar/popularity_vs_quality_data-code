These liners work fine.  They really help keep my baby's bottom feeling dry by wicking away moisture.  I noticed some other reviews saying that they're thin or that it's like expecting 1 layer of cotton to absorb any amount of liquid.  These are NOT meant to absorb urine, they're just meant to be a "stay dry" liner.  That means you need an absorbent layer underneath...an insert, prefold, flat, etc.  I thought that might be confusing for some people new to cloth diapers.  My only complaint is that I find them to be too narrow. I use these at night and to get adequate coverageI've had to use 2 side by side.
