We have two different silverware sets from Sugarbooger.  While the design on the first set has held up, many of the letters on this particular set have scraped off both the spoon and fork.  I'm not sure why or how this has happened as we handwash them with a soft sponge.  Other than the design coming off (is this to give them a true vintage look?!?), they are great.  We use them daily as I find the size and shape satisfactory for my toddler.  While others have complained about the size of the spoon, I find it works especially well with soups and cereals.  While the food "hides" in spoons with a deeper curve and less seems to be emptied in the mouth, this spoon comes out completely empty.  I imagine it could be more messy getting to the mouth but we haven't really seen too much of an issue there.  I just wish the design would have lasted more than the several months we've owned them as this is a cute set.
