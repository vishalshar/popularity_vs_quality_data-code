Bought for my second son when he was potty training.  I loved how it looks like a regular toilet and amkes the flushing sound, but it is big and bulky.  I put it in my bathroom to he would get used to "going" in the bathroom and it took up way to much floor space.  Was a pain to clean since uring went under the collection bowl.  Had way to many small parts that made it difficult to clean.  We were never able to get it truely clean.  Finally just bought a step stool and he used to "big boy potty".  Maybe just a problem for the boys sine they are built differently.
