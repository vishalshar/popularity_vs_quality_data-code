The leaking with this cup is simply terrible, and it seems to have a mind of its own.  It doesn't necessarily leak when you tip it over.  It leaks AS SOON AS YOU PUT LIQUID IN IT AND CLOSE THE TOP.  It just oozes milk everywhere.  We are so careful about making sure the straw parts are positioned carefully, but it still leaks.It leaks less if you only fill it halfway, but that is so little milk.I am still searching for a good insulated cup that doesn't leak, but I haven't found it yet...Edited 4/17/10: We recently took this cup back out to use with plain water, and we've been fine with it.  I'm not sure whether that's because water leaks aren't as noticeable as milk leaks, or if it's something else.  When we used this cup with milk we'd often put it in the fridge or in an insulated container with an ice pack for travel, and I wonder whether making the outside of it cold was what caused the milk to ooze up through the straw on its own (no idea about the physics of these things).Anyway, used recently with plain water we've been fine with this cup.  The only negative of it as a straw cup is that the child has to tip the cup to get the liquid out once the liquid level goes down, which teaches the child to tip cups with straws.  With regular straws they actually need to keep the cup down to get the liquid, so it's just kind of opposite of regular straws.
