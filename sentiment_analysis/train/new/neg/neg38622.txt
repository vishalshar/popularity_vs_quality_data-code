When baby starts pulling up I am not sure how this is going to stay on. The Velcro keeps it on for the time being but I am thinking some ties might keep it more secure.Update: baby is now 16 months old and when he's acting silly, he does sometimes pull it partially off, but it still protects finish on the crib rail, as evidenced by the teeth marks immediately to the left and right of the cover! :p
