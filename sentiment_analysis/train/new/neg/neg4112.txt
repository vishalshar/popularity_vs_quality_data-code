This thing is entirely too quiet.  The timer is neat, but in the end it is terrible at the one thing it is supposed to do - play sound.  The ocean sound, sounds almost exactly like the white noise.  The music is dinky.  The white noise set on the loudest setting is so quiet that it hardly competes with the air conditioner. Having read "The Happiest Baby on the Block" I know that the sound needs to be quite loud to get through to a screaming baby.  It is also quite a bit larger than it appears online (the main part is about the size of my whole hand). I would not buy it again.  Just download a free sleep sound app like "Relax Sounds" instead.
