My baby's head was no longer moving from side to side, but it just came right off of the car seat when she sleeps. We had them with the infant car seat for a while until our pediatrician saw and told us to take them out for a safety reason (since it was not tested with the carseat, so it can compromise the safety feature of the carseat itself).
