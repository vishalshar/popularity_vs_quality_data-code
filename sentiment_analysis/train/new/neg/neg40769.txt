I bought this to use in my daughter's room as a nice hamper to go with her pink room but the product quite desapointing for the job. The sides are thin so it warps easy, I ended up using it for her stuffed animals and had to go back to the old mesh hamper, it does an OK job with the toys but it wasn't what I needed. The quality is regular towards OK, it didn't work for loading with lots of clothes, it bends easy. I bought another one for my son's room and that one is much better quality, I'm talking about the Rubbermaid one with blue inside liner. I wish they had that one in pink polka dots.
