We use this tote to bring our daughter's bottles to daycare.  It's a good design, but falls short in a couple of key ways.Pros:It's a good size, and the compartments are well thought out.  We use one of the Medela ice packs and Dr. Browns 4- and 8-ounce bottles.  You can very easily get 6 of the 4-ounce bottles in there with the ice pack, plus all the nipples and inserts in the top compartment, and still have room for a little Tupperware container of solids, yogurt, etc.  The strap is a good length to carry with all of the rest of your baby gear.  And let's face it--the bright green color helps make sure you don't forget it after a bleary-eyed night.Cons:Very quickly (within a month or so), the white vinyl lining started to come apart from the interior of the bag, which was disappointing.  But more problematic is that the lining isn't made to be detachable--this is a bag made for carrying milk, and milk is going to get spilled (i.e., from the "empty" bottles you're bringing home at the end of the day) and then spoiled inside the bag.  You really need an insert of some kind that can be washed or discarded.We ended up using gallon-sized Ziploc bags, but it's not a perfect solution, since you won't be able to seal them, and you'll still get spills.  Using them (or another plastic liner) just slows the degradation of the interior--it won't prevent it.It just falls short, despite its other good features.  Haven't found something better yet, though.
