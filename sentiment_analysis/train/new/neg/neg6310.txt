Awful quality and design in stark contrast to something like the Bugaboo's travel system.  The Bugaboo is a simple drop in, click, and then click the car seat right in.  Because they are trying to be Universal, it isn't ideal for any single brand.  Our Graco Snugride fits and is safe, but it's wobbly.  Putting the adapter in place also works, but it's just not as simple as the Bugaboo's drop in.  It takes two hands, you have to align each side (right and left) and then put a strap over the top.I'm sure at some point the company will make individual car seat adapters for the various brands.  Until then, this travel system feels like a cheap shortcut.  We debated about returning it immediately after we first tried it.  Unfortunately, a travel system is very convenient so we're stuck with trying to make this work.  It really is disappointing, especially considering how much we love our BJCS.
