I'm writing this review 2 years after purchasing.  My son is now 2.5 years old.  This changing table does what it says it will.  However, it's VERY poorly designed and was a nightmare to put together.  I recently spent an afternoon rebuliding and reinforcing the changing dresser/chest.  I'm an engineer and ensure you that it was intially installed correctly.Since there are only 4 legs and the dresser is rather long, the middle of the bottom support sags over time.  After initial construction, if you move the piece of furniture it will continually get weaker due to it's poor construction.  Eventually it will sag enough to break the ONE bolt that holds it on there.  As it sags, the dresser door won't shut correctly and the dresser drawers will now appear at a 45 degree angle.  Also, if you overfill the cabinet, the back particle board will break through the screws and further weaken the cabinet.My wife takes pride in how she decorates the rooms, and this piece of furniture looked bad no matter what we did to it. The drawers were at a 45 degree angle and the cabinet door wouldn't shut correctly due to the sagging nature, cheap particle wood, and lack of correct support underneath the middle of the chest.To fix it, I purchased wood and wood screws.  The back is held together with very thin particle board and I replaced that.  I also had to place 6 new screws along the bottom front to hold the underlying base of the dresser up, thus preventing the large amount of sag.  The perpendicular column that creates a divider between the drawers and the cabinet also needed reinforcement with screws along the top and bottom.  It was held on cheaply with a few dowel rods (Not nearly enough).Unless you're willing to reinforce this thing and modify it as you're building it, I would stay FAR away.  I would've been better off and saved a lot of time and effort buying a better quality changing table.
