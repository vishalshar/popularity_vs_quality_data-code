These do a decent job of cleaning, but they are not authentic Sunshine Polishing Cloths. If you want a superior cloth that will thoroughly clean tiny crevices and really "dirty" metals in short order...this isn't it.  Try "Elements Sunshine Polishing Cloths". Those are the real deal. Authentic Sunshine cloths are denser, have more cleaning product contained within the cloth and turn absolutely black after using. Unlike these, they continue to still clean well, after they have blackened. They remove tarnish so well, you actually need to use gloves. If not, your hands will become very dirty.I've been buying Sunshine cloths for a few years, since I wear a lot of unplated silver jewelry. When I saw this trio at their asking price, I immediately purchased thinking I was getting a great deal. I got what I paid for. These  work fine for average cleaning jobs, but if you want a superior cleaning cloth, try the Elements. Trust me on this one.
