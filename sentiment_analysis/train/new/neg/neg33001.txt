I bought two of these latches for the glass doors on our entertainment center.  The backing on these latches seemed very sticky and the latch that we placed on the tall glass doors out of our baby's reach has worked perfectly.  The latch we placed on the lower doors under the TV have been a problem.  Our baby (13 months old) used all her weight and hung on the latch until it came off the glass.  We replaced the latch, but she keeps pulling on the latch until it comes off.  I don't think the latch is defective at all, but it would probably take a latch screwed into something to keep her out. No tape backing can be expected to hold up to a 20 pound baby hanging on it.
