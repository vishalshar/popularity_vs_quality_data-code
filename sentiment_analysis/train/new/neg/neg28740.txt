i wasn't sure what to expect with this stroller since i wasn't able to test drive it before i purchased, but i thought i would take the plunge because i liked all the features. i got the step up board, shopping basket, and tray.i was surprised at the size of the stroller. it is big. i'm 5'7" and i think it's the right size for my height. i would hesitate if you are much shorter.  the quality is very good. i was pleasantly surprised by its nice construction and quality materials. the step up board is for my 40lb, 5 yr old son. he absolutely loves it. the stroller is heavy.. a friend commented it is the range rover of strollers. it takes up a lot of trunk space. i have a volvo suv and have little room for anything else. you definitely can push this stroller with one hand. i like the high weight capacity for this stroller; we even use it for my son when he falls asleep.all in all, if you have the trunk space and you are tall enough and strong enough (to get the stroller in and out of your car), feel confident in ordering.  we got the peg perego aria as a backup stroller which we keep in the car now (because it was a real pain lifting the stroller), and keep this one in our house for walks. now i'm happy.
