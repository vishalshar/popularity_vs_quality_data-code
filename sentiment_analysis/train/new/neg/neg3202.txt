This spoon arrived in a small sealed plastic bag, labeled merely "Children Giraffe feeding spoon."  There was no brochure or any product information from Reed & Barton.  No box.  No presentation.  The back of the spoon does say "Reed&Barton" but shows no indication that it is silver-plate.  I went to the Reed&Barton website (now part of Lenox) and looked at their children's spoons.  The giraffe spoon is no longer among them.  Perhaps it was an older pattern?  The current spoons are actually nickel plated in this price range.  Which leads me to believe that this spoon is not silver-plated but nickel plated.  It is a nice enough spoon and will make a nice gift, but nevertheless, I believe in truth in advertising.  Shouldn't this spoon come with a Reed & Barton insert declaring that it is silver-plated?  There may have been an older version that was silver plated, but I do not believe this is it!
