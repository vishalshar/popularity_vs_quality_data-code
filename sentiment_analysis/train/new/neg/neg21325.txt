Seems like a good car seat but the description says it can fit a newborn with min weight of 5 lbs. false! My baby was born 6lbs 10oz and the seat belt is so bulky and offers no head support that it could strangles newborn child. I had to impulsively buy a regular rear facing car seat with a base 2 days after she was born because after leaving the hospital with my newborn in the Diono I knew she was not secure to continue to ride to her doctor appointments safely.
