This works well to help my wife put our son down to sleep.  BUT, it's a pretty white light.  For anyone who understands circadian rhythms, melatonin release, and preventing stimulation, you need to 'remove' all 'blue light' sources prior to bedtime.  So, this is solely used so my wife can see and then shut off prior to putting the big guy down.That said, it's not as intense (bright/luminous) as the alternatives we've found.  We've been using 'sleep inducing' lighting at night in primary lamps, but those bulbs are too bright to try to put him down with.  Still searching for a true 'red light'  solution for night time.  In the meantime, I may try to disassemble this and place some orange kapton over the LED.
