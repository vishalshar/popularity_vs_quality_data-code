The wood is very lightweight poplar... This is to be expected for such a inexpensive piece. But still, $300 is $300. I would have been okay with things if it were not for the cheap hardware. I had about 3 of the turn and lock mechanisms break on me and had to go the the hardware store to purchase additional screws which will probably do a better job anyhow. Some of the screw actually popped through the finish when tightened with the turn and lock mechanisms.The directions were actually good (if the correct numbers were on every piece - which they were not).Overall I think $100 - $150 is the true worth of this do it yourself Armoire. HAs a nice look... but wouldn't buy again or would use different hardware.
