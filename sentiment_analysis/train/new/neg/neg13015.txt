I returned this lamp.  The lamp cord had a warning attached.......there was lead in and on the cord....after touching the cord (which anyone needed to do to turn on the lamp) you had TO WASH YOUR HANDS!  Around the visible light bulb there was also a label with a warning which you could not remove. What a horrible children's product!
