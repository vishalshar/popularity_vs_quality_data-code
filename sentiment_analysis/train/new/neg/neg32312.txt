Last 3 years, I had two of these products, one three year ago and one recently.  I liked the design, color, easy set up.  It WAS right hight and tallness for a toddler. And dark blue color was perfect match for my son's room.  My younger son is transitioning from crip to bed, so I needed another pair.  I ordered same product from amazon, which arrived fast.  However the product has changed, and different than picture here.  First, the color is no longer dark blue as in the photo, it is very light blue.  Second, the design addedd a zipper to secure the fabric, which is very low quality and I am not sure how long it will stand to the task.  Third, the rails are shorter now versus the prior versions.  And there is some changes on fastening system as well.  On top, quality of the fabric is down, now it feels very plasticy and thin. All in all, the product quality is down, but the price is up more than 30% versus what I paid last time.
