This stroller is very attractive, but don't be fooled.  It is cheaply made and poorly designed.  The folding mechanism isn't lined up properly, so I have to pull - HARD - the two sides of the handle apart from each other while twisting the release.  It always takes me several tries to get it to twist and release the stroller.  Then, once it is finally folded, there's no hook to keep it folded, and it doesn't stand on end.  These are REALLY basic features that even super cheap strollers have, so why not this one?  It is a serious pain in the butt to fold and stow this stroller, so I definitely don't recommend it for the car or if you have very little storage space at home.But the real kicker for me is the harness... it would only contain a very large/older kid.  My 38-inch tall 2.5 year old isn't even big enough for this harness, I don't see how you could possibly buckle in a baby safely.  I have the straps (shoulder and crotch) tightened as far as they will go, and they flop over my son's body.  If he decides he wants out of the stroller, he just pulls the straps aside and climbs right out.I rarely leave bad reviews, but the depth of my hatred for this stroller inspired me to do so this time.  I got this because I wanted a lightweight/compact stroller for my car that had a large, easily-accessible basket.  The basket is great, but this stroller is NOT lightweight, or compact, or user-friendly.  Spend your money on something else.
