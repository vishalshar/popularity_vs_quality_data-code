The sale on September 17th dropped this carrier significantly in price. It was still sold by Amazon, not a third party. I received it and contacted Ergobaby to verify validity, as several things were a little 'off' about the packaging. This verification included seven pictures of the carrier.  They verified that it was counterfeit and not a genuine Ergobaby carrier, which could potentially be unsafe.They did confirm that Amazon was supposed to be an authorized retailer and that they will look into the issue.
