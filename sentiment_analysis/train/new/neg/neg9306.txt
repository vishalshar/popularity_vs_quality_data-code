My daughter sucks her thumb so much she has severely damaged her thumb with blisters and sores. When I came across this product, I was excited in thinking that this would be the product that would assist with the idea of her stopping the thumb sucking. After reading the reviews, I purchased two of them. One for the right thumb and one for the left.Once it arrived I automatically put them on her. One of the reasons why I chose to purchase this product was due to the idea that it was "child proof" meaning that it would be hard for babies/toddlers to take them off because it has a secure latch.Boy was I wrong. My 18 month baby pulled them off instantly. Even with the secure latch in place she was able to take them off using her teeth. It didn't matter how tight I secured them.I am very upset with the product since I paid roughly $60 dollars for both and she barely kept them on.
