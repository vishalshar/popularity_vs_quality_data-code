Not very accurate at all!!!! at first I liked it but after about 2 days it was giving a different reading on the same ear, as well as the forehead and temple. not by a degree or two, more like 20 to 50 degree difference. Not a good choice if your looking for a thermometer for your children. I am Sorry but I cannot recommend this particular product at all.
