My son is 5 weeks old now.  I really wanted to love this, but the biggest problem, as others have posted, is the changing table.  I think if you were using the changing feature only when you traveled occasionally it would suffice; however, to use it regularly is no good.  It is too low in height.  My husband (6 foot) literally threw his back out after using this for a week.  I am 5 ft 5 in and it is also too low for me to change him comfortably.  With a newborn, you are using your lower back constantly.  It is also true, as others have mentioned, that the baby rolls to the one side when using the changing table (and I used a leveler to check).  Otherwise, the portable bassinet with stand is great--very functional for our multilevel vertical city home.  We also use the bassinet portion of the pack and play often (the opposite side of the changing table). I have removed the mat and handwashed it easily (due to spit-up) and it dries quickly.  The vibrating feature is nice, the baby likes it.  The mp3 player speaker does not work and there has been no time to investigate this further.  The entire system is nicely made, durable and stylish looking. For approx. $200 you get a separate bassinet (which if you look at other bassinets this size online go for approx.$75-100) and you get a bassinet in the top of the pack and play and then you get the playpen aspect when the baby is older; so overall it is a good value.  I think it is lame that the insert doesn't come out and you can't have the baby lay parallel to the length of the pack and play like other models allow.  So, bottom line, you can either buy this product alone for $200 or buy a regular pack and play for $100 and a separate bassinet for $100.
