This bib catches food and juice in the plastic compartment at the bottom of the bib it's very colorful which all kids and parents love but its not thick and absorbent enough in my opinion once it gets wet you have to get another bib because no child likes something cold and wet on them.Of course all bibs need to be changed after a while but not soon as your child spits up or makes a mess. I would stick with this bib if it was a little thicker because the colors are great and the designs are exciting on the eye.
