I purchased this along with a SkipHop Diaper Bag prior to having my first child.  The pattern is cute and fun, but other than that this product isnt really useful. The only thing I ever really use is the bottle carrier.  My son didnt take a pacifier, so the pouch became a coin holder, and you get wipes containers everytime you purchase wipes so I now have enough to open my own business. The laminated zip case became a catch all and the diaper holder only holds 4 diapers (which when do you only need 4 diapers when you go out)? I'm just going to chalk this purchase up to the one of the many products 1st time parents buy but dont really need.
