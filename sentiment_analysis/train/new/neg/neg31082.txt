This concept is awesome and would get five stars if it worked the way it should.  It gives great peace of mind to be able to check your baby while you drive.  As the other reviews state, the mirror does has a tendency to fog up.  Mine did in one corner within the first week.  If it gets any worse, I will have to contact the company.
