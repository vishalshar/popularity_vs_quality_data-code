My twins are almost one year old, and they love baby rattles and soft toys that make noise.  Upon first opening the box, I was surprised at how large the Parrot Ball Toy was.  It's not quite a soccer ball, but larger than a softball.  I'd guess 6-8" in diameter.  My daughter especially loves to chew on soft 'flaps', so I figured she would love the wings on the Owl.  Both kids were excited by a new toy, but I think it was just a bit too large to drag around the house in their mouth, or sit and chew on, or swing around like a rattle.The back of the toy is also a bit drab.  All the color is on the front of the toy, and even then, when choosing between the almost earth tones of the Owl or something bring and vibrant, the more vibrant toy seems to catch their eye.  They still play with the Owl a little bit, but more in the 'let's see what happens when I pick this up and immediately throw it' type of play.
