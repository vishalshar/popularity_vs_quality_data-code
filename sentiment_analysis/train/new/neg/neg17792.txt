I purchased this item for my daughter whose school required them for mandatory naptime.  The price was a little better than those they offered ;however, in hindsight, I would have been better off just paying the extra for theirs.  Evidently they have already gone through many of the mats out there and found one that keeps it's shape and doesn't peel - which this one had both problems.  Cute design and handy carrying strap.  She likes it and isn't worried about above issues.  Easy to clean in the washer which we do a few times a month.
