This was a Xmas gift for my nephew, 8 months. This toy is larger than you'd expect from the product pictures, which is a great thing! There's a lot to keep him busy... Four teething rings, crinkly feet, a slight jingle bell, rotating head, and a 'mirror' on his belly.The one issue on the toy I received is that the seam on the robots neck was already busted when I received this, exposing the inner stuffing (I'll post the pic). Look at all the seams when you receive yours to make sure it's safe! We had to sew it on the morning after Xmas so he wouldn't hurt himself :(
