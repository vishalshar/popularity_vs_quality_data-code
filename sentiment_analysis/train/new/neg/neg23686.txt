I want to love this sleepsack. I love other halo products and have used them with 3 of my 4 kids now. I bought this for #4 and it just doesn't work. She is a little Houdini so was able to get her arms out of this one several times. I use the velcro swaddle blankets and those keep her secure. I love that you can use this as a regular sleepsack when baby isn't swaddling anymore but it just didn't work as a swaddle blanket for us. Also, I've found that Halo Sleepsacks are huge! My almost 3 year old is currently using a 6-12 months one (he is really small granted and it is getting small on him) so I assumed that would be the case with this one. Unfortunately this one isn't extra long like they're others. I went with newborn because my 2 month old is small, not even 10 lbs so I figured the small would drown her. Now I worry that by the time she'll sleep unswaddled that this will be too short on her. Too bad, since I love halo products.
