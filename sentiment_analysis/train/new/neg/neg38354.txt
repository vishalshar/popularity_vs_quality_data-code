It was hard to tell exactly what these were going to be like until I got them and opened the package.  They are just a flexible mesh attached to a stretching plastic lining.  You stretch the thing out, stick it on the window, and then the stretchiness releases and it sticks to the window.  At first I thought they were great because I stuck one on the window and it stayed put for about a month.  Since then, I've never had that kind of success again.  It usually doesn't even last all day.  The good thing is that it's soft so when it falls and hits the baby it doesn't hurt him... still, having a toddler playing with this thing makes me a little nervous because of the plastic.  I think it's a low risk of injury, but I can imagine maybe a suffocation risk in an extreme circumstance.  Even if playing with this product is safe, the fact remains that a kid with this shade in his lap is still getting blasted in the face with light.Another major issue in my vehicle (ford edge) that I think would be the case in other vehicles as well, is that the rear window is divided with a separate part towards the back that doesn't go up and down.  When the kid is rear facing, that window is a major source of light in the face, and this product can not be used to cover that window at all.
