We are on our 2nd child. We got rid of our free standing high chair for a space saver.  We originally were using a fisher price space saver but didn't like that it did not have a snap on tray cover (for easy washing).  We ordered this instead.  We have had it for 2 days and realize it is cheeeaaappp.  The fabric is paper thin and moves around so much it makes getting a kid in and out a nightmare.  Get a better one!  This one isn't it.
