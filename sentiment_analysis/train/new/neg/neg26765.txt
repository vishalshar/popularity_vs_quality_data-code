I bought this for my Graco pack and play and it did not fit at all after I washed it.  I washed it on cold/cold and then placed it in the dryer for a couple hours under very low heat and it still shrunk.  It looks like it is thick and would provide waterproof protection but is useless for the pack and play as it doesn't fit.  I can't return it because I threw out all the packaging, thinking it would fit with no problem.  I guess I'll be using it as a small blanket for my little one to lay on the carpet in the living room...
