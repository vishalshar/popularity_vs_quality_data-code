Got these today, and they are alright, they are not quite as nice as they look in the picture.They are little material and cardboard bins that fold out, and they have pink material inserts with cardboard separators that go in the bins to create the sections.Could just be mine but my inserts do not really fit properly, but in the end the job gets done. I suppose having the removable inserts is nice if anything spills in there.They are alright but keep in mind you get what you pay for and they are only $9. I will use them, but am keeping my eye out for something a bit sturdier.
