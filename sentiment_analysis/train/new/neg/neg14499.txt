The problem  with the Possitioner is that the arrow arrived( due to the packaging)  broken  in the middle, so  it  is not  possibleto hang up propperly the toys for our baby to play. Also,when we assambled  the  broken arrow,it stays in a position very dangerous! Our baby traying to reach the  toys, almost fall down to the floor. The  broken  arrow stays in 45 grades instead of 90 grades,that is the distance that  allows babies to seat  propperly with  their back in the right  position when  they play with the  hangging  toys, whithout the risk of falling  towards with  their heads to the floor.
