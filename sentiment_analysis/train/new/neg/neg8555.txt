Looks awesome but when using, it seems to not allow the powder to slide out of the container without you having to bump the spout into the bottle from every direction possible before you can get ALL the powder into the baby bottle. When the other one I use is in the dishwasher or being cleaned, I use this as a backup. Also, there is no click or divot in the plastic so you have to eyeball if you are between servings (there are 3 sections to this product) and sometimes in the middle of the night, this can be very hard to do. I have spilled powder with this more than a few times.
