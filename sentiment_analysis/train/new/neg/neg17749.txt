I hate this thing. Every time I have to use it, I complain to my husband how much I hate it. It's too small, I can never fit all of my son's things in it, so I have a clip on bag that hangs off the side to hold his food, bib, spoon and snack. The most annoying part about it is the SQUEAKING! The clasp that attaches the shoulder strap to the bag squeak, squeak squeaks with every step. And I don't want to put WD-40 or any other lubricant on it for fear it will rub off on our clothes while carrying it. Wish I would have sent it back right after I got it.
