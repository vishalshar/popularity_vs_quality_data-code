Although I like the print on this bedset the material was disappointing. The quilt is not very soft at all so my 2 year old daughter doesnt even use it. The fitted sheet and top sheet tho are better and adorable. Even tho I didn't love this product, it is quite a bit cheaper than any other princess bed sets I found so I guess y ou get what you pay for. Shipping also took an entire week longer than the estimated shipping date. Hope this was helpful.
