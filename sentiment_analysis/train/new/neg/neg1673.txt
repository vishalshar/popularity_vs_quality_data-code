I really wanted to love Charlie Banana. The diapers are super soft and cute. But the fit is just too bulky/awkward. My daughter is 6 months old, long and skinny for her age. I have the elastic on the small setting and the diaper is just so bulky she couldn't even grab her toes which she loves to do. It was especially bulky in the front as other reviewers pointed out. It looks like when she is a bit older and bigger they will fit much better, so I'm setting them aside for when she's around a year old. But disappointed I couldn't get more use out of these! I'll stick with BumGenius until then which is a much trimmer fit.
