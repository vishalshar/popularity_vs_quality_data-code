This bag held up to 18 prefold diapers with a few covers, and the handle stayed in tact beautifully-- despite the weight. The smell of the diapers seeped through on occasion, which was unfortunate. After 2 months of use, the zipper pull ripped off. The zipper always felt weak, and most likely why the smell leaked. The quality is perhaps why the price is cheaper. I am currently on amazon now in search of a better wet bag.
