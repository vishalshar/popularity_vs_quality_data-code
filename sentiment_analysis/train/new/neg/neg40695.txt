Despite good intentions by Safety 1st, this seat is a flop.Yes, the seat MIGHT raise your child into a proper position for using your vehicle's seat belt (there are too many variables to be certain as children come in even more different shapes and sizes than do vehicles), but this seat is incredibly hard and uncomfortable to sit on.  My 9 year old child weighs 82 pounds and started complaining that his "bum" hurt within a few miles of our home, and he's not one to complain.As far as belt positioning, the seat correctly positioned the lap portion of the belt, but the shoulder portion of the belt still dug into his neck.  Also of note, your child will have to unhook one of the belt positioners (whichever side is closest to the seat belt buckle) each and every time they get out of the seat, and then hook it back on each and every time they buckle themselves into the seat.  Keep your child's age/needs/capabilities in mind when considering this seat.If it helps anyone, I used this seat in the second row bucket seat of a 2015 Chevy Traverse.  The seat fit well in the car and the dark gray color matched my gray cloth seats well.  Had it been semi-comfortable for my child to use, I would've kept it and rated it 4 stars (minus 1 for the constant connecting/disconnecting of the seat belt to the seat as well as not addressing the shoulder portion of the seat belt).  Thanks to Amazon's free returns policy on this item, I'll be mailing it back and getting a refund.
