We bought this frame specifically for traveling. We did not want to take our larger, primary stroller with us when we were flying somewhere (or on long car journeys) and as we would need to have a car seat with us it seemed to make sens to get this base unit.It works very well as a travel stroller. It's very easy to fold/unfold and install/remove the car seat. While the ride is not as smooth as the larger stroller, junior does not seem to be disturbed by any jostling. It's very light and easy to lug around an airport.On the downside, it does not steer particularly well and performs poorly on cobblestones (I also won't plan on using it during the Winter when things get snowy). The basket is large but not very accessible when the car seat is in place. The cup holders are useless, so just ditch them. It is on the short side so may not be well suited to taller parents.Overall I would definitely recommend it for traveling but probably not for prolonged use as the main stroller.
