I really liked it, but unfortunately, my 8.5 month old son did not.  He cried every time.I think it may have been too much of a shock to go from a firm mattress in a regular crib to a soft thinner mattress on the ground.I think the product is really well made, but I guess we're back to the PNP for travel!
