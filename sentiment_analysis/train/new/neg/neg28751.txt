This cover is not good quality.  The adjustable strap does not stay in place because it is not thick enough. The ends are not even stitched together. There is no wire or anything to allow the collar to be adjusted to view the baby while also keeping it in place.  The biggest issue is that the bow looks nothing like the one in the picture.  The picture makes it look much nicer, the one on the actual cover cheapens the look. (The bow looks like those on other nursing cover designs made by Trend Lab.  Picture for Perfectly Preppy is misleading.) Also the color in the picture does not match.  The green is actually more of a yellowish-lime green, not dark green.  I would not waste money on this product; you can get a better cover from big box stores for the same price. I may just use the fabric for something else and buy another nursing cover from elsewhere.
