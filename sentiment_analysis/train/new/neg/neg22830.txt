What was not clear to me from the picture or product description or other non-Amazon sources regarding this seat, is that the sides of the seat are several inches wider than the base.If you are like me, you are looking at this product because you need a narrow booster and are trying to get 3 kids across the back seat. I have a chicco fit 30 and a diono radian 100 in the back of a 2009 subaru forester. That should have left me plenty of room for the advertised 14.5 inches wide booster in between, but it didn't, due to the wider upper part of the booster.  Add to that the issue of pulling the seat belt thru the gap in the sides, and it was very hard to get my son strapped into this seat while it was in between the other two seats.I had only a little trouble installing it - but getting him into it was a challenge. I am told that if I put the booster on one of the outside positions (behind the driver, optimally), I would have an easier time. But then I would have to use the middle seat belt to attach a latch-enabled car seat in the middle position where there is no latch hook available. Like most people, I am not very successful at attaching car seats via seat belt (I think that is why the LATCH was invented - it makes it easy to install car seats correctly). I don't want to have to go to DMV every time I have to re-install my car seats.Don't tell me -- I know -- get a mini van.
