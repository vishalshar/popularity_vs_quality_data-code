I bought these to put on the corner of the window sill so that my 1 year old twins wouldn't hit their heads. While they work pretty well and are still in place, my boys have completely destroyed them with their teeth. I realize that this isn't exactly an issue with the product as much my children but maybe the manufacturer could look into other materials that can't be eaten a easily :/
