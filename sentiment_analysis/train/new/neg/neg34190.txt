I bought this for a full sized mattress after being very happy with the bassinet and crib covers for several years. However upon opening this, I was immediately hit in the face with a strong chemical smell that wasn't present with my earlier purchases. I was weary of what might have been done to the product post manufacturing since my earlier purchases were sold directly by Naturepedic on Amazon and this full sized was sold by Aidleyco. I was also disappointed with the stiff feel and scratchy backing. So I ordered the fitted version for 20 dollars more that is knit with jersey cotton on both sides to compare. The first, unfitted one came in a cheap plastic bag and the fitted one came in a nice cardboard box with a rope handle. The fitted one is of much nicer quality, soft on both sides and did not have the moth-ball like smell of the unfitted one. It did have a mild smell to it, but it is more of a material smell, not chemical. I expect that with washing it will dissipate.Definitely worth the extra 20 bucks for the fitted one! Just FYI that seller was called Pokkadots.
