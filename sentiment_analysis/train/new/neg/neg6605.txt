The two star rating applies more to the listing of this product than the quality of the product itself.It appears from the listing that you are receiving TWO binky loops, when in fact you are only receiving ONE and they are simply showing you the front and back. Seems obvious now that I am looking at the product in packaging (which is NOT shown in the ad), but when ordering, this wasn't clear. And sifting through the details of the add doesn't help either since it doesn't make it clear whether you're receiving two items or one.Disappointed with my purchase simply because the posting was confusing. Cute product, but would have been cuter to have two like I thought I was ordering.
