My daughter is on IV nutrition so has a central IV line connected to a backpack.  She had rolled out of her toddler bed a couple of times and my wife and I were paranoid she would rip her line out so we bought this crib rail.  At first I hated it.The way it works is a strap goes under the mattress.  At the end of the strap is a metal piece that you wedge between the mattress and box springs and that is supposed to hold the rail in place.  Her toddler bed mattress is so light that their wasn't enough weight to hold the metal piece in place.  She slipped between the rail a couple of times and ended up in the floor.  For us, this was even more dangerous than the alternative.What I did to make this rail work really well (and hopefully this will help others) is just ignore the metal piece and tie the strap to the opposite rail/frame of the bed.  There is now no way that the rail will come loose.  It is very sturdy and she could put all of her weight on it and it wouldn't budge.My suggestion is to avoid this rail unless you have a full size, heavy mattress or a way to tie the strap down to the opposite side of the bed.
