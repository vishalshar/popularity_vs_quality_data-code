This product gets points for design and ingenuity, but unfortunately fails to perform its intended function, i.e. drying bottles.  I was looking for something to dry our various reusable water bottles, and wanted something without a built-in drip tray, which I find inevitably is a home for mold (I wanted something to put directly on my absorbent drying mat). This rack holds the bottles fairly well, but the angle is so inclined that the water just accumulates in the neck of the bottles rather than dripping out. As a result, the bottles never actually get dry.  Disappointing -- I guess I'll have to keep looking.
