I purchased these lights based soley on the reviews I read here on Amazon.  They are indeed what they say they are and the sensors work well they are not bright at all though.  They have an extremely short throw light output and I was just hoping for a bit more safety since the brand is safety 1st.  I have a little alcove at the top of my stairs and I wanted a light there to keep guests from stumbling around trying to find either the light switch or the stairwell.  This just doesnt even come close to helping. It pretty much only lights up the outlet.  I am sure it would serve a purpose just not mine. Update I continued to leave one in the office and I brushed past it with my leg and ripped it apart.  ? Junk.
