This bendy spoon and fork set is as cute as it can be. But barely functional. The spoon part is so flat it will not hold anything. The fork is just the spoon with notches cut out. But my son LOVES THEM. He just turned 15 months and thinks he's a big guy eating peanut butter which he loves as well. If your baby can eat peanut butter then these will be fun. If not, well there cute anyway.
