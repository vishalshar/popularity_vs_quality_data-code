I so wanted this product to work. My little girl is a roller, and when we go on vacation she falls out of bed even when she is on the floor. This bed seemed like the perfect solution. I got the bed & based on some of the reviews, I decided to blow it up and test it out. It worked great  and stayed inflated for 3 days. Then we took it on vacation, and it never worked again. My poor daughter ended up sleeping on the floor! She is only 24 pounds, and certainly is not heavy enough to cause the bed to deflate. I exchanged it with Amazon for a new bed. The replacement was even worse! It wouldn't stay inflated even once and was completely out of air with in 5 hours! I have returned it for a full refund, but am totally dissatisfied. Don't let YOUR CHILD be the one sleeping on the floor on your next trip out of town.
