The pillow I ordered arrived with a tear in it.  I'm sure I could have gotten it replaced, but I had ordered a different pillow as well that I decided to use.  This one was just much bigger than I wanted.  I needed something I could pack in a suitcase and that wouldn't take up too much room.  This was only marginally smaller than the regular boppy.  I ended up using the mother's breast friend nursing pillow - but the travel version.  It's inflatable, so you can collapse it completely, and it fit well in my suitcase.
