I'm changing my review form 3 star to 1. After using the for 10 months, I really wish I had a better quality set. I washed the bumpers, low heat, and they don't fit our crib anymore! Complete waste of a lot of money.The set looks really good-very clean and modern.However, the first thing I did was wash all the bedding (bed skirt, diaper stacker, sheets, etc) and dried them like I do all my other clothes. Now, the set doesn't fit our crib! The skirt is about two inches too short, the diaper stacker is completely unusable-the cardboard insert is about twice the size of the bag. I haven't tried putting the sheet on yet, but my guess is that won't fit either.Overall, for the price, I'd have gone with another set. I'd rather have less items and better quality items that I'll use.
