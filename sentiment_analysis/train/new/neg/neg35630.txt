I'm a little irritated that these were falsely advertised. The picture isn't even close to what these baskets actually look like. As you can see in my picture, the advertised product is a classy light pink and the actual product is a bright tacky pink. Also, there was quite a bit of damage to the wicker on my large basket. I just wanted the product that was in the main picture not this crap they tried to pass off as acceptable!
