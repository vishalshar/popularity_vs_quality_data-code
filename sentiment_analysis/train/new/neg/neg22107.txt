A good product in theory, but this falls short in execution. My daughter will not take medicine from an oral syringe, so I typically mix it in with her bottle. I was hoping to find something that would allow me to easily administer medicine even if she wasn't hungry. My daughter is not at all picky when it comes to nipples; she will drink from any bottle and happily suck on any pacifier. However, even she wouldn't drink from this because the nipple is incredibly hard. It will be going back.
