There aren't a lot of options for child safety locks on ovens.I like that this is rater aesthetically pleasing (I have white appliances), it's also easy-ish for an adult to usre but difficult for a kid and can be swung out of the way to leave it unlocked as needed.However, it failed in less than 2 weeks with minimal oven use. By fail, I mean the adhesive gave out and the lock just came off. The lock is installed using an adhesive strip. I cleaned the surface multiple times to ensure maximum adhesion and pressed/wiggled many many times to try and set it as best I could. I also used the oven several times hoping the heat would bake the adhesive in before really using the lock but it still came off after less than 2 weeks.Improve the adhesive to something super strong and heat activated/resistant and this will be a winner in my opinion. Otherwise, your results may vary.I just bought some double sided foam tape from Home Depot that has a high lbs rating, going to give it a shot and hope it'll stay put this time.
