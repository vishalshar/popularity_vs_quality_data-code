For the pricing, I had expected something better. Certainly not the lightweight item that I saw my 6 months old baby dragging with him in when I put him inside. As in another review, I have to emphasize that my baby was at 50th percentile height and weight at 6 months then, thus it was really a shocking sight for me. Well, I should also mention something about the assembling too. Why weren't there any spare nails provided, considering the price I paid for and the size of nails making them easily lost? In addition, the two halves of the blue supporting trunk were impossibly difficult to align. I had to use my chin, chest and part if my face to keep the two halves in alignment while attempting to screw the nails through. In the end, what I had was a lope-sided supporting trunking due to misalignment of the edges and overtightening of the nails. When I tried to unscrew the nails, it was another great hassle and the halves entirely came apart again. The second attempt of fixing brought me back to the same lope-sided supporting trunking, yet again, which eventually affected the stability of the activity station. Buy at your own risk of safety of your kid and wastage of your money!
