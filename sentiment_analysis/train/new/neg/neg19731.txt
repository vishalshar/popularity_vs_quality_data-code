I was sitting with my son 16 month old son tonight when he pulled the binky out of his mouth and the nipple part was torn off. It was inside his mouth! Thank God I was there with him, otherwise he would have choked!! I then went to check the other pacifiers in the house and 3 of them were split in half. You bet they all went in the garbage!! These are very poorly made if my son is able to bite the nipple off. They should not be allowed in the stores or to be sold online! So dangerous!
