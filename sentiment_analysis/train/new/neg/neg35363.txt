The first remote we received was defective but The Discovery Store was super helpful and fast about sending a replacement before Christmas. I bought these for my 16 month old and he likes the remote but doesn't seem too interested in the other two. The only issues I have with this set are that it advertises an iPod but instead you get a camera (not a big deal, but they should show two different pictures or say that products may vary). Also the buttons on the iPhone are basically a big sticker with icons that are flush and not raised like actual buttons. They also don't light up (just a single light on the phone activates when you press each icon) and for this reason my 16 month old doesn't know he can press them and tosses this one aside. The age does say 18 months on this so I will give it time. For the camera I would rather go out and buy something that had actions like a folding flip screen or a lighted flash (instead of a little red dot) and, again, not just a big sticker slapped on the back with pictures. Overall it's not a horrible set for what I paid, but if you're looking for quality educational toys I reccomend sticking to buying more detailed items sold singly in the store.
