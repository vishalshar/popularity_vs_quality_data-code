Although this toy is a great idea, it is much smaller than I thought it would be when I read the review. It is small and flat: great to stick in a purse or diaper bag for "emergency entertainment," however I'm not impressed with what the toy offers. My daughter loves toys that have the crinkle sound, but the color tabs with the crinkle inside on this toy are so small that it is hardly effective. The claw rattles are nice and visible, but the toy itself doesn't seem to be realistic for tiny hands to grab.
