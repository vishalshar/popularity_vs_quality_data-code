This product arrived quickly. If you're familiar with strollers, you really don't need to read the manual to figure out how to open it. It's pretty easy to open and to assembly the canopy. The canopy shades only from above, but not the side or front. My child is almost 3 and tall for his age. He sits easily on the seat, but the backing only goes up to the back of his shoulders. If he fell asleep, his head would not be supported. The shoulder harness is also very low and he cannot wear it. I will have to cut the tabs that hold the straps/harness down so that he can get his arms through. I'm 5'3'' and the handles are comfortable. If you're tall or have long arms, the handles may be too low. What I do like is that it is lightweight and rides smooth yet sturdy for traveling.
