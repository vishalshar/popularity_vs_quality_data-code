Loved the print of this sling, as all of my other things for my baby match it.  When my baby was a newborn she loved being cradled in this thing.  She would feel cozy and warm and would sleep comfortably in it while I would go out to dinner with my husband.  I did find that the shoulder that I would hang it on would hurt after awhile just because the support is not distributed evenly between my body so I would not recommend it for long periods of time, especially with a heavier baby, but during the newborn stage it was perfect.
