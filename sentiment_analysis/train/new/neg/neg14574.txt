I actually returned this item.  My daughter is nine months old and 26 inches tall.  When I placed her inside the walker, set to the lowest setting, her feet were about three inches off of the floor.  The manual states the walker is for babies 4+ months of age.  If my nine month old can't reach the floor, what 4 month old will be able to?
