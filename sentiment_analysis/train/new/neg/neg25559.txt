When first purchased I would have given this chair 4 stars. But after 1.5 years, my opinion is much different. I like the wheels, the locking and folding mechanism, the tray size, the pocket on the back of the chair for bibs and the sturdiness of the chair. What I dont like is that for the price, the seat cover falls apart in 1- 2 years of purchase. The replacement cover is soooo expensive so I had to order one from etsy. $50! But it was still cheaper than going with the real deal. The tray is also not a one handed mechanism. Smaller babies sit really low but you can buy a booster- still more $. For the price, the chair should include the booster seat and be made from a material that doesn't disintegrate. Oh and cleaning the actual seat is horrible!!! Once kids start feeding themselves you will hate cleaning it!!
