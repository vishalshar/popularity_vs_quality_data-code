I obsessed over which animal to buy and settled on the Lion, which I'm very happy with, but I'm just OK with the whole blanket/pillow concept.  Once the blanket is unfolded out of the body of the animal, there really is not a pillow remaining -- I'm not sure what I was expecting though.  Overall it's OK...but you could certainly get by with a blanket/pillow combo for less $
