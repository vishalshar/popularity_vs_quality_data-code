I bought this for my 11 month old son with hopes he would like it so i could get "some" shopping done with him in his stroller, but that didn't happen. When i got this the music didn't work it was warped but being a new mom i didn't even want to deal with sending it back. The only good thing was that it had a little snack tray for cherrios witch worked good....
