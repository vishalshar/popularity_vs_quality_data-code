I purchased this thinking that my baby will not sleep in a crib for the first few weeks or months.Assembly:- Painful, I don't know what it is with baby manufacturer's instructions, but they are painful to read/follow.TIP to Mfgs: Make a simple video, upload it to you your YouTube channel! This will take less than 30 mins and it will save a lot of new and expecting parents a lot of headache and grief!- You really need a 2nd hand to help you pull the bars up and lock the bars- Fully assembled (with all the bars locked), the side bars look crooked (not straight). I disassembled and re-assembled and same result.Use:- We put the cosleeper next to our sofa (the first floor pretty much became baby room #2. The baby did not sleep at all. She likes the rocking chair that comes with a pack and play much better.- The pad does not come with a sheet (which is fine) but no recommendation on where to buy sheets. Maybe the baby didnt sleep because of the coldness of the pad.Honestly, for new parents, I would look into a cradle swing or a rocking chair to help your baby sleep. as long as it has a firm back support/mattress, you should be ok.For now, I folded this up and kept it in the basement. Perhaps we will find a use for it later, but right now the assembly is painful and the baby does not like it.
