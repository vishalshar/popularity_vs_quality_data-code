EDIT: Added a VIDEO REVIEW so you can hear the annoying motorboat buzz sound this thing makes. It's real folks! Listen to it and make up your own mind.OK, the mobile FELL on our baby! Needs a way to secure the mobile, not just loose plastic slip on. Even if the mobile does not fall, the cheap, clunky design results in another issue that makes this absolutely unbearable. Vibration in the shaft results in an annoying motorboat sound. You know that "buzz" sound you hear in a fluorescent tube fixture when the ballast is going bad? That pretty much describes it, only louder.Obviously I'm returning it. Unless you want to drive your baby crazy from the annoying buzzing sound coming from the shaft / motor, I would avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid.Assembly is pretty easy, but just putting it together the first thing I noticed is how poorly made it seems to be. I build computers so I appreciate well-made, well-designed components. Likewise, I know cheap build quality when I see it and you will see it, too. Pieces don't fit snugly which may not seem like a big deal, but the resulting, jerky movement led to the mobile FALLING onto our baby not once, but twice. Unacceptable.My advice after this? KISS (Keep It Simple). You can get far better renderings (and infinitely better sound quality) of Mozart and Bach from better sources (MP3 player, anyone?) and you can get far better mobiles with no annoying buzz sound also, for less. Get a well-made simple mobile and turn on your MP3 player. Much better option. And you and your baby won't have headaches from plastic Mozart accompanied by motorboat ballast buzz.
