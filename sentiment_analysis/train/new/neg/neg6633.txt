I ordered this for my son.  It arrived in a well packaged, although large and quite heavy box.  I was happy to have a delivery man offer to carry it upstairs for me.  When I finally got around to putting it together, I was initially intimidated by the directions - all pictures, no words.  It wasn't too hard to figure out though, although I did end up having to remove some of the wood plugs I had put in and place them in different spots after I figured out that some places were to be used by the metal plugs.I'd definitely recommend having an electric drill to put this together.  It took me about 2 hours to put this together, it would have taken a lot longer without the electric drill.One of the side pieces of one of the drawers arrived broken - despite all the good packing, there is no guarantee that pressboard will arrive undamaged.  It wasn't broken enough for me to want to wait for a replacement part to get shipped to me, but the drawer I used it in will not be as sturdy as it should.  Overall, the construction of the side pieces isn't all that sturdy, as about half of them tried to spilt while I was installing the rails for the drawer runners.Overall, you get what you pay for.  Wouldn't necessarily order another one due to the lower quality of the press board, but I'm not unhappy with what I got.  The drawers are fairly shallow, so I won't be able to use it for his jeans, but it will work for undergarments and shirts.
