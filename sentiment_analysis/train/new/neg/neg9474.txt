The Jacootie light is a great product, while it works. The stretchy band easily wraps around bars and holds the light securely in place. The light is bright enough to illuminate your path and alert drivers to your presence.After using the light for a couple of months, though, two severe problems became evident. First, the light doesn't even approach the claimed operation time of 30 hours. I purchased a pair of these lights, and after about 10-15 hours of operation the brightness of the lights had diminished so much that they were barely visible outdoors and no longer illuminated the ground.The second problem with the Jacootie light is that it simply isn't designed to be used after the included batteries have died. The stretchy band that holds the light in place also serves as the light's casing. Therefore, to change the batteries, you need to stretch the casing and pull the light out. In doing this, I found that the clear windows on the side of the light are held in place only by frail plastic tabs, one of which broke as I removed the light from the casing. I also found that the circuit board for the light's on/off button is attached to the main body of the light only by a few soldered wires. Otherwise, without the casing holding the circuit board in place, it hangs loosely from the light. The wires are easily broken and the circuit board is difficult to return to the proper position after returning the light to the casing.The design of the Jacootie light suggests that it is a disposable product and not intended for long-term use. I wouldn't recommend it unless its price was significantly lower.
