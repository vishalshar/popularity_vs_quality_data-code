Got this monitor at a great price and was really looking forward to using it. We have a summer infant video monitor from 2010, but after a few years (and a couple of drops) the audio doesn't work like it once did. Plus, we're having another baby soon and need a monitor that can connect to more than one camera. The lorex seemed like a great solution for a great price.Unfortunately, I've been using it now for a couple of hours while my daughter naps and it has definitely not performed the way I expected it to. While the daytime video image is good quality, the night vision is quite blurry, not nearly as good as our old summer infant model is even now. More importantly (and a deal breaker for us) our house is only around 1300 sq ft, and the signal has cut out numerous (10+) times with an "Out of Range" error message accompanied by a beep, which I'm sure will be very annoying when we're trying to sleep at night. And this is with the camera and receiver located maybe 35-40 feet away from one another. Not going to work.So, we're returning the lorex sweet peek to amazon and will continue to look for a new monitor. Very disappointed.
