It's a neat idea to have mess-free painting, and that part holds true, however it is hard even for me to make a simple line by dragging my finger across the board! There is a pen included to facilitate drawing but you can only get a couple of lines in before they start getting swallowed up in paint. You can't really draw a picture like a flower, stick figure, sun, etc..
