This seems to be a perfectly adequate gate, as other reviewers have noted. However, there were two things that aren't explicitly listed in the item description that I wanted to note for future buyers:1. The gate is not the color shown in the item photo. It is black, or, at least, a wood stain so dark that it appears to be black. I wish the photo reflected this.2. The gate is not to be used at the top of stairs. While the item description says that it's best for bottom of stairs and between rooms, it doesn't explicitly warn against using it at the top of the stairs. The box and instructions in the box do warn against using it for this purpose.For both of these reasons, we have to return the gate unused. I hope that this review will help others to avoid having to send back the product!
