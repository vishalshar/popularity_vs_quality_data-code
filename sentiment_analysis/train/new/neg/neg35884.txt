I was very disappointed in these as I installed them. First they are very difficult to install and second they are madeof very poor quality materials. The screws in particular were very flimsy. I drilled pilot holes for every screw and then used a hand screw driver to put them in. I had several screws break as I was installing them. The heads would twist off. I eventually switched to screws I had.I just installed them but I don't think they are going to hold up. I don't see the parasitic parts hold up long term.I would not recommend buying these cabinet locks.
