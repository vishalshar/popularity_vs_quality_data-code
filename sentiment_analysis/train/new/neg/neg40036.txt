This chair was a disappointment. I read a ton of reviews, but somehow missed that this is plywood, particleboard and pieced wood. After starting my son on solid foods, I have realized that everything he comes in contact with needs to be hosed down. There is even a warning on the plywood tray that it can't get wet! I'm a first time parent and had no idea how completely unrealistic of a proposition that is. I think this chair was designed either by someone without kids or someone who hates parents. There are so many nooks and crannies where food gets stuck. There is no way to clean this properly without a good set of dental tools.The chair is not as adjustable as I had anticipated either. The position for the tray is fixed and there is only one possible setting for high chair mode. The next lowest setting for the seat would be much too low for an infant. The first setting means the tray is almost on my son's lap and he is only 6 months. I'm not sure that his legs will fit underneath the tray for long.I would not buy this chair nor recommend.Update: I downgraded my original rating of 2 stars down to 1, because on top of all the above mentioned reasons to dislike this chair, my son gets his fingers pinched between the particleboard tray and the plastic tray.
