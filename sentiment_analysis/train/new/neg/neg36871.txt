It was difficult to find a gate that fit a 61" space. This was one of the only options. While it assembled relatively easily, I have found I need to keep re-tightening it often. (every couple days). Also, it is slightly "shakey". Luckily my toddler doesnt shake the gate violently anymore, or this would come right down. Also, the handle seems very fragile and I am worried it will break as the plastic locking mechanism seems frail and opening the gate has to be done with great care not to break the little grey buttons. The gate is OK, it works for now but I have a feeling it will break not long after purchase.I will be very unhappy if I have to go out and spend another $100+ on another gate if this one breaks within the first year of use.Also, the plastic handle edges cut me earlier today. Be careful while opening the gate door.
