My son loves to play with this light, but when it comes to comforting his fear of the dark, it's pretty useless. My daughter has a yellow one that works great, but the blue one has always been very dim, the light just doesn't get through the dark color of the plastic as well. The battery life is not as advertised either, this light has always lasted a maximum of 6 hours. After just a few short months, I'm back at amazon looking for a replacement.
