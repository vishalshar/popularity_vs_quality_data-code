This is a decent stroller for carting around our little ones, ages 2 years and 5 months.  We like having the option of putting either one in the front (the Graco car seat fits in either the front or the back).  It took us a while to decide that we even needed a double stroller, but now we're happy we have one.  Even if just our little guy needs to sit, we can put the car seat on one seat (great when we have to pull him out of the car when he's sleeping) and move him to the other seat when he wakes up.We've had some trouble with the front wheels.  They squeaked and became warped in the first week.  Graco sent us new ones with no problem at all.  The new ones are squeak-free, but have warped again.  We suspect that they're warping in the truck of the minivan, but if you can't store your stroller in the back of your minivan without problems what good is it?  It is summer in Las Vegas, so the heat may be the problem.We're not absolutely convinced that we'd buy this one again; we'd have to check out the other options carefully.
