I got this to use with the soothie pacifiers before we went on a trip. We don't usually use a clip at all, but I was traveling with an infant in arms and didn't want to deal with her losing it somewhere on the plane or in an airport. The night before we were set to leave, I decided to put her binkie on it, and as I was pulling the ribbon through the loop, the white string at the end broke off. We were able to fix it in a pinch with some fabric glue, but shouldn't have had to. She's an infant... there's no way this would stand up to an older baby who could pull on it, and the string would be a choking hazard for sure.
