I like this cover.  The material is softer, stretchier and thinner than a lot of covers and I like that.  This used to be one of our go-to nighttime covers.  Then baby got chunky thighs and this cover left deep red lines in his skin that took days to go away.  Great cover, but not for chubby legs, especially overnight.
