It's OK as a extra booster or one for the grandparent's car for a quick trip.  After a few minutes it starts to slide away from the back of the seat and my grand daughter slips off it in the back.  It's also not as easy as it should be to use the seatbelt.  Kids can't fasten them themselves.  Ended up ordering another Grayco which works perfectly as it latches in.  No slipping.
