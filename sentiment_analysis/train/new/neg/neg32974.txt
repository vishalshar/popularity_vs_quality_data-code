I ordered this pink Huggybuddy as a replacement one to switch in and out when our daughter's was in the wash. The seller sent the blue bear on accident but was swift to send the correct one within days of contacting him.The issues ÓºÅI had with the Huggybuddy were that it was different than the original one my daughter received as a gift. The satiny material was snagged and was not as silky smooth as that of the original Gund Baby Huggybuddy. Also "My First Teddy" was not embroidered on the replacement bear.I was very pleased with the speed of the seller's response when I contacted him about the error but I was not so pleased when the Huggybuddy ddidn't live up to my expectations as an idectical replacement to the existing one.
