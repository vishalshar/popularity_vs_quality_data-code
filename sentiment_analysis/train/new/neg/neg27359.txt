We hate these. We used the Munchkin weighted straw cups for months, but finally got sick of the leaking so I thought I would try these instead. I am going back to Munchkin until I can find something else.If your 15 month old tips it upside down the milk flows out from the straw. If the cups is on it's side and it's pretty full and the straw is at the "perfect" angle, the milk flows from the side. If it tips upside down in a cooler or diaper bag with the lid on, the milk spews out.It's also annoying to refill with milk if the handle is on. The handle comes up so high that it makes it hard to screw the lid back on.Also, the straw isn't weighted enough or flexible enough for me to really consider it a weighted straw. My kids sometimes like to drink while laying around on the floor, the straw isn't flexible enough to follow the kids movements and allow milk to flow into the straw and up the cup while a kid is laying down. Same thing goes for if the cup is angled and there isn't much milk left. It's pretty much a lost cause because the straw isn't long enough or weighted enough to move to where the last of the milk is.I rarely write reviews, but I felt compelled to leave this one because I was REALLY REALLY hoping this would solve our leaking issues. Or at least cut them in half, but it pretty much made them worse.
