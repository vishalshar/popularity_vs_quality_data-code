It was a challenge to find this product and when I did find it on Amazon I was thrilled.  It has been perfect for my infant who has used it while learning how to sit up.  I know that if he topples over, he will not bump his head on the floor.  It is very lightweight.  My preschooler can easily move it between rooms for me so that the baby can sit with us while we're doing different activities.  The only problem that I have with it is that one of the seams came apart the first day that my baby used it.  I'm pretty sure it can be fixed, but I would've expected it to be more durable.  Other than that problem, I have been very satisfied with it.
