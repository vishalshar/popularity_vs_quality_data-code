I've used this car seat for over a year.  My daughter didn't care for it too much.  I'm not sure what she hated more the head rest or the seat which is about as soft as a towel covering a rock.  The cup holders can in no way function as a cup holder.  The car seat head unit is made up of a flexible plastic, Styrofoam, covered with cloth.  Somehow during the moving the car seat around we cracked the Styrofoam in two places.  Thus foam was falling out of the head rest.  Well a call to Britax and waiting on hold for about 30 mins I was told it would cost $10 for a replacement piece.  A car booster seat needs to last longer however I was able to damage mine in about a year.  The replacement foam (the same stuff cheap beer coolers are made of) costing $10 seems a bit excessive.
