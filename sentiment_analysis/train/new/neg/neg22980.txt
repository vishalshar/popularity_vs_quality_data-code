If I could rate this less than 1 star I totally would! Unlike some other molds that have the consistency of playdoh and you just roll it out, this one uses water. Well, after I made the clay and pressed my daughter's hands, I laid it out to dry like the instructions said. However, I happened to check it a month later and found green mold growing on it!! Totally gross. I threw it out and bought one of the premade clay molds instead.
