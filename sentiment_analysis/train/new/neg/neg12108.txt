I ordered the deluxe weather shield because it had the vents on the side and it looked large enough to cover my Chicco Cortina Travel System. I didn't realize that the front does not go all the way down to the foot rest so, the tips of my son's shoes are exposed. Not a big deal because his shoes would have gotten wet if he walked in the rain. Also, they provide you with a bag to store the weather shield in when not in use but, it is do hard to fold/roll to get it to fit well. But, the biggest down side is that I can't have the stroller handles up because the weather shield won't fit. I can still push the stroller but, it's a little more difficult to have full control of the stroller.
