Once I saw this diaper bag, I had to have it. After receiving it...I wish I would've saved the money! It's really cute for a little girl but the side pockets aren't big enough for bottles unless you leave them unsnapped. I also have a 2 yr old and I have to take either 2 bags with me or just a few things of theirs and hope it's enough because it doesn't have a lot of room.
