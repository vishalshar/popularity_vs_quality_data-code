I used this timer for my first child in 2012. I only used it for a couple days because I chose to feed on demand breastfeeding. So I stored the device without batteries until I was close to delivering my second child. Input new batteries in it and it worked fine for two days. My second baby needs to be woken up for several feedings do it is necessary to keep track. Now the timer display is messing up two of the bottom numbers. It will not show all of the number bring displayed. At times it messes up each of the times and I have to shake it to work. My phone is much more reliable and has apps that can do better for free. I am still trying to use the timer but the display continues to mess up.
