I bought this item based on all the good reviews on Amazon.  When I received it, I was surprised to find out that there was no recycling code on any part of the bowl or the spoon.  I wrote an email to the company and learned that the upper transparent part of the bowl is made out of polycarbonate plastic.  That's the type of plastic with recycling code 7, which means it might contain phthalates and BPA.  I am not willing to take this chance with my baby (especially with a product made in China!).I think it's really shady of the company to omit this vital piece of information from their packaging.
