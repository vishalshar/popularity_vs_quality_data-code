We purchased this for toilet training our 2.5 year old son. At first I we loved it. It was very easy to use. But then we noticed a mahjor design flaw...somehow urine got into the cushion of the seat. When my son sat there would be a hiss/bubbling noise. And then the smell began. We scrubbed and bleached the whole bathroom, we threw out the bathmat, and then isolated that the smell was from the potty seat. Urine must be stuck in the cushioning and we cant get rid of the smell. We had to stop using the product. It was very disappointing and a big waste of money.
