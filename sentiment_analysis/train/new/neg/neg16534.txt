The sheet was extremely soft and comfortable. However, I have the5" mattress and the sheet did not fit all the way around the mattress. It was just shy of fitting and I was afraid that it might slip off in the night. I returned it. I would definitely recommend it for someone using a 3" mattress - it would probably be perfect.
