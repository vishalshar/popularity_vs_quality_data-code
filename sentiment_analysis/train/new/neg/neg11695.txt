I bought this for my almost 2 year old boyWhen he tries to pull the string he holds the rubber figure with one hand and the string with the other dipping it slightly in the water a bit then upon letting go when he releases the rubber figure it sucks up water and would move slightly tilted to one side.Even if you, the adult tried it when dry it would only move slightly not " zoom" in the waterMy kid still likes it though , but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because it doesn't do what its supposed to do properly.Its meant to be for kids but it doesn't show in the design.Ive bought the "Yookidoo Stack 'N' Spray Tub Fountain" which he loves although he doesn't completely understand but it seems to be the best bath toy there is.
