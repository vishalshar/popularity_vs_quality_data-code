The nap mat came on time. However, the pillow part seems to be stitched up-side down on the nap mat. The graphic on the pillow is up-side down! My daughter, of course, doesn't mind and loves it, but my OCD kicks in every time I see it and I hate it. My daughter loves it and other then the graphic being up-side down, it is adorable! The part they lay on is a little bit more comfortable than the lambs and ivy nap mats.
