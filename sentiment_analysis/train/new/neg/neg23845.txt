I bought this seat after two certified carseat technicians told me how great it was to have the 5 pt harness up to 80 lbs. I have a brand new 2008 GMC vehicle and this seat was way too big for it! My child looked like she was sitting on a throne. I had difficulty getting it out of the box it was so enormous. It is huge. I returned it and bought a Britax Marathon that has the 5 pt harness up to 65 lbs instead. I'd recommend trying out the Regent in person in your car and on your child before buying this one for sure.
