This product may prevent children from opening the fridge up enough to get inside, but is still flexible enough for a child to partially open the fridge then have it close on their fingers.  It's a flexible piece of rubber with a clasp to close it around the two handles.  When you want to open the fridge yourself it will come completely off and you will have to hold it until you are done in the fridge.  It should have a lanyard or something so it will stay attached to one of the doors so you don't have to hang on to it while you are in the fridge.  I'll be looking for a better product than this.  A dog collar would work better than this, and cost half as much.
