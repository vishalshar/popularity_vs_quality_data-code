This diaper bag looks cool, but it doesn't have any insulated pockets for warm bottles (though the product description claims it does).  The side pockets are supposed to be insulated, but they don't appear to be, & I prefer ones that zipped shut to keep bottles really warm.  The small, red, zippered purse addition is superfluous. I haven't used it at all.  The material is durable and sturdy, though there isn't much stretch in it, so it doesn't expand when you stuff it.  I really like the little inner buckles that attach to the stroller handle.
