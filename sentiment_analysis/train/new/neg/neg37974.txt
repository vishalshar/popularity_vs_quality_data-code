We bought this because my son who is 5 wanted a high back booster instead of the no back kind he already had.  We tried and Harmony brand no-back in the store and it was super comfortable for him to sit on.  I ordered this assuming it would have the same seat but it does not.  This seat is just as cushy as all the rest on the market.  I wound up buying a piece of foam from the fabric store and stuffing it under the cover to add extra comfort.  Since then my son has never complained about his butt hurting, and we just got back from a 5 hour trip.  He is able to sleep safely with his head on the head rest with no problem.  In hindsight, I probably would have bought a cheaper seat and put the foam in that had I known this seat was just as uncomfortable.  The manufacturer website was misleading when it comes to the material used in the seat and I don't think this is really worth the extra money as compared to other high back boosters
