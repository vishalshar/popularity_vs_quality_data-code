The wider part of the nipple is harder than I expected. They were purchased for a baby that opened their mouth too wide on the regular Dr. Brown bottles, but her jaw wasn't strong enough to 'smoosh' this nipple to get a good latch. The cap also does not fit well, pressing down on the nipple and causing leaks. It did not leak in the diaper bag, it stayed inside the cap but it was still a mess when you opened the bottle. These bottles didn't serve their intended purpose for us. If the nipple was a bit softer and the caps were a better fit, it could be a great bottle but instead it is just mediocre at best.
