After a few days home from the hospital, I realized I needed more than 4 changing pad covers.  These were a economical option, compared to the boppy's.  The size is functional, but the contour of the bobby's make much more sense.  These pads are scratchy and they ball up - very easily.  I'll keep them for emergencies, but I'll be ordering more of the boppy's.Boppy Changing Pad Cover with Waterproof Liner, Sage(The make 3 packs of these liners, I just cannot find them on here.  Stores like Buy Buy Baby have them.)
