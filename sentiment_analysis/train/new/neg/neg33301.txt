The first time I washed this towel there was so much lint in the washing machine I thought the towel had fallen apart.  Then I dried it and it came out completely covered in pills, both on the front and back.  It's the same quality as the beach towels I get for $5 at our local discount store.  For $5 bucks I probably wouldn't complain but I paid $18.99 for this piece of crap!  I know it's "licensed" and all but a poor quality towel with a Sesame Street label on it isn't worth almost $20 bucks!!  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it's still cute even though it's a piece of junk.
