I bought this because I live in a very hot climate and I wanted a carseat canopy that didn't have minky fabric on one side.  To that extent, this canopy totally fit the bill -- the weight of the fabric is exactly what I wanted.  However, I find that the width of the canopy is just a bit too narrow -- it doesn't do a good job of completely covering the sides of the carseat.  I have a Graco Snugride 35 -- it's a large carseat, but no bigger than most infant carseats.  One other issue I had with this canopy is that it had an overpowering chemical smell when it arrived.  I had to wash it multiple times before it lost the odor.
