My baby absolutely hated tummy time. No matter what I did, including purchasing this product could change that. She only started to enjoy tummy time when she could roll out of it. This device seemed like a good thing to try though. It had a sturdy construction, but it made my child scream like no other. She really hated having her legs in the molds because she wasn't able to hardly move them at all. Unfortunately this item was a failure for us.
