It seems as my child gets older, I like orbit less and less. When we were in the infant car seat 4 docks and the stroller it was beyond PERFECT!! However now as we move on I have had to buy this seat as well as the stroller seat. Cost aside (although it seems every few months I have to spend 300 or more on another orbit accessory) the thing that made the orbit system for our infant so great is gone. Lets start with docking it. For a short while the docks still work with this seat facing backwards but once over 32lbs we were told to start mounting the car seat in the forward position. This requires these rails that come with the seat (only one set) and makes the seat more permanent. No more swapping between cars with ease. Also I remember loving taking the infant seat out and docking right in the stroller. You can do that with this seat but it is far to heavy and cumbersome that you won't want to.Bottom Line: Its a high quality well made car seat but the convince of the orbit system is gone.......Anyone want to buy $900 worth of orbit docks I no longer have use for.
