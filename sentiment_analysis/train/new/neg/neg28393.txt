The idea of these stickers are cute and we LOVE the Lucy Darling Monthly stickers, but the milestone stickers are a bit much. I think I purchased these before I had my baby, and I consider myself a pretty dillegent documentor, but I have forgotten to take pictures of her wearing these the first time she reaches a milestone.  The only one I was able to do was "I just slept all night." If you are good at this sort of thing then go for it, but for me it was a waste.
