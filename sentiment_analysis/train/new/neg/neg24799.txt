All your friends will make fun of you - as if it's not enough to want to play with your baby all day long, now you can watch her/him at night too!The video works well enough for us, and the camera does a pretty good job of picking up decent quality.  We wondered how it would work at night, and whether there'd be distracting lights, etc, keeping our baby up.  It turns out the video works pretty well - we can sometimes tell if her eyes are open, and certainly can see whether she's OK. And the night vision lights aren't visible to the baby.  There's just one green LED on the camera unit (to tell you the video is on), which you can tape over.The audio on the main unit is OK.  But the audio on the handset is a huge disappointment.  Even when it's working, the quality is much worse than the Safety First audio-only monitor we've used.  The tiny microphone on the video camera is probably a compromise to make it small - bad idea.  It has a tinny, artifical sound.  And the audio handset of this set is almost unusable, even on the other side of the wall from the baby's room, due to static and noise.  So for us, there wasn't much point to buying this version with the audio handset.Also, of course, being analog it's subject to interference.  Try changing the channel, that often helps.
