This is a very useful product for keeping a child calm in a car seat.  It is great for use in restaurants or supermarkets when your child is still young enough to be kept in an infant car seat.  However, nothing should EVER be attached to a car seat handle while the car is in motion.  First, your car seat handle should be placed behind the hood of the car seat while the car is in motion.  If this toy were to be attached to a handle during an accident, it would slam into your child's face.  While it may seem secure, it could become a dangerous projectile during a crash.  So, while this is a great toy for very specific uses, be careful and resist the temptation to attach it or anything else to your baby's car seat while you are driving.
