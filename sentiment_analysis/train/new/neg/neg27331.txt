At first look, I really wanted this stroller! I thought it was so neat, how I could change the seating, etc. But once it arrived and we put it together, oh gosh, it was a HUGE!!!! It was so large and sooooo extremely heavy (I think about 52 pounds) it was difficult to lug around. The overwhelming size took up nearly my entire Mazda 6 trunk. I would never buy this again! For a matter of fact, within months, we got rid of it and bought a Combi double stroller. So much lighter and it folds up small! (FYI, I never switched the chairs around. Another thing that wasn't as easy as they make it seem.)
