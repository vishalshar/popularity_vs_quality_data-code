I really wanted to love this tub based on its usefulness into toddlerhood and all the great reviews however my baby hates it and I don't blame him. The infant back support changes slope halfway leaving his head in an awkwardly hunched forward position. I have to support his upper back with one hand when I wash him. We have a 4 in 1 fisher price baby bathtub at my parents house and that one is much more ergonomic. Wish we saved our money on this and went with that one but I'm cheap so will probably keep using this tub for him and future babies. Definitely would not buy again.
