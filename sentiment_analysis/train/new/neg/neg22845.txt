This product is not worth buying. I purchased it for the long trip from Indiana to California to heat my infants bottle. The outside of the heating strap would heat up really well, but none of that heat was transferred to the bottle. I even had the warmer on for a good 45 minutes, and the water was barely luke-warm. After the first leg of our trip, we ditched the warmer and bought a thermos made by Stanley. We put hot water in it, and it kept it's temperature for the entire day. The warmer is a waste of money.
