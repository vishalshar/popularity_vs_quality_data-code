The look is great, but the size is much smaller than I thought it would be. There is one large turtle  and the rest of the images are pretty small. It would have been nice to have all the turtles, sea horses and sting rays be the same size. Also the coral doesn't look as big as the picture. And the description is wrong. It says that there are two more turtles than what is actually in the package. There are no two six inch turtles in my package. I'm currently trying to get that resolved with the seller.Overall, it's still cute, but you'd almost have to buy two sets to make a standard size room look dynamic. Currently, I have it on just one wall which has the window on it. If I spread it out over all the walls in the room, it would look a little lack luster. My walls are painted a fun shade of blue and the comforter for my son's twin bed is the sea scape comforter from Ikea. Looks great together with these wall decals.
