I absolutely love this concept.  I've used the sleep training concepts in The Sleepeasy Solution (GREAT BOOK.  SWEAR BY IT.) but I was never very thrilled at the thought of having to take notes in the dark.  This little gadget allows you to track your baby's sleep patterns without having to fumble around for your pen and paper in the middle of the night.  Alas, mine arrived defective.  The super nice lady at the 4moms company sent me out a new product in a few days but by that time we had already finished sleep training!  (I couldn't wait any longer.  I was literally a zombie mommy at this point.)  I'll be returning this for a refund, but I would still recommend this to my friends.
