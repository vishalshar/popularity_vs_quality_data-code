I accidentally ordered this for a full-size crib (I was debating between a mini crib and a standard and have sheets and mattresses for both saved on my amazon baby registry. Whoops!), but since I took it out of the package, I figured I would review it. It's a very cute pattern, it would've looked great with the grey crib we ordered, but it is NOT soft. I don't know why it's so hard to find crib sheets that aren't scratchy, but I recommend buying all baby things in bamboo. It is THE softest.
