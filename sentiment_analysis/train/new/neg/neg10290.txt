I purchased this with reading most reviews but was very disappointed. The first time we had an accident it soaked through the pad to the car seat and even through to the seat. It doesn't help at all. Also, this product is lined with a very soft but warm material that sits against the Childs rear, if you live in a warmer area your child will be insulated. It's too hot. I've found better luck with the bed pad liners from ikea and cutting a hole to let the buckle through. I have had accidents and it seems to hold more and often doesn't reach the seat. Some days are better than others. Tip # 1: protect your "car" seat. You can't wash it as easy as your Childs seat.
