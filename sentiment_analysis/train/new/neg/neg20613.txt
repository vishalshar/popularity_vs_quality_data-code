When we first got these about a week ago, my baby loved using them to help with her teething.  Per the instructions, we refrigerated them for added relief.  They are a good size and easy for baby to hold onto.  However, after only a couple uses, my baby bit through one of the teething rings! So scary as this is now a choking hazard.  Not to mention the old water on the inside.  My baby is 6 months and her lower 2 front teeth have just come in.  Needless to say, threw out all 3 teething rings.
