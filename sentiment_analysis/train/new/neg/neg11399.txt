Good idea but I think it works better for smaller babies. I got it when my son was 4 months already and his feet almost got out of the bottom. I also look fat and ugly when I wear this. It is not flattering at all. The string that tightens the bottom elastic is strange and I have not figure out how it works. The arm hole seems too low when I wear it. To me this design needs improvement.
