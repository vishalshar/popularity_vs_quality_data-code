Very cheap brush that is so soft to use. The comb is very sharp and hard to hold onto. I bought it because I wanted a fine comb to help with cradle cap. However I wish I bought a normal sized fine comb it would be easier to hang onto and wouldn't be so sharp. Not worth the money even though it's cheap
