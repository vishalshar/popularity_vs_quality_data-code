Our newborn worked herself out of these pretty easily. She was born average length and weight, but she was exceptionally wiggly and active. Maybe all mothers say that, but honestly, even the medical professionals at her birth commented on how active she was. So perhaps that was more of the problem than the sizing. Still, they did seem loose. I suppose it's a tricky business though b/c you certainly wouldn't want them to be too tight.My suggestion would be to not purchase infant mittens at all. I know some people find them very helpful, and I can understand why-- none of us want our babies to scratch themselves!-- but our midwife and lactation consultant both said that the hands are important to have uncovered b/c they tend to smell like being in the womb, and it's comforting to the newborn. Even once they are washed the hands tend to retain that comforting smell. Or so we were told! Also, bare hands are more conducive to breastfeeding, for those of you going that route.
