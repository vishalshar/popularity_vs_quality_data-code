I would like to give zero stars. We purchased this tub about a year ago for our newly expected grand babies. This past holiday our ten-month-old grandson reached forward grasping the front of the tub when his hand slipped through the hook (used to hang tub up when not in use). He was pushing down and so his hand slipped through fast and easily all the way past his elbow. His upper arm (bicep area) became wedged, pinched and entrapped. The action pulled him forward and down towards the water. He was wet, slippery, and screaming with pain.  It took both his mother and myself to get him out of the situation. One of us held him up above the water while the other worked to push his arm up and out. The hook left a welt, scratch, and bruise on baby's upper arm.  It was very frightening. We were glad that two adults were present to unwedge his arm. We wrote to the company asking that they redesign the hook or at the very least put a warning on the product. Now when using the tub we stuff a towel into the hook.
