The idea of this is great, a mixer that helps mix formula.  It cuts downs on bubbles and with the Dr. Brown bottles and having to add rice cereal to his bottles ( per dr orders) it would help. The problem is that the metal 'mixer' part of the mixer falls off all the time, and because he has narrow neck bottles it takes forever to dig out, which is great when he is screaming and yelling because he is hungry.  Sometimes it falls off just under normal use and it always falls off if you accidentally bump the side of the bottle. It might work better on the shorter bottles, like Avent. But not good with Dr. Browns or taller bottles.  I love the idea of this product, and hope that they get the design better for the future.
