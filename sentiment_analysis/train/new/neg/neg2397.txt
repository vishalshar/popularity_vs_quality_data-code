I bought this because when my son first started feeding himself he would shove the spoon so far into his mouth I was afraid he would gag himself or injure his mouth.  I figured with the big ball handle, he couldn't do that.  Well, although this made an interesting teething toy for him, using it to feed himself was just impractical.  He hated having the long plastic handle extension on it and preferred holding it by the feeding end.  To him, the ball just made a good club to smash his food with.  I think it was just too awkward for him to grab any other way.
