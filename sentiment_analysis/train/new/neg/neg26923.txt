My 19mo loved it at first sight.  It's a step (she is in love with all steps), there is an almost-storage under the bottom step, and it's pink.It sorta works - the top step is just the right height for my baby to reach the sink, and it seems fairly steady.However, I don't quite love it, and here's why.- The construction is not as sturdy as I would have liked.  My husband put it together, and he worries that it will fall apart soon enough.- The manual that shows how to put the thing together is out-of-date and not accurate.- The painted pattern is un-even, and paint is smudged in a few noticeable places.- The almost-storage is weird - the top of the bottom step goes up, allowing to put something underneath, yet, there is no back wall, so that the box is not closed.  I look forward to finding all sorts of inappropriate stuff in there, stashed there by my toddler.This is an expensive piece, and I feel the quality should've been better at that price.
