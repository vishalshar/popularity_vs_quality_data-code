We have twins that are 10 months old. One does not like it at all and cries when I put it on her.  The other one tolerates everything, and tolerates this bib.  Its rather stiff and makes it difficult for them to reach things on their trays.  Also, one bib seems to leave a mark on the neck, even if you go to the largest size.  It does catch a lot of food and it is easy to clean.  However, my kids don't like it so we don't use them very often.  Maybe as the girls get bigger and can reach better around the bib.  For now, I only use it when dinner is especially messy.
