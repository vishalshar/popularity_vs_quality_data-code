I want to love these bibs, I got one as a sample and loved it so I decided to order more. Let's start positive. They are adorable!!! LOVE the colors and patterns. They are super easy to clean. I throw them into a bin with my daughter's dishes and let them soak for an hour or so and then wash them with a sponge. The sample one I have still works fine, but that's where these differ. I have two issues with these: one, my daughter just pulls on them a little bit and they come right off. Of course, this is always when I have turned around for like a SECOND and she is now covered in past sauce. Not the bib's fault for the mess, but they should not come off so easily. Two, the velcro sections are actually ripping off of the plastic which makes them completely useless now. The stitching is different than the sample one I have, these only have a single row of stitches with are just tearing off the plastic. The sample bib is triple stitched to hold it on and is still working fine. Fix the stitching and make the velcro a little more secure and these would be just perfect. Usefull, but with their flaws. Still better than a laundry load of traditional bibs that don't hold the loose food my daughter stashes for later.
