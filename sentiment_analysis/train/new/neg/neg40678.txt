I bought the 9 oz set for my son and they worked beautifully at first, no leaks and no formula running out of his mouth when he decided to stop eating.  If you tip it upside down there are absolutely no leaks.  When the nipples are intact, the bottles work just like they advertise, so they are a good option if you are willing to take the extra time needed to care for them.  The drawback is that the nipples are very sensitive, and you must be very careful when washing them or they will tear, then they obviously will leak.  Top rack dw seems to be the best way to preserve them.  I also realized just recently that when mixing formula in the bottle, if I shake the contents up and down, which puts pressure on the nipple, it can cause tearing to begin.  I have contacted the manufacturer twice, and they are sending me another set of replacement nipples, my second set now.  They also mentioned that the nipples need to be replaced after 2 months, as opposed to 3 in other cases.
