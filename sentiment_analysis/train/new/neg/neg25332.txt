I loved - LOVED - these shells! They were the only ones I purchased and for a while I was glad. They were the only diapers that I could use to contain my daughter's... messes.The only problem is that they were not going to fit her to 40lb; she was 15lb and on the second to last elastic leg hole on several of the shells, other shells of the same brand she was on a different leg hole. Not great quality control. I had read that the customer service of the manufacturer was lousy but I sent them a message about the problem and got a prompt reply - send them in and they'll be fixed. Yay!So I sent them in. It's been over 2 weeks; I have called and emailed them four times asking where my shells are and have gotten no reply. I have spent 30% of the purchase price of these shells to get them repaired and replace them temporarily and now I have run out of disposables and have had to purchase a different brand of shells because I don't know when, if EVER, I will get these back. It has been a lot of extra money that I was not expecting to spend when I bought these. Very, very, very disappointed. $200 gone.
