The other reviews are amazing, but these are too big to swaddle my (9 lbs. at birth) 17-day old baby. There is a ton of extra fabric when swaddling. Also, they are getting crunchier with each wash, not softer. They are good looking and somewhat useful, but not as swaddling blankets... BTW, the fabric is GAUZE not muslin. Muslin is the sack-cloth that dress forms are covered with and patterns are made with. It is not terribly soft and certainly does not stretch. You can make your own gauze blankets for cents on the dollar compared to this cost. I was so excited to get these, but have found little use for them, other than to dress up photos of baby.
