I hoped that the manufacturer/distributor would have corrected the issue of the smell.  I purchased these for Similac single serve formula for a long road trip. It was so bad that during my test run, my baby vomited all over me after just a few minutes and refused to use them.  As soon as I went back to regular bottles/nipples, my baby was happy to eat once again.  It made travelling harder without these disposable nipples, but I didn't have a choice.
