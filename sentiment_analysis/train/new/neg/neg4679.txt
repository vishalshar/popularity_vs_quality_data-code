I do like the product, and it really looks nice in my daughter's outdoor themed bedroom, but I have a thing for faulty advertising.  As others have said, the picture they show of the butterflies at night is NOT what it looks like at night.  All you get is a very faint outline..and I mean faint..  My daughter's ceiling stars are MUCH brighter.If not for that seriously misleading photoshoped night photo I might have given them 5 stars...they've been up for over a year now and still look fantastic.  Hopefully some lower ratings will make people look at the reviews before they buy..and who knows, maybe get the photo removed.
