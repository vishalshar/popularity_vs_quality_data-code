When i started potty training my son i thought this product was genius. Installing it was a little difficult. My son could sit on it very well. But when he sits down to go poo poo, and then pees, the pee comes out the cracks. So i'm always having to clean up pee every time he goes poo poo. The piece of plastic that comes down that's supposed to block the pee pee should be longer, and then this would be perfect.
