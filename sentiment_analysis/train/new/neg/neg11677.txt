The amount of light this nighlight puts out is just right for us--enough to see the stairs but not so bright that it keeps us awake if our bedroom door is open.  However:- It's not as smooth and sleek-looking as the picture. It's curved, not flat, and the lights are right where the sockets are, it's not a single panel of light as I was expecting.- The sensor is not sensitive enough--the light never goes off, even with bright sun shining through the window.- My toddler was able to pull this out of the socket the first morning (and we don't have paneled or textured walls). My husband put double-sided tape on the inside and that seems to be working out.
