I bought this clip specifically because it was the Graco name, thinking that it would fit in the space the original one did under the carseat... It did not, and they are bigger and bulkier than I expected.  While they do the job of locking the belt and I appreciated the value if having two, I was disappointed they won't be convenient to carry with the seat at all times.
