Fairly narrow and too slippery. Baby can scoot right off of it with a well placed kick (and at only two-three weeks old).On the other hand, is very waterproof - but that's not necessarily best. Super waterproof surface just means liquids go straight down baby's back, running all over the pad like mercury on tile floor. An ideal pad would be water resistant but not fully water proof. I can simply dry it if I get it wet. All in all, much too plasticky but still the price is right.
