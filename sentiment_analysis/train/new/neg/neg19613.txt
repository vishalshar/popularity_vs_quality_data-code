When I first bought this product a year ago, I would have given it 5 stars.  It is so wonderful to see what the kids are doing in the back, without having to guess or turn around to see what they are doing.  I felt it greatly increased my safety while driving.  I even have a built-in mirror in my van, but it isn't wide enough.Well, it appears the interior of the car got so hot this month (July in Texas) that the mirror part fell off from the plastic mount.  There was a sunshade behind it when it fell, so no direct sunlight, and this was the first time it fell or gave any indication that it would.  When it fell it must have hit the cup holder (the crack and little pieces look almost identical to the other review's photo) and tiny small pieces were on the driver's seat.  I kept hunting for the more substantial sized pieces (diameter of a pea, guessing 2 of them) around the center console but couldn't find them.  Then one of my kids spotted a piece of a glass in the back seat floor next to the sliding door (minivan).  How did a piece of glass get that far?!  I'm still looking for one more piece missing, and will thoroughly vacuum my car to make sure my children do not get cut from this.First, it should be made of tempered glass (tempered glass is the type that makes tiny round pieces and doesn't come apart, like your car windows, and it is harder to break).  Second, I'm surprised that it is even made of glass instead of some high-grade clear plastic.  Lastly, if the adhesive cannot stand up to hot temperatures (many climates will produce a very hot car interior) the glass should be secured some way other than glue or something sticky, like a plastic clamp mount around it.If you look at the other few reviews I have, I don't go out of my way to give a bad review, but instead like to share about products that I like.  But since this one is a safety hazard, I felt it was important to let other parents know.
