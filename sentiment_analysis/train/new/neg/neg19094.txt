I've been using this for my daughter for the last few months and the holder is not as good as you would think. It's pretty hard to set up, rather plastic, and after a while of sitting in one place, it sticks to the surface and is very hard to move unless you take everything off it and rip it off the surface it's on! Would not buy again
