There should be warning stickers on the legs that say "warning! Once legs are attached they do not come off!" We bought this as a transition toy for our 7 month old and upon opening it, attached the legs just to see how tall it would be. Now, we are stuck with a toy that is too tall for our child who can only sit up...guess it's going in the basement until she can stand. I don't understand why it would be made with undetachable legs. Even if we had known there's weren't removable, we wouldn't be able to use it for another baby until they can stand as well so technically it is not a transition toy.
