I purchased this product for my son to sleep better, but after realizing that there was no power cord, I wish I didn't buy it.  I changed batteries weekly.  Plus, he figured out how to open the cover and would play with it all the time.  It worked out great and I would recomend it for newborns, but when they start standing up in the crib, they will figure out how to open it.
