I'm extremely disappointed with this product. As soon as I opened the bag, a cloud of fuzz fell all over me. With the hopes that it was only due to the packaging, I shook it a little and more material kept falling down. It finally stopped after a while but with a simple pull of a body part (as soft as a baby would do it) it would happen again. Can you imagine a baby covered with and breathing this??? It's completely UNSAFE for babies!!!
