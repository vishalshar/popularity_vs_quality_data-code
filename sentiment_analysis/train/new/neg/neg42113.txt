Although this chair is of great quality and very safe im sure, my son hates it! His head falls forward when he falls asleep (after crying for quite some time) because the seat doesn't recline enough. It is very difficult to get him in and out as well because the buckles don't snap easily.  He also has cuts on his chunky legs from the harnesses. Am going to try the Chicco Nextfit!
