These worked well the first time, but then the bags were stained and no matter how hard we tried, we couldn't get them 100% clean.  We did wash them as soon as she was done eating, but the banana seemed mashed into the fibers of the mesh.  Eventually we ended up throwing them out (after about four uses each) because they smelled a little funky and were stained.  I'd say this product is just so-so.  Not particularly great and not a "must have" item, but they're ok.
