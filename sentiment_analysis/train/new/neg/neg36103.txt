When I had my first son I bought a Keekaroo changer to try to avoid the hassle of washing changing pad covers constantly.  It worked perfect and I absolutely loved it!  I bought a second one when I had my daughter because my son still enjoys using his when we change his diaper.  The second one is the reason I am giving this product 2 stars.  This one also works great and serves the purpose I am looking for like a charm.  However, I have been using it on top of my daughter's dresser, where it has been placed for about 2 months now.  This morning I moved it and noticed that the whole top of the dresser was discolored where it had been sitting in the shape of the Keekaroo.  I scrubbed and scrubbed and cannot get the discoloration to go away.  I am SO disappointed.  Great product, but buyer beware before placing it on a white dresser :(
