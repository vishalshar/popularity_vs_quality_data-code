This is less a review about the quality of these parts, but rather a commentary on Medela's sales tactics regarding bottle collars.  As most people know, there is a durability problem with the bottle collars and you need to replace these regularly.  But, you cannot buy collars by themselves, No, that would be too sensible. Instead, you have to shell out for this whole set of stuff, most of which you don't need to just get two darn collars.  I mean come on!!!  Just sell us the collars for pete's sake! This is the fourth or fifth time we have bought this set just for the collars and each time I resent Medela a little more.
