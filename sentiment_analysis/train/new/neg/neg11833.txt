I would like this item more if I didn't live in an apartment building. I have to turn off the sound because it is all static the picture is ok but has static on it too. I can not find a monitor that is good for apartments. I hope to not live in one forever and it still helps me out a little to see the baby. In the end I am keeping the monitor but it needs some inprovements.
