First of all, my set came with 2 not 3. Minus one star there. Second, pictures suggest you get different colored handles and neither of the two I got had any color. Minus another star there. Otherwise, it's $3 for a product that would be worth it even if it broke after a few uses (it hasn't, fortunately). It's a fun little toy that gives a pleasant tingly sensation when you use it on the top of your head. Even better when someone else does it for you.To be perfectly honest tho, I think my dog gets the most enjoyment out of them. If I could post a video of his eyes rolling back and him drifting off once I start using it on him, I would. Every time I bring it out he starts to give me the same look he does when I open up the jar of peanut butter. If his opinion is worth anything on Amazon, he'd probably give it 5 stars.
