The photo of this product does not accurately reflect what is shipped.  The problenm is with the fabric that connects the two sides of the mirror together.  In the photo, there is no fabric filling in the gap between the two sides.  The product that is shipped has fabric that fills in the space between the two sides.  This causes this product to topple over easily because you cannot open the mirror up to a large enough angle.  It is constantly falling over.As for the mirror itself, it is simply a funhouse style mirror that stretches and contorts your baby's face in all directions.  I am left wondering what sort of developmental effect this actually has on a child.Our baby loves looking at himself in a real mirror when we hold him up to it.  Unfortunately, he is not as enthusiastic about seeing himself in this mirror.
