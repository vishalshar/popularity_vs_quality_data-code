the pillow is not cool and comfortable, it awful and uncomfortable, i have a 120 dollar paper weight. the seam on the cover is coming apart in a small area. i got the message that you do not take returns but know where on the amazon web site about this pillow did it say no returns so am i supposed to go your website specifically before i buy something from you or another nonamazon seller just to check because the retailer fail to tell people this. i feel this is a failure on your part and amazonsthank you for your time
