My toddler and baby love this bath toy and play with it a bunch. I wish I hadn't bought this because it has ruined our tub. The coloring from the ring has left red and yellow marks all over our tub that we cannot remove no matter what we've used to clean or how hard we scrub. Maybe if your child plays with this without banging it up against the sides to catch the fish, then you won't have the same problem. We now just use it at the pool.
