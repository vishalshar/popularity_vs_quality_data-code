One of the ingredients is citric acid. If you have open blisters on your nipples, like me, the last thing you want is to squeeze a lemon on them. Essentially, that is what using this product feels like. I suppose if you are not bleeding this product may provide some healing relief. But when they say sore, they mean achy not wounded. Keep that in mind before you purchse.
