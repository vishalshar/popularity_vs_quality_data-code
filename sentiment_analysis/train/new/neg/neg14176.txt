I purchased these curtains for my daughter's room.  They looked very nice on the picture so I got them even thou they were expensive. When they arrived it was the cheapest material I have ever seen.  I even had to mend the top of it because it was so poorly made.  Don't purchase this.  It is expensive and very cheaply made.
