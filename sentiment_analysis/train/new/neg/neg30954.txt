I have two prior stollers before I purchased this Jeep Tandem Traveler.  As I thought that this was a good brand, I was wrong.  I had the stroller delivered to Las Vegas since I was going to spend the holidays there with my family.  We were able to use it in Las Vegas from Dec. 25 to Jan. 5.  Between those times, it was already showing a little defect on the handle.  It would not go down smoothly.  The day came that I had to go back to my home country the Philippines.  As we were nearing the last x-ray check at Mccarran Airport in Las Vegas, the stroller handle would not go down anymore.  To be able to fold the stoller, the handle must go down.  Can you imagine the embarassment we had to go through.  We held up the line for 20 mins. In the end, they had to fly it un-folded.  Now, I am back in the Philippines and the stroller would not fold anymore.  I have an unusable stroller since I could not fold it and put it in the trunk of the car.  This is not a good brand and I will be requesting for a refund for this item. But there is a catch, they just emailed me that I can only return the item from the delivery address but I'm already back in the Philippines.  The shipping cost to send the item back to where it was delivered is more expensive than the value of the item itself.  What a waste of money.
