I bought this to use while we were travelling and had it sent to our US hotel in advance of our arrival.  BE WARNED THAT THIS PRODUCT IS FAR TOO SMALL TO USE ON A US KING SIZE BED.  It is designed for a NZ king size bed which is much smaller than a US king.  We were unable to use this product.  I gave it a 3 star only because it seems durable and a good idea.  Also, for travel purposes it is quite heavy and bulky.
