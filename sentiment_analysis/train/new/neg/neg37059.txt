I bought two of these and while my.baby has a preference for silicone spouts, these leak horribly when they aren't upright (which is 90% of the time).  My baby soaks her clothes and my diaper bag gets wet if they tip over.  Unfortunately these don't come with a lid either.In the positive side, the spouts are soft silicone as described.  The cups are cute and hold 8 oz.Because of the leaks with thinner liquids lied milk and juice, we've started using them for smoothies instead.  The hole in the spout really is plenty big enough without getting clogged (thus the leaking) and the thicker liquid makes for less mess than other drinks.I wouldn't buy these again, even though we've found another use for them.
