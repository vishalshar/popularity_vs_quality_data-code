The colors are wonderful, brighter than I was expecting, but not too bright. The fabric on the mat is very smooth and nice feeling. The toys seem great and as others have mentioned, the bird plays several catchy tunes.I do have a few problems with this gym though. First: it comes with 6 links to attach the toys to the gym. Looking at the photo you would think that would be enough, it's not. The product photo actually shows 7 links being used (2 each for each teether, 1 for each rattle type toy, and 1 for the bird in the center). I thought the link for the bird came with the toy, but you actually need to use one of the 6 included. Basically what this means is that it is impossible to hang the toys as shown in the picture unless you get additional links, you need 1 more to make it work.Second: The instructions say not to cross the toy bars for set-up. I tried it both ways and the crossed bars are by far the most stable. When I set it up so they are parallel, as per the instructions, it seems very flimsy. I am afraid my daughter will give a yank on one of the toys and pull it down on top of her (it falls to either side, doesn't stand up well). I'm going to fool around with it some more and see if I can get the parallel bars to work.Third: As others have mentioned, the batteries in the bird cannot be replaced, meaning when it stops playing you have to throw it away and find another toy to replace it. This seems like a waste, especially since the bird toy isn't one you can just go and buy a replacement for.Overall I like the gym for my daughter but it does have several issues.
