First off, I've purchased this particular wubbanub tabby in the past (from a different retailer), so I'm familiar with the quality and what it's supposed to look like. The "official" photo in the listing IS accurate. Which is why I ordered it. The product that I received is of a different quality. Not sure if I received a fake, or if wubbanub has changed the quality of the product from the original version. If wubbanub has indeed made changes from the original, then actual photos of the "new" version should be advertised. The one that I received feels "cheaper", is lighter in weight, and the fur and stripes is also different from original. Hard to explain but the original had a different texture and stripes was colored into the fur (if that makes sense). The one that I received had stripes that are printed on top of fur. I feel like this was a bait and switch. Just look closely at the photos I attached in comparison to the photo in listing.
