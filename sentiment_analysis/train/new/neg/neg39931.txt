the pros:I like the wide angle of the mirror, the double pivots let you change the angle easily, it also have a good size.the cons:one of the suction cups does not work properly (not clinging to the glass for more than two seconds).the visor clip slip easily when turning the car, and it might fall when hitting speed bumpsthe mirror shakes a lot when driving (due to it's double pivots) which requires more time to analyse what does it reflect (is my baby smiling? or he is about to cry?) .
