We've had this since January and I'm just now getting around to review it since I'm tired of seeing it taking up space in the bathroom.Although this bears a passing resemblance to the real Sophie teething toy, do not be fooled. It is made of a hard plastic that is not at all good for teething. I am a strong grown man and even I have trouble compressing it just to get the water into it. Making it spray the water out of the pinhole in it's mouth is not something any child is going to be capable of doing -- I can barely get one or two pathetic squirts out, even though it's filled with water. How else to get the (bath) water out? Yep, it's gross to think about...While there is what looks like a life-preserver ring around the figurine, ostensibly to make it float, it DOES NOT FLOAT UPRIGHT. It lamely bobs on its side with half its face underwater, looking stupid.So, you can't teeth on it, you can't use it to squirt water effectively, and it doesn't actually float well. What's it good for then? Your guess is as good as mine, but I feel like I've been swindled by actually paying ($14.83) for what really is just a piece of useless crap. Keep on looking, is my advice.Dec 9, 2013 UPDATE: Since posting this review, I decided to go ahead and drill a hole in the bottom of this toy right where the dimple is. It probably should be redesigned to have a hole in it, so I'm posting this info for the benefit of those who've already bought it. We're finding that it both works better this way in terms of squirting and draining for cleanliness.I still STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST purchasing this product for the reasons laid out above in my original review from October.
