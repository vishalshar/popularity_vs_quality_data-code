I really wanted to love this diaper.  This thing is just so frigging huge.  It does not fit under Flip covers or Bummis whisper wraps.  You can kiiiiinda MAKE it fit, but one wrong move by the baby and there's going to be a leak zone peeking out.  It is fairly absorbent though, so I guess if you have a giant cover and maybe a hemp insert, you could use this for an overnight heavy wetter.  I wasn't really looking to spend more $ on another cover that will only get used with one specific fitted diaper.  It appears to be made quite well and I like the way it snaps, but for us, it's just more trouble than it's worth.  Maybe if I get adventurous and get into wool this will come back out from the back of my stash.
