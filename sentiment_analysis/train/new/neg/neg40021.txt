I will not recommend this spoon for babies who are starting self-feeding. This is a rather long spoon and I was perpetually worried that my little one will activate his gag reflex when he pushes too much of the spoon into his mouth. My LO also ate more and enjoyed more of his food after I switched over to the fisher price self feeding spoon which has a short handle and hence a lower risk of activating his gag reflex.
