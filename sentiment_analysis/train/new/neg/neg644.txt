This monitor seemed nice at first, but it is an unreliable piece of junk. The antenna came loose within a couple weeks of light use (no dropping, rough handling, or much use at all since our baby slept in the same room as us, and we only needed the monitor during naps). Perhaps this was the root of our problems with the range. We have a one story, 1800 sq.ft house, and it constantly drops out of range, beeping throughout the night as it drops and picks up the signal. I hate that, but can live with it. The part that makes this monitor worthless is that at least five times, I have woken to the sound of my daughter screaming from across the house and found that the monitor definitely had the volume turned up, and the video was working, but no sound was coming out. I was furious! Do not buy this piece of junk! I bought it because I trusted Samsung, it seemed like a higher end product, and I wanted to be able to use it for future children as well. No way; I will be getting a different monitor if we have another baby, and it will not be a Samsung!
