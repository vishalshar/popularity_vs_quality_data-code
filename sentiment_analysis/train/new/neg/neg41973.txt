Since my China cheapie pocket diaper inserts just weren't cutting it absorption-wise, I decided it was time to try out prefolds, and Econobum's trial pack seemed a good place to start. I was not impressed by how cheap the cover feels, although not terribly surprised considering the price. Despite feeling cheap, it rarely leaks...so that's a plus. It is huge in the butt though. If you want to stuff the diaper to the point the baby can't move, this is the cover for you. You can literally put 3-4 normal prefolds (2-3 Econobum prefolds) or flats padfolded in it and still get the cover to fit around them all.The prefolds in this kit leave much to be desired. They are incredibly bulky and too long for babies under about 9 months to a year old. Folding the excess diaper down made it so bulky it was impossible for my 5 month old to roll over (not to mention, his pants wouldn't fit over the diaper!). Also, they absorb about as well as China cheapies microfiber inserts or Gerber 3-ply prefolds (they were my 2nd attempt at prefolds). I would expect a diaper that is this bulky to at least come close to or exceed the absorbency of a normal name brand prefold so it can be salvaged as a night-time diaper, but no such luck here. I use cloth diaper friendly detergent and don't use fabric softeners, so that's not the issue.My recommendation if you want to try out prefolds: skip these and go with a good-quality, name brand prefold or flat. You will very likely be discouraged from using what should be a highly-effective, affordable diapering option if these are your first experience with prefolds.
