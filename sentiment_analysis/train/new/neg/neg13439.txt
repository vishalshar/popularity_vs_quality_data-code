Still in discussion with company however they are not very helpful. Ordered whole bedroom set (13 pc bedding, mobile and lamp). Lamp  shade borders are taped on and were falling off upon arrival, mobile does not fit correctly on crib and initial order of bedding was missing two items and have recently discovered a tear in the quilt due to poor stitching. Normally do not complain but if baby wasn't expected any day would return and reorder. Not a satisified customer!
