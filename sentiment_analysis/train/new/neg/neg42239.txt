I really liked the idea of this and the first couple of times we used it it worked really well. If you're traveling, you can get Starbucks to fill it up with hot water and heat up your bottles on the go. Unfortunately, it started leaking after the first couple of uses. The hot water spilled into the plastic cover and then poured all over me when I opened it, burning me. It is now leaking constantly, even after adjusting the seal to try to get it to do its job. Water has spilled all over me and all over my diaper bag, soaking everything in it. I can't recommend buying it. It would be better to just get a regular thermos and carry a separate vessel to heat the bottle in.
