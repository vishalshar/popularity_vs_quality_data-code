From crazzeto's wife:We have a 1999 Corolla and the shoulder belts move too much too keep the carseat base from flipping over, so we ordered this clip. It keeps the belt from moving quite as much, but not enough for me to really feel safe with the carseat in it. We have decided to sell the car and get one more family-friendly. It's worth mentioning, though, that corollas are known to have problems with moveable seatbelts causing carseat incompatability so if your car's belts aren't quite as loose as ours this clip may end up solving your problems even if it didnt' solve ours.
