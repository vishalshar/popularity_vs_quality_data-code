I had two Combi carriers and I liked the idea of being able to attach the carriers to a stroller, which led me to this purchase.  When I received the stroller, the first thing I noticed was that the stroller was extremely heavy and bulky:  I could just imagine my wife pulling her back trying to lift this thing in and out of the trunk.  The next thing I noticed was that the safety bar would not stay in place.  The safety bar is kept in place with cheap plastic and tension.  The plastic was flimsy so it did not create enough tension to keep the bar in place (see picture below).  For such an expensive stroller, I thought I would get top notch quality: I was disappointed.  I returned this stroller and went with the Britax B Agile Stroller system: the stroller was cheaper, lighter, and better built.  I do NOT recommend this stroller.
