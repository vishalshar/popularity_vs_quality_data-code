We've had this mattress for a few months. My daughter loves it and it seems very comfortable.We are having an issue now because the cover is not actually waterproof and we had been told it was. The online store we bought it from told us it was waterproof. Multiple reviews and comments as well as what I gathered from the Nook website I was under the impression that it was. Everyone seems to say it is and that it can be conveniently washed. IT ISN'T WATERPROOF. This seems like a high price to pay for a mattress that then you need to go ahead and buy and organic mattress cover for. Although, if you knew that going in maybe it's not such a big deal. I'm afraid mine may be ruined now since after so many months, my daughter had an accident on it the other night. It's now still wet. This would also be impractical for moving houses, etc or any risk the mattress could get wet and ruined.From Nook:"A little bit of background about the technology used in the wrap. The Nanosphere Technology is an non-toxic water-based treatment similar to that of Nike Dry Fit or Lululemon allowing for the wicking of moisture and a protected sleep space. The Nanosphere coats each fiber of the fabric prior to its assembly. This allows for continued air flow in and throughout the mattress. This is not a solid coating that blocks oxygen from moving through the fabric, but a protective functional non-toxic seal around the individual fibers. Our wraps are water-resistant, and this allows small messes to bead up on the surface of the wrap for up to an hour and a half at which point they are easily wiped away.  Our wraps are not waterproof - as waterproofing material requires plastic or chemical agents.  For protection from larger messes, associated with potty training, a water-proof mattress pad should be applied on top of the wrap to protect the core below.
