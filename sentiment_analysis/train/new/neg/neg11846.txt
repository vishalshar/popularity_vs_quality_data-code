Good booster seats but expected to be a little more narrow. Ordered these for my kids so it wont take so much space in the back seat like a regular car set would. Also if they made these with anchor straps on the bottom to make it feel more secure would've been great also. Overall i still recommend this to parents that have children that overgrew their current full car seat. Especially if you have multiple vehicles and have to swap them around alot. This product makes it easier.
