We have been using this just over a month.Pros:It was really easy to set up.Nice appearance.Although a lot of people said the picture wasn't clear I think it's pretty good. The more light the clearer the picture. When the lights are out it it a bit grainy and black and white but I can still make out my baby.Also we have it mounted on the wall right next to the crib and we can get almost the whole crib on the screen.Automaticily turns the screen of to save the battery when not on the charger.When the volume is on low you don't hear every grunt and little fuss but if they start crying you hear that well.Cons:After only a month I'm having problems with the volume up button not working all the time.We bought it so my husband who works evenings could wifi in to see the twins, however, this feature doesn't work more often than it works. It'll say camera offline. I will reboot the router over and over, sometimes it works sometimes it won't.Some people mentioned a lag time when watching from online. We discovered that it didn't lag at first but after several minutes of watching it did. Then he just hit the refresh button and it was fine again.Overall I would probably still buy it knowing what I know. I just wish companies would stop taking shortcuts when making things. It has the potential to be a great monitor.
