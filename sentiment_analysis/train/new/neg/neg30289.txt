Unlike some other reviewers I really didn't find it hard to put together.  If you've owned enough discount furniture, it's all kind of similar.  We have owned this for a few months, minimal minimal use.  (Put it together, have been filling it with the few clothes we've gotten.  Babies are not due until May!!)  The drawers are already falling off the tracks.  We are trying to come up with some kind of fix so that we don't have to trash it and buy a different one.  I really got it for the color- hard to find pecan furniture.  I regret buying it though.  It's attractive, but a waste of money if it doesn't work.Update: We ended up fixing it by adding some washers/cardboard behind the tracks for the drawers to narrow the space.  Works well now.
