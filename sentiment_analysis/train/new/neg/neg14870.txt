The design is very cute and the fabric is soft and decent quality, but the entire set had a terrible odor... so strong that we could smell it through the packaging. I washed the set three times (the last time in hot water with a splash of bleach) and a faint smell still remains. It's usable, but it'll take some more work to finally get rid of the smell completely.  I'm not sure if it is some sort of chemical, or animal  urine, or some combination of the two, but the smell was gag-inducing.Aside from the smell, the comforter is thin but adequate, the fabric has a silky feel to it, and the sheets are generous in size and perfect for our toddler/crib mattress.
