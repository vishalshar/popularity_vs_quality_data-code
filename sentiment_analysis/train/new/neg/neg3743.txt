I bought these for my 12lb infant and found that they did not breath or fit very well and leaked right away. They were too big and did not hold the cloth diaper at all. The cloth diaper fell apart under the cover even with the use of snappies holding them on. Also the legs holes seemed to be cut too low compared to the rise and my infant has chunky thighs and the elastic leg holes pinched his skin too much.  I do not recommend these and would recommend a fitted diaper cover with velcro so it can conform to your babies shape.
