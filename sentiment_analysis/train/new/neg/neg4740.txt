Ugh, I really didn't want to write a negative review, but it is what it is.  I ordered this product and it arrived relatively quickly, so that was a huge bonus.  Upon opening the package and removing all the parts, I was completely overwhelmed by the smell of the wood stain.  The odor was so strong, I had to place all the wood items outside on my balcony in hopes that the smell would subside.  Upon removing the different parts, I noticed that the headboard was cracked.  There was an indentation in the middle of the crack that was an obvious indication of stress from all the different parts in the box.  I called the Foundations (manufacturer) 800 number and the representative Tanya was awesome.  I emailed her photos and provided the PO and they processed my request for new headboard immediately.So, back to the smell:  So, with my wife pregnant, this item had to be returned immediately as it is giving the both of us extreme headaches. Just by how strong the odor was, this product was packaged the within 24 hours of staining and not given time to breath/cure in a ventilated space.  Even the box had to be put outside!I wish my review was in regards to the integrity of the crib, but unfortunately we never had the opportunity to assemble it and try it out.  I hope that nobody else was subjected to this.  It looked super-cool too!
