Bought this for my 2 year old daughter. It's cute and it works well, but I don't think it's in the slightest bit "huggable" (product description.) I had imagined it would be made of a soft rubbery material but it's actually just hard plastic. My daughter likes it but it's not worth $21 imo; $15 MAYBE. Hopefully her younger brother will be able to use it when he's a little older. I don't think I would recommend it to friends.
