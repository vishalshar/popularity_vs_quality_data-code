Zipper construction is all plastic.  Within an hour of receiving it the zipper broke.  It came off the teeth.  It is fine having plastic teeth, but not a plastic zipper...  Love the design.  (wished it was large enough to fit a standard size paper) My daughter loves wearing her "pack pack" like the big kids and putting treasures in it.  Just wished it were a little more sturdy.
