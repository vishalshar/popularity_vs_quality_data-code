We purchased 2, both work the same. Whatever mechanism the dinosaur relies on to turn on is very faulty. It often takes much more than a gentle tip to activate, and most of the time we find ourselves turning it upside down and shaking it to get it to come on. The time it stays lit also varies; sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes the full 30. It is cute, but not functional. I wish it worked.
