These pads are so much more comfortable than traditional disposables. However, these particular pads are a little shorter than the regular size for disposables, and the back (the part that lays against your underwear) is silky smooth, which means that a lot of movement can cause it to slide out of place. I've been wearing these for about 6 months, and I've had three leaks. I wore one of these pads on a walk and then for sprints and the pad slid so far that it was not functioning at all. I recommend getting a longer pad for average activity levels and a different design for high levels of activity.
