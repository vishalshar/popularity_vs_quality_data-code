This highchair cover isn't padded or thick.  It's simple to put on, folds up into a package that fits into a diaper bag, and does the job of covering a high-chair at a restaurant.  I like it for that.  I've seen thicker ones that are more padded.  That might be better for a younger child who needs extra stability. It also doesn't double as a shopping cart cover, so you'd have to get a separate one of those. There's nothing wrong with this product, but it doesn't have anything that makes me want to rate it 4 or 5 stars.  It is literally "just OK." On the upside, it's inexpensive.
