This gate was impossible to assemble. The instructions are not clear at all and have no words; only diagrams that don't really make a lot of sense.  It took two of us almost three hours to assemble and mount it, only to realize that it wasn't going to do the job.  I actually returned it because I felt that It wasn't safe enough to use.
