Although it works really well and helps keep baby position I'm very disappointed that the Velcro scratchy part is on the wrong side!! Catches on everything, have to do laundry load with this on its own,  blankets to my sweaters it's ruined tons of things. Soft side should have been on the case, not the strap.
