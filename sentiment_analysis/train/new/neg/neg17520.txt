Adorable, but the app that is to be used in conjunction with this product is very glitchy. Not a lot for kids to do on the app anyways. The clear plastic that covers the screen is great for protection but a bit big and interferes with the functionality of the touchscreen. Overall, boxed it back up and will be selling it on Ebay because the return shipping was more that the toy itself.
