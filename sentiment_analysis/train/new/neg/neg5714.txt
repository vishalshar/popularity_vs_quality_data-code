The cradle looks excellent it has a proper space for the child to be comfortable and it's very safe. At first I thought that it was going to be very loose because of the simple connections you use to connect every piece, but it exceeded my expectation. The reason that I'm giving it a middle score is because of the kind of errors that came with the package, some pieces were repeated and other where missing, it was kind of hard to assemble everything and because of that one of the drawers doesn't close well. Another problem was that one of the pieces came partially broken. To sum up, its a beautiful cradle but you need to make some adjustments to make it work.
