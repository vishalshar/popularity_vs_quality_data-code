I was excited when we found and ordered this crib set, however we were very disappointed when it arrived. The background color on the border of the sheet is white and the background color on the sleep sack amd blanket are an off-white/cream color. The difference is very noticable and when the blanket is laid next to the sheet it looks dingy and dirty because you assume they should be the same and both started as white. My husband actually asked if it just needed washed.
