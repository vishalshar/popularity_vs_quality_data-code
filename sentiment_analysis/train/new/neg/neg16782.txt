The toy seems to be ok, but I received it all dirty and dusty. 2 out of 6 baby toys that I bought at Amazon this time came dirty (another one had a gum and a hair on it)... I'm not returning as I'm from another country, but Amazon needs to do something about the storage of the toys - they are for babies and need to be safe and clean!
