First, the design pictured here is not the one received. It is still SpongeBob, but it's a small image of him riding a bicycle, which is not near as cute as this one would have been! We still like it though because my toddler loves SpongeBob either way. It sticks pretty well, which is nice, but it's not quite as big or provides as much shade as I had hoped. It still leaves a lot of gaps for sunlight. It does help though, so it's still an improvement! Not too bad for the price, just a shame they send you different designs...
