I wanted to like this one because it was cheaper than others, but the quality is not great.  The back cushion is kind of of lumpy and I didn't like the way it looked.  Mine was quiet when I sat and rocked and it has a smooth motion, but I didn't like the appearance.  The delivery was easy and so was the return.  The company called me and scheduled a day and time for delivery and they were very kind and helpful.  I wish I liked it more.  Amazon has such great service.
