I'm obsessive about keeping my baby's play area clean. I tried Babyganics wipes but couldn't take the weird smell.  I usually use Dapple Nursery wipes but at $6.99 for a canister of 75 wipes, I thought I'd give these Arm & Hammer wipes a try.  Unfortunately, I'm going to switch back to Dapple as I really didn't like how dry these wipes are.  It didn't really clean as well as I hope.  The only plus these wipes have over others are the price and the lack of odor.
