These light bulbs don't last 35,000 hrs. as advertised.  I bought 4 in mid April 2015, and the first one burned out after about 5 months of use, the second just burned out a day or two ago, after roughly 10 months of use.  I use them as outdoor porch lights and leave them on from dusk to dawn, so averaging at most 12 hours per day.  The first one didn't last more than 2000 hrs, and the second one barely made it past 4000 hrs. of use.  So even at less than $3 per light bulb, they are not the bargain I thought they would be.  Definitely will be getting something else to replace these when the last two get burned out.
