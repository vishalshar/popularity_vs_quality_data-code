I got this sling because I liked the moby wrap but hated all of the wrapping, adjusting and sagging that occurred with it. This sling is really easy just slip it on and slip baby in.I bought the large because I read so many reviews that the regular was too small. I cinched it down as much as possible and I think it fits great.My baby is 3 months and fits nicely in it when she is laying in it like a hammock but her feet seem a little scrunched and she gets fussy in it after about a half hour so I don't think she is very comfortable.I do like that she is propped up more so she can look around more than the other carrier I have that pushes her into my chest. Maybe when she has more head/neck control she will like the hip seat position.As others have mentioned it does put a lot of weight on my shoulderI will likely be keeping this wrap in my diaper bag for short trips to the store or walks around the block. The price is great compared to some carriers out there and is so easy to use that I can get it on and get her in it without the help of a second person (this is not the case with many other slings and carriers out there)Overall I'm glad I purchased this sling
