My baby loved this until the metal screw stripped the plastic base and detached. This exposed a two inch metal screw which my wife saw immediately, thank god! Maybe I just got a defective one, but it isn't worth the risk if you ask me. There should be a better way to connect the base to the wheel besides a huge screw!
