This rating is based on the color and not the application of the product since there isn't much to comment on a piece of material used to protect your seat.  I purchased the BEIGE color and received what I called GRAY.  The outside packaging does say BEIGE and has a color sample that is indeed BEIGE by normal standards, yet the product was NOT the same color as denoted on the packaging color sample.  We thought we received a defect and ordered a replacement.  Interesting enough the replacement was identical in the color as what we perceived as defective, thus it's going back again.  Perhaps we were part of a bad color batch, but it indeed was not BEIGE as I needed to match the seats.
