I bought this when it was a great price for our spare seat in my husbands truck. Here are some of my observations.-it's HUGE. Like side to side it takes up a lot of space.-it's very light, which you would think is nice but when it comes to a car seat it makes me nervous. Like how sturdy can it be if it's so light?-it is a pain in the butt to install when using the latch system. It just has cheap clips not the nice kind that pricier seats have. And I have the hardest time tightening and loosening the latch strap. I have to make my husband do it after I usually end up cursing at it a little bit.-it doesn't have protective cushions on the straps so my son usually ends up with red marks on his neck from where they dig into him.Overall, it's ok for a cheap spare but I wouldn't want this for my every day car seat. We have 2 other brands in addition to this one and this is my least favorite of the 3.
