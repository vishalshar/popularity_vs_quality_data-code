Like a few others here, the set I received was missing pieces (the 2 pacifiers). I got these in October for my December little one, and only started using the bottles a couple weeks ago. I only just noticed that we didn't have the pacifiers in the sterilizer and there seems to be no way to contact Philips about this. Disappointing. The bottles themselves seem to be ok, except my baby seems to get medium flow out of these "slowest flow" nipples, and he's pretty gassy (not sure if due to nipples or if that's just how he is, haha!) Also, the valves drip sometimes if the bottle isn't held with them facing up.
