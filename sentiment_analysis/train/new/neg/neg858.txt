In the beginning these worked well.  If the bottles were too full, there is pressure build up in the bottle and would spill through the straw.  i would squeeze open the straw as i put on the cap to avoid this from happening.  This worked fine for a month.Last week i had a couple of really bad spills from one of the cups and didn't know what was wrong.  i heard the "click" and everything was fine.  Today i realized one of the cups kept leaking whenever it was tilted.  The milk was dripping from the top and i noticed the 2 ends where the cap would 'click' onto the small tabs on the bottle were broken and so there were 2 holes on each end of the cup.  i believe the click motion ensures the cap is on but it also pushes on to these tiny tabs each time and the plastic just didn't hold up.i'm a bit disappointed at how soon it failed.  i will try my luck with another brand as this is not very long lasting.
