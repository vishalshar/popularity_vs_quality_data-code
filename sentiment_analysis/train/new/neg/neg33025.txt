We purchased this stroller to replace our MacLaren Triumph, which was past it's usable life cycle. For an older kid (2-4) we didn't need the recline feature and we wanted something simple and lightweight for taking on the subway.What we like:- The weight. This is such a light stroller and good for city/subway use. Not too big and easy to carry up and down stairs. The Maclaren feels like a lead weight compared to this.- The color.- Removable seat fabric for easy washing. No worries about that spilled ice cream.What we don't like:- The fold! The second time we tried to fold it up, the seat side fabric got caught in the folding mechanism and ripped. Still usable, but not so attractive. A few weeks later the other side ripped too. Also not a big deal except for aethestics. BUT you also have to fold in the fabric every time you fold the stroller. An extra step I don't really want to take with an active toddler!- Brakes. Unlike the Maclaren, these are push-down foot brakes. Take a big stride while you're walking, accidentally step on the brake, and the wheel will lock.  Wham! That's OK now, however, since both brakes broke after about 4 months.The bottom line: I would hesitantly recommend this ONLY as a part-time stroller for light use. It's not going to work as an everyday mode of transportation. After 6 months, we're on the market for something new.
