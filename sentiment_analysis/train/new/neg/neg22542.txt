Be careful when you purchase this to select the shipping option carefully. I have Amazon Prime, which typically defaults to the free 2 day shipping option. Since this is not a prime eligible item, I had to pay shipping. I've never had a problem before, but with this item it defaulted to the 2 day shipping option (rather than the cheaper slower option) and I clicked through so quickly that I didn't change it. Cost more for shipping than it did for the product. Amazon was unapologetic.The product itself is great. My daughter loves her loveys - we got one as a shower present and then had to buy more so we could cycle through them and keep them clean. However, each time I buy one they look a little different. Tag in a different spot, embroidered eyes nose and ears a different color, etc. We will not be able to fool her that they are all just one for much longer.
