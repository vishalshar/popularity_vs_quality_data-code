Plus side:- The straw follows the liquid - good for when my daughter tips back the cup or when the liquid is low- Easy to hold and my daughter loves to play with the capNegative side:- It LEAKS!!  - It seems like the milk/water gets stuck in the straw and then pressure or temperature change forces the liquid to spew out when you open the cap.  I just cleaned up a puddle of milk this evening- It is hard to clean the inside of the straw and I worry that old milk or old juice will rot in there
