When looking for a high chair for my second child, I wanted something versatile that he could use for as long as possible.  I originally bought the Graco DuoDiner LX Highchair as it had great reviews and had the versatility that I was looking for.  Once I received it and put it together, I hated it right away.  For the price, it still looked cheap, I didn't like the feel of the material and the tray table was hard to put on and off. I had been eyeing the Peg-Perego Prima Pappa for awhile but didn't think that it was worth spending $200 on a high chair.  Well since I didn't like the Graco, I figured I might as well just spend a little more and get what I really wanted for my son so I bought this high chair. I don't regret that decision at all.  The Peg-Perego looks as nice in person as it does in the pictures, folds up nicely to store away when not in use and is easy to clean, which I found surprising as a lot of the reviews I read said that it wasn't.  The one big surprise I found was that the seat cushion comes completely off. You just have to unsnap around the arms and then just pull it up and off. I can easily then just spray all the crumbs and goop off in the shower and let it dry overnight... very easy.  When I'm not in the mood to do all that, the cushion wipes down easily and though it does have nooks where food can fall in, you can just run a wet paper towel through it and brush them out.  The  shoulder straps comes off quite easily as well and I've thrown them into the washing machine and air dried them perfectly fine.  Again compared to the Graco, this high chair rolls around much more easily and smoothly and doesn't take up too much room in my small dining room.  My only gripe is that the tray table doesn't always go on very smoothly but I usually don't take it off. I slide it out and then push it into the "up" position for storage so it's really not that big of a deal.I started using this when my son was 6 months old so he was a little small for the chair but at that age, I didn't think was a big deal as I had him sitting in it in the recline position while I fed him his pureed food and wasn't using the tray table at all.  We kept the tray on the hooks on the back legs (another great feature) until we felt he was ready to start trying self feeding and using the tray.  The big selling point for me with this chair vs the Graco and several other high chairs is that the middle partition that goes between the baby's legs and keeps him from sliding out of the seat is affixed to the chair rather than to the tray.  When I was testing out the Graco DuoDiner, I was always worried that I might accidentally squish my son's little man parts whenever I was sliding the tray in and out and it didn't seem to hold him up as securely.  All in all, despite the higher price, I'm extremely satisfied with this high chair.***Updated review*** So now that I've had this high chair for a year, I needed to update my review primarily because of two things...1.  The seat cover is falling apart. For the price of this high chair, it's ridiculous that only after a year the cover is starting to rip in places and a small hole just developed. I thought perhaps it was because I was being overzealous with my cleaning but looks like several other reviews are starting to pop up saying the same thing.  I tried to contact peg perego via email about their warranty period but my emails kept getting returned undeliverable.. I have no time to try to call them but just tonight I saw they added a method that you can send them messages through their website so we'll see what they say to my request for a free replacement cover. I have a feeling it'll be too bad but you have to buy one.2. Tons of crevices for food to cram itself in... So at first, I thought this chair was so easy to clean but little did I realize all the various moving parts in this high chair creates microscopic thin gaps between the pieces which food still find it's way in.****Latest update***** So I was able to get in contact with Peg Perego customer service and there is a two year limited warranty so after I sent pictures to them of the rips and holes in the seat cushion, they sent me a free replacement but I had to pay $10 for shipping. This was back in October and since then I've been a little less overzealous in washing the seat cushion in the shower as I didn't want this one to rip as well. I primarily vacuumed the crumbs and wiped down any food stains. Well, I've had the new cushion for about 7 months now and I just saw that two big rips had developed on the side. Unbelievable! For the amount of design they put into this chair and for the price they're charging, it's unfathomable that they would use such cheap material. What's the point of Making this in Italy if the cushion keeps falling apart like it's made in the cheapest factory in China???
