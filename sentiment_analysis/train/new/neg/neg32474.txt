This diaper gets two stars because it has a clever design and it does the job it's supposed to do.  However, this is my least favorite diaper in the stash and I'm so glad I only bought one!  For one, it is very bulky.  My son weighs about 14 pounds, and this is the fattest diaper in the stash by far-and I use 90% prefolds so I'm used to bulk.  It's also very awkward to put on a squirming baby, with the flaps going everywhere while I snap it up.  Then you have to check and make sure that nothing has wiggled out of the cover during the process and stuff bits of flap back into the cover.  I find it very annoying to put on.  Last, it takes forever to dry.  forever.  I do live in a humid climate, which I'm sure contributes to the long dry time.  I have my Freetime hanging on my drying rack right now, and it's still damp after 24 hours.  I put several PUL covers (which dry in less than 6 hours) and several BG 4.0's (which I love and dry in about 10 hours) up at the same time, and they are long since back in rotation.  What's more, it now has that nasty damp dish towel stink from being wet so long.  I avoid putting PUL in my dryer to save energy and prolong the useful life of my diapers, but I'm going to have to stick this one in the dryer every time so that I can use it without it stinking.  Oh well, live and learn!
