This comforter is beautiful. Only one small problem! It seems to be fragile. Upon examination I found numerous stitches that were not secure. And one place about 4 inches long where the material was torn loose from the top of the product. I am not returning this due to the fact that it is so beautiful. But I will be careful not to pull nor use this as a regular bed cover.
