We have been using this stroller for about 2 months now. Its wheels keep squeaking. It is not as easy to fold as displayed in the video. My wife & two of her friends tried to fold it but in vain. You got to press the folding handle very hard.But it is quite comfortable for our kid due to extra cushion and broad space. The storage beneath the seat is quite large.
