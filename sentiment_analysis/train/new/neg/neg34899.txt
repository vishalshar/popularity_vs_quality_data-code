These are huge but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The biggest problem is that they are so big and the adhesive is just one little line that is supposed to stick to your bra. For something as large, I would assume they would add more adhesive stripes but no. They do conform to your breast and won't be so noticeable. I will not repurchase these as I didn't like them as much as the Lasinoh and Medela.
