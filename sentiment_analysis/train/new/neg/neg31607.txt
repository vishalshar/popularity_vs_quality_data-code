Product is ok. The sheets aren't very thick which is fine b/c I wanted something lightweight & like other reviews stated, they are not very soft. All this is ok, but what disappoints the most is the stitching & elastic they use. The elastic is a very thin piece, too thin to be used for fitted sheets & also for the top sheet. Then the stitching is not done well at all. It almost appears as though single thread & stitching is used. I'm hoping these hold up for 6 months. The one thing I do like is that the top sheet had the elastic at the foot off the mattress to stay tucked in; I also wish the pillow case was smaller for a toddler pillow. Save your money if you need to use these sheets for a long time
