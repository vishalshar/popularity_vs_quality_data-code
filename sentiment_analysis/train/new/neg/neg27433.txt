Im only giving this three stars because it is functional for our picnics.  It is not functional at the beach for our family of four.  The sand is so difficult to get off and it is only water resistant as far as maybe spilling a water bottle.  Now, the cleaning instructions state to cold wash and lay flat.  After the second wash it got all jumbled up and doesn't really lay completely flat.  I would recommend if this is something you are getting for a picnic blanket than can easily be wiped off.  If you are looking for something to withstand the beach, keep scrolling.
