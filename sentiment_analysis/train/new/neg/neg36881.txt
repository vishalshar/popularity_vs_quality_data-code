At first these were nice. I bought two because we were night-time training my 4yo. I knew we'd have to do a decent amount of laundry for a while. I followed the wash instructions (cold water and no-heat dry). It's been less than 2 months and the waterproof backing it already disintegrating allowing urine to seep through onto the 2nd mattress pad. And now I have to wash both every time, and now the 2nd one is falling apart. I really needed the waterproof portion to be the part to remain in tact. I'm a little disappointed. This product would be fine for a child still in diapers where you just want to protect against leak throughs or juice spills.
