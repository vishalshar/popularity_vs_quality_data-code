The rose quarts is of poor quality. It's less pink and more white.  It actually looks like white plastic balls when on.  The Amber, is way smaller than depicted in the photo.  Each piece of Amber is actually almost half the size of the quartz beads.  Would definitely recommend a necklace that is made of only Amber to get the best healing affect.
