The sun shade doesn't naturally sit any further out than the shade that came built into the stroller. We have to pull the shade crazy forward and very low to block any extra sun. We have a Graco stroller.It is cute and looks like the picture, until you try to block the sun on your walk and have to pull the shade down the front. It does keep bugs out and is breathable enough for baby girl to not get hot
