I'm still searching for the perfect bib, but for now, these are our favorites. They are small enough that they don't get in the way while my daughter plays, and they work well to absorb small spit ups and milk dribbles. The bandana shape looks cute, and we love that they have snaps (and two size options at that!). Some bandana bibs we have tried have too much fabric and bunch up around our baby's neck and face, but these don't do that.The reason these only get three stars is because they aren't very waterproof. It must be the PUL fabric that so many bibs use these days. It might be water-resistant, but it is certainly not waterproof. Our daughter gets bottles at daycare and she is still a messy eater with them. Even though these are supposed to have a waterproof inner layer, wetness soaks through to the other side, and her clothes still get wet. Our daycare provider usually straps an older, bib that really is waterproof over the Bumkins bibs during bottle feeds.
