I was really bummed and was hoping the other reviews were not correct.  We use eco-friendly diapers (The Honest Company) that are biodegradable as well as wipes so i was stoked that we found trash bags that were as eco-friendly as his diapers but unfortunately the smell got to be too much.  These really hold no smell in at all and my son's room started smelling like his diapers.  I love my Diaper Dekor and we've had no issues unless the trash can needed to be emptied (overflowing) and when we started using these.  I switched back to the old liners and have had no issue with the smell so unfortunately that tells me something about these liners.  I am sorry but I can't recommend these unless you don't mind the smell.
