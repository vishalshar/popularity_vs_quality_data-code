product really work for about 3 month, there are 4 problems I find for This junk.1. It need 4 large battery that cost about 6.89 x2 every 2 month.2. It need you to close the cap very vary hard for the fan to turn on.  6 month later that's how I broke my but I'm glad this junk broke.3. When it's not in use yes it work it doesn't stink up the whole bathroom but ever time I open the cap I have to hold my breath.4.  Every time I have to fight with my wife to change the bag cause it stink so bad for the entire day.After this garbage I got a replacement from munch that's heaven compare to this junk and then I realize how bad this thing is, I hope they go out of business so people don't have to suffer with their junk design.
