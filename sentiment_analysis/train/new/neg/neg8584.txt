It was in a registry for a baby shower so I'm hoping the person that will receive the gift likes it, but honestly...I wasn't impressed.  It's a small box with different cards and looks like it should not have cost as much as it did.  If it was for me I would have been a bit disappointed.  Hopefully she won't!
