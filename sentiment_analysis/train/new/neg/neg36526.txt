These diapers come so highly recommended and have won so many awards.  As a mom just getting started in cloth diapering (on my 3rd and last child) I was sure all my research had paid off.  I had found my go-to diaper, or so I thought.  Bummis Tots Bots Easy Fits are near perfect.  They are sturdily made, have EXCELLENT velcro, wash like a dream with no staining, dry quickly in the dryer, I could go on and on.  The one problem?  They leaked.  Consistently.  Not just one, but all 7 that I bought.  I had to change my little guy nearly immediately every time he urinated to prevent leakage.  I prepped according to instructions, used additive-free recommended detergent, no luck.  The white inner lining of the diaper would roll out along my sons legs and wick urine onto his jammies every time.  Held poo in really well though.  I called the company and they treated me wonderfully.  They tried to resolve the problem, and when they couldn't, they attempted to compensate me.  I found this to be exceptional, as there was no structural defect in the diaper, just a bad fit for my large baby.  So, I recommend giving these diapers a shot.  They are a great diaper and, if they happen to fit your baby which seems more likely than not, you're set.  If they don't, then the company is very easy to work with.  What do you have to lose?
