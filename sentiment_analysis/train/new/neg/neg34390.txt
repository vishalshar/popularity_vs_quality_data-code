I don't often leave bad reviews, but this one caused my wife and I plenty of frustration, so I'll make an exception.My wife started using this thermometer with our infant son after the hospital told us that they didn't recommend anything other than a rectal thermometer for infants. I naturally turned to Amazon for the best priced item that had reasonably good reviews, and confess I dismissed some of the negative feedback for this item as nothing more than user-error.My wife had a difficult time with getting consistent results on this thermometer until she read the packaging, and discovered that she was supposed to allow a five-minute window between subsequent tests. After she switched to doing it the way the instructions indicated--including having both the baby on his back (at first) and then on his stomach (second), we determined that the product must just be crap. We consistently get swings in temperature of over 1.5 degrees, and in some cases as high as 3.5. This is insufferable when your child's 'danger line' is around the 101 mark (as opposed to an adults, which is around 104). With such narrow margins of error, an inaccurate (and more to the point, inconsistent) result is completely unacceptable.We ended up switching to the Vicks, which I was forced to purchase locally after an evening of concern that our child might need to be hospitalized thanks to a series of temperature measurements at or above the 101 mark. The Vicks thermometer--yielding consistent results-- pegged him at 99.8 and 100.0. Good news for anyone hoping to avoid unnecessary ER visits.Just save yourself the trouble, and switch to the Vicks.Vicks Baby Rectal Thermometer: http://www.amazon.com/Vicks-V934-Baby-Rectal-Thermometer/dp/B0002AHVZU
