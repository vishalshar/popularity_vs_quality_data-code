I bought this for my 5 month old and when he was sick with a fever, this thermometer was TOTALLY USELESS. My child was burning up.....you could feel him being hot by touching him and this thermometer gave a reading of 100.6. The reading was NEVER the same twice or more times when I took it. ANd when I took his temperature with another thermometer (rectal)....ie the rectal temperature was 102!!! He clearly had a fever but this thermometer did not pick that up. Talked to my pediatrician and was told that ear thermometers are not accurate for infants less than 1 year old......so if you have a baby less than 1 year old....take the rectal temp....its the most accurate. This ear thermometer does not give the same reading even when the reading is taken in the same ear within 1 min......and its not at all accurate. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !!!
