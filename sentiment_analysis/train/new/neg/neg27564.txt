I wouldn't purchase from this company! The crib sheet is not what is pictured - it was plain pink instead. The quality is poor, and I have already had to remove the bumper because the strings that attach the bumper to the crib have fallen off - I found them inside the crib with my 17 month old - talk about a choking or strangulation hazard! Very poor quality and not worth the price. Extremely disappointed and wish I could return, but their return policy is horrible!
