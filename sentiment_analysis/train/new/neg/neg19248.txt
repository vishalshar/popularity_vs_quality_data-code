New to cloth diapering and wish I had known I needed a quick absorbing aspect to these to get them to work better. It would be nice if they had come with one sewn in already like my best bottom inserts. I am adding stuff to it so it's not the end of the world but would be a nice addition if they ever decide to redo them!
