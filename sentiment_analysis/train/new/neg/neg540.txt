I'd give it zero stars if I could. The idea is great in theory - we wanted something that fit in my purse to use at public restrooms because my daughter is potty trained but she's super tiny for her age and can't sit on a normal toilet without falling in. I found this and figured it was the answer! So wrong. This thing slides everywhere on the toilet, the couple times we used it my daughter was terrified because it moved a lot when she sat down, but we would have dealt with that. The real, very serious issue is that no matter how much you "click" the panels into place they inevitably, painfully pinch your child's skin (on the back of the thigh - OUCH!) either when they sit or get up. The couple times we used it ended with her sobbing in a public restroom and us having to cut our trips short and head home. She became afraid of using the potty and regressed in her training to having accidents. Don't waste your money on this.
