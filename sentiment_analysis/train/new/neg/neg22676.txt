We bought a bed from Ikea which has slats, and wanted to add this to make this very high bed safer. Unfortunately, because of the feet on the bars, it sits very high and creates a gap between the side of the bed and mattress, exposing the screws and creating a potential hazard where children might catch their fingers or get a toestuck. We instead purchased a bumper, which works perfectly and is much safer with that bed.
