I bought these on recommendation from a friend who swears by them, but I completely wasted my money.  They are extremely heavy (especially the 8oz size!) and have little tiny "holes/tunnels" that go through two of the plastic pieces.  They give you a little pipe cleaner-esque brush to clean out those "tunnels," but it's a pain.  You can't use other collars and nipples with these bottles either.  I hoped that these would help with a baby who spits up a lot, but it made no difference.  So, these are sitting in the back of my closet, gathering dust!
