These covers do an excellent job at keeping liquids in. I prefer the velcro to the snap they are faster to use.I would have rated them 5 star except, despite washing it everyday and hanging it in the sun, it now just smells like pee. (Im going to soak them in vinegar & see if that clears the smell. I know that will run the risk or wrecking the plastic coating rendering them useless, but frankly them smelling like pee has put me off them anyway!.)They do make the bum sweaty because they don't breathe, being plastic coated.I have just transferred over to using Lovey bums wool jersey cover. They are a little more work as you have to soak them in lanolin before use, and resoak them every month or so, but the lanolin does make them waterproof and I have found them very effective. They also breathe and my son doesn't get sweaty, great for summer!
