First one I ordered, water got into the screen and the temperature read out wouldn't work anymore, this was within the first 2 months of owning it.  Amazon kindly replaced it...the second one would NOT stay on the faucet (the first one didn't really either, but it did a better job than the second one).  So the second one had to be sent back too.  I think this is a really great idea, but it is done very poorly.  My son loves his bath a little warmer...about 101-102...this starts beeping at 100 degrees and there is no way to silence the alarm, or adjust what temperature you want the alarm to start beeping at.  Also, there is no alarm for if the water is too cold, which I think is also a big oversight.  I would not recommend this product to anyone until it has all it's "kinks" worked out, and trust me there are a few!
