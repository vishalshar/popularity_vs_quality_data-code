From reading the other reviews, I expected the 4-5T to be huge on my 39.5" tall two year old. However - see pic - it's the exact same length as her well-worn XL HALO wearable blanket, except for the feet bump-outs. As HALO says to tuck "feet in for sleeping," I was expecting the main part of the sack to be a lot longer. Because it isn't, her feet come out of it at night. This SleepSack would have been great had it worked as HALO say it should, i.e. if it were able to keep her feet in at night while still allowing them to come out for walking. However, because it doesn't keep her feet in at night, it's essentially just really baggy pajamas.
