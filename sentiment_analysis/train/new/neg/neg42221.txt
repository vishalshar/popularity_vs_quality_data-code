I usually never have time to write reviews as a mum with a full time job, a toddler and a baby at home but I made a point of coming back to review this item.  It took me a year to find out what was wrong with this 'raincoat'.  My daughter got completely wet under this coat last fall.  I assumed water got into the hood due to the wind though it was bizarre that even the sleeves, back and front were all wet.  I forgot that I shelved it last year and had her wear it again last week.  Her nanny who figured it out.  The material is COMPLETELY POROUS. I even ran water on top of it and it just drained right through the other side. Awful product.  How can they sell this as a waterproof raincoat when it is the very exact opposite.  Terrible product.  Very disappointed. Don't buy.
