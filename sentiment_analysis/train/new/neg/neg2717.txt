I bought 12 of the bumGenius 4.0 Hook and Loop and 12 of the snaps about less than a month ago. The inside fleece is unfortunately starting to pill even though I've followed the washing and drying instructions. For the price of these diapers, I believe the fleece should be of better quality.I would recommend buying the snaps over the hook and loop because the velcro does not seem like it will last a long time. Also, the laundry tabs seems like they are rough on the baby's skin. I know I wouldn't want those tabs rubbing on my skin. The velcro is easier to get on a squirming baby; however, if you buy these with the intention of using it for future kids too, I would buy the snaps.Overall, the quality of the outside cover is outstanding, inside fleece is terrible, two inserts are just ok.
