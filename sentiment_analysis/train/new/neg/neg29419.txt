First, the bumper ties literally fell off immediately. Second, the bumper itself is too short. It didn't go all the way around the crib. I had decided not to use it anyway though since after I ordered it I heard all the warnings about crib bumpers and SIDS (bumpers are a no-no). Third, the crib skirt is short (too short, but I should have checked the measurements before I ordered). Fourth, the comforter is really stiff. There is no way I would put it on top of my son. It would be uncomfortable if used as an actual blanket/comforter. I ended up just laying him on top of it, and using it as a sort of pillow-top.
