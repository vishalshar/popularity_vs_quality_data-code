This is the second maternity pillow I bought.  This is my first pregnancy and since I have to sleep on my side (I'm usually a back sleeper) I thought to buy a pillow to force me to be on a side.  The pillow itself is fine.  It's pretty comfy without being too hard or to soft.  My personal problem is that I've spoiled myself the past 6-7 years with a memory foam pillow and so using this instead of the memory foam caused my ear and head to hurt where it was laying on the pillow.  I mean, you can't really use any other pillow but this for your entire body including your head.I would have given it 5 stars if it was more memory foamish but for the product description and what it's meant to accomplish, I would give it 5 stars.  It's just not for me...
