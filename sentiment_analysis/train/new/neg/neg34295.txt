We bought Spasilk towels & washcloths 3 years ago before our daughter was born & adore them!  We still use them with her bath, although it is time to get bigger towels for her.  ;-)  So, of course, Spasilk was our first choice when registering for our soon-to-be-born son.  I had no qualms whatsoever when this towel & washcloth set came in, even though they don't look as soft or thick as our older ones do.  Then I opened the package & am now quite unhappy indeed.  The washcloths each had a strip of tape holding them together, & each & every one of them ended up with pulled strings of fabric when I undid the tape.  Very frustrating to have brand-new washcloths in this condition!  Then, I pulled out the towel & discovered that, completely unlike our daughter's towels, the embroidery is NOT covered by cloth!  Which means that the rough embroidery thread will be right up against our newborn's skin.  Seriously?!  Who makes towels for newborns/infants & doesn't think to protect them from rough fabric?  I expected Spasilk to have better quality than this.  Had I not already unpackaged all of it, this would be returned in a heartbeat!  I am a very unhappy expectant Mama!
