Pros:- The film was very easy to apply on the first try (no problems, whatsoever).- The film is thick and appears to be durable.  I have no concerns or disagreements about its level of protection.- Package includes 3 pieces, so there's no concern about "trial and error" during installation.Cons:- The matte surface is a tad too obscure / "dim" for me.  The Sero 7 Pro has a really good screen, but the film takes away some of that clarity and "brilliance" (so to speak).Note:  I was originally attracted to try this matte style b/c it was touted to reduce the appearance/distraction of fingerprints (which it does).  As with most types of online purchases, it's difficult to judge the product before actually receiving it.  To be fair, it does "work as advertised," thus my ~average-level 3-star rating.  It's just that the film is either too thick and/or too "dim" for what I'm looking for.  I think I'll prefer a clear film, and just wipe it off occasionally to remove fingerprints or grime.I'm ordering a "clear" protector from another vendor to try for comparison--not that I dislike JOTO (this is my first-ever purchase of this brand), it's just that I like to try different products / vendors, where practical.  I have a clear film on my smartphone (which I use often) and find that I don't have to wipe it off to much...looking for a similar experience for my tablet.  I'll still keep these JOTO screen protectors...just in case I want to switch back.
