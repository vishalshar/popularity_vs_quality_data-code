I received this bra today. I was initially really excited about it because I am currently pumping to build my supply, and I loathe putting on the Medela pumping bustier every 2 hours. This bra gets 2 stars for being really comfortable and true to size. I had to knock off a few stars though for the following reasons.The nipple placement on this bra doesn't work for me. This may be a personal anatomy issue, but the pump slits seem to be for a woman who's nipples are cock eyed, or turned out. My nipples face much more forward than to the side, so in order to use this I will need to see the existing slits shut and rip open the seam to create slits placed properly for me. This is actually a minor thing.The pumping slits are also very small, and the cotton material, while it feels great, is not very stretchy. Why does this matter? Again, perhaps more of a personal issue, but you cannot use a one piece pumping flange! Most standard pumping flanges, like the ones that come with most pumps, are in two pieces. I personally had to order a small size flange, which doesn't come in two piece. This will be easily solved when I create my own slits, but still a little annoying.The big issue: the pumping slits on my particular bra are completely off center, and don't even match up with each other! Of course I discovered this after I had already started to rip the seams and mark the new slits, so I can't return this, but see the attached photo to see what I mean. I put the tape measure there to show that they are literally an inch off from each other, but you can see from the center seam that the slits are totally placed differently. Even if the other issues weren't an issue, that to me is just unacceptable, and I would return this product if I still could.That being said I can't, and I am now going to make the best of a bra I hoped would be much more. With a few alterations it should work out for me, but be aware of these potential issues before you buy.
