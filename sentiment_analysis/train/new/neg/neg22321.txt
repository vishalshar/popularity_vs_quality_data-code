As an overhead gym, this worked ok, but my son enjoyed other overhead gyms much more.  As a tummy time toy, this Chicco I-Gym is very poorly designed.  You lay your child down in the middle of the floor gym, but the sides of the gym are a couple inches high and made of hard, thick plastic.  So, when baby goes to roll off his tummy, he lands his back on the hard plastic and cries.  When baby is older and can stay on his tummy longer, he is stuck in the gym and cannot scoot out of it and cries.  There are so many better overhead gyms and tummy time toys.
