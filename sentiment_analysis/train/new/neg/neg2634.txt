I needed a storage compartment for my new Chicco umbrella stroller and I thought this would be perfect.  I was wrong. This fit so tight that I could hardly put anything in the compartments.  I have an iPhone 5 and it was tight just to get it out!  I just don't see how drinks could fit in there and other things.  I am returning it and of course Amazon made it a breeze.  They are awesome! Actually I can't remember the last time I had to return anything from Amazon but this one is definitely something I will not be using. I have already ordered a different one that is not so stretchy which allows for things to actually fit inside. Three stars because it's made of nice material and looks nice but as far as functionality, it's just not there, at least not for me and not for my new stroller.
