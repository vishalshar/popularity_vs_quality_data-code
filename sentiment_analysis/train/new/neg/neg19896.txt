While it would be nice to pick the design, this review is based solely on the functionality of this cup. It has been durable and mostly leak proof but I have to fiddle with the straw valve constantly. It seems like screwing down the lid is causing the straw to seal too tightly to some part or another. This makes it so that no matter how hard you try, nothing will come through the straw, sucking only creates a vacuum. It's fixable by removing the lid and pulling back just a little where the rigid straw fits into the valve. Not a deal breaker but a bit messy and a pain in the butt several times a day. I have tried to make sure it's right before lowering it into the cup, but even then it gets this way after screwing on the lid.
