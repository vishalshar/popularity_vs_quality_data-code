Ok Few points:Its long on my 5'0 frame & very hot and even more hot with the infant insert. My son was born early so it took us a long time to be able to use it to begin with. HOWEVER  I am giving it three stars because I know once he's out of the insert & the temps get cooler I will fall in love with ergo all over again like I have had with my last four children!  the color is pretty and I know it's comfortable when worn  on the back even if I haven't been able to use this particular one yet  because I have had this carrier in brown in the past
