I wish I could give this product a better review because it honestly is a great pacifier for small infants. These Soothies have saved my sanity many nights and are excellent in that I dont have to worry about water collecting in the pacifier BUT the older (and chunkier) my infant is getting the more her little thick fingers are get stuck in the center of the pacifier. When learning to pull her pacifier to her mouth and play with it she almost always gets her thumb stuck in the pacifier center. I am a hawk over my baby so her finger never stays in there for long but the suction created makes it difficult to remove the pacifier from her finger at times. After struggling with this issue for 3 days I finally got her a competitors pacifier that is very similar in design to reduce my anxierty and her risk of injury associated with her finger being lodged in the pacifier's nipple/ center.
