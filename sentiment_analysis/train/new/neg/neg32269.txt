Really nice sturdy and adorable in Ellie but the straps were so difficult to pull and it was so big on me.  I'm 5'4" and 130 lbs about size 4/6 and it was on tightest setting on the lumbar support.  The double locks kind of drove me crazy and the button was so short and harder to get.  I have a Beco Butterfly and its double lock buckles are a bit easier.  I love the capabilities of this carrier but it just wasnt a good fit for me.  My baby is also small so at 7 mos old she is still very small in it.  The straps on this were also thicker/stiffer and much harder to adjust than my Butterfly.  I'm sad it didnt work out.
