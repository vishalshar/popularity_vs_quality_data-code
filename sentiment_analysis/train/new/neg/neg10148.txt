Such a great idea, because when my little one was learning to walk it was a big pain in the butt (well, back) to have to haunch over to hold her hands. I purchased this thinking, NO MORE HAUNCHING OVER! This was true, but only if you have one adult on each side holding the loops.When I was holding both loops by myself, I had to walk with my feet wide open so I didn't kick the baby. Or if I didn't want to walk like that, I had to hold it in front of my body, which causes a lot of strain on my upper body. Imagine if you're holding a large bag of heavy, wobbly groceries out in front of your body; it gets tiring quite quickly.The thought was good for this product, but ease-of-use was not the best, unfortunately.
