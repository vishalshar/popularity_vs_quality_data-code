We ordered two different brands of these toy hammocks, because our 18 month old daughter is a stuffed animal addict, and we had to find some way to manage and contain all the toys!  The hammock in this one is great- sturdy and well shaped for holding the animals- unfortunately, it comes with wall hangers that look like picture hangers, so the moment we put one stuffed animal in, the whole thing came down.  If you purchase this one, plan on buying some more substantial hooks for hanging it!  (We were much happier with the Prince Lionheart brand)
