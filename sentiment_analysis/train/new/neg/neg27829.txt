I am so upset! I really wanted to like these bottles. I bought the starter set and an extra 3-pack of the 9 oz ones. Of the 8 ventaire bottles I have, only 3 don't leak. The ones that don't leak are fine and my baby takes them with no problem. However, more than half of the ones I received in my purchase are made so poorly (there is a slight gap between the bottle and the bottom) that they leak every time. I personally hate pumping and have cried over the bottles leaking because of the wasted milk. I'm tossing every single one of them in the trash and buying something new. Save yourself the headache & tears and don't buy these!!
