I was at a loss as to what type of reusable diapers to get so I bought this starter kit.  This diaper system is easy to use and the covers did not allow any leak at all.  The cotton diapers are soft and pretty absorbent.  I have also tried the Flip diapers and the Grovia ones.  Out of all the 3 brands, I'd say the Bummis ranked 2nd in bulkiness.  The bag that came with it was very useful and kept the smell at bay.  The reusable liners were awesome though.  The disposable liners were useful as they helped keep the  diapers from staining.  Overall it is a good kit.  It has everything you need.  However, I'm giving it only 3 stars because I did not like the bulkiness of it.
