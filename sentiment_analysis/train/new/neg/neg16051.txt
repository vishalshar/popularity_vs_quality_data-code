Do not purchase this product! We purchased this rocking monkey for our toddler and after weeks of him not wanting to sit on it realized that it is because there are sharp metal rods running along the seat with sharp corners and NO PADDING at all.  I wish that I had sat on it myself to test it out or at least felt along the seat instead of just assuming that it was padded or at the very least comfortable and not dangerous.  Not only is it extremely uncomfortable to sit on I feel it is bordering on dangerous for any child to sit on this or play with it.  I have written the company about my concerns and will update this review if I hear back from them but for now I will not be allowing my children near this toy.
