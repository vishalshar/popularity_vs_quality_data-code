My 6 month old choked on this toy. I had it attached to her carrier carseat. It was pure coincidence that I happened to pull over and had to get something out of the back seat. She began to choke and had her mouth open and at first I could not figure out what was going on. I finally just put my fingers in her mouth and scooped out a piece of the shiny yellow celophane like material out of her throat.  I almost couldn't even see it. I was very lucky.  I have contacted the ocmpany to let them know, but I think until someone's child dies, they will not do anything. The shiny yellow material is what came off and ended up in her throat. Please use caution and I would advice NOT to purchase this toy. I was very shaken up by this. Soft Stroller Bar
