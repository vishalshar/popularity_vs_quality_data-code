This calendar is nice for the purpose of keeping a day by day record of your baby's changes as it is a blank calendar you customize as you write in it. My complaint is that it is from a much older print time.  The inside cover has complete calendars from 2008-2011 years on it. I ordered this for my delivery in mid July 2012. You would think that the item would be from more recent print/stock than to have 4 year old calendar on it.  I plan to put photos over the inside cover to hide those old 4 years of calendars.  It appears to have been made awhile back as the included stickers arent sticky enough to stay on the pages without adding glue to the back.  The full matching LuLu set is also nice - particularly the keep sake box. It has plenty of room to keep hospital items, outfit worn home, and still has plenty of space for other things we find to save for her as she grows.
