I have a 5 month old and he rolled out, literally- rolled out! He was buckled in and he started chewing on the side as most all 5 month olds love to do. For what ever reason, I walked back in the living room from the kitchen wthout finishing getting my 3 yr old fully situated and I watched my son roll head first onto the floor, still buckled in and the seat falling down over top of him. His head was one way and his body was another. All it takes is a second for these little ones to manage themselves into a bad situation. Carters was awesome when I called with the complaint. They are sending me the postage to return the product to them, however, now I will be out the $60 or so that it cost me. I will know soon if they will compinsate me.The design is horrible. Baby is sat completely upright. So when they lean forward, as they do, where do you think they're going to go? I love Carter's clothes, but they have yet to buy me on their hardware.
