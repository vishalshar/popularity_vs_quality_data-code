I got the item in a timely manner it just when I order the bottles I assumed it was a white top like showed on the picture but when I recieved it today it was PINK!!! it said nothing about the bottles being pink, I have a little boy that can not and will not use pink bottles....just was wondering why it didn't say it was pink? cause I never would have bought it! But other then that I order from you guys all the time and hardly ever have problems..
