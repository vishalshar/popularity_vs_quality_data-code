I have been using cloth everything for quite some time. Unpaper towels, cloth kleenex, RUMPS, etc. I have an excellent protocol for washing and sanitizing my reusables. This product is very difficult to remove odor from and they have been from the start. I have many different types of reusables (including other bamboo charcoal and microfiber) and these are the only ones where this is an issue. They actually require extra steps in my laundering process to get them smelling completely clean, as compared to everything else I use, which is frustrating. Since one of the reasons I go with cloth is to avoid the impact of disposables on the environment, having to use extra water, detergent, etc. is both onerous and inconsistent with why I use cloth in the first place. These have been relegated to the position of backup inserts.
