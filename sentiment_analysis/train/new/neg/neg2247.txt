This is a good concept as a narrow light weight small umbrella stroller.  I do like that it has a tray for sippy cup or baby snacks.  The basket underneath is useless since their is not enough space between the underneath of the seat and the opening of the basket to put even a small purse or umbrella under there, so their was no way my wife could get her small diaper bag under there.  My older kids loved this stroller since my 6 year old could push his baby sister around and see over the handles.  However, this stroller is SO short that even my very short 5'3" wife kept hitting her toes into the wheels when taking the baby for a walk.  Good concept just way too small, almost looks like a doll stroller.  This would be a good stroller for a little person, honestly, but anyone over 5'2" would not be able to push this without hitting their feet on the wheels.  Sent back.
