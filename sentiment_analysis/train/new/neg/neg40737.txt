The clip itself is cute and functional but the ad is misleading. It shows what appears to be 2 clips for the price but in all actuality, it's just the front and back of the clip. I think that's pretty misleading when they don't state that it's a picture of both the front and back. I guess they don't state that you're getting two clips either so it's up to you to interpret the picture.
