We followed the advice of Kenneth M. Saltzman to double-baffle the cup for a slower flow, but it was still too fast. Besides, we had a difficult time getting both baffles to click on properly. Ultimately, we ended up getting a Reflo Smart Cup, a Smart Alternative to "Sippy Cups" (Clear - 2 Pack) instead, which has a much slower flow.But to be fair, our baby (6-months-old) has an oral aversion, so he doesn't drink or eat like typical babies. We are trying to use a cup for him upon the suggestion of his occupational therapist. Because of health issues, he didn't have the energy to suck and and swallow his milk from a bottle. And when his health issues were resolved, we realized that he actually lost the ability and desire to use the bottle altogether, which is why we're where we are... trying to get him to drink from a cup.So, anyway, my review about the flow being too much may not be fair because of our baby's special circumstance. Be sure to take this into account when making your purchasing choice. We are still going to keep our cups in hopes of being able to use them when Baby gets older and hopefully masters the Reflo Cup.
