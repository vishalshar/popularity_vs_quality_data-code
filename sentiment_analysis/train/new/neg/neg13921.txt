This lock will only work on a very select few appliances. Because the locking connector is rigid plastic, the two points that the bases connect to must be perfectly flush. Didn't work on any of my major appliances as they all have a beveled edge or some design aspect that is other than having a perfectly flush door and main unit. And my appliances aren't fancy by any means. I only found one unit in my entire house that this would work on. An old wine fridge where the door is exactly the same size as the main unit.Oh. and the advertising for this is deceiving. It says and shows that it works on stoves. However, in the instructions, it says NEVER use on stoves.Also it's described as having 3 settings. Deceptive again. There are only 2 locking stages. If you read the instructions, stage 3 is the phase after you've opened it. The pictures make it look as if there are 2 sliding locks on either side for extra security. But really it's just 1. slide the lock to the left. 2. Push the tab to open the lock.  3. is you just actually opening the door. It's already unlocked.  Why not just call it 4 stage and include the action of closing it again. haha.Get their Dual Action Multi-Use latches instead. They have a flexible part that allows you to mount on almost anything.
