I'm not sure why so many people have rated this item so highly. I am a first time mother... Maybe that's why I'm not able to use this pump? It does absolutely NOTHING.  Maybe it's because I am "well endowed" in the lactator department... *shrug*.. I have no idea.I came home from the hospital after using the Madela hospital pump (which I loved!) and almost cried when this little hand pump proved itself useless.  I begged my husband to run to the local medical supply rental office to rent an electric pump (Which cost us over $100). In just one day I was in such pain from being unable to pump I would have done ANYTHING! My baby refuses to nurse (she learned to love the bottle in the special care nursery at the hospital).  I was forced to feed her formula while I begged the ISIS to help me.  If the ISIS collected any milk it was because my poor engorged breasts dripped some into it in desperation.After all this drama I ended up buying a Medela Pump In Style Advanced Breast Pump with Metro Bag 57036 which I LOVE.  It was more expensive than the hand pump.. but NOT more expensive than the rental would have ended up costing us!Maybe it works for some people... It did NOT work for me!!  BUT, it is cheap... so maybe you should try it... just have a back-up plan ready so you don't have screaming angry breasts... not to mention a screaming angry baby.
