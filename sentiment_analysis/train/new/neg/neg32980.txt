My wife was hoping these hooks would be good for hanging a backpack on our stroller. They're ok. The carabiner is a little smaller than I had hoped, so it's hard to get a large bag strap in there. They are also fairly flimsy. However, this might have all been stuff I should have inferred from the photo.
