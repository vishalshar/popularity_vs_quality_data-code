When I originally purchased this product, it didn't mention that it would be a 6 Pack, so I bought 2. Well now I have 12 Valves, however the price seems a lot better that way. Otherwise no complaints. These Valves are identical to the ones that came with my Avent Pump, which have never caused any problems.
