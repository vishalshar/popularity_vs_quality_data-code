We just bought this and I know that it's eventually going to drive us crazy.  We got the blue one (not sure if that makes a difference).  You may read other reviews about it not moving on carpet - believe it.  It won't budge.  But what's going to drive us crazy is the music, which consists of about 4 songs - one of which is a duck quacking song that sounds like something that Si from Duck Dynasty recorded on an Army issued recording device in Vietnam.  The quality and song selection aren't great (comparing against Fisher Price toys).  I had thought the gadgets in front would at least be pretty cool to tinker with, but they don't do much.  The nice thing is that you can take all that garbage off and use the tray for snacks or other toys.  The other thing that's interesting is that the back wheels don't move - I don't know if that's standard on walkers or not.  But it seems like it's limiting my child's mobility.  Maybe that's to prevent spin-outs or something.  The positives are that it's extremely easy to put together and I like the fact that you can adjust the height as the child grows (Note: the lowest setting is "1".  I'm not sure if that refers to years or what, but our 9 month old is tippy toeing).  I personally think the price point is too high - I think full retail value is like $70-80, we got it around $60.  $30 seems more appropriate.  But in the end, my baby seemed to enjoy it and was able to move around - and that's more or less all you're looking for, right?
