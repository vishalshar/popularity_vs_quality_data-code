I was very happy with this purchase for the price.  I just had my third child and had to buy a new bassinet because the one I had for my other two children was no longer in good enough condition to be used again.  I wanted something that wasn't super expensive as my children did not use the previous bassinet for long.  This product was cute and sturdy.  This product isn't very fancy and doesn't have music or vibration, but it serves it's purpose.  I would recommend this product to someone who is looking for a practical low priced bassinet.
