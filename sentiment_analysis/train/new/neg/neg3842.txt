Bought 2 of these---different companies, and they are equally irritating to use.  The seatbelt gets twisted and a child would quiickly get frustrated trying to fasten the belt.  I'm short, so I wanted one for mysel in my big SUV--so the strap wouldn't cut right across my neck.  I'm going to have to keep looking, because after a week of fighting with this, I've discarded it.
