I pre ordered the Brica spout cover and just got it a couple of days ago and it's now on it's way back. It is so cheaply made. It doesn't fit my standard spout even with the adjustable strap. Also the rinse cup that comes with it doesn't fit on the top. It just falls off no matter how hard you try to get it to stick. I'm so disappointed that I waited for this thing. Waste of my time.
