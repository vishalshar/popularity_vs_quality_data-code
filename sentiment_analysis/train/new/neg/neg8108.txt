After a trip to the ER following a pinched finger in our bathroom door, I was looking for something to make sure it would never happen again. After looking at lots of options, these seemed simple and effective.I was excited these arrived, and tried them on the non-hinge side of the door. I was immediately disappointed, as fingers could still get pinched on the hinge side of the door.I put the pinch preventer on the hinge side and was satisfied that the door would now stay open (I attached as shown in the picture). My kids didn't even touch the door, I pulled on it slightly to see what would happen if a child tried to pull the door shut. I then removed the pinch protector and the door was off of alignment. It stripped the door so the screws will not tighten all the way. My husband was able to fix the door thanks to a helpful hardware store employee. We are now trying the pinch preventer on the hinge side so it is "hugging" the door, and hoping for the best. The hinges are OK so far.
