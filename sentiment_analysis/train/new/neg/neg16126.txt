Not crazy about the boring colors on this bouncer & the toys are kinda boring too. I removed the bar & replaced it with the Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll It took a few tries and weeks for my baby to finally relax in this. The bounce is very very soft, not what I expected. You have to crank it up to get any bouncing action. Music is okay since my baby seems to like the water sound. BTW once you put it together there really isn't a way to take it apart for storage, a design flaw if you ask me. Not the most amazing baby gear we have & use, we like our Fisher-Price My Little Snugabunny Cradle 'n Swing wayyyyyyyyy better!
