Very easy to use just wear it like a bag, pop open at the side and you can put baby inside easily. However, I cannot use the carrier more than 1-2 hours as my back will start to hurt.Adjust the location where the shoulder strap meet properly at your back because if it's too high, it will make your back hurt. Even with me making it as low as possible, still make my back hurt. I think this is because of the carrier design where there is not enough support for your back. Should include another strap that go around your back or one at the waist as currently, only the shoulder strap is at your back and I don't think that's enough support.Other than that, it's so easy to use so when I go out with my baby, I will carry these (although I may have back pain after coming back home).
