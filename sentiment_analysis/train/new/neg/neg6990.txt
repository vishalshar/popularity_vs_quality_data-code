This bag has all the pockets I wanted... It's just smaller than I thought. I was thinking it was a full sized back pack...  I would say it is somewhere between an over the shoulder purse size and a full size backpack size... It does the trick, but there is NOTHING going in this bag except the basic essentials needed for on the go diaper changes. I would recommend a backpack diaper bag, but I would not recommend this one in particular, due to the size.
