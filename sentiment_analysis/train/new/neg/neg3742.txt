musical toy did not work.  I was aware of this issue from other reviews so I just stuffed it with tissue paper hoping she would enjoy just playing with it.  I bought this one to replace one I had for her with a sun, hot air balloon, and airplane toy, which she absolutely loved (and we accidentally left somewhere), but they don't seem to make that one anymore, and she's not that interested in these toys.
