Meh.  It looks nice, and the storage on the front is great.  However, you can't remove the dang changing table cover!  That's just plain stupid IMO.  I'm not washing poop out of the changing table by hand.  We bought a waterproof cover for it, but it's still an additional purchase we shouldn't have had to make.
