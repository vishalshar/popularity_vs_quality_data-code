it is a sad thing when you are a first time parent and don't really know how or what you need to do to help your little one.i bought these spoons with the intention of helping my son learn to self feed, it will soon be a year since they have been sitting in the drawer!! the other day my husband saw them and remarked what a waste of money these were.the first issue i had with these that caused me not to use them is that they are not deep enough to hold much of anything- and my son gets frustrated if he isn't getting enough food to make a proper "mouth full".and the more i think of these the more i realize how silly they are- indeed the holes can make for a tough clean up routine when food gets in...i really don't know what else to say to parents looking at these except "move along"...
