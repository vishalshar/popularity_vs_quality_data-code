So I don't think it makes sense to rate this because I know that every baby is different.  But I thought I would post what problems we had and our solution in case other parents are dealing with the same issue. The slow flow nipple was too fast for my newborn, and the nipple constantly collapsed on him, making for a very messy, hungry, gassy, and frustrated baby. We tried working with these for 3 weeks, but I eventually realized I needed to make a change, it was the bottle, not us having issues.  We switched to the Playtex Ventaire and this worked like magic! Our little guy was no longer a mess, he was more calm, and not hungry anymore. He still has a little gas, but this is normal, nothing extreme.  I know these bottles work for many moms and babies, but these just didn't work for us.
