I wasn't sure how to name this review, so I tried summing up my opinion in the title.  They are both really cute, but the prongs on the forks are a bit difficult for my son to poke things with.  Not that it can't be done because he only recently started using them and learning how to feed himself with utensils.  They are very nice quality, and he can grasp the ends perfectly.The 3 stars out of 5, come back to the fork and that it's just not as functional as I would have thought.  Now, in all fairness I saw the pictures, and noticed the prongs before -- and thought "Oh they are cute!".... but being a new mom, I didn't realize how it would impact functionality.  So it is my fault for buying them...However, I have 2 sets and I am currently happy with them.  If I think they will cause a large issue going forward, I will purchase others.
