I bought this for my daughter when she was 2 months old. She is now 5 months so I have a good handle on this swing.Pros:Picked specifically for the tray. I feel like the tray is easier to use to secure her than the buckles.She will occasionally fall asleep in itAC adapterCons:Seat is narrow. If she rolls at all she will probably fall out without being securedThe mobile is low. Kind of difficult to get her in now that she's a little bigger. Hard on Momma's back!Speakers are sounding wonky nowIt's pretty hugeIsn't very powerful. Hardly swings at her 17 lb weight.Music shuts off after 15 minMotor is loud at beginning. Only a big deal if I put her in there when she's asleepBase rocks. The leg actually comes up off of the ground while it sways.Very reclined. Not for a baby who wants to sit and play. Tray is tilted so you can't put additional toys on tray, unless you are strategic.Overall, good. It does the job. I miss the old style I had with the older two. Wide simple swing with tray and cup holders. It only went forwards but with the old style, they could sit up and play. This new style seems to be just for sleep. Now that she want to sit up, I can tell this won't last long.
