It's fine. Nice pattern and all. But it's just a touch small on our standard crib mattress. Not so small that it doesn't work, but small enough that the piping doesn't line up with the edges -- and since it's in a clear, contrasting color, it's annoyingly easy to see that the sheet doesn't quite fit.
