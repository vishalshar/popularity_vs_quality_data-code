I am a single working mom who travels for work periodically and have to take my toddler with me.  When he was smaller I used a stroller/click-in car seat combination which was very easy to deal with at the end of the jet-way.  This product with the toddler attachment was so unwieldy that I decided to ship it home rather than try and take it back on the plane.  I found it easier to hook the car seat straps on the umbrella stroller to get through the airport.  The wheel control was not good.  The front wheels were too small and the big wheels on the back were hard to deal with.  The breaks were not very good so it was difficult to have it stay still when loading and unloading the baby and car seat.  The toddler attachment straps were too long and there was nowhere to store them and they flopped all around.  They were also difficult to strap to the car seat each time you need it.  It is a two handed job which is not easy when you are alone with a walking toddler getting off a plane.  I wish there were a way to keep the straps strung on the car seat and then clip them to the stroller rather than the other way around.  I really wanted this system to work with my toddler seat and it made things much worse rather than better.
