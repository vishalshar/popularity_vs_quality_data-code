Did not work with my pump, no suction. After pitching new tuning from Medela the pump works perfect so it was definitely the tuning and not my pump. They wouldn't allow me to return for a refund because it had been after the 30 days ( because I purchased before I delivered and didn't try it until after I had baby) Terrible experience wouldn't recommend!
