Mine was missing the cow. The pieces are all really small- the measurements are included so that was my fault, I just assumed they were standard bath toy style rubber ducky size. These are more like something you would get in a plastic bubble for a quarter from a machine at the front of a grocery store. Maybe "mini" in the product name would be more straightforward. Still, even missing a cow, it's definitely a rubber ducky nativity set, so I'm hoping my child likes it.
