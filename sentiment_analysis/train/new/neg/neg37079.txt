This really does work better than the bulb I got from the hospital. I wish it worked a little better though but that may not happen until the kid can blow. My issues with it are the long tube. Why does it need to be so long? When you have to hold your child down to suck out the snot, you tend to be pretty close to them and it has gotten kinked a few times which makes it hard to suck. The other problem is cleaning it. I love that you can use a tissue as the filter but most of the snot stays in the nose tip. So to get it out you have to soak in warm water. The thing is you have to have something b/c these kids are always stuffed up and can't sleep when stuffed up. So if you want to get any sleep get one of these. Did I mention you get to use tissues as filters with this one. The other one you have to buy their filters to replace.
