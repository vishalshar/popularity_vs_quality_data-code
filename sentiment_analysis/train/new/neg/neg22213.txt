First off, the bottles are not like pictured! They are all clear bottles. Second, two of the bottles I received were all warped and bent. I don't know who packaged them but they did a horrible job! I'm also weary on whether or not these are new because all they were packaged in were in a ziplock bag. Not professional at all. I don't even know who to contact about getting replacement bottles.
