The pillow seems to be well made and is very cute, which is why it got two stars.  Unfortunately, my baby hates it and cries whenever we try to lay him down on it. I tried using it in the baby swing, and not only did the baby hate it, but it wouldn't stay in place and slid downward, taking my baby's head with it until he was practically folded sideways in the swing.I also feel it's a little pricey at $35. It would have been worth that and more if it had helped my son, but since it didn't, it's been a waste of money for us. I'm hoping he will at least use it for neck support when he's older so we'll get a little use out of it.
