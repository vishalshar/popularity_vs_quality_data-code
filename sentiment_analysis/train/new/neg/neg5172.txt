I liked these for my son. They're very cute and he enjoyed shooting them in the little hoop. The only down fall is they get EXTREMELY moldy on the inside. I had to throw them all away. It was pretty gross. Even after squeezing them out and putting them in a draining tub mate, they still managed to get mass amounts of mold.
