This is an updated review after a few months of use. Unfortunately, I have found that they get moldy. Just under the cap where the seal is. It's not removable so you can't clean under it. It is for this reason I have thrown mine out and do not recommend buying this. I normally really like oxo products they are usually very well thought out. Also, The straw doesn't go all the way to the bottom so you can't get all the liquid out.
