These flow pretty fast! My son is almost 7mo and we only use these when he's wide awake and not out in public. If he's sleepy he can't keep up with the flow and chokes, and if he's wearing nice clothes out we always have to change him right away since he's covered in milk. They might be fine for him in a couple months, so I wish the recommended age reflected reality better and I would've waited to purchase these. It's also nearly impossible to tell these apart from the slow flow (unless you try to use them obviously, but now you have an extra nipple to clean), so I just ended up storing them away. I'll probably try again when he's 9mo.
