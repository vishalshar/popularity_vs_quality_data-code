DO NOT BUT THIS CAR SEAT COVER!!!  I purchased this last week for a short trip with 1 leg each on United Express.  The car seat cover made it to the destination on with no issue but upon pickup after the return flight, I noticed a large hole in the bottom of the bag which was created due to a design flaw in the bag itself.  The wheels are on the wrong side of the bag from where you would think they should be.  You have to tip the bag forward instead of backward to roll it.  As the owner and the person trying to care for your $200-$300 car seat, you can get used to it using it frequently but unfortunately, the baggage handlers aren't going to pay attention and are just going to drag it around.  A 40 lb car seat being pulled across concrete is going to create a hole in no time.I realize United Airlines is the one that created the hole, but I believe it is the design flaw of the bag itself that caused the problem.  If the whole bottom was built out of a tougher material I would recommend this cover as it fit my Chicco Nextfit perfectly but until they increase the durability of the bottom of the bag, I cannot recommend this bag to anyone.
