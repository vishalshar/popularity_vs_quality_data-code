My kid loves the soft spout sippy cups, naturally he loves these but I have so many problems with it. First off, it is nice and cheap so I think it earned some good stars for that and the fact that my kid loves it. The problem is while it may be cheap initially you will pay even more to maintain it. My kid chewed the nipple, he barely has any teeth, but it broke open and after that it was a leaky sippy and I am no fan. I went to order some replacement spouts and that is where it got expensive. 1 replacement spout costs almost as much as buying an entirely new sippy cup! I sucked it up and bought the new one only to be met with the same tragic end PLUS nasty cruddy build up around almost the entire spout. I always am cleaning bottles, I hate it but I still do it 5-6 times a day with warm soapy water, so there is no way that there should have ever been build up of any kind especially since with don't do formula or milk in sippy cups. So while my kid loves it, I hate it with a burning hot passion and that's just how it goes.
