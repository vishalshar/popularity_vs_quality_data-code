I bought this as a travel car seat and a backup car seat for my husband's car. It was lightweight and narrow enough to fit on most airplane seats. As soon as I opened it, I regretted purchasing it. You obviously get what you pay for. It's cheap and flimsy looking and the seat cover is really thin and provides no real cushioning. Also the cup holder that came with it is a really stupid design that bunches up the seat cover. It also wasn't the cup holder pictured on the box or in the instruction manual. I wonder if it was even the right cupholder....? As a backup car seat, these issues alone are not deal breakers, but what made me return it was when we tried to install it rear-facing with a seat belt we could NOT get it tight enough. With two adults, we couldn't get this seat installed safely. It would slide several inches side to side and the worst part was it would tip forward into the seat back.Our main car seat is an Orbit Baby and with the base you can install it really securely. There is no budging once it's installed. We ended up buying the Diono Radian r120 and I was able to install it safely by myself. No sliding or tipping (because it has a rear-facing tether)!
