I love this lamp but... the shade doesn't fit like it should. It is too wide so it sits lower than its suppose to. The giraffes head is covered. Maybe I am doing something wrong but I don't think so. I am a little disappointed. I was very excited about this lamp. But I will make it work somehow. But other than that the lamp is just as it looks nice and sturdy. Pretty good buy.
