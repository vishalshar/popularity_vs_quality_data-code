We bought this crib in February, about 6 months ago. When it came the package was beat up and full of holes but everything was still there and the crib looked fine. The hardware was still there but it was pretty hard to put together. The holes aren't aligned very well. Just put some elbow grease in it and it worked. Only problem was the smell. I'd read other reviewers saying the same thing but they waited a while and it went away. Problem is, it hasn't. We had plenty of time to try getting rid of the smell since I'm not due until October. So we tried Goo Gone, soap and water, baking soda, vinegar... basically anything we could think of. The smell did decrease quite a bit. We kept the windows open and a fan on the crib to air it out since there's no way we could take it apart to move it. It's been MONTHS and it's still not gone. As a last resort, we're going to put on some polyurethane but then we won't be able to return it.It seems like a lot of trouble to go through when you can return it but it does have a pretty look and I do enjoy the crib's versatility. So we'll try to make it work somehow. But if the polyurethane doesn't work... this was a bit of money down the drain.
