I bought this to clip onto our sons carseat for the road trips we take so that he would have something to look at.  First of all it wasnt green and blue like it said, it was pink purple and yellow.  The arch would not stay clipped on and the tiniest bump would send it flying into our sons face.  The turtle "sings" which is cute but it plays the same 10 second clip every time it hardly swings which can get annoying after a 9 hour trip!  The only good thing was that my son really liked the toys hanging from it and we were able to take them off the arch and hang them onto his carseat with some colored rings that we got from Walmart.  Overall we were really disappointed with this.
