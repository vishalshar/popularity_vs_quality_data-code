The cup works well but I prefer other Nuby cups.  The sippy spout is a little harder on this one, making it more difficult to squeeze to wet the liquid out.  My son doesn't like it as much.  The handle is also attached to the sippy part.  I prefer the removable handles that can grow with the child.  Finally, the sippy spout is harder to really clean than some other brands.  My child prefers this one and so do I: http://www.amazon.com/Nuby-Stage-Bottle-Ounce-Colors/dp/B001TBYNUW/ref=sr_1_1?s=baby-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1425872868&sr=1-1&keywords=nuby+grow+with+me+sippy+cup
