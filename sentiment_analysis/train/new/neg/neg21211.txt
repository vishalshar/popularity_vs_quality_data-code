I washed these when I go them and after the wash and dry i noticed many snags and tears in the blankets.  Note:  i washed them on the delicate cycle and on the delicate low/low dry cycle and this still caused then to break down.  I am returning them and ordering the original Aden & Anais and hopefully they will prove worth the extra ten dollars.
