I feel like I don't give less than 3 stars very often, but I just really don't have a lot of good to say about this product.For the price, what you get seems pretty ridiculous. The fabric is very thin and the design simple. I can't imagine these cost much to produce. I have other nursing covers that are much higher quality and cost a lot less. The fabric is light, and would be good for the summer time though.The boning in the neckline does not work. It's much too thin and small and did not give me easy top access to my baby. I could not see her unless I held the neckline open, and as a mom with a squirmy baby and overactive letdown - I do not have a hand to spare!I wanted this cover for the extra coverage it offers. I have a large chest, a large and squirmy baby, and overactive letdown. Sort of a recipe for disaster when nursing in public. I found this cover didn't do much more for me than the apron style covers, and gave me a worse view of baby through the neckline. I really wanted to fall in love with this cover because at the time I was disparate for a full coverage solution! This was also shorter than expected, so the length wasn't helping to give the coverage I needed.I ended up finding a pattern for a nursing cover online and picked out my own very structured boning to use. This worked well for a while but my saving grace ended up being learning to nurse in an Ergo carrier. My baby is happy and less squirmy nursing while in motion. I throw an apron style cover over her, use one hand for positioning and don't have to worry about holding/taming baby with the other. I'm free to shop, walk, or do whatever else it is I need to do! Total life saver!Anyway, I'm getting off topic, but I hope that insight can help someone!Overall, I don't recommend this cover. Keep looking because the poncho is sort of a rip off.
