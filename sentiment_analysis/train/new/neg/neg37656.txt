This changing table was right in our price range and that was the biggest part in our decision to buy it.  When it arrived and after I got it out of the box, I realized that the materials weren't of the highest quality but ended up being ok if you don't get too rough with it when moving it around once you've assembled it.The assembly process however was extremely frustrating.  Due to the incredibly horrible directions writted (probably) by someone who's never seen the thing or doesn't speak English as his/her first language. Once I got a part on I had to take it back off again because I realized it was the wrong part or it was positioned in the wrong way.  I'm very good at putting things together out of the box and I rather enjoy it most of the time but this little number was a doosie.  I finally got it together after several tries while looking at the stupid diagrams they put in the assembly instructions.The magnets that are supposed to hold the doors shut are crap.  One of the doors on mine shuts and holds against the magnet barely and the other doesn't "stick" to the magnet at all.Once again, if you don't mind not having a really sturdy changing table, and you've got 4 hours or so to put the thing together go for it, because the price isn't too bad.  If you have a little more to spend, I suggest looking somewhere other than this manufacturer for your purchase.
