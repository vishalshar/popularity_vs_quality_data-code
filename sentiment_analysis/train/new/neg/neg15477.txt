We have a mid-sized sedan and had no problems installing this mirror.  We just used the tether attachment in the middle seat and a spot of Velcro to help keep it from sliding around.Our daughter absolutely loved this mirror.  Around two months of age, she started being able to stay awake in the car.  She used to scream and cry from the instant we closed the back door until she fell asleep, then again from the time she woke up until we took her out of the car seat.  Once we installed this mirror and she could see us, she relaxed and actually started to enjoy riding in the car.She's now six months old, so we've had the mirror for four months.  Last week, we came out to the car to find the mirror and part of the strap lying on the backseat, with the tether attachment still set up.  The strap seems to have disintegrated in the middle.  It's very brittle and flakes a bit when we touch it.  Our guess is that the sunlight damaged the nylon (we think) strap, but we live in a coastal city where it's often foggy or overcast.  I can't imagine what would happen to this mirror in a truly sunny place.We enjoyed using this mirror, but when we replace it this weekend, we'll be going to a physical store where we can examine the strapping/attachments other mirrors use.  $... is not too expensive, but $... every four months is.
