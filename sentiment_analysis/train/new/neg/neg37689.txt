I splurged and spent $135 on this diaper bag, so I really wanted and expected to love this bag.  I had seen reviews about it being too small, but I watched a video online that showed a woman fitting a lot of baby stuff inside, so I ordered it.  I used it as a purse while pregnant; it worked well for my needs and I got a lot of compliments on it.  However, within a few days the "earth leather" was chipping in places.  For as much as Ju-Ju-Bee hypes up and prices this material, I expected much better  and longer lasting quality.As for the size, when I attempted to pack it as a diaper bag to bring to the hospital, there was no way the newborn essentials (diapers, wipes, lotion, changing pad, extra outfit, burp cloth, bottle) would fit inside, let alone the "extras" like a rattle, receiving blanket, etc.  I had to buy a bigger bag, and this one is sitting in the closet until my daughter is older and needs less.  Unfortunately I doubt it will last long based on the wear and tear it is already showing after very little use.
