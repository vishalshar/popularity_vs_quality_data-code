These sheet savers were handy as my babies spit up a lot, and for a few months I was able to change these instead of all the sheets, which was a time saver. However, I'm giving them three stars because they are a pain in the butt to tie (especially if your crib backs up to a wall). Additionally, as soon as my babies could roll over we stopped using them as we were nervous that they might pose a suffocation risk to a baby in the face-down position (the fabric is very soft and plush). If these had velcro fasteners I would have given them four or five stars.
