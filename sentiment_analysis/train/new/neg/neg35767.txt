I was so excited to receive this as a gift for my son.  Not only will it prevent him from sucking on a nasty shopping cart, but it would help him to sit up better in a cart.I was sadly disappointed.  I was holding him and trying to get it positioned in the cart and all velcroed into the appropriate places, when I realized it was way too small for the cart.  It took me a good 5 minutes to get it into the cart, and him into it.  Because it didn't fit the cart correctly, I couldn't hook him into the safety strap.  His legs wouldn't go through the holes because they were up too high since I had to velcro the front to the handlebar.  I ended up hooking it up in a place it didn't go just so he would have something to sit in since I had no place else to put him.  He is 8 months old but has just learned to sit up so wobbles side to side.  The head rest couldn't be used because of the way I had to rig it into the cart.  Then he fell side to side and it offered no protection there.  Because of the way I had to attach it into the seat, he didn't have access to any of the toys.This was such a disappointment.  I want to return it but received it as a gift.  I'd like to purchase a different one.  I emailed the company and low and behold, I have not heard from them yet.  Not very good customer service.I would not recommend this at all, there are much better and nicer ones out there that will do the job.
