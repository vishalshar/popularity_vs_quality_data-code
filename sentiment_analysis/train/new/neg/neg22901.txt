I like the operation and thought behind this diaper pail but it is huge. I think you could hold a hundred newborn diapers in it and who wants that many wet or dirty diapers lingering in any closed space for any amount of time? I like the idea of using regular kitchen trash bags but I would of preferred it to be about half its size. Maybe better for someone with multiples.
