I purchased two bibs from bumkins, and these bibs, by no stretch of the imagination, are cheap.  We have used the bibs for three days and one of the bibs is falling apart! I am totally disappointed on the quality of such an expensive baby item!  The neck straps that are sewn on our completely coming apart. We have not even washed the bibs yet. I cannot imagine what they would look like after a wash. Save your money and buy the cheaper ones on here. I did and they lasted about five months.  I included pictures so you can see how badly made the gray babe is. The pink one is holding up so far. Posted a picture of that one just for comparison .
