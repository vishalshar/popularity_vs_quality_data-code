Somehow I was sent this Rose colored item rather than the Tan one I thought I ordered. I have a return label to send it back, just hope with the big snow coming, I can get to my son's house and ship it before the 28th when the label expires.I have reordered the Tan one which is supposed to be delivered Tomorrow, 12/27/2012, weather permitting.
