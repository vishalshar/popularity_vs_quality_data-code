We had the FP Rainforest Auto Mirror. We wanted another one. I saw the Precious Planet mirror and decided to get it instead thinking that it'd be the same mirror with slightly different animals and music. (This was my experience of the differences between the Rainforest and Precious Planet jumperoos and other stuff.)But the Precious Planet version doesn't have lights like the Rainforest one does. This is one of my baby's favorite features. He likes the Rainforest one in Daddy's car way better than the Precious Planet in my car. I wish that I had bought the Rainforest one. What a bummer.One other difference: the remote control in the Precious Planet version is smaller. (So what?)
