I really like the idea of this cupholder, but have found that it is not as useful as I would have thought in practice. It does not fit well (or at all) into cup holders that have curved tops or that are even slightly larger than usual. If used in one of a pair of cupholders, it will pretty much always as least partially block the cup holder it is not inserted into.The foam material that this is made out of also tends to tightly grip cups that are inserted into it. Several times, I have tried to pull a cup out only to pull out the entire holder.I would not recommend this product.
