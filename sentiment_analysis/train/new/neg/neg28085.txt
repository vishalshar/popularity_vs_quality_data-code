I can hear EVERYTHING except the baby with this thing. I have to be in a very quiet room and even turn the fans off because they come through the headphones and even then I can't hear the actual baby. Another thing that gets in the way is hearing your knuckles creak. Even holding my hand completely still, I can still hear them creak and it is very loud. You should save your money and get an actual doppler because this thing is a waste of money.
