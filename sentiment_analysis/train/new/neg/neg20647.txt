I don't know how the company can legally advertise this product as 100% organic cotton. That is not the case. Unfortunately, you won't know that until you open up the package and look at the actual tags to find that it only CONTAINS organic cotton. The rest of it is resin-treated polyester (yeah, that sounds "organic"). Yet the product description and the packaging both indicate that this set is all-natural 100% organic cotton.As other reviewers have commented on, this set IS quite soft and comfortable, like velvet. But it is rather plain--and not just because it contains no bleaches or dyes. For the (poor) quality of bumper and blanket you get, I'm more than a little disappointed. I ended up replacing the blanket with a down comforter.Bottom line: this set is overpriced for what you get and I wouldn't recommend it at all. If you don't care about organic, you can get a much nicer--and more colorful--set for less money. And if you want genuine organic, you're not getting what you're paying for anyway.
