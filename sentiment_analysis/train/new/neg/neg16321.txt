I bought this for a baby gift and will not be giving it because its actually embarrassing how small and hard it is.  Not suitable for a child. I also thought for $8 i was buying a 3 pack but after going back and reading the 'fine print', it says only 1 will be sent. I got the octopus which looks used, as it has a black scratch on the eye. I wouldn't even buy this if i found it as the dollar store.
