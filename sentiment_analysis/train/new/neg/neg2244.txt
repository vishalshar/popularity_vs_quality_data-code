When these things actually work, they're great. No doubt about it. The problem that I keep running into is the amount of leaking that these bottles do. I mean, they literally leak everywhere.  I get more formula on my 3 month old son's clothes than I actually get in his mouth. I assumed that the bottles warped around the ring because of so many runs in the dishwasher, but after reading some of these reviews, I'm not so sure. Though there are much worse bottles out there (Parent's Choice), I still can't honestly recommend these bottles to anyone. Take a pass. You can thank me later.
