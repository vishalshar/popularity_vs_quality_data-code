I ordered this bag because 2.5 years ago I purchased one and loved it. I have been a little disappointed in the wear my original bag showed (at this point a lot of the pleather is coming off even though I've babied it) but I figured, what the heck, this one was on sale and I LOVED the organization, so for the new baby I was going to try Timi Leslie again. The pebbled look doesn't look anything like leather. It looks really cheap and fake. The old look was much better. I'm also disappointed in the quality with this new one. Maybe the got a new manufacturer since my first or I may have just got a defective bag but the back zipper is crooked and the grommets had some issues that for over 100$ it should be in great condition. I'm spending the extra money for a Lily Jade bag instead now.
