I agree these burp cloths are on the thin side. My complaint is that I didn't receive the burp cloths as shown in the picture on Amazon. I received 2 green burp cloths and 2 green and yellow striped burp cloths. The green and yellow striped cloths are hideous...not sure what that is all about but I'm not going to return them. They're gonna get thrown up on anyway lol. But the one's pictured on Amazon are much cuter... Wish I would have gotten the cute polka dot cloths. Just want people to know in case they are purchasing this as a gift. The ones I received are oversized burp cloths which is nice. This way I can fold them lengthwise so they become the size of a normal burp cloth and aren't so thin. Lastly, they're not super flannely. They just feel like thin cotton. The tags on the burp cloths say, "Luvable Friends" so it is the right company just the wrong package/patterns. Amazon's super saver free shipping is great and everything I purchase on Amazon gets shipped out to me quickly. Amazon has been great.
