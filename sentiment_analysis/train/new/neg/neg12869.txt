I have ordered from Amazon.com probably a hundred times and this is my first review, because this is the first time I've received something that was just awful. I received the package right at lunch time, so opened it immediately and washed for use. I suctioned it to my 13 month old daughters high-chair tray and put her lunch inside of it. I walked back to the kitchen to grab her sippy cup. When I came back, she had the dish in her hand upside down with her lunch spilled out on her chair and all over the floor. I salvaged what I could and tried suctioning again - thinking it was my fault at first. The suction felt really strong. I sat and watched her and within a few moments she had it off again. I tried wetting the bottom of the suction ring (thinking of some of her bath toys with suction). Again, the suction felt strong. I kept her from grabbing at it. I checked the seal after about a minute and there was zero suction - it was releasing the seal on its own. I will be returning this item immediately for a refund.
