I bought this when we first got our front-loading washer to reduce my wife's fears about our precocious 3 year old and his older brother "playing" in the laundry room.The problem with this device is that the only method of installing it on the washer (or dryer) is the adhesive backing. This worked great for about a month, but then it just fell off because the adhesive had worn off.If you are concerned about your kids getting into a front load washer, I recommend buying a washer model that has a door lock button/feature. There is of course some chance that a kid could figure out how to unlock the door, but not much more so than the chance that they could figure out how to open this device, or just aggressively pull on the door until the adhesive gives out. The other option would be to put a lock on your laundry room door. Definitely more effective, and possibly cheaper.
