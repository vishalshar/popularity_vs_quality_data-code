I am new to cloth diapering so like anyone trying something new, I did a lot of reading and then dove in head first and purchased several different styles and brands of cloth diapers.  I purchased this diaper at the same time as other, which included Bummis Duo Brite AI2, Flips, and Thirsties pocket diapers. So far this is my least favorite diaper. Every time I use it, it leaks. I tried adding additional inserts and monkeying with the different size adjustments without success.  I've used all the other diapers and no problems with leaking.  This diaper might work well for a different family but just didn't work well for ours.
