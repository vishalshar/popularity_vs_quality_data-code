I ordered these when the title was for "8 count" because I thought, hey, they have come out with the same product as reviewed under the 4-count, but at a  better price.  When I received the cloths, the packaging even said "8 count", but there were only 4 in the pack.  I called Amazon and learned that the title was a mistake because the content description listed the cloths as a 4-count.  Amazon refunded me half of the purchase price since I thought that I was receiving 8 cloths.I see now that they have re-titled the product with the correct count, but they did not lower the price.  Therefore, I have to say that I think that $24-$26 is quite a bit to pay for 4 simple cloths.  Yes they are soft and organic, but they are not super-large.
