It's just not a smooth ride unless you are on ultra smooth ground.  My Britax B-Agile is smoother ride.  I love the rear facing ability, but I often find that the wheel lock release at even the slightest bump. This causes the stroller to become unstable.  This stroller is also very bulky when folded.  I'm about to sell my Flyer as I have just ordered an Indie. I feel like I wasted time and money.  The B-Agile will be our compact travel stroller, and I'll use the Indie when we're out at fairs, etc.
