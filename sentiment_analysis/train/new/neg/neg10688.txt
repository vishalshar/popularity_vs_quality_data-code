I love the print, simple to clean just treat like you would stained delicates, and they are very comfy and soft. But for a super pad i was expecting something a bit longer, and for some kind of absorbing material on the wings. Charlie Banana should make a overnight type deal for those who are "leakers" (sry gross D:) They are not long enough for overnight unfortunately but make great pads for day use for light or med flow wouldnt say for sure on heavy flow though.
