I bought these because I could not find white in our local stores.  I have Safety First corners that have been in place at least 2 years with no issues.  First, these are really not white, they are off-white.  The bag has corners & the stickers included.  They are not on the corners, you place it yourself.  I did that and places it on the corners of my girls' new dresser.  I pressed them down & held them for about 45 seconds.  They are not solidly stuck, but move & sick cock-eyed.  I am constantly pressing them back in place.  They are protecting my kids' heads from the sharp dresser corner, but I would not recommend or by it again.
