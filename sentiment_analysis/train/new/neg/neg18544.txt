I was very displeased with the quality all together! When taking the produce out of the box I immediately found on of the plates chipped and the piece that product was chipped off was no where to be found! The tower has a slight lean, mine is leaning right. I read the product reviews before purchasing and thought I'd be kind enough to give it my own opinion. Blast! You sink my battle shop. Wilton sales some of the best and cheapest towers I found myself going out today an hour before the birthday party. Don't buy it!
