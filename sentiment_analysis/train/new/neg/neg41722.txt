After having this stroller for a while I've become very annoyed that there is no option for a cup holder for me to hold my coffee. Another dumb thing is the safely bar is too high and my son is on the tall side. You cannot buy an snack tray for when he's older. It seems like this would be easy for them to make but there are no options. I would not buy this stroller again for the price you can get a better one that has many options.
