The whole point of the storage bag is to get milk from point A to point B (my freezer).  These bags are very difficult to close as they rely on supermarket produce technology to seal the bags (those little coated wire twist ties).  Obviously these are not going to make a great airtight or milk-tight seal.Hilariously, my box of bags boasts scientific proof that these bags are superior since the plastic has lower Oxygen permeability.  Sure, the plastic might be space age but if you can't get the bag to close, plenty of Oxygen is going to get in the top and spoil your milk.I now have a bunch of these boxes sitting around doing nothing but making me mad.  I have received several from "friends" who are happy to dump these on me when they find out I'm pumping.  Each box is full except one or two bags.  Apparently that is how long it takes to realize that these bags totally suck.
