After reading the reviews and ingredients I was expecting a little better of a product. It's not terrible in that it didn't make the rash worse, but on my baby's bum it doesn't help much if any so I still incorporated desetin into the routine....until I figured out that lavender oil (essential oil) is also good for skin. So I diluted a few drops, poured it into a sprayer...and voila no more need for creams....ill give this ointment out to my next friend who has a baby to try but for me there's no room for it anymore
