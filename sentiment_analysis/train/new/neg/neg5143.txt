Two big problems for me:1. It's hard to clean the tubing. No matter how much rinsing I did with hot hot water, it always looked like there was milk still trapped inside. I didn't want my children to keep drinking through the tubes when I couldn't tell whether they were clean or not.2. We got this so our babies could drink from bottles hands free, but by the time they're old enough to do that without dropping the nipples from their mouths (and then needing mom or dad to put them back) they're old enough to hold a bottle or sippy cup on their own so they don't need this.I was disappointed. I thought this would make life a little easier for my husband and me, but we wound up not even using it.
