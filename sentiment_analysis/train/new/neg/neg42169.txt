I love the set outside the fact when we wrote on it with the supplied chalk the message did not come off completely.  So, it looks like the first message is stuck on the plate for life.  I find this happens no a days with cheap chalk boards.  Things just are not made like used to be.  It would get 5 stars had it been a higher quality chalk board and let me erase my message completely.
