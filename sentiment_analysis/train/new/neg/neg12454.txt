I think these toys are well constructed, made of great materials and nicely colored. The idea of putting little items inside the cubes with a window is great. Although there are little teething "handles" for each toy, my baby has a hard time grasping and teething them. Basically, these are big cubes that some babies may have a challenge picking up.My baby best enjoys these toys when I hang them in a play gym. That way, these cubes are suspended in the way and the little toys inside move around, which my baby likes to do.
