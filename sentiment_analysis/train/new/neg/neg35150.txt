I like this stroller, it was mostly assembled before I got it.  Took about 30mins to go through instructions and realized I didn't have to do much.  It is light, easy to collapse and maneuverable  with 1 hand, so I could roll it in front and still have a roll-on carry on through an airport.Couple of things I didn't like, the fabric looked cheap, it was a bit spot dirty when it arrived, but a soft cloth and soapy water got rid of that.The biggest issue though is that the leg space is small.  When my son (17months) falls asleep and I put him all the way down in sleep position.  A good almost 8 inches of his feet are hanging out with no support. I don't like that at all.  It looks uncomfortable and probably is.  His legs do not hang out his other stroller when he sleeps.  If I had known about this, I would not have purchased this stroller.  If you don't mind that, you will like the lightness and ease of movement.
