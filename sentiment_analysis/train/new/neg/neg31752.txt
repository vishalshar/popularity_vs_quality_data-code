Beautiful jogger...but the seat is short. Gave it the benefit of the doubt after reading reviews and now I don't want to deal with the hassle of a return.This really does look like a quality stroller, although we have only received it today. Sturdy, quality materials, and our 15 month old seems comfy. The problem was when we put our 3yr old in it. Her head hit the top. We had hopes of using it for our 5 and 6yr old as well on outings when they got tired since it holds up to 70 lbs. They will be able to ride but not comfortably. Such a shame considering the price.The other things that were a little bit of a let down were the seat position and the ability to raise and lower the seat. The level of recline in the seat I am overlooking due to it being a jogger. The ability to lower and raise the seat I am ok with because it is sturdy. It will just take a couple extra steps.With this said, my husband loves it. We purchased the blue and he is extremely comfortable using it. We have all girls and he loves that this one is more "manly" looking", color and style. It isn't too boyish for the little ones either. He also loves that it is able to go through our trails in the woods. I am not a jogger but we needed something that would be a comfortable ride over bumps and dips. I also feel confident that my mother will love pushing it through the stores.I'm sure it will withstand vigorous use, we just hope our LO won't outgrow it too fast.I do recommend spending the extra for the snack tray and the cup holder. We purchased the same brand and I'm happy with both. The tray is a little high but our little girl can reach just fine. Happy to see she can grow into this instead of outgrowing it.Overall it looks like a pretty good stroller. And like my husband said, we could find fault in any one we would have gotten. Good quality though. :-)
