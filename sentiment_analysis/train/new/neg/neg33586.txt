After less than one year in use the plastic became brittle and broke.  I would have never realized this but I dropped a sock behind the kids dresser and was trying to inch it out a little to retrieve the sock and the plastic safety straps snapped with little to no force.  Once I removed them from the wall they were so dry and brittle that you could snap them like a tortilla chip.  These should be recalled in my opinion.
