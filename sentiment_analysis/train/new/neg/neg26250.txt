This music player is a great idea but there are a couple of things that it needs. First it needs a monitor or something that indicates that it is fully charged and done when it is fully charged. Next, it needs a better and more intuitive operating system, it was really hard to figure out how to play this thing with the usb stick. At least with a CD player, you see the disc spinning. With the stick, you don't know what is going on. Our biggest problem was that it would run out of power and we didn't know it. The power cord is also WAY TOO SHORT.
