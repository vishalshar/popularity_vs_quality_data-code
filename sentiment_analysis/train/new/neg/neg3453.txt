I bought this swing when my daughter was 3 months old.  We were traveling and I knew I couldn't bring our big swing with us.  But being gone 10 days I didn't know what I was going to do - this swing was a lifesaver at first!!!  She was 3 months old (about 12 or so pounds) had good neck control and loved swinging.  It worked great...but she looked so tiny in it!  We used it on the go then as the main swing and at home placed it on the 2nd floor for a secondary swing - worked great. HOWEVER...we traveled again when she was nearly 6 months old and while the swing works great and the motor doesn't even have to be on the highest setting (5).  I can no longer place her in it - its just NOT safe.  She was fussing so normally I would put her in the big swing and she'd calm right down...I put her in this swing and she stretched out so her feet were at the bottom (metal area that is covered) which gave her just enough umph to wiggle...and her head got went off the swing right in between the part where the swing attaches to the base.  Had I not been there watching her and the swing kept moving she could have been SERIOUSLY injured as her neck would have been between the two parts moving and smoosh. :(  Do I recommend this swing?  If you have nothing else to get and need something in a pinch for an itty bitty perhaps.  BUT I'd say you have to absolutely watch your little one and when they show signs of movement remove them from the swing and put it away.  THat means you don't get much use out of a 60-70$ item.  Ways this swing could be better?  In stead of a 3 point harness system it could have a 5 point harness system over the shoulders perhaps preventing the children from having the ability to move as much.
