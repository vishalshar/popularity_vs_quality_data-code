When I bought for my child, she seemed excited about the cats, but now that she's going to middle school, she doesn't think it's so cute. But I like it because it has many compartments that can fit different foods - sandwich, fruit cups, juice, yoghurt without worrying that things will get smooched together. I like it because  it's made of durable material so it's easy to clean and it's very light weight.
