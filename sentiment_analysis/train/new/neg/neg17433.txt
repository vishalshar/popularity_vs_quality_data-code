I wanted to like this but it's going back. I already have a Foscam monitor for my older child but I wanted one that I could have a separate handset for my baby. This monitor does not work well for us. The night vision, while it allows you to see the baby just fine, tries to compensate constantly causing the monitor to flash every few seconds. This is very disturbing to a light sleeper. Additionally, if you use the VOX with the sound on, the monitor beeps every time it detects movement.Another note on the VOX is it is useless if you use a loudish fan like we do. We use the fan to help drown out noise in our baby's room but this fan sets off the sensor leaving the monitor on or beeping on every few seconds.My baby's room is next to mine and I still constantly get the "out of range" notification. If you use a cell phone near it, forget it.  I like the idea of the magnetic base but it does not seem to function as it's supposed to. Throughout the night, it would shift slightly and make it so that I couldn't see my baby at all. I would prefer if it had an attached base and even better, remote tilt/pan feature.Some positives: I actually do like the lullaby feature. However, I can use my iPod with the same effect.  I also appreciate the nightlight since my baby still wakes throughout the night and it's nice to be able to see without turning any lights on. Again, this can easily be achieved with a nightlight.Unfortunately, I am sending this monitor back and going back to my trusted Foscam.
