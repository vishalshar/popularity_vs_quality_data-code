I like to bring a variety of snacks for my three year old when we will be out running errands for the better part of a day.  I was excited about this snack dispenser because it would consolidate all of the selections into one receptacle and I wouldn't have to dig around for the multiple containers in my bag.I read all the reviews & saw the warnings of how little they fill and how bulky they were.  I purchased one anyway because I was okay with making the bulk trade-off to get rid of multiple containers.  As far as how much they hold, I decided to go by the pictures and figured people were just complaining.Unfortunately, they really don't hold enough for me to justify the bulk.  There's just no room.  The dividers take up too much space & create angles that the snacks can't fit in.  There is a lot of wasted space.  What is left just simply does not leave enough room for a snack.  Maybe if there were two compartments instead of four it would open enough space and cut some of the angles the snacks can't fit in, but I'm not sure.  I filled one section of my cup and it held 33 goldfish crackers.  This is not near enough for a full day of errands for me, even when you multiply that number by four.Although I love the idea, I filled it once, then immediately took the snacks out & went back to multiple containers without even using it.  It's in the back of my cupboard, never used.  I will give it one more chance when my youngest is old enough for snacks.  Maybe this will hold enough for a younger child.  Otherwise, I have no use for it as intended.
