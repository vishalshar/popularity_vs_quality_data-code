I had been using an oogie bear, and lost it, so I was looking for a cheaper alternative.  This one wasn't worth the money to me.  It doesn't open very wide, so I have to hold it awkwardly to get it to open a bit wider to make it easier to grab, because if I don't get a good grip on the boogie, then the smooth plastic of this just slides right off.  I need something that can grab that boogie in one stroke, because if you have to go back in, the kid has figured out what is going on and is going to struggle.  I think it could be useful on small boogies, close to the opening - but I don't need it for those - I can usually get those with my fingers.
