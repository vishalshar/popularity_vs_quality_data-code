At first glance, this seems to be a wonderful kit....  or at least one thinks so.  It comes in a "sturdy" hard plastic case, and seems to carry the most essential products.  The products in themselves appear to be top of the line with rubberized handles and even magnifying glasses.  It seems to say safety and security.  Well our baby has yet to arrive but I had an emergency with a very sick little 4 year old in which I was forced to break out "the kit".  And man was I sorely disappointed.  The thermometer is not lit and hard to read, and to top it off it doesn't even beep when it is done, so you have to sit there and continually watch it.  When it says it only takes 90 seconds... it is lying!!  I was there holding blasted thing under her arm for 3-4 minutes, every 3-4 hours when she was due for her tylenol or motrin... GRRRRR!!!  The other wonder I was initially awed by was the handy medicine dispenser.  Two words.... IT SUCKS!  It was impossible to get the medicine all the way into the syringe without leaving a significant portion in the cup, and the plunger itself took an act of congress to pull!!!  We tried everything, even turning the darned thing upside down.  All I know is I am a veteran mom of 3, and I know from experience when you have a cranky, sick toddler, THE LAST thing you want to fidget with is an unreliable medicine dispenser!!!  You have enough of a fight just to get the medicine into the child without fighting with the dispenser too!!!  In the end the cheap one the drug store sent was WAY better!!!  Save your money and time and spend it on something else or even better yet make your own with all the products YOU like most :) And BTW, they are right...  all the equipment inside the kit does fall out and all over the place.  Really... Safety 1st could have done a MUCH better job!!!
