Both my son and I like this mobile, but it only stays on for 5 minutes at a time. I've been using it for about a month now and have had no problems with it except that it doesn't stay on long enough. When the mobile stops, he cries. I would've gotten a different one if I would have known it only goes for 5 minutes, but I couldn't find any other mobiles that had the projection lights on the top AND the toys hanging down underneath. Also would be neater if the fish in the part that attaches to the crib would light up. If it would stay on a reasonable amount of time, I would definitely give it 5 starts!!!
