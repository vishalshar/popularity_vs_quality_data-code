This brush actually works very well. The sponge does a good job of cleaning the interior of bottles while the nipple brush is a useful tool for cleaning the nipple insides. The way the brush folds inside the handle is also quite neat. It is also very affordable.However, we have had problems with these brushes breaking - specifically the  handle snaps where it attaches to the sponge head. Cheap to replace but irritating nevertheless. Have tried a couple of other brushes and this is the best (in our experience) in terms of how well it cleans so we will probably keep on buying despite the built in obsolescence.
