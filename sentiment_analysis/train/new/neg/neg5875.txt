I have several of the Oball products, and really wanted to like this one.  The concept is great - my son loves to watch the beads filter down through the layers.  Unfortunately, I should have paid more attention to the description, as the 6" diameter is just too large for his little hands.  We've had this for three months now, and my one year old son has only played with it maybe two or three times.  This might be a better option for older toddlers, but if you have a young baby, I'd recommend trying the Oball shaker or the Oball 4" rattle instead - my son has gotten tons of play value out of these!I've included a photo to show you how this ball sizes against the regular Oball rattle.
