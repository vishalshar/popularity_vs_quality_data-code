It's a cute toy, but it hits the baby in the face sometimes when you're carrying the car seat. Then while it's up and it's in the way when taking the baby out of the car seat. But it's made well and the baby enjoyed playing with it sometimes. I had to cut a hole in my car seat blanket cover to use it though.
