We recieved a product with handles that are not removeable.  We have used the older version of these cups for years since our son started sippy cups in 2010.  Avent sippy cups used to have remevoable handles and interchangable spouts that you could change as the child grew older.  The new models of these sippies are very hard to clean, the round "valve" is nearly impossible to pry out of it now that the spout is a permement fixture in the lid.  Anything that requires a knife or tool to get apart is dangerous and not worth my time.  I am so sad we have lost our original cups because the new products are terrible.  Please, Avent, go back to the original design!!
