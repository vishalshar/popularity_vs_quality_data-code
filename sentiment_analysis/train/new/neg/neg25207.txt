So far I am loving this set. It's super cute and the colors are great. The pacifiers are awesome since my daughter will only take the one from the hospital and she takes these and they are much cuter.Edit...After using a while she still loves the binkies but  the bottles while cute, seem to give her pretty bad gas. The playtex vent aire work much better
