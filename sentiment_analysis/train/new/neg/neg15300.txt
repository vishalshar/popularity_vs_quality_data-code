I chose this item firstly because all of my children have had exersaucers and they are great. Secondly, for the oceanic theme. What disappoints me is the teadious assembly. You would think that in 14 years the item would become easier to assemble - no- every other model has been simpler than this. It is not necessary to have me assembling spring parts. Other exersaucers have come out of the box and just clicked together; if they had maintained this standard, I'd have given it 5 stars. Otherwise, it is loads of fun and I believe a 'must have' item for the sitting to walking baby-one might consider a different model, however.
