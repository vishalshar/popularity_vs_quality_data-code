We have used the Nuby straw cups with the 3 piece assembly with good results with our 19 mo old grandson for several months--and now that he is off the bottle were buying some more -- wanted to try something with an easier cleaning/install system...very disappointed in the "no spill"--it may not qualify for "spilling" but there are definitely leaks--he will pull on the soft nipple which causes the seal to come loose at some point and unless he is perfectly straight with holding/drinking there will of course be leaks...Maybe a 19 mo old is too young to obey the laws of physics required to use this glass w/o problems...if so put an age designation on the description...
