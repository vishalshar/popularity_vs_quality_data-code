I purchased this November 2012 when I was expecting my second child. We did not install til January.. Installation was easy and had no issues. Whatever issues with leaking and installation previous posters have complained about must have been corrected. This item has worked like a champ until recently. Now I am annoyed. ONLY 9 MONTHS OF USE spraying my diapers and the button to spray is broken. My husband has pulled item apart to figure out the issue. Apparently the mechanics inside the sprayer are plastic. The piece that opens and closes the valve snapped making my product unusable. It no longer sprays. Contacted amazon who told me they could not help me. They directed me to a company that shows NO signs of this product on their website...I have a 9 month old in diapers and another on the way in a very short time and NO DIAPER SPRAYER... IRRITATED.Dont waste your time purchasing this product unless you plan to replace it in a few months anyway.. Look for an item that is REAL stainless steel with REAL stainless steel parts.
