This toy should be awesome. Unfortunately, the RFID tags just aren't up to the task, so it ends up being frustrating.I would like to say, though, that anyone who thinks the sounds are too quiet must have a loud TV on in the room, because they're just fine.Here's the problem: the animal names/sounds only play if you put the animal in or take it out at just the right speed. If your child shoves the monkey in quickly, no result. If they push the monkey in but miss, and kinda push and twist until it finally goes, no result. You can get it to consistently say the names/sounds if you put the animals in or take them out at a medium pace, but at least my child has no interest in doing that.Which means you end up paying too much for what ends up being a standard put-toys-in-take-toys-out arrangement. The Manhattan Toy Put and Peek Birdhouse is much better for that, anyway.And while the on button is cleverly concealed in the tent door, the only way to tell if the device is on is by sticking a toy in and seeing if it says 'lion!' or 'raaaaawr!' or whatever. This is very frustrating for a child when they've finally gotten the hang of putting the toys in just right.
