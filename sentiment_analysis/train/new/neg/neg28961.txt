This is the second one ordered (1st one came completely damaged and used) The second came slightly damaged with chips of paint off the corners. The reason for the corners being chipped is that the manufacturer doesn't spend a few extra pennies and put styrofoam in the corners of the box. The gate....somewhat cheaply made....poor instructions...no wall anchors....need to go to store to finish product....hardware screws, are cheap. I need 2 more gates for the house and I can assure you it won't be this product.
