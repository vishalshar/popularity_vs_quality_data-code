I like the sturdy glass and bright colors- durable. However.... the nipples do not vent. Makes for a much longer and frustrating feed for my 5 month old. I do not want to purchase additional nipples at this point as I have already spent $15 a bottle. Also, the neck is narrow making it difficult to get a scoop of formula into the bottle- very messy. Found myself using one container to pour into another. I dislike additional steps and things to clean. And as much as I like the silicone sleeves they were hard to slip in and out of my diaper bag/purse. Picky, yes but I'm like that. I have 3 kids and need it to run quick and smooth. Great bottles but they clearly do not come from someone in the "baby industry".
