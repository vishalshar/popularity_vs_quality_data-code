I never leave reviews but I'm livid! I got this for my nephew who is to be baptized this weekend. It came in the mail and it's supposed to be what the picture shows. Instead the "N" on Now is written in with Sharpie... The "I" is missing and the "L" is written in with Sharpie as are some "O"'s.... the "W" in down is written in with Sharpie. HOW CAN I GIVE THIS TO MY NEPHEW LOOKING LIKE THIS? This is sold by JAKS on Amazon so if you see that name...DO NOT BUY THIS! I could have got this in better shape at the Dollar Store. Seriously. I'm an Amazon Prime member & I always get things off of Amazon but this the by far the poorest looking item I've ever seen. Very disappointed.
