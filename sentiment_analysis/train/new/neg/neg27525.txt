I have a very wide space of 66" and I thought this gate would be perfect.  Boy, was I wrong!  I had a friend install it for me.  He is very handy and it took him about an hour.  This metal gate is very heavy and some genius over at Summer Infant created plastic hinges for this heavy, metal gate.  After 2 weeks of use, the top hinge came out of the wall (screws, anchors and all)  We had to reinstall the hinge with longer screws and bigger anchors and the gate was never the same.  It sagged and a few days later, the top hinge actually cracked in half!  I called Summer Infant.  They are out of stock on this hinge because they have had so many calls and complaints and they ran out!  According to Summer Infant, they redesigned a new, sturdy, metal hinge.  I ordered a new hinge 2 weeks ago and it is still on back order.  Summer Infant claims that I will receive my new hinge the end of next week.  We'll see.
