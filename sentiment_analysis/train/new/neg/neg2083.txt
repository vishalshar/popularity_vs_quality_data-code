The Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Silicone Nipples are fine.  I have used them without issues, except my newborn prefers the Playtex Breastlike Silicone Nipple instead.I am rating this with one star so that other buyers will know that in some of the Amazon website displays of this NaturaLatch Nipple, the incorrect photo is displayed.  The BreastLike Nipple is erroneously shown instead of the NaturaLatch.  The BreastLike Nipple has the double rings at the base of the nipple (versus the single ring at the base for the NaturaLatch).  Seeing the erroneous BreastLike Nipple displayed, I ordered six of these nipples; I received the NatuaLatch Nipples instead.
