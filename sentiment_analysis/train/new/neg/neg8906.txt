The price and ease of use for this carrier is pretty good, however if you live in a warm climate you and your baby will burn up wearing it. It is dark colored and quite thick, my baby and I are both sweaty after using it.  My biggest complaint is the rough texture of the materials and the placement of the front latches. My son has gotten mild scrapes and redness on his legs and face from the carriers material and front latches. He likes to look out the side which means he is wedged against the strap. I have ordered  " The Ultimate Baby Wrap" as a replacement carrier. It comes in lighter colors (retailers other than Amazon carry light grey and tan), has soft material,  and has no latches. I can also breast feed in it which is an option the Snugli does not offer.I do highly reccomend investing in a carrier of some type. My son is enjoys being in a carrier and is much happier in a  carrier than a stroller, particularly in crowded or noisy settings. I also find it much easier for me to go places using the carrier instead of the stroller or carseat carrier. It is great when shopping and for going to dr appointments.
