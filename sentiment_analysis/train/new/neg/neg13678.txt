I just started using this for about a week. I'm only 5 1/2 months pregnant with my first child, so I don't have any visible stretch marks (and hopefully it stays that way).Pros:1. Smells great - not over powering2. 1 application only and the moisture stays throughout the day (I follow the instructions and use 2x a day)3. Handy - if you travel or are on the goCons1. I think it's too small2. I seem to be the only one mentioning this (so I don't know if theres something wrong with the one I have), but there are small particles like a salt scrub that are on the product and go on my skin when applying which is quite annoying (please let me know to those that have used this if it's the same for you).
