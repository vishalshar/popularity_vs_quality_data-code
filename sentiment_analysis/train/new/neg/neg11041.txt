Purchased these sheets in 3 different colors. I bought one for my toddler's bed and the other 2 for my daughter, who is due in November. The orange sheet is not a very bright orange, more like a dark peach color. It doesn't match his Denver Bronco's room but he loves how soft it is! I washed before using and it held up well to washing. I will be returning the 2 sets I bought for my daughter because they do not fit the mattress as snugly as I would like, especially not for a child under the age of 1. They are fine for a toddler though. Not so fun fact: These sheets are sold by a company called "American Baby," however, they are made in China!
