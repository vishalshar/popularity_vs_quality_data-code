I am  disappointed in these covers. They don't fit any of the public toilet seats I've used them on. The tags are tough to pull off and when you have a two year old who has to go it's annoying to be fighting with glue tags so I've ended up just putting the covers on w/or using the glue tags. The material is of good quality but they just don't fit the darn toilet seats would not recommend and will be looking at these reviews for other suggestions. UGHHH!!
