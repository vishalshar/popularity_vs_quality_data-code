These would be better if the clips were connected to the chain not just hooked on. They fall off all the time and when the chain is full it is hard to keep the stuffed animals/plushes on without one falling off. I have mine hanging horizontally. It would probably work better vertically but we do it this way for the safety of my 2 and 6 year old. I will probably be purchasing the net that hangs in the corner to replace this and give this to my older nephew for his plushes.
