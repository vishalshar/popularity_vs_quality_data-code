I bought the NUK Silicone nipples as an alternative to the latex ones when I was trying to introduce bottle feeding to my already breastfed two month old. He didn't like the feel of the silicone and I really couldn't blame him, the feel of the silicone nipples is very stiff and hard; very different from a mother's breast.I switched to the latex version of these nipples and he took to that very well, possibly because these were softer.  I am waiting until he is older to re-introduce the silicone nipples. Now that my son is 6-months old and has adjusted to bottle feeding, I will try to use the silicone nipples again; hopefully this time around he might be able to use them.
