Right out of the box it looked like a promising item that quickly became a frustration.  First the battery door was jammed shut with a stripped screw.  After half an hour of prying with a screw-driver and a knife for leverage i was able to open  it.  Poured in the soap solution per manual and turned on.  The noise of the motor was deafening; it sounded like a professional-grade meat grinder.  No bubbles yet. Just a steady spit of soap and the grind of the motor.Then i diluted the solution with water.  That helped to make half-bubbles that popped and sent the spray right into my kid's face.  Ok, thinks I, this is can be avoided by attaching it to the bathroom wall below the kid's eye level.  The suction cup held for 15 minutes and then crashed to the bathroom floor. After opening the battery compartment to retrieve the batteries i noticed that it is not water-tight--brilliant idea to put electric toys with no water-proofing into direct contact with water!This crap is going back!
