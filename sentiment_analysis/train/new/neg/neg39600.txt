Took a while to discover, but this adapter does not fit the Click Connect series of Graco Snugride seats.We purchased this item specifically because all the literature said that it fitted the Snugride 35 -- we have a Snugride 35 Click Connect - which it is NOT compatible with.I don't really know who's at fault with this one... Graco for making two different systems under the same name (Snugride 35 and Snugride 35 Click Connect) or Uppababy for not making it more clear that there are incompatible models.
