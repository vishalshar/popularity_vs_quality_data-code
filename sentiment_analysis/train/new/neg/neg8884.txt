Pretty much pointless.  The design of the arms causes the tray to project so far out front away from the child, that even when the child is in the fully upright position it is nearly impossible for them to reach the tray.  My son has to grab the edge and pull himself forward, causing the back fabric of the stroller to compress, allowing him to reach anything on the tray.  Then let go and fall back.  He has to do this every time he wants to grab something.
