I love the Eric Carle theme so of course I wanted the car seat mirror!  The elephant is adorable and the straps that attach this to the back of the seat are well made and there are no issues at all with it falling or with poor placement.My issues with this product is that the mirror isn't any good. First it comes with a sticker on it that if you don't get lucky removing leaves a film that is impossible to get off. Second, the mirror just isn't that good, it's difficult to see in because it has a distortion. I consider it to be a driving hazard because it will cause you to keep your eyes off the road for too long in order to see what your baby is doing.If you need to see your baby, and I know that sometimes we do.. then I advise you to get a better mirror or simply pull over and assess your child's needs. No good will come out of getting into an accident because you're focused on trying to see into a mirror that isn't really a mirror.
