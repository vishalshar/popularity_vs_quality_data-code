This stroller is absolutely BEAUTIFUL, BUT for the price I would've expected better quality. Don't get me wrong, it's very sturdy and easy to maneuver,  but when it comes to folding it, its very difficult, I have to take the seat off because it just doesn't fold flat, not to mention that the seat it's VERY heavy. And after less than 5 months of use, it's kind of breaking down on me :( ... sometimes when trying to fold it down, it gets stuck, making it impossible to fold and VERY frustrating, so I have to put it in my car without folding it down. And now, one of the wheels is making a very annoying sound (imagine going to the grocery store and picking the cart with the broken wheels, that sound!), I put some (a lot) WD40 and got rid of the sound for now.I would've liked to give it 5 stars because I absolutely fell in love with this stroller, but for that price, I shouldn't be dealing with these issues :(
