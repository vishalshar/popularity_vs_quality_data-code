My baby is almost 6 months and a friend of mine recommended it, today while he was jumping the exersaucer fell apart with my baby, the legs, the wires everything flew on the air and my baby hit the ground inside the upper plate. I would not recommended to anybody and be calling consumer report. I hope this dangerous baby gear is retired from the market.
