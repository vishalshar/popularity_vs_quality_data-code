I agree that the quilted sheet is a great idea for a more comfortable sleeping surface, but it's too small.  I can get the quilted sheet on the Graco pack-n-play mattress but the mattress does not lay flat.  Therefore the sheet buckles creating a dangerously lumpy surface for a sleeping baby.  I'm returning mine.
