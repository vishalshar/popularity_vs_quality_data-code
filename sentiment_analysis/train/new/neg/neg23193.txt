The Bright Starts Door Jumper is very accurate in color, the bright blues and green compliment each other perfectly.The door frame clamp is very sturdy and allows for babies of all weights. I have used the door frame jumper for my slender son, and also gifted to a friend who has a solid child and the door frame clamp worked great for both.The "support pillow" on the Bright Starts Door Jumper does nothing for additional support of small babies. My son just slumped even with the support pillow. Wrapping a blanket around him was much more supportive.The adjustable straps are nice, it worked best for us to put the strap up where my sons toes only touched the ground.The playtime toys were not bad at all. The zebra and giraffe we still have for my daughter now. The mirror is not great though, it fogs up quickly and reflects funny.The major downfall of the Bright Starts Door Jumper is the "hours of bouncing fun", the Bright Starts Door Jumper does not really bounce at all. My son used the Bright Starts Door Jumper more like a swing, he would walk forward lift up his feet and swing backwards. He would also use the Bright Starts Door Jumper to spin in circles. So not really a door jumper, more like a door spinner or door walker. For my son who hated bouncing, this worked great, however if you are looking for an actual bouncing affect get a different door jumper.
