We have used these mittens for two children. They are well made and attractive. However, after washing, the Velcro tab curled backwards, exposing the scratchy Velcro on the underside of the tab (see posted photo). There needs to be either be a longer strip of Velcro to keep the tab down, or maybe put the softer side of the Velcro on the tab so that the scratchy side isn't exposed when it curls back. I will say that these do stay on fairly well!
