We have an original ergo and I looooved that one. It was time for a new one so I figured the 360 sounded awesome.... And to be honest it's ok. I say just ok for four reasons:one- the Velcro waistband sucks. It's loud and you can't adjust it once it's on without undoing the whole thing and then re-velcroing it. Which with the original once it's on you can tighten and loosen pretty easily.Two- the clasp behind your shoulders is lower then on the original so you need someone there to help you, whereas with the original I could reach and connect it myself.Three- there aren't a any pockets on this one where with the original between the two pockets I could put my phone and cash or cards easily and not have to bring a bag or wallet.Four- the hood is much smaller, and as a breastfeeding mama I wasn't too happy about that. It doesn't cover the sides enough, and when we are nursing or the babe is sleeping it just doesn't cover as much as the original.So ya it's awesome they can be front facing but they definitely should  have done some study groups on this to troubleshoot some of these issues.
