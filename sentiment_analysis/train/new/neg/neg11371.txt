Impossible to secure in older model Graco high chair. Does the job of keeping baby off the cold plastic, but generally has to be repositioned every time I put my child in it. Material is repellent, which I like and machine washes easily and holds up well. Material is not soft, though - sorta like vinyl but softer.
