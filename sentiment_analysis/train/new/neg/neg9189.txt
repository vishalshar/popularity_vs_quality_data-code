I am a bit disappointed in the product. For the amount of postive reviews, it's not the greatest product. I previously owned a nose frida and wanted to try a new product this time around instead of just picking up some new filters and 2 years later the connections to keep the nose frida were getting slightly loose.The bubzi item looks great comes in some nice packaging etc. Looked extremely positive when I got it. The biggest problem is you don't know how much you got out and the nose tip part is so tiny it doesn't create the proper seal/suction up against the infants nose. The nose tip is extremely small unlike the other products which allow a full seal inside a nostril where this product just has a tiny tip which goes deep into the nose.I would personally pass on this product in the future and go with something else.
