As other reviewers stated, this is not reversible, it's solid grey and only one side can be used. Fortunately I knew that before purchasing and isn't an issue for me.The color isn't what I expected from the picture, the it's a very blue grey. It's also pretty thin, and the elastic doesn't feel extremely heavy duty.The measurements listed are accurate. Honestly my mattress (standard from Pottery Barn) is a little bit bigger, so it doesn't fit great, but obviously I can't fault them for that. I was hoping they would be the same size as the Carter's velour sheets, but they're smaller. The overall quality isn't as good either, in my option.To its credit, it's a very soft and cozy sheet that my son has no complaints about.
