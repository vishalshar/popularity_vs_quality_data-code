I bought this car seat for my daughter about a year ago and it has served us well.  It's big but comfortable and I love the sliding shoulder straps.  HOWEVER, I went to move the car seat yesterday from the middle of the car to one side and found that the mechanism you press to release the latch system is broken/stuck.  That means that I can't pull it tighter to make the seat more secure and I definitely can't loosen the strap to get the car seat out.  My concern is of course that the seat would come flying out during an accident. So I bought a Britax today and when it's delivered tomorrow I will cut this seat out of the car and throw it away.
