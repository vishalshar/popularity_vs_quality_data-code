This is a great idea and sometimes it works quite well, other times it is just a swing. My daughter was about 7 months when we got this and we only ended up using it a handful of times. I adjusted it and tried to make it as balanced and comfortable as possible but many times I ended up almost just carrying my daughter because she would kind of lean forward and just use the thing like a harness for flying. I first thought it was just her but after looking at it and using it with another child, the same thing happened. If she really wanted to walk with it she could but many times it tipped her forward and she ended up flying again.I really think the concept is great and at times it works well, but other times it just is not doing what it needs to do. It is a backsaver when working. Great for grandparents that do not want to hunch over to walk the grandkid around, but it just needs a few balancing tweaks in manufacturing and it might get 5 stars. It is possible that your kid will fair better than mine. Not a bad product by any means, but I might skip it if I had the chance to do it again.
