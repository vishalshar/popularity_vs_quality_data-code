I have looked a long time for a safe, unbreakable plate with dividers for my 'food separtist' kids.  I had these plates in my cart but did not buy for some time because of the high price.  I finally decided to buy them.  They are sturdy, cute, and large enough to accomodate my four year-old's bigger portions.  However, the fact that you cannot wash them in the dishwasher is a hassle, also the rubber grippers on the bottom have been falling out since day one.  I begrudgingly recommend only because there is nothing else out there with the same features.
