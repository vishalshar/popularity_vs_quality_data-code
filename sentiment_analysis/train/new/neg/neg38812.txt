As some other reviewers stated, this product claims to fit both 30 & 35 however it does not fit the 30 properly (at least ours).  I received this product and promptly got my Snugride 30 stuck in it - neither my husband nor I could remove it, rendering the carseat unusable.  I ended up calling Graco customer support and they walked me through a complicated process to unhook it (finally!) and they were able to direct order for me a second base that was actually made for the 30 alone (identical to the one that came with my 30).  This worked great - not sure why they don't just sell the 30 base -- evidently the only way to get it is to call Graco customer support.
