I didn't like these.  There were two flavors that tasted decent, peppermint & lavender, but all of the other sour fruit flavors really upset my stomach.  they didn't increase the nausea, but (sorry for the TMI ahead, but I want to help out women who are experiencing gastro issues already due to pregnancy), they made me really gassy.  Not good if you already feel like barfing and your GI system is moving slowly due to pregnancy hormones anyway.  It stunk that out of the container of candies and the whole box of lollipops only two pieces helped at all.  Honestly, cinnamon gum or cinnamon Altoids worked better, as did Mentos or other fruity candies that didn't have such a high sour factor.
