I threw it away.  Really.  I bought this as a baby shower gift and was late in giving a gift because this item was inferior.  The 'matting' was off center.  About 1/4 inch on one side and 3/4 inch on the other, so the picture was off center and there was no way to correct it, since it was obviously a printing error.  Everything else was really sweet, but I was just too embarrassed to give it as a gift since I knew it would never be displayed.
