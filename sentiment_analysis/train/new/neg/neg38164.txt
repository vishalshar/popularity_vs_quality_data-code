If for any reason you think you may have a large child I would not recomend this car seat.  My baby was only 8 pounds and 20 inches at birth,  and at 6 weeks(12 lbs and 24 inches)  he has practically outgrown this seat. I have taken out the head rest and he still may have only a good 4 weeks left in it.
