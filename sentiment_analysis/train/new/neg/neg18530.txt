Light weight enough that my 12 month old is able to tip it over.  Also, with the repeated cleaning that paint is coming off.  I'll need to add another layer of something to protect it so it does not continue to chip.  I liked it becuase it was wood - and much more attractive that the plastic chairs. It would be much better if they constructed it with more sturdy and heavy wood.  My friend has another Eddie Bauer chair that is a lighter color and seems to be a much heavier more solid wood. I wish I'd bought that one.
