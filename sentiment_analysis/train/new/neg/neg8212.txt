I have been using this shade in my 2003 Chevy Malibu. It does a pretty good job of blocking the sun from my son's eyes while still allowing me to see through it.  However, it does not stick to the window.  I think it may be more of a design issue with my car than with the shade.  The inside of my back window is covered with tiny black rubberized dots (not sure of their purpose?).  The cling-style shades won't stick to it either. I have been propping this shade up but it has fallen a few times.  I plan to try to use safety pins to attach to the ceiling and seat.  I can't give it more stars because I have had to come up with my own attachment process.  But I would recommend it to someone looking to block sun from the rear window.  Maybe others will have better luck getting it to suction on.
