I love the look and functionality of this mat BUT I will be returning it.  The fillers used to make the mat padded comes out of the fabric when my son moves around on the mat.  I noticed the white thread/fiber balls all over the mat the first time we used it and more kept coming out as we use it.  My son almost ingested one of the thread/fiber balls and the fibers can definitely be inhaled by a baby while on tummy time or rolling around in this mat.  I'm really disappointed since this is the best looking play mat I've seen, but it's just not safe for my 4 month old son or any baby!
