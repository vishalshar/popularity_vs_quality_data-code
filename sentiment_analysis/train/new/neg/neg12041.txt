I bought this night stand for my toddler's room. At first I wasn't sure about ordering this because of a few of the bad reviews I read but I really liked it so I just took a chance and ordered it. This night stand is really cute and matches her room perfectly! It is alot bigger than I thought it was going to be, its about the size of an adults night stand. It has a reversable graphic on the drawer (it has the princesses on one side and on the other its just plain pink with a heart on it.) you can also take that piece off if you wish, so it could just be a pink and white night stand with no graphic. The drawer slides out good with no problems. Took me about 30-45 mintues to put together with no help from the husband. It had good directions with it and all the parts needed plus a screw driver included. It was shipped fast and arrived on time. The only complant I have is that it did have a small scratch on the top peice, other than that its great.*UPDATE:Fell apart and broke...We are in the middle of moving so I emptied this nightstand and picked it up to load it in the moving van and the top piece fell right off and the whole night stand just smashed into pieces! I knew it was partical board but I thought it was well equipt enough to atleast withstand being picked up... very disapointed in this product after this. sorry to say but I wouldn't recomend this anymore so I lowered to 3 stars. I will add that I contacted amazon and they exchanged it for a new one.
