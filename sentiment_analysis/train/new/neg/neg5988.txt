The reason I bought them was that they were advertised as soft. I admit that they are soft. But....When I first received them, these wipes STINKED. They smelled like petroleum. I was washing them for at least 3 weeks to get rid of the smell.They may be dye-free and probably it is a blend of Rayon from Bamboo and Organic Cotton.I think the problem is the process and the chemicals they use to turn the bamboo into rayon.I used them for almost a year and at the end whenever they were wet, they turned into a white-purplish-light pink color. And the petroleum smell came back.I will never buy anything else except 100% organic cotton.
