Doesn't work efficiently on carpet. The pieces are slightly raised in areas when you walk on it and the circles come out of the squares. I don't believe the circles are all the same size because if you mix and match them with different squares they don't all fit perfectly. We are going to keep them because we are moving 7 months from now and we hope to find a home with hard wood floors.
