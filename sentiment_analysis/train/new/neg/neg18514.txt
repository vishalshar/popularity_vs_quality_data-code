so, I guess this is a tough review. while I think there are more negatives with this bed then pluses, I still would say go get it and use it.negatives:1-not stable enough or safe enough for a bed2-the sides have zero, ZERO support therefore any baby could simply roll out3-it is also very mushy in general- (again zero support) in the center, and so you really cannot place it anywhere that is not a firm rigid surface because the baby can curl forward in a ball or into the bedpluses:1-it seems compfy2-it's easy and light3- the baby does seem to fit well inside4- visibility of this infant bed is excellent -which for me is keyBottom Line: this is not -by far-my number 1 choice in infant beds but it's good temporarily and if you add support with towels pillows etc. it works. it will not be my baby's primary bed but it works on firm stable surfaces like a sofa or inside a pack and play and its mobile which  is what the designer wanted anyway.
