I bought this product after reading the reviews, I thought the wider snout would be better than some of the longer snouted ones.  It did not work very well, the two pieces come apart at the seam when you squeeze them.  Also, it wasn't that expensive but the shipping was $5 - which was twice the cost of the product itself.  When it came, there was no receipt or packing slip and they put it in a heavy cardboard box.  If I knew it was going to be $7-8,  I definitely wouldn't have bought it.  The best one we have is the medicalrite ear/ulcer bulb syringe, 3oz - it's green and the opening is bigger so I don't have to cram it up my 18month old's nose to get a good seal, it draws out a lot of snot and the rubber is soft.
