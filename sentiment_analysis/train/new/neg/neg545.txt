I purchased this item over 3 years ago in preparation for our daughter to be born. We used this primarily as a changing table, napping option in our office. It worked out perfectly for how we utilized this. We also did bring this outside and used it as a play area for our infant daughter too. As far as using this pack and play as a "pack and play"... I'd say, it's a bit cumbersome. I would not want to set this up and/or break-it-down on a regular basis. We did not use this as a sleep option for traveling with baby. We used a Baby Bjorn travel crib for that purpose. We, pretty much left this thing set up permanently as it was sort of a pain to set it up and take down. This is a nice item as a napping bed, changing table and outside play option. But as something that you'd want to bring along on trips; definitely not! As far as durability is concerned; we used it for 1.5 years on a daily basis and it seemed to be very durable. We ended up giving this item away to friends who have a new baby, and they like this item as well. However, they used it much like we did; primarily as a 2nd bed/changing table in a room other than baby's permanent room.
