We were using OXO Tot Roll Up bibs first. Which was OK for a while. The velcro made them too easy to open and take them off. And the upper part would get too wet after washing them and took a long while to dry them. Then we replaced them with bibs from Bebe Earth. All bought on amazon. The last ones worked better (harder plastic that was easy to clean and didn't required any time to dry up) and the only problem was the neck (it looks like beads. our twins learned to take these off as well and  they started chew off the beads and trying to swallow or put them in their noses or ears). So I decided to try these bibs with a hook thinking it would be hard to take them off. I was wrong. Beside that the bib is practically USELESS. it is too small and the upper part is too narrow it doesn't cover much, the pocket that is supposed to catch food and crumbs doesn't stay open. The silicone is too soft. It is hard to believe that so many people are satisfied.
