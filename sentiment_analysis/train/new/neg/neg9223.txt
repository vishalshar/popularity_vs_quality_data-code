We use this to connect our Bob Revolution SE  (2011) to the Mountain Buggy Scooter <http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DGLLIO2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0>.As far as a review for the connector only:Installation was tricky and took a long time for three of us - and we're all quite handy.  The foam/rubber that came with the clamp part wasn't really needed for our Bob Revolution, as it already has a bit of foam on the rear bar. I think this has affected it's overall install and scooter's folding capabilities.As an overall combination for the scooter using the connector:This stroller scooter fits the most basic of needs for us. We are an active family who live on a mountain where we go on daily extended walks/hikes with a baby, 3yr old, older kid and a couple dogs too.  We also travel frequently and hit trails wherever we go.  I was looking for something to help the wee boy when we're out for a long time/distance, or in areas where it is safer for him to stick with the stroller (like boardwalks through Yellowstone's geothermal features). This is a basic, though frustrating, solution for that.It is very difficult to push/steer the stroller with this buggy/scooter attached.  It takes an odd outstretched of wide stance to avoid kicking it, and only slight steering is possible without coming to a near stop and lifting the entire stroller and scooter to make the turn.When separate from the stroller, it only steers by leaning - limiting and tricky for a 3yr old.I've yet to master folding it up, but when we can get it up/down, then it will still be useful to have.  Overall, it's a disappointment, yet I can't see that there are better options out there for our Bob Revolution.
