I like that this bib is waterproof, easy to clean, and has snaps (my daughter learned at a young age how to pull off bibs with velcro closure).  That being said, the purpose of a bib is to keep the wearer's clothes clean.  This bib fails because the neck opening is way too large.  Sure, there are 2 snaps for adjusting the neck size.  But even on the second snap, the bib stands away from my daughter's neck and I constantly watch food fall behind the bib and cover her clothes.  Out of curiosity, I tried the bib on myself and was able to secure it around my own neck on both snap settings.  I don't have an unusually small neck, so I'm wondering how many babies out there really have such huge necks that this bib fits them properly.  Out of desperation, I used a "chip clip" to secure the bib so it fit my daughter's neck properly.  While that worked, it defeated the purpose of having a bib she can't pull off (which she figured out).
