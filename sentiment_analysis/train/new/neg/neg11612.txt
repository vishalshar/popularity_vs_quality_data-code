These pads are a complete waste of money. I started using Lansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-pack which are awesome! But I was hoping that these would work because they are a little cheaper. They might work for you if you have extremely light or practically non-existent leakage. But even in that case, the absorbent material used in this product performs like a thin circular cotton ball -- it doesn't draw the moisture away from your skin, which was extremely irritating to my skin and made me feel edgy and damp all the time.So here are the cons of this product:-There is no waterproof backing on these pads (which is good for preventing thrush) but is BAD for holding leaks. My shirt and bra would end up damp anyway.-The absorbent material does not draw moisture away from skin. My skin would end up wet and damp and hot. Very uncomfortable.-I had to change these pads constantly if I wanted to feel dry and comfortable--thus removing the whole purpose of replacing a wonderful product -Lansinoh pads- with a terrible but cheaper product.-The mesh material that covered the absorbent material is irritating to my skin and would stick to the skin when I removed the pad. The mesh material also allowed fibers through that would stick all over my skin which would then end up rubbing off on my baby's face.-These pads are small but puffy, which would often show up in silhouette if wearing even a slightly fitted shirt.-
