Cute color, soft, and nice snaps. The problem I see is that I want them to protect my Beco so it doesn't get wet with baby's drool. Since it's just cotton velour, the saliva goes straight through it so the straps end up getting all wet after 20 minutes of baby chewing on this. If they had a PUL layer in between (or some other waterproof fabric), they would be perfect!
