While I like the look of this bottle bag, it leaves much to be desired in the area of cooling bottles.  The product says that it cools for up to 13 hours but I was out for about 6 hours and the ice packs had melted and my expressed bottles were very warm.***Updated to add that in less than a month the strap has now broken, This purchase was a complete waste of money!
