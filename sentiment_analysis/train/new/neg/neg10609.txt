I got these to protect my 13 month old daughter from the corners of a glass desk. The top of her head almost reaches the height of the table so it was important that the covers protect her from below as well but these have a very sharp point that is almost as bad as the corner of the table itself. She also was able to pull it off in about 2 seconds.
