My goal was bulk, but I didn't realize how often I wanted this for small batches!- Consider the first few months when babies are trying new foods.  They try a bite and then refuse the rest.- Even infants that are good eaters only eat half a cup of food per week the first few weeks.- Foods that may cause reactions are generally tried in small batches.- Some foods for crawlers can't be frozen.This mill wastes two tablespoons of food; the interior cylinder/plunger is 1/4" too short.  My friend's mill (same style, different brand) wastes way less (maybe a teaspoon tops).  If the food has breast milk or formula, I end up pitching the fourth that the mill can't reach.  It's frustrating!Also, the notches for the metal strainer aren't big enough.  As someone else said, "the metal part won't twist into the slot without a lot of effort."
