I'm using this with a Medela Pump In Style Advanced pump. I seem to get more milk and more efficient suction, but I'm crossing brands and I'm not sure its enough to worry about carrying the extra part around. Here are the pros/consPros-more comfortable for someone with short nipples instead of downsizing to smaller hard plastic flange-get roughly 1/4 oz more per side with each pumping sessionCons-only fits the Medela 24mm one piece breast shield (doesn't work when the shield is separate from the connector)-one more piece to clean after each pumping session-harder to line up your nipple in the middle if using with a pumping bra-sometimes i need to up the suction pressure which negate the added comfort of the soft silicone
