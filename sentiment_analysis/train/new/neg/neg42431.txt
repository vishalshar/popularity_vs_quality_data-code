...and I guess that's all that really matters. If you're interested in buying this take into consideration that it's a wind-up and doesn't work for very long before you have to rewind. Also, it doesn't attach to our crib very securely. The attachment mechanism is cheap plastic, wobbles a little when it's attached and comes loose easily. On the upside, it's pretty adorable.
