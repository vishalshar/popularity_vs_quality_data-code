I ordered two of these and although I like the colors and they were pretty inexpensive, I was not impressed with the overall quality. The pink valance was totally a different color pink than the comforter, so I had to buy another curtain to match. I bought two of the same sets to go into my twin grandbabies room and the two sets did not match.
