This changing table is very sturdy and was very easy to put together.  We have used it for over a month now and will seem to hold up for a long time.  Be mindful that the height listed is not the height at which you would be changing diapers but rather the height of the back of the changing table.  I am giving 3 stars due to the height and changing pad included.  This could be a few inches taller.  I am 5'4" and I believe the height for changing diapers is a little low.  It is comparable to the height of a changing pad on a pack and play.  Changing pad included is very thin.  I am using a different changing pad but kept the one included and placed it underneath to provide slightly more height.
