I never used the play mat since I got this when my son turned 4 months so no opinion on that.The bouncer was good except that as soon as I got it it needed to be set to the highest setting...my baby is tall, but he still fits on the middle setting on another brand's bouncer.  I let him use it while flat footed which I know I shouldn't but otherwise I wouldn't have gotten any use out of it.  He really enjoyed the toys on it.Now that my son is 7 months, crawling, pulling up, cruising, and crawling out of things we tried turning it into an activity table and found that it takes almost 5 seconds for him to pull it down.  Rather than risk him breaking it, it is being put away for the next in line.
