I like this product a lot. It doesn't budge and I haven't slipped in the shower since I put it down.  It was fairly easy to apply and is not an eyesore in my pretty bathroom, although it would be nice if it came in more colors.  I was concerned at purchase because I don't have beige in my bathroom, but my worries disappeared when I laid it down to test it.  It looks just fine.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. It is quite expensive. It IS a good product so I can understand charging a little more than they do for inferior products, but I do think the price is a bit much. That being said, if the product LASTS long enough to make it really worth it, I WOULD purchase again when the time comes. We shall see.  I will try to remember to update and let you all know how that goes.Update: I DID give this product 4 stars, however I am taking 3 of those stars back. I waited quite some time for my order to arrive and I paid $55.00 for it.  For that price I most certainly expected the product to last more than 2.5 months.  It is no longer adhered to the tub and has completely mildewed underneath.  It's disgusting.  I would have been better off going to Target and spending $20 on a regular mat. I severely over paid for what is apparently a low quality item.  Quite disappointing. I definitely would not purchase again.2nd Update: I brought my review back up to 3 stars and I will tell you why. They say you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar. Well I served this company up a whole mouthful of vinegar and the customer service was great anyway. They sent me another mat right away with additional tips on how to help make it stick better.  I will update, yet again, in the future and let you know if I have better results this time around. Hope this isn't too confusing... I just figure if I am going to write a review someone is basing a decision off of, it should be as accurate and complete as possible.
