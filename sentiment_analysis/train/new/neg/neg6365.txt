*******************************************************UPDATE: Munchkin finally contacted me and replaced my cracked straw cup lids. The rep said that the reason it took so long was that the company had been overwhelmed with customer Service complaints due to the Mattel recalls (lead paint toys).The new lids have not cracked and work great. Thanks Munchkin! (p.s. hire temps to cover your customer service overflow!)*******************************************************These cups are made poorly and will crack. They will crack at the same spot so you know it's a design flaw. I have three and two of them have cracked at the exact same spot on the lid, near the threading.Munchkin Customer service has ignored me. I asked them to replace my two flawed, damaged cups and got NO RESPONSE. It's such a disapointment for me that they company cares so little for it's customers that they don't even acknowledge my concerns.These cups used to be my favorite, unfortunatly when I had a problem, I was treated like garbage by Munchkin's "Customer Service" (an oxymoron). There is no customer service, they just ignore you until you quit trying to contact them.
