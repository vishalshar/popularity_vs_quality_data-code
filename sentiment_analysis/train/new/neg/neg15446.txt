I just took this "lambskin" to a professional cleaners and was informed it is NOT lambskin. It is some kind of synthetic carpeting material -- that is the cleaner's best guess. I should have realized -- this product DOES feel like carpet. It is too late for me to return it. I hate getting ripped off like this.
