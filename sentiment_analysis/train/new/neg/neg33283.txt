This food mill had the best reviews out of all of the ones I was considering. It's just okay.  It takes a lot of work to grind up things that aren't complete mush. Although my biggest complaint is that it's difficult to wrangle while grinding - almost as if it's too small to get a firm grip on the base and on the tiny handle (and I'm not a big person).  Also if you have especially juicy things the juice leaks out of the bottom. The food 'patty' that others have described is annoying, but I would just end up eating it while preparing my daughter's food. I really couldn't see using this in a restaurant - it just seems so impractical given how hard you have work, how much food you have to put in it to get enough out to feed baby and the leak factor. Knowing that I would have spent the extra money on a food mill that you can attach to the table.
