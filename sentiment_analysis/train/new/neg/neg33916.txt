Bought this product at the same time I bought the Learning Resource's Time Tracker (as seen on Supernanny). The combination has all but eliminated my 2 1/2 year old's need for a time out. He knows that we can now do a Time Out anytime, anywhere and his behavior has improved ten-fold. It's been extraordinary...And while I cannot attribute his behavior change specifically to either the Time Tracker or the Time Out Mat, I do endorse their combined functionality. They work. They may even work separately, but I doubt it. The Time Out Mat simply provides my son a visible reminder of what awaits him should he misbehave or use a toy inappropriately. And he does anything to avoid it, yet he's cooperative when he has done something unacceptable and readily goes and sits in the circle until "time's up!"This product is a good alternative to an expensive Time Out Chair. Still, it's overpriced for what it is -- a rubber mat. You could probably use masking tape on your carpet and achieve the same results...
