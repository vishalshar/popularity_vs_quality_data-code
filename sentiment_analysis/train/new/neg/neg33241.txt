Baby can not straighten his/her legs and my newborn was too big from birth at 19.5 inches. The insert would work better without the bump too. The bit where they can sit up and recline means only babies tushie in the water so they wt cold and hate it. Do not buy! I read the reviews and still did and regret it as now have to by another one
