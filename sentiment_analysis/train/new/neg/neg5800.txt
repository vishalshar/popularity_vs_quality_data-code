The quality seems high and the fabrics are very soft. I gave it 4 instead of five stars because the "blue" blanket has a 2x2 patchwork pattern (a total of 4 large rectangles), rather than the 4x3 pattern shown in the other pictures. I probably wouldn't have ordered it had I known this, since I specifically chose this blanket because I liked the 4x3 style shown in the pictures. It's still a nice, very cute blanket, so I will be keeping it...just slightly disappointed about the design.UPDATE 10/22/2013 (went form 4 to 1 star): All right, I have to take back what I said about the quality. There are two spots where the seams are coming apart - one seam has opened more than two inches. I'm afraid to wash the blanket now, and I'm really hoping this item doesn't turn into a "lovey", as I don't think it will last very long. I'm going to re-sew the seams, but I don't have confidence the rest of it will hold up.
