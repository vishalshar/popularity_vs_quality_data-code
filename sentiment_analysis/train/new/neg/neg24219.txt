Oh, I fell in love with the bag when it arrived! Perfect for my needs. My husband is severely handicapped and this is perfectfor my needs, and discrete, yet classic looking! However, after 5 days of use the zipper pull on the clutch broke off. It's made with plastic! It's the piece that holds the pull to the zipper drive. Tiny piece made to look like metal and it's plastic. So after less than a week I'm disappointed considering the cost! I plan to replace the bag this week. I hope the other zippers aren't made the same way on the rest of the bag.
