We were very optimistic about this being an "upgrade" from a Graco Glider we purchased over 23 years ago.  The older glider was still in great shape but no longer matched our bedroom furniture and we wanted the ottoman.Unfortunately, when this one arrived here's what we found:o The finish had several large bubbles in the stain and was very uneven in certain areas.o The brass colored bolts that hold the arms on show even with the side upolstrary attached to the snaps.o The contact points for the feet to the floor were very rough, like they had not seen a piece of sandpaper.o One arm was missing both snaps required to hold the arm cushions on.o The cushions barely qualify as cushions.  They were less than two inches thick at best.o The arm pads are thin, and look like cheap add-ons.On the positive side, it did sit nicely, with springs in the seat, and it seemed to rock well.  It also went together very quickly, which was nice since I disassembled it right away to send back.  The Ottoman and the base of the chair are fully assembled.  The chair needs only 8 bolts, 3 for each arm and 2 for the back.  It includes the needed allen wrench.If this chair was half this price, I would say its a good (but not excellent) buy (discounting the wrong arm shipping with it).  However, for this price, I'd rather spend more and get a truly high quality piece of furniture.
