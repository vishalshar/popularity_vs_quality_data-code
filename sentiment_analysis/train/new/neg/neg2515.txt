Was really excited about getting this washcloth/towel since it was suppose to be silk. This cloth is not silk, the first day of use I turned it into a cleaning rag.It's too painful to cleanse with this washcloth especially if you have high sensitivity skin. It's just not for me, not something I can recommend.
