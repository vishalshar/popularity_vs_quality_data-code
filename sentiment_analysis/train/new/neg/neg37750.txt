It does what it says and is easy to use, but I am returning it because it has a highly chemical smell to it (both f them do I bought two one was a warehouse deal the other was brand new). Also it is made I'm PVC. I guess I should have figured that out before buying it. I don't like the idea of that being what my child is laying on/drooling on possibly chewing on for 12+ hours a day. We are pretty natural around here and try to avoid VOCs and caustic plastics as much as Possible. Bottom line if you are into natural items/organic/green living at all you prob don't want your baby sleeping on this. If not then it is easy to use and as described.
