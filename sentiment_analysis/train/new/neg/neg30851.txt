I wanted these to live up to my expectations but unfortunately i have a couple issues with them.1. They don't come with anything to fasten to the garbage with so you have to either use doublesided tape which isn't great since the weight of the freshener tends to make them fall off, or you could use velcro but this seems a little excessive for something so inexpensive.2. They loose their freshening scent quite quickly.My recommendation is to just empty your garbage more :(
