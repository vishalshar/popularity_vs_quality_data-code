I loved the ease of removing frozen food cubes from the silicone tray and the ease of cleaning it afterwards, but unfortunately after its second use (a week in the freezer) the tray had a terrible smell. The lid, made of a plastic material, did not smell at all. I am not sure whether silicone absorbs the smells from other food items in the freezer or whether the smell is emanating from the tray itself, but I have had this happened to silicone teethers as well. Regardless, I would not dare put my baby's food in this tray again. It will be returned to the manufacturer.
