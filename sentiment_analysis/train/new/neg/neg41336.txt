The jogger was previously used and taken to the beach since a number of the joints had sand.  Even though it was reduced to reflect the return because i got it from the Amazon Warehouse, I would have expected that it was inspected and cleaned.  I am not sure if there is damage to the folding mechanism based ont he sand.  It's too early to tell.  I do like the stroller although the velcro opening for the shade are very disruptive if you are trying to check on your infant when they are trying to sleep.  It wakes my girl up all the time.. The storage under the stroller is small.  The break on the right side doesn't appear to really stop the whole stroller it only stops one side and the stroller starts turning.  I haven't figured out if that's a defect or just how it's supposed to work.  I do like it and the color is nice if you want to be gender neutral.  We have gotten compliments on the color.
