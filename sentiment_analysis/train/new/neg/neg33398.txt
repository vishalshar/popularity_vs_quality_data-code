Design flaws and manufacturing process issues make me rate this product with 2 stars only. Let's start with the design flaws:1. The board on which your child will be standing can flip up on the one side if your child to steps on the far opposite edge. This is due to the height adjustment fixture which allows to create a leverage-effect if your child's feet apply enough pressure for the board to flip (guess who was tip-toeing and managed to achieve that within 10 minutes of use...). Our little one (thankfully) managed to adjust balance quickly enough not to slide into the gap between standing board and frame.2. To stabilize the step stool its foot extends sideways in every direction. Since those extensions don't go all the way up to the top of the chair your brain assumes a smaller footprint and we find ourselves continuously tripping over these edges (which can be painful). Feel free to call us stupid, since our brain can't manage to get used to this tripping hazard or make us feel better by confirming this experience :-)3. Our painted version (green) apparently had been boxed by the manufacturer when the paint hadn't dried completely yet. One could still smell the fresh paint (so had to let it air out) and more annoyingly the individual parts were "glued" together by the wet paint, which resulted in paint being torn off (see attached pictures), when having to forcefully separate parts.Our little one loves to "help" in the kitchen so much now, that I'll keep it, but I would buy a different product if I had to chose again..
