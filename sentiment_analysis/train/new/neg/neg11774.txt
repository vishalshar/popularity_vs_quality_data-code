I was quite happy to find extras, because we have purchased the panels previously, but mysteriously lost the connectors over the years.They sort of work. Some broke off during the assembly itself. They are really quite brittle and not too flexible.After a couple of months, the assembled shelf collapsed. I noticed that some more of the connectors broke during the process.Next time I will probably just buy again the whole shelf, in Target, Sears, or so. I really tried to reuse the old panels, but these connectors are not helpful.
