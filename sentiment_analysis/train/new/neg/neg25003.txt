I have used this backpack nearly daily for my now-8 week old baby, every time we leave the house. On the plus side, it is the perfect size for what I need to carry along with us, and my 9-year old son is able to wear it without any complaint. On the major minus side, I was closing one of the side zippers yesterday and the zipper pull and zipper head part came right off in my hand as it was closing. It is now broken beyond repair (short of replacing the entire zipper) and my wallet was stuck inside!! Poor quality for this to happen in under 2 months.
