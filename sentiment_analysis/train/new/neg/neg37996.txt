I loved how trim these were. It's so hard to find cloth diapers that aren't huge-making an issue when trying to cram your sweet one into pants. So, very trim. As close to disposable trimness of any diaper I've tried. Here's the problem. The aplix/velcro is AWFUL. Very poor quality and barely stays closed after a few washes. They should really adjust the material as it is useless. I do not use this diaper (after only 5 washes). I have kept it in the car in case of "emergency" but would never trust it out and about.
