I am so disappointed! I'm the type of person to review and research an item before I purchase it. I was so happy to receive these drool bibs for my 5 month old and couldn't wait to get them on her. I was also excited that the drool bibs were smaller and not the size of a regular bib and wouldn't cover up her outfit. That happiness quickly turned to disappointment and dissatisfaction when I prewashed them. I followed all instructions. When I removed these from the dryer the bibs were torn and had pulled thread everywhere. They weren't even wearable! Gee when I order something I expect it to be quality. Not something that ends up being even cheaper than the 99 cent store (nothing against 99 cent store, I get a lot of stuff there but not when I'm looking for quality). Don't even bother wasting your time in ordering this.  If there was a possibility of giving this a 0 star I would have rated that way.
