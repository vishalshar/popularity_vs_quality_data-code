I purchased this after moving to Germany with a 2 month old, 4 year old, and 8 year old.  With the amount of walking we do I needed a stroller for my 4 year old to ride on when she gets tired.  This was one of the better options since most tandem strollers are very awkward to stear with heavier children.  My daughter can't ride in this when I have to lift the front of the stroller to get up on the curb.  The stroller needs some tape over some of the frame next to where my daughter hops on.  The ends of the frame scratched her a few times.  Also the stroller is very hard to get in and out of the van.  It is quite long when it collapses.  The wheels aren't going to survive the cobblestone streets here very long.  The seat also slides back and forth and has to be pulled out several times when my daughter gets in and out.  This stroller may be better with a few modifications.  I am able to use it but wish there was something better.
