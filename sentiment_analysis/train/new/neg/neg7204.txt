I don't love this stroller, the tires go flat quite a bit and it takes 2 hands and some oomph to get it closed (and for it to be flat you have to recline the seat completely, which also takes 2 hands). The storage compartment isn't huge and it sags low, not the worst stroller but not the easiest to work. That said, the kid tray with 2 cup holders is nice, the sun shade is totally adjustable and it can fit in the trunk of my Honda when flat.
