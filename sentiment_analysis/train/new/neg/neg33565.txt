reviews stated it gets our cloth diapers really white like brand new and stops the stink issue i followed directions and striped all the diapers in there detrergent. i still got stinkies so back to good ol vinegar. This soap is low to no suds though and it is ok and a great price and with the vinegar i notice no smell at all. so its a toss up i also have well water though so lots minerals and lime and such.
