Both utensils have a weird angle to them that makes them hard to use.  But more importantly, the business end of each utensil is just plain worthless.  The tines of the fork are too dull and fat to skewer any food, and they're too far apart scoop any food.  The spoon is too shallow and the odd angle makes it hard to keep anything in it.  As an adult with great fine-motor skills, I have a hard time getting anything from the plate to my mouth with these.  For a baby, it's hopeless.
