This whole experience has made me very frustrated.First complaint: This is no where close to newborn. My kid was born with a >99% head size and I'll be lucky if he fits this when he is a year old. Gigantic is an understatement. We'll be using this for toddler photoshoots a few years down the road.Second Complaint: This took a month and a half to get to my house. Why so long? It is literally shipping from China. Frustrated that it's taking so long want to cancel? Forget it, because it's been shipped - it just probably sitting on some freight ship or stuck in customs somewhere.  Also trying to return this is near impossible.
