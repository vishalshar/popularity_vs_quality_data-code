I ordered this necklace along with two others from different brands, one very similar in style and color, one like a set of pearls. This is by far my favorite and I returned the others. The coral color is very true to the picture - just slightly more pink than orange, which is what I had hoped. The construction and soft feel are good, it's held up well to my teething son and he loves it, but as many others have said, it is hazardous to your hair! My hair is shoulder length, so it doesn't really get caught in it just walking around, but I have to carefully put it over my head when taking on and off. And if my son falls asleep on my shoulder or is getting sleepy and rubbing his head against me, I loop it over my back so he can't get his hair caught (which he has - and the sharp tug and scream negated all the falling asleep). All in all, not the best design because of the hair pulling silicone, but visually attractive and just what I needed to pull my outfits together for a few dressier occasions that also required a happy, teething baby on hip. I'd give it two stars for actual function (I assume a smooth cord with a single pendant teether is more comfortable) but four for looks as far as being colorful and trendy and soft silicone.
