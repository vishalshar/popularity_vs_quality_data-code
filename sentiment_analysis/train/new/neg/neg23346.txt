NOT A NATUREPEDIC PRODUCT! I purchased a product that was listed as a "Naturepedic ... topper."  I received a "lullaby earth" topper. Looks like I'm not the only person to receive this based on the Q&A. An unscrupulous seller and false advertising. This thing smells and feels cheap - scratchy, polyester foam. I have multiple Naturepedic brand products, including mattress pads and mattresses and changing pads and other items, and none has ever had a smell or this low quality "feel."PS. Im not interested in hearing that "Naturepedic makes Lullaby Earth", by the way. The same company may sell products under these two brand names, but if that's the case, it's pretty clear Lullaby Earth is the lower end line, and in any case I relied on the Naturepedic name when I made my purchase. Selling this product under the Naturepedic name is clearly deceptive. I will be expecting a full refund.
