This is not a bad review just an informative one. The picture on the left is the BT GLX series and the right picture is the universal BT base.  The box says compatible with ALL Baby Trend car seats. Not the case.  Apparently the Baby Trend Expedition GLX (what we have) is the "secure" type base, which we didn't know, and is not compatible.  I give it 3 stars because I like the brand, but needs to be more informative on what works with each other.
