We have used the babybjorn potty for two children now and THOUGHT it was a great potty....that is until we purchased the $5 toilet from IKEA and the design flaw in the babybjorn became obvious. The main difference between the two potties is that thebabybjorn potty has a full seat extending 360 degrees around the toilet (with the exception of the splash guard) but the IKEA potty omits the seat area at the rear for a sloped wide spout for dumping the waste in the toilet. I have found this to be much more convenient.  When the babybjorn is filled with...well #2 let's say, you have to do a quick twist of the wrist to drop the #2 into the toilet. This action typically results in a splatter effect and almost always leaves something delightful on the seat requiring additional cleanup. With the wide spout on the back of the IKEA toilet, dumping is much cleaner and easier. Since my child doesn't touch or sit on this area I don't feel the need to clean it when simply pouring out urine, which is not the case for the babybjorn. At IKEA the potty is around $5 but i would pay the same price (or more) for the IKEA potty ad I would for the babybjorn.
