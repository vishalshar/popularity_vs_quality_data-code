I heard a lot of good reviews about this brand and love the pacifiers, but the bottles just aren't that great.  The opening of the bottle is wide--great for pouring formula in--but it makes it really hard to feed.  In order to get the last oz. in the bottle, you practically have to suffocate your baby because the nipple is in the center of this wide-mouthed bottle.  So in order for fluid to get to the nipple, you have to tilt the bottle 90 degrees over the mouth of your baby.  The result of this problem led to a lot of gas.  This bottle might not be so bad if they made the the mouth of the bottle narrower or moved the the nipple away from center.
