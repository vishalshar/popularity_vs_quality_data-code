As a simple chair, this seat is cute and comfy and has been very handy, but there have been some definite drawbacks when it comes to the bells and whistles. For one, the vibration setting sometimes causes the entire battery box to rumble loudly, though I've found that as my little one has gotten older and heavier that she dampens the vibrations and this hasn't been as much of an issue. You also can't really use the vibrate setting when the toy bar is attached because it causes the entire bar to rattle like a jackhammer. This hasn't been a huge problem, though, as my daughter has had little interest in the toy bar. She would watch it for a little while when she was smaller, but it's not nearly as interactive as the description would lead one to believe. At four months, my daughter has pretty much outgrown the seat except for the occasional nap (She gets bored quickly and strains to sit up in it unless she's tired.), and she still can't reach that darn whale. She's by no means a small kid (70th percentile for height at her last doctor visit), but by the time she'll be able to reach that whale she'll have outgrown the seat completely. I wish I had gotten a seat with some lower hanging toys, or better yet with some attachment points so I could hang some of her favorite toys. I've taken to clipping toys to the springs that support the penguin and turtle, which sort of works but is hardly ideal. I bought this seat based on all the glowing reviews, and I have used it a good deal as a chair, but overall I'd say that it's been a little disappointing.
