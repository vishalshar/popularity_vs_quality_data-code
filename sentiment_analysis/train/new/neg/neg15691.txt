I've bought two of these in a row here is my brief synopsis of this product.I originally bought this as a Christmas gift for my 1 year old daughter, upon inserting batteries into it and testing it out following the directions the bubble maker churned to life for all of 3 seconds. At that point the orange bubble wheel stopped moving and the electric motor began to produce a high pitched whine. This was indicative of a gear failure within the device i.e. gear sheared, or gear slip.Upon dismantling this product I found what was a electric engine that is overrated for this subtle moving wheel. The gearbox is constructed of cheap plastic gears of which a total of 9 gears are used to step down the torque of this engine. Instead of using a stepper motor or a more appropriate motor, or even a better constructed gear box the manufacture went the cheap route and it shows.The same can be said about the second bubble maker I purchased, same symptoms, same results, same issues.In conclusion I would suggest you look for a better quality bubble maker other than this, if your ok with the possibility of yours working or not working then go for it, enjoy your headache.44/99 1 star ratings IS A BOLD STATEMENT to this item's quality,
