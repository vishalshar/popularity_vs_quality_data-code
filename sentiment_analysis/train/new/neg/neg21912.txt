I have to say that I usually am a big advocate for Britax seats. This would be our 3rd one for our daughter. However I received 2 of these so far and both had damage to the plastic safe cells. The first was cracked and broken in several spots as well as strained in others to the point that the plastic was white. The second seat was better, but still had one side that the plastic shows white strain marks. I called Britax and they said it was cosmetic, but darker grey plastic doesn't turn white unless it's been strained in some way. I liked the other functions of the seat, but am worried that these plastic pieces will stand up to the test of time, and the seat being moved from vehicle to vehicle and taken on trips. I'm returning the 2nd seat as well and will pick a different option.
