I was excited when I first saw these advertised, as they sounded and looked like the perfect bottle for my breastfeeding baby. However, the blunt nipple is not as conducive to breast/bottle transition as it appears. My baby will take it, but not readily, and he's obviously not thrilled with it when he does. He has a very DEFINITE "What the--???" expression on his face the whole time and chews on the nipple intermittently while feeding. It also flows much faster than expected. I've had much better luck with the cheapest angled bottles using slow-flow nipples. I started my little guy on these at 4 weeks, preparing for the daycare transition. Hopefully he'll accept them better at an older age so I won't feel like they were a total waste. My local BabiesRUs store didn't carry the Second Nature bottles, so my cousin brought me a gift set from the Orlando store. If it weren't for her searching these out especially for me because I wanted to try them so badly, I probably would've returned them.
