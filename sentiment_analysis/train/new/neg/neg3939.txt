I bought this as a visual for a design project I had to do in college. We put this through a pretty good amount of testing (like dropping it off a four story building to test the endurance on the design). We were working with nothing inside the bowl, since our final design, which we had 3D printed, had our device instead of the bowl. I can't tell you though:Pros-The bowl is pretty well made. Your toddler could probably throw it a wall all day and not hurt it-The Lid lid fits securelyCons-If you had anything in the bowl and were swinging it around, it will come out-If you hit it at the right angle, the lid will pop offIn conclusion, this is pretty toddler proof and would be great for them eating in the car, movie theater, etc, but any movement like swinging it around while walking will inevitably cause the food to fly out.
