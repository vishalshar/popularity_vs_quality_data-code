The Graco Bumper Jumper works well, as it clamps firmly above solidly built door casings. This is a good piece of exercise equipment for a baby who hasn't yet learned to walk. I sought this out for our new grandson, as I remembered how well it worked for our own children. Personal opinion - train that cerebellum early and often.
