I have a Maclaren twin techno and before my children were born, I travelled a lot.  I was committed to bringing my babies with me as often as I could when I travelled and was looking out for travel paraphernalia that would ease the hassels of travelling with twins.  Hence, I came to this product, and though it was more than twice as much as the others, it was the only one that had wheels, and the only one specifically made for the maclaren strollers which has always been known to produce quality products.  The first one came already ripped at the seams.  I didn't think much of this as it was not tested on any of my flights, I didn't think it was a product failing.  I had it returned for free and exchanged for another one which I used one time for my travel to Israel from Los Angeles.  The bag ripped even before our arrival to Israel as I used it to protect my twin techno which was gate checked.  The bag was not useable after that first and only flight.  Unfortunately, I was so busy with my twins that the 90 days had passed since I had the second bag and Amazon would not take it back without me having to have it shipped myself, which, again I couldn't do for lack of time.  But had the bag withstood it's maiden voyage, I woulnd't be dealing with the issue of returning a defective product.  Long story short, it's a cheap product that costs too much.  Stay away.
