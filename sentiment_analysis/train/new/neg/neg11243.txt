The hat was too small for our baby (which was a 9 pounds baby at birth) but it was a well-made hat and it was just like the picture, beautiful.  I do understand that babies in your country are smaller than in America and other countries so I would advise you to enlarge your pattern so that it will accommodate larger babies.  The hat was everything I expected and I loved it but it was just too small for our baby.
