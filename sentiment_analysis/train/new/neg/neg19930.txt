I was hoping that I would receive the product pictured but as others have stated it was a lower model. I did however keep it since it was almost half of the cost that the regular model usually sells for. It does extend the stroller shade quite bit even on my big Graco stroller. Very easy to install....just tie a few straps and you are good to go!
