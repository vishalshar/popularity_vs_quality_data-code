I returned this item after taking it out to use for just 1 time.  I know this is a no frills umbrella double stroller, and can't be compared to my Baby Jogger City Select Double, but I still expected more.  I got this in preparation for my trip to NYC.  The colors are beautiful and vibrant, and the tandem seats were was I wanted.  It is heavier than it looks.Before heading out on the trip, I took it to use at a local park to test.  The seat is so shallow....my 30 pound two year old barely fits, and could only fit in the front seat.  He was close to sliding off.  We put the baby in the back, and there just wasn't enough support for him.  Forget my 4 year old, there was no possible way he would fit in either seat.  I am 5'9", so the handles were at a good height for me, which I liked.  However, I kept kicking the bottom of the stroller with each stride.  The worst thing was trying to break it down to put back in the trunk.  Oh my god...I was wrestling with the stupid stroller.  The joints are super stiff, and the thing was a nightmare to fold!  It literally took me 5 minutes, and it injured my finger when it finally gave way.  What a waste of my time and energy!
