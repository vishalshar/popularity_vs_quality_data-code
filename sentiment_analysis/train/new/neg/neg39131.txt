I thought the whole screen would be backlit like a real tablet, but instead only one small circle icon in the upper left lights up.  The rubber buttons with stickers on top are just not what I expected.  At $29.99, it seemed overpriced for the limited number of functions that this toy has.  My main problem is with the picture on the website, which in my opinion is misleading.
