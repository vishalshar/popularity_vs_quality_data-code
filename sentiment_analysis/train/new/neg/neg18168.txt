Arrived damaged. It has a black magic marker like smear under the nose. The nose is hard to get to make any sound and there are two hard things in the paw and foot of the toy, that i figure were supposed to make some sort of noise. No noise. It was also supposed to squeak. Again it doesn't make a sound! It is also quite a bit larger than I had envisioned. Requested a refund and received one the very next day. Very Prompt delivery, and fast remedy. I would be pleased to deal with this vendor again in the future. Good company!
