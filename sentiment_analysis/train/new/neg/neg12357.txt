DO NOT USE!!!!! I stock piled these milk bags and they are horrible. I use about 5-6 bags a day and I have at least one bag a day leak. They leak from the middle of the bag, not like you would think it would leak at the seams. I can't return them because it has been too long since I bought them. If I could return them I would. I also have contacted them about the bags leaking, and they gave me the suggestion to put wax paper in between them when I freeze them. Well that is great and all except they leak before I get a chance to put them in the freezer. The only good products from tommee tippee are their bottles. I bought the double pump and it lasted 4 months of daily use. The battery on the pump was horrible and would not keep a charge. I called and they said they would send a new battery. Then the pump started acting up and would not change off the first level of pumping. I went and bought a Medela pump which is amazing, it has lasted 7 months with my first child and I'm going on 5 with my second. I would Not recommend this or any product from this company. The products themselves are not of any quality and the customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. If I could give this thing 0 stars I would!
