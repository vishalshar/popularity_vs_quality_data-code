They do say,"colors may vary."  Mine are bright pink.  I have a daughter.  I might have been upset if I had a son.I like the set though.  I bought them for a road trip.  I take the all over the place now.  They stay clean and separate from all the stuff in the diaper bag.  Yes, you could use a plastic bag for the same purpose.  So, so I need this set?  No.  Do I use this set? All the time.Just a note- my other toddler flatware fits in the container too.  Not at the same time, of course, but instead.  Thus, I don't have to worry about the right flatware being clean.The spoon is deep enough for cereal with milk.  I think the shape works well.  The fork- pretty mediocre.  It is hard to get forks right I guess, dull to be safe, but still useful.  This one is safe, but don't expect to poke anything (not even roast potato!  We tried!)They are cheap though, and I use them all the time, so it gets a few stars.
