My 3 year old is a bit of a houdini. We were hoping that this would help keep our sliding door a little more secure. We followed the directions and waited the suggested 48 hours. The first time my son tried to open the door the latch completely fell off the glass. It didn't seem like he even pulled the door very hard.
