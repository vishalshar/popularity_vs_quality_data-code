The quality of construction compares poorly with the Babyletto mini crib, but if you need the folding side feature as I do there are not many alternatives. On the positive side the crib is easy to assemble, but the one I got had two wooden dowels used to secure a side beam missing. The mattress, a one-inch thick piece of cheap foam is frankly useless. The plexiglass sides had visible scratches. I am being generous in giving this two stars, only because, as mentioned, there aren't many alternatives that have folding sides.
