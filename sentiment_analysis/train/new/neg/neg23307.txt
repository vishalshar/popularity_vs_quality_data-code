The functionality of the Dr. Brown's system can't be beat. They are truly terrific at preventing excess gas during feedings. Yes, they require a little more work in the bottle washing department, but well worth it when I have a happy baby with no gas pains. The bottle tops and internal parts work perfectly as designed and when screwed on tightly, do not leak like other brands (Avent). My only issue with these bottles is that these ones do not have flat bottoms and kind of tip-over. It's like the plastic was molded incorrectly and the bottom part comes out instead of going into the bottom of the bottle. The bottles are still functional, but I have to be extra careful not to spill when filling them and never use the defective ones when preparing nighttime feeds in low-lighting with my eyes still halfway shut. Not sure if these were the factory rejects? I purchased a single bottle from Babies R Us and it does not have the same isssue.
