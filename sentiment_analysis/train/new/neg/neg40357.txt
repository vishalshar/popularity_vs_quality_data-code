So disappointed.  I have the full Kiinde Twist Breastfeeding kit ($99) and love it.  The slow flow nipple that came with the kit is the perfect speed for my newborn.  I ordered this set of two more slow flow nipples and they barely work!  They clog frequently, they are so slow that the frustrate my baby, and they are a different design than the one in the kit (see photo - nipple from kit on left, nipple from Amazon on right).The nipples delivered from Amazon should be considered defective and not be sold.  Kiinde has obviously improved the nipple design and only those ones should be sold.  I even paid for rush delivery on these...total waste of money.  Shame on Amazon and Kiinde for continuing to sell a product that doesn't work.
