The background is not as white as shown in the picture.  Agree with previous reviewer, the liner color bleeds through and makes the pouch look dingy.  The handle strap does not have attachment ring on the other end of the bag.  I did not know there were 2 different models as far as the strap configuration options, the one I looked at the local store has two rings so you can wear the pouch as wrist bag or attach the strap end to the other side to make a small shoulder bag (the store did not carry this pattern).
