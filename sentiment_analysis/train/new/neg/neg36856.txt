We ordered this backpack for our 4-year old daughter to carry her lunch and thermos for preschool. It's far too large to work as an insulated lunch bag. It's a good size backpack if your child will be carrying some other items in it too, but then why would you need it to be insulated? I wouldn't want to add ice packs inside to keep lunch and drink cold and then also put other items (like a change of clothes or a stuffed animal) in the pack as well. The ice packs would drip on the other items as they melted. It made no sense, so we returned it. We ended up getting an insulated lunch box and a regular backpack instead.
