The butterflies were shipped promptly and received in record time. The condition is new and very beautiful. The only thing I can see a problem with is the size as the butterflies seem so small , much smaller than the picture. I bought them for my sisters baby shower as decoration and to later be used in the baby's room . Keep away from the little ones.
