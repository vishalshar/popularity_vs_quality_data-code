I guess this chair is fine if you're short and not overweight.  The fact is, I'm tall and overweight and the wood arms on this chair are way too low and dig into my thighs.  I should also mention the ottoman portion arrived with a broken piece.  I'm not impressed with the comfort/quality of this chair, especially considering it's not a bargain price or anything.  I don't recommend it - probably better to go to a physical store to try a chair and purchase there.
