I picked this inflatable spout cover over others because a friend had a similar one and it looked like the best protector - hers was always very full and much softer than the harder plastic versions. Compared to hers this one is okay- but definitely not the same. The two biggest problems are 1) I had a hard time inflating it (whether I tried to inflate it on or off of the spout). The air valve sticks out and it was difficult to get the air to stay in while putting the valve cover on. It doesn't hold much air so it is almost flat by the time I get the value closed. After a few tries it now has a decent amount of air but it is not "full". 2) Our faucet has a pull up for the shower and this does not have a hole for it to pass through. We only use that tub for the kids/guests so there is not a regular need to use the shower but if you only have one shower this could be a pain!I will keep the cover because it will serve its purpose and I don't feel like messing with a return but I would not purchase this one again. I would try another brand...
