After owning this product for 2 years, one of the short sides collapses if an adult or child puts any weight on it. The company tried to help me troubleshoot and was not helpful at all. Very disappointed. Spend the extra money to work with a better company that will gaurentee their products. Kids II was not a pleasant experience.
