First of all, it was impossible to figure out which way this thing was supposed to go on. Then it was really difficult to attach. It was a bad combination of stiff and fragile plastic. When I did use it, the plastic fogged up instantly and my kid could not see out and she flipped out. I deeded it was easier to just dress the kid in rain gear then mess with it.
