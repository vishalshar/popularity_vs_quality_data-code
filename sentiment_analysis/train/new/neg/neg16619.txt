I had high hopes for this stroller. After reading reviews on Amazon and other sites, I thought this would be a good stroller for me. I currently use the Bugaboo Frog but I needed a more compact stroller for our monthly trip to Disneyland. Easy to put together, all I needed to do was to snap the front wheels on and attach the cup holder. My 7 1/2 month old fit nicely inside. Everything was fine until I collapsed the stroller and the left latch came off! My husband tried to put it back together but was unable to. Of course we sent it right back the first day we received it. Beware of the latch!! It's too bad since I really like the look of this stroller and it folded nicely. I hope that this was only a problem on my stroller. I ended up getting a Maclaren Volo.
