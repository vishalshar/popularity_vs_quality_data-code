I really wish I would have been thinking about more than matching my decor when I bought this highchair.This highchair just does not work for us.First off, the holes for the foot rest were not fully drilled through, so my husband had to fix them and the screws fall out constantly (yes i probably should have sent it back).The seat is not adjustable AT ALL. It will probably fit my daughter better when she is an older toddler, but now as a tiny 1 year old all of the food she eats ends up right on her lap instead of the tray.It's nice that the seat comes out to clean, but honestly i would have to do this 3 x a day if i wanted to keep this chair clean because of all of the food that misses the tray. Also this means that a lot of food ends up under the padding which is gross, and in the wrinkles in the fabric which is also gross.The chair itself is pretty gigantic and takes up a lot of space..I have a large dining room but even then it takes up a ton of room. The legs are just so wide!The seat is very low and not adjustable which is a huge problem for us and something I just didn't think of, again because I was paying too much attention to how the seat looked more than how it functioned.
