these items are a great thought, but they are not well executed in design. The product will only stick for like a day or two then starts to fall off. The way we got them to stay in place was by putting a screw through them. We had bought these because our cats kept opening the closet doors and it was the only way to keep them from getting into the closets. Fortunately in our new place we don't have sliding closet doors anymore so we we were able to throw these things out. Not worth the money I paid for them.
