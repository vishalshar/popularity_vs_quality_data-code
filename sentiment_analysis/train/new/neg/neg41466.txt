This pink carrier is EASY to use (and I hate directions).  No problem putting it on without reading instructions.Great for skinny moms like me, but I would not recommend for larger women, I don't think there is enough slack to ensure SAFE carrying.The color is great: you cannot get asked: "is that a boy?" -Clearly a girl's item (you would think).I gave this three stars because it needs more HEAD SUPPORT.  The material seems to stretch and is not sturdy enough to let your infant just 'hang' in there without securing head with your hand.But-it is EASY to understand and there aren't 12 buckles and 14 ways to put on like moby wrap which I HATE.Get this if you like simple-because it is.My baby is 10 lbs.
