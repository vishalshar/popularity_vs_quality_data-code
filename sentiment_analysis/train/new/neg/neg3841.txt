Very unhappy with this order.  The chair pictured w/the blue and yellowish stripes is NOT the one I received.  My pad is green, red and yellow striped.  I specifically ordered it because I liked the pattern on the cushion so much for my baby boy.  DOUBLY unhappy because I needed this chair in time for a weekend vacation with the baby.  The chair will be travelling with us.  So I paid for 2 day shipping because I thought I would be in love with it and it's not at all what I wanted.  The chair will still do its job but its so aggravating when the picture shown is NOT what the product looks like!  I will be contacting the seller and seeing what they can do for me.
