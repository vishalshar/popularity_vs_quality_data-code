I ordered this because of the reviewsand it IS adorable. Shipping was quick and it was easy to put together. But I can't recommend it. Its flimsy, for one thing. My daughter has also gotten big enough so she can sit up which is great but when i had her in it she sat up and forward and it FLIPPED over with her in it. Twice!!  Luckily I was right next to her so could react quickly. But seriously! The whole thing just flipped right forward with her locked in the seat. She was face down on the floor with this contraction on top of her. I thought maybe it was just a fluke the first time sonput her in it again and watched it happen again. So that's that. Cant use it and wont give it to any of my pregnant friends and certainly cant recommend it.
