These little shoes are very cute, and I had high hopes for them. The problem is that the elastic is so tight I can't get my son's feet into the shoes. At first I thought they were too small, but eventually my husband was able to get them on our son's feet after much pulling and twisting on the elastic for a good 30 minutes: the shoe itself fits him just fine. (We bought size 12-18 months, and our son is currently 15 months.) I tried again this morning in vain to get the shoes on him; the elastic makes it impossible for me. Maybe the elastic will stretch out over time, I suppose, but in the meantime only my husband can get them on him. Not terribly pleased with this purchase.
