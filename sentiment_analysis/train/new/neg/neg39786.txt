Note that the product description for this item calls it a playmat -- NOT a changing pad. It isn't waterproof! My husband and I couldn't figure out how our newborn kept getting pee on the crib sheet below it, and today I noticed that the pee stains were in the same pattern as the seams. It is going straight through the mat! Ordered something different today -- what a waste of money.
