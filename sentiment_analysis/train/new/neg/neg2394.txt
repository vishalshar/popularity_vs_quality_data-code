I purchased these because I left my amazing baby bjorn bib at an out of town relatives. For my 10 mos old, these bibs pop off more easily, are more flimsy/ warp a little bit in the dish washer but are cheaper.I received the bjorn bibs as a hand me down and I can say have truly stood the test of time, not sure how these will hold up. The designs are similar so very good at catching things and now my infant knows to "check your baby trap" for food that missed his mouth.Bottom line: these will be God sent if you're using any other style of bib but consider bucking up for the Bjorns if you want something to go the distance
