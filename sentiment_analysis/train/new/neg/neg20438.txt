They are a great alternative to the expensive pre-printed labels but on some of the sippy cups I have to use tape to keep them on the cup. It seems to stay on certain cups like Gerber's but the large NUK's I guess are a different plastic and they come off very easily to the point where I had put the cups in the bag and when I arrived at day care, I had to fish around the diaper bag looking for them because they popped off already. My intention was to have something on bottle that I could remove easily but when I have to tape them onto the cup it becomes more work than I wanted. I might as well handwrite her name on the cup itself at that point. They did last through multiple washes in the dishwasher on the Gerber cups though and I was very surprised about that. It just depends on the material of the cup you're using.
