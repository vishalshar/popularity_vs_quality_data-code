I like this item as a shopping cart strap.  9 times out of 10 the straps that come on a cart are broken, and even when they aren't they are so flimsy that they don't really serve a purpose.  This strap is nice and cushiony and keeps my child secure in carts.  It also keeps him from being able to lean forward and chew on the shopping cart handle (I am not a germaphobe, but ewwwww!).  However, I have tried--on multiple occasions--to use it on a regular chair for a makeshift highchair and it just doesn't work.  My child inevitably slides down and does not sit upright in the chair no matter how snug I fit the strap (and of course I don't want to tighten it too much).  To give you a better frame of reference, he is almost 16 months old (walking proficiently) and I tried it recently on a regular chair...and it was no good.So, as a shopping cart enhancement:  yes.  As a safety strap on a regular chair:  no.  Would I recommend it?  Yes.  It's inexpensive, fits in your diaper bag or purse, and is useful in stores.
