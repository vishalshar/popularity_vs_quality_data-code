this bedrail was very easy to get together, maybe 10 mins total [read directions, set out parts, etc...] but only 5 mins to actually put it together.  and once you do it once, it's much quicker the second time.i really liked the design.  sturdy, simple, folds down.  tall enough for a deep mattresses but not for pillowtops [tried it on different beds].  seems like the frame would last.however, the material part will not.  the white material and mesh is very cheap.  the one i bought had to be returned because it was sewn incorrectly which resulted in part of the mesh not being attached to the vinyl[?] material.  the mesh itself is not like you'd find on current pack and plays, it's much cheaper and seems like it would rip or tear if anything pushed or got caught on it.  the white material itself is thin, and seriously why white?  don't they know it's for kids?  ecru, off-white, something other than white which is bound to get dingy.overall, i am going to eventually purchase another one because it's better than the others out there.  but, i'm hoping we won't have any problems down the road with wear and tear.  don't know if it'll last, although for the price i'm guessing that's what you get.good, not great
