While beautiful, this bag is not functional. With a newborn, I needed easy access to the inside, but the way the top is structured, it doesn't open up very wide at all, making digging around in the bag to find things nearly impossible. So I ended up having to remove a bunch of items from the bag, just to find what I was looking for. Now with a toddler AND a newborn, that is an even bigger issue. I need to be able to just reach in and grab what I need and see everything that's in there in one quick glance. I returned this almost immediately, after just a couple days, and got a bag that opens up much wider and is much more functional.
