So this stroller is the best of both worlds!It is great when running, turning and all the functions you want/need when jogging or walking. I love doing one handed turns.Con's, I hate the way the seat reclines...Whose idea was it to have a pull string to make it recline? that's so old school. it is nearly impossible to lift my 8 month old 25 lb son seat when he is in it.The roof could be a bit longer as well.The major thing i hate is the way it folds. I hate that it is a two handed fold!I am a single mom. I have to literally put my son on the dirty ground just to use both hands and close it. Also once it is folder the handle bars touch the ground! YUCK! and if the handle bares aren't touching the ground..the tray is! yuck again!. I end up putting it on it's side most of the time. But I haven't had it for a month and the tray and handle bar are already scratched up. =(.It does look really nice though.
