As a pediatric audiologist, I'm very concerned about the loudness of my daughter's toys.  Babys' little arms are not very long, so all of a baby's toys are near his or her ears when played with.  Sometimes, I think I go a bit overboard, but when I was putting batteries in this thing and my husband yelled, "Holy c*@p that's loud" from across the room, I knew I was not out of line with this one.  First of all, it came with dead batteries in it.  What's the point of that?  Include batteries or don't, but sending it with dead ones is almost offensive.  There is a "functioning volume control" on it, but since a baby just indiscriminately pushes buttons, I doubt that if I pushed the volume button down it would stay there.  I tried putting packing tape over the speaker to see if that helped, but it didn't.  Not even a little.  I took it to work and measured it with the sound level meter.  At the standard volume (not having pushed the "up" pr "down" button), many of the sounds on this thing peaked at over 80 dBA at a typical baby sized distance of 10 inches.  OSHA would almost make your baby wear hearing plugs if she were playing with this as her job.  We sent it back.
