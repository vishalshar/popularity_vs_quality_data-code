I bought this highchair after reading its many excellent reviews (not just on Amazon, but other baby-related websites).On the plus side: it really is a very fancy high chair, with adjustments for pretty much everything you could think of: seat height, recline degree, leg rest angle, etc. The seat is also very comfortable and well made -- sort of a rubberized leather material, which I imagine wouldn't be too hard to wipe clean. The big negative for me, however, is that this sucker is CLUNKY. Really heavy and hard to maneuver around if you're the sort of person who wants to put away the highchair between feedings. I also found (as mentioned by other reviewers) that the tray is very difficult to get in and out, even with two free hands. The peg holes just don't seem to line up easily, which made setting up the chair a bit of a trial each time. I also found myself wishing that the chair had fewer crevices and hinges where food might lodge, although admittedly we didn't keep it long enough to test that sort of clean-up.In sum: if you're into bells and whistles, this chair might be for you. However, if you're looking for ease of use or general simplicity of design, you might be happier looking elsewhere.
