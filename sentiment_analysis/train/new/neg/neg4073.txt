It's pretty, and it's wood and very nice, but it's so expensive and it doesn't keep either of our twins occupied for very long compared to the much cheaper and more versatile Tiny Love Take Along Arch (we have both this wooden toy and the takealong arch for both our Baby Bjorn seats). Yes the takealong arches are big and plastic but they fold up and you can put them away, and you can use them on other things like car seats, cribs, stroller so they are very versatile. The wooden toy only fits the Baby Bjorn and keeps attention for a few minutes. My girls, at least, stay much longer in the bouncer with the Takealong arch because it's more interesting, colorful, etc.We got the "Sunny stroll" one and have used it on the Bjorn bouncers, car seats, Mamaroo, and crib. It attaches to pretty much anything.http://www.amazon.com/Tiny-Love-Take-Along-Sunny-Stroll/dp/B000S9RF4M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415473014&sr=8-1&keywords=tiny+love+take+along+archI understand that anyone buying the Baby Bjorn bouncer doesn't want big plastic gaudy baby stuff, and neither did I. But when the twins came, I realized that a clean house comes not from having tasteful baby toys but from having an adult in the house with 15 minutes to clean up. In order to get those 15 minutes, I need toys and things that actually occupy the babies for long enough. Time makes a clean house, not just nice-looking baby gear.So to me, the issue is, which toy saves me the most time so I can clean my house in little increments here and there. For us, the wooden one was cute but gave me 5 minutes instead of 15 or 20 with the Take along arch and that's a big difference with little babies.
