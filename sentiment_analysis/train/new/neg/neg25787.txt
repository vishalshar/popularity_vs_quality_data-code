I'm really sad to write a less-than-5-star review for this item, because it's SO DARN CUTE!!!  Unfortunately, whether it was user error or not, it impeded the tightening of the straps of my son's car seat. We have a First Year's car seat...Again, I'm really sorry that it wasn't an A+; it could be the cover, it could be me--I'm not sure. But I can't let my son's safety be jeopardized for a cute car seat cover, so I returned it. :(
