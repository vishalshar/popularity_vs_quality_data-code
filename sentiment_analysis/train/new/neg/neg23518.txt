This seat was a disappointment. First, it doesn't have any sort of grip on it so it slides around on the toilet seat. (I attempted to remedy this by applying hot glue to the bottom edges, and it helped a little bit.)  Second, the urine splash guard is really high and made of hard plastic. It doesn't give at all and makes me a little nervous for my son if he slides forward off the seat.  Third, urine gets between the cushion and the hard plastic base. You have to remove the cushion to clean underneath it, but once you remove the cushion, it comes off the base very easily. It hardly stays attached now. Thankfully, I am still within the return window.
