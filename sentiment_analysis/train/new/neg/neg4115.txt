I choose the bottle because of Tommee Tippee brand. However I don't like the temperature sensor present in the bottle . While dealing with twins where you have so little time at hand you don't wanna buy thing which is not easy to handle . What I find difficult is when I am preparing formula I have to put this sensor stick with nipple aside . If it is only nipple , it is usually covered with a cap so it is hard to get contamination on the nipple however with this long sensor stick it can become tricky especially if you are out of your home.
