I purchased this for a gift basket, and I love the way it looks. However, when it arrived the hang-tag said it was made in China! Part of what went into my choices was to track down USA-made products, and the product description said it was made in the USA. I'm not going to bother returning it-- it's still a sweet toy, and I understand only 10% or so of available toys are made in this country. Still, I was very disappointed at the inaccurate information.
