We use this seat as a booster seat for our two-year-old who can sit at the table.  She had the Fisher Price Space Saver which we will now be using for her little sister who is due in a few weeks.  This is an okay chair, but I have three complaints.1. It's light weight and highly portable.  However, my two complaints are that it does not secure sturdily.  If I had a wiggly child or a child that tries to get out of seats, I would not recommend this as they will probably fall taking the booster seat and chair with them.2. The tray is a SNACK tray, meaning that a child's plate will not sit on this tray, so if you're not letting them eat at the table, you'll have to put the food directly on the tray. Only a bowl or cup will fit on the tray.  So in my opinion, it's not meant to replace a high chair, and the tray is basically worthless.3. It has a built in cup holder that is in an inconvenient place - right by the child's arm.  If your child puts their cup there you will spend most of your time picking it up off of the floor.It is worth the money if you're using it for a backup high chair or a booster seat.  I did like that the tray washes easily and does not stain.  Her Fisher Price space saver tray could never hold up to spaghetti or any other red sauce spills.  It's also easy to travel with and install.  If it had a bigger tray, I would have given it a higher rating.
