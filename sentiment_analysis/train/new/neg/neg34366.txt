There are many things wrong with this product. First off, it DOES NOT say that the product was used; therefore, the product should not have been opened before it got to me. Well, it was already opened. That is just gross. Even though I'm planning on washing it, if I buy something "new" it should be unopened!!Second, even though the main picture of this item shows a blue plate, under "Product Features" it says "Colors may vary, you may receive in one of the following colors: orange and white." I took this to mean that the plates that I receive would either be orange or they would be white. I received blue.The only reason why I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 star is because I actually like this product. I like the portions and that it comes with toddler silverware. The price is great. I'm just upset for how the product got to me and that the listing is not updated with correct information.I've never had a problem with Amazon and maybe it's just the seller. But I am thoroughly disappointed. Who sends someone an opened package?? Seriously.
