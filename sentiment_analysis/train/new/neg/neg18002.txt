Although it might look like a good price, i returned the item as it did not have any patting at all, the car seat was uncomfortable. My kids spend some time in the car, and some of the times they fall asleep, and is better to spend 30 dlls more and get something better at your local stores that you could see the comfort your self. The car seat is an item that most likely your kid is going to use for several years.
