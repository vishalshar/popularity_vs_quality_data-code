If I could give zero stars, I would! I don't know what happened to Avent's bottles in the 9 years I've last used them but the quality has gone down!The Size 1 nipples are supposedly meant for newborns but my 2.5 week old guzzles her milk down way too fast causing choking, vomiting and too much gas! Epic fail!If you are looking for a better flow rate for newborns, you're better off going to their Natural line of bottles. At least their nipples for newborns are better suited for them. Now I have to go buy more of them for my girl and put these up until she can tolerate them better!
