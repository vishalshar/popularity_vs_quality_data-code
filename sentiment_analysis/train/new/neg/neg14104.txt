I expected from other's reviews that the material would be thin, rough, and almost dingy. I was willing to accept that given how expensive other boppy covers are, and I haven't had time to create my own.What I didn't expect was for the zipper stitching to fall apart the first time putting this cover on the boppy. What shoddy construction. I would rather continue to toss a blanket over the boppy than use one of these covers.
