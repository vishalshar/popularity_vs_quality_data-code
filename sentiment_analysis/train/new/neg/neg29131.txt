I bought this after reading a magazine promotion, and was looking forward to using it for my infant.  However, this seat is not nearly as well-designed as they claim.  My baby's fat and long, and did not fit into this seat comfortably.  There's little back support so the little one is doubled over, with his spine bent.  This is not a healthy position for a baby.  Also, the bottom has no cushioning and can get cold on the baby's bottom.  This item may fit certain babies, but please make sure this is actually what you want because THEY DO NOT PAY FOR RETURN SHIPPING and this item is expensive to ship back.  IT WILL COST THE SAME TO BUY AS TO RETURN.So if you buy this and don't love it, you're stuck.  Given most amazon products offer return shipping if you're not satisfied, I'd recommend trying something else before committing to this.Also, if you're looking for a place to set down your child that's safe, comfortable, and can prevent spit ups, try the Fischer Price Rock 'n Play, or the Dot-a-Tot, which provides cozy comfort and is much better made.
