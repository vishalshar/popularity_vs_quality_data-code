I think this set is adorable sitting on my LO's dresser. The comb works well. The brush really is useless to us- it doesn't brush through my guy's hair. The mirror is heavy for a small toddler to use; my son would rather look in a large, hanging mirror. I would have passed on this in retrospect.Pros:1. Adorable2. Comb works wellCons:1. Brush doesn't work well2. Mirror is heavy and have to empty brush and comb in order to use it.
