Pros:-It's black, not some hideously bright baby color.-It has a sponge.-It's inexpensive.-It has a nipple cleaner attached.Cons:-I bought this because I liked the double sponge, but my son is breastfed and therefore hasn't (& won't) move up past a 5oz bottle.  The sponge closest to the handle doesn't really fit in the bottle and is therefore useless.-The wire is NOT STRONG.  My son only takes 3 bottles a day, 5 days a week when he's at daycare.  So we wash fewer bottles than a formula-fed baby, or baby getting exclusively pumped breastmilk.  My previous bottle brush lasted 5 months before the wire broke.  With this one, upon first use I could tell it wouldn't last NEARLY that long.  If your baby drinks breastmilk from a bottle, you know how it can get film from the ring of fat at the top when the milk separates.  This is why the sponge was so important.I can tell this will need to be replaced before my son is a year old (in four and a half months!), and I will NOT be purchasing this one again.  Again, maybe the faults I find in this brush are due to the fact I am using it to clean breastmilk residue from 5oz bottles.  Perhaps this is a brush better suited for 8oz bottles filled with formula.
