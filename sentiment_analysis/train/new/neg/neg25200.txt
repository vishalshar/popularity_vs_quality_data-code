My son is a cars fanatic, so we figured this potty seat could lure him onto the big potty. We were right! He climbed up on the stool and sat on the seat. He LOVES McQueen.  However, it was pretty annoying to use this seat. We have an oval shaped toilet and this seat doesn't really secure itself into this type of toilet. I don't even think it would fit securely into any toilet. We tried it with the seat down and the seat up. Both way.. very loose. It slid backwards when he was seated on the chair, and we had to keep pulling it forward so he wouldn't slide all the way back and lose his footing.  IN the end, we bought the Bjorn potty trainer and it fits so securely into the toilet seat, and it also has the raised pee guard. FAR superior product. Our son was upset that he didn't get to sit on the Cars seat, but we just put some CARS stickers on the Bjorn trainer and he was happy as a clam. :)If you want something that stays in place and keeps the pee in the actual potty, go with the Bjorn potty trainer. If you just want something entertaining that your kid will love, this product fits the bill.
