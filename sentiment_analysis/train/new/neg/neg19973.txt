Got small size after reading reviews, but felt extra small would have been better after using the small. It works as advertised, but the breast shields feel loose when attached. Does not give a secure feeling, although shields have never fallen out and milk has never spilled. It is also awkward that the top of the bustier feels looser than the bottom giving the sensation that it could tip over or open up. Idea is great, but I got a much better and much more comfortable result by taking an old sports bra, cutting out nipple holes and securing the breast shields under the bra. It is extremely expensive for what it is, I could have bought 3 sports bras and converted them with a pair of scissors and gotten a better result for the same price! So I if I had the chance to do it over, I would not buy it; and therefore, cannot recommend it.Ps. A word of advice: if you want to use a sports bra, the tighter the hole you make for the breast shield spouts the better. And for longer use you can sew around the hole to stop it from expanding with numerous uses.
