It feels a bit silly to write, as this isn't an expensive purchase, but the quality of the product was so different from what I have come to expect from OXO that I felt it was worth a review. From the beginning the cup didn't work well for our daughter (she was about 16 months when we bought it, and is 22 months now). She couldn't get her hand into it and mostly just demanded that we take the top off. The flaps softened a bit over time but she still preferred to have the lid off (which pretty much defeats the purpose of a somewhat nonspill cup, obviously). Anyway, we soldiered along and tried to make it work but then she threw it on the ground, as toddlers do, and it cracked a bit. Then it cracked a bit more, and within a week or so the cup part was completely cracked with a jagged edge. This is after a little over three months of average use by a typical toddler. Feels like bad design and bad quality to me, and this is the first time I've had a negative experience with an OXO product. Disappointing.ETA: I contacted the company and they are sending a replacement. I still can't really recommend buying it, but adding an extra star for good customer service.
