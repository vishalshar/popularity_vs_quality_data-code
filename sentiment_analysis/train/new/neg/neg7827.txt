These are not the ones that you can get at Target.  For some reason it says ultra soft but the ones I purchased at target feel softer and the backing is different. These have a backing that seems almost plastic like (which I heard wasn't good).  The ones I got at Target have more a "cloth-like" backing, more breathable.  But I'm giving it 3 stars still because it works, no leaking.
