For us these were useless as anything more than a toy. I purchased them when my son started teething a lot and they fit well on our crib, but my son figured out how to take them off immediately. I made sure I put them on at a time when he couldn't watch me but it obviously wasn't hard for him to figure out how they worked. I can't imagine it would be much harder for another baby. I should note that my son has always been a very easy going and laid back baby. He's really not destructive or things like that, but he is smart. Since I already purchased these I plan to keep them and try using them for our next child, but if he or she removes them as well I'll get one of the fabric tie on rail covers. I don't usually write many reviews but this is one purchase I've regretted on more than one occasion so I thought I should share.
