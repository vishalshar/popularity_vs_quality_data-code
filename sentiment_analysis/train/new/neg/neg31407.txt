when i saw this, i thought it would be the perfect addition to our baby's nursery. since it was a carter's product, i didn't at all question the quality...i've had great experience with carters' products in the past. this mobile, however, was a HUGE disappointment to us. the first one we purchased lasted 3 months of occasional use and then refused to spin despite repositioning it, taking it apart and putting it back together, etc. we thought it was a fluke and purchased a second one. that lasted 2 months and the when winding it up one day, the spring broke inside the music chamber.don't get this mobile: the animals are very cute and our baby loved it, but it's not worth it. it will not last. i wish i would have read the reviews on this product before purchasing...i would have gone with something else in its place.
