This is not as sturdy as I had hoped. I used to have a molded plastic booster similar to what you get in a restaurant. When I forgot it on vacation, I decided to buy this booster which is more compact. It lives in the car so we have it when we travel to grandma's house, etc. The reviews of this are all pretty positive, but it seems flimsy to me. The back has no support for a squirmy toddler. It's got a pretty small footprint, so his 2T, 2-year-old bum fits inside, but not for long. I am always worried that I didn't strap it down adequately. With the larger booster, it felt sturdy even though it didn't have straps, because the base was wider. I feel like my son is balanced on a little pedestal. Also, I realized too late that the chairs at Grandma's house are designed so that the back support is up higher and they are open at the low back, which causes the booster to slide through off the back of the chair through the opening a bit. I adjust it each time my son gets in, but it doesn't feel secure. Even for a travel booster, I want something sturdier.
