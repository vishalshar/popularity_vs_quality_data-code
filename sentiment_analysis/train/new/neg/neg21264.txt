this has an upper compartment that can be removed for traveling & just warming bottles. The problem with this upper bottle warmer is that it takes eternity to warm a bottle from the fridge. How long, you ask, is eternity? with a hungry crying baby, 14 minutes (the product manual places the warm up time at 14 minutes)So, you may want to dispense hot water to the bottle to mix with dry formula. This is a lot faster than the bottle warm time but, according to my thermometer, the water dispensed was not even close to the termperature advertized in the manual.I got this because I thought that the warmer could be used to heat larger food containers like the sage spoonfuls. The problem I found was that the bottom of the warmer is uneven and so if the glass jars don't weigh enough they float around in the minimum water level and may get ucky water in them. Anyway, I found that the dr brown steam heater fits the sage spoonfuls glass jars perfectly (in a fraction of the time) and I've never had trouble with breakage.I wanted to love this but it just doesn't do anything well. I will say that I was able to return it with no problems and so have no regrets.
