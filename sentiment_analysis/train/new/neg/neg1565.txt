I love medela breast pumps but never understood why their milk storage bags cost significantly more than other brands like lansinoh but since this came with the storage bags I thought I'd test them out. The storage bags are hard to close and are very stiff. They also only hold 5 ounces while most other bags hold 8. So I recommend medela for their pumps and accessories but save money on breast milk storage bags by getting lansinoh which are the best ones I've ever used or even Target brand is better than Medela.
