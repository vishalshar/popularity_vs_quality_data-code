This is too big for my 24 month old.  He simply will not use it.  I bought two of these (total of 4 pacifiers) thinking we should switch to the larger size.  Unfortunately, I did not notice that this is not fulfilled by Amazon.  Despite having a second 2-pack completely untouched, I would be required to pay about as much in shipping to return it as I would get in my refund.I would not recommend this pacifier in general, and would recommend another source for those interested in checking it out.
