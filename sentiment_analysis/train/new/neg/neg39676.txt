The plastic back which folds down catches the foam seat and the foam keeps chipping off the foam seat (as you can see in the photos) Either it's a design flaw or a manufacture defect.  Also the seat is much smaller than I'd expected.  I initially liked the design of the seat with its clean look but after a few months the seat degraded FAST. (Photo attached) after the initial chipping of the foams, I was going to return it but then got busy in my motherhood and then lost the window. But I do like how the seat is very light and it's complete non-slip.  It does fold down easily and carry easily. I'm just bummed the seat isn't very durable. Hopefully they will continue to improve this product.
