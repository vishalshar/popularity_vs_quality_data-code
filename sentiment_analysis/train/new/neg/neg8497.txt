I ordered this carseat because everything I've read says that Britax is the best and because it was on sale.  There are a few things that I don't like about this seat.  The biggest issue is that the belts/straps twist constantly.  This causes problems when you try to adjust the tightness of the belts.  One side always tightens more than the other so my son's shoulder sometimes slips out of the one side which is not what you want to see when you turn back to look at him in the car.  I do like that the headrest adjusts up with just the turn of the knob and I really like the quality of the fabric.  It's very soft and cushiony but seems like it will be durable.  My son seems to love it so far.  If I were going to buy another one I will go with the more expensive model, in hopes that it wouldn't have these same issues.
