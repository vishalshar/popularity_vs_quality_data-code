This seat would be fine for toddlers. It is not adjustable and my 7 month old slides forward. I have to put a towel behind him as a back support or in front of him to keep him from sliding. Also, your can not take off the covers and wash them, they are screwed in. I would not buy it again. If you happen to have super clean 1 year old, this chair is for you.
