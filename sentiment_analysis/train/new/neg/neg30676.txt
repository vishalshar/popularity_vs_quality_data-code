I was a little concerned that it would not fit the monstrosity of a stroller that carries our child.  Fortunately it does, and it works effectively at also keeping the child warm by keeping the wind off. It's is clear enough and smooth enough that the child doesn't throw a tantrum due to a lack of visibility.  But you do have to loosen it if you go indoors as it can compound heat as well.Key is being aware of the child in the stroller and their needs when this is in use.Edit: 12/17 - Item is clearly falling apart. It is  used, but not heavily.  The seams have come undone and soon I will be looking to purchase an alternative.  It works good but that it's falling apart already is problematic.  Particularly when it's a $26 product.
