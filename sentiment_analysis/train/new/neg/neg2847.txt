These pads were the same ones I received in the hospital and they were OK. My biggest gripe was that they only lasted 24 hours and were pretty expensive. And I didn't think they healed or soothed as well as the Ameda pads that actually last six days. The Medela pads are fine if you only need them for a short period of time, but I'm glad I went looking for something else.
