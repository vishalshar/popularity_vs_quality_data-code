basically when you buy a stroller its meant for travel , but not this product as it is too sensitive and can break easily under pressure . there is a pressure limit sensor just under the seat which is so delicate that it broke on its first flight . brand new stroller 4 days old . so anyway i called 4 moms they were extremely arrogant about their product and refute to attend a claim done if the stroller has been used in an aircraft , i was wondering that is the stroller made to keep the baby safe or do we need to keep the stroller safe . pathetic service of the stroller company . unfortunately i was travelling for 6 months so i cannot even return the product to amazon for a refund i have actually thrown away a 850 usd stroller ,
