My son is fascinated by plugs and has defeated every safety device I've tried.  When I saw that this one needs a coin to undo it, I thought I'd finally found a solution.  Problem is, before I'd finished plugging my 6th plug with these things, my son was handing me the first two plug covers.  He was so proud of himself!  The problem is, these covers rely on their shape to stay in place - the coin simply pops out a handle for adults to grip.  My son, being too young to know that he wasn't supposed to be able to do it, simply plucked them off the wall.  Bah!  Still questing for something that works!
