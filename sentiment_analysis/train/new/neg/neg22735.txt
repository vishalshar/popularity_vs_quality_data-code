We received these for a gift, and we put them on the seat today. As we were traveling through a construction zone, by daughter started chocking very badly on them. Her straps were tightly secured, but her paci had fallen out and she had been searching for it. It was the scariest moment I've ever had. DON'T BUY. Unsafe.
