This is a very beautiful and high quality ring sling, but I was very disappointed by the sizing. The manufacturer's website claimed their slings are "one size fits all" which is one of the reasons I purchased this. After trying it on it seems extremely short on me (I am 5'9"). After noticing this problem I did more research on ring slings, and discovered that the Sakura Bloom standard size 74" is actually considered a size small in many other ring sling manufacturers. I wonder why they do not mention this on their site, and instead advertised as "one size fits all".I contacted the manufacturer to see if it would be possible purchase a longer length sling, but they said no. It is too bad because I really do like their style and quality of materials. It was a lot of money to spend to end up with a super short, silly looking tail. I will probably try and resell it online. I've since purchased a longer sling from another company and I can't wait to try it out when my little one is born.If you are a petite or shorter woman then this sling company might work out fine for you. If you are on the taller/curvier side I would suggest doing your research on ring sling sizing and determine what length you really want before making the same mistake I did.
