I got this and never really used any part of it except the dishwasher basket.  I may yet use the steamer part, but... I love the dishwasher basket so much that I got a second. I have the ventaire bottles and I mainly use the basket for the vent stopper, the bottom cap and the nipples. I can fit those parts for six bottles comfortably but can squeeze in two more sets if necessary. Since I have two, I don't have to run the dishwasher daily, I can go every other day and build up 12-14 bottles to wash at once. The ring for the nipples I put individually on the prongs on the top tray of the dishwasher and then put this basket on top of them. Two of these baskets fit perfectly in one row of the dishwasher so that it doesn't take up as much space in the washer. When I wash the 12-14 bottles, bottles and baskets take up 2/3rds of the top drawer of the dishwasher.
