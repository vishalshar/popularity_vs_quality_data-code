Hip-looking, like something Virgin Atlantic would design, BUT.... Can't take this anywhere because the lid is very loose.  Can't put this in the freezer because the lid is loose (which would result in freezer burn).  I have never put this in the dishwasher, only washed by hand.  Spoon is okay... I actually prefer the Munchkin 6-pack... those spoons stain less, have a more comfortable grip, and have a deeper basin for food.  Don't waste your time on this product - get some glass containers with snapping / spillproof lids instead.
