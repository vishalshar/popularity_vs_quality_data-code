i have a one year old that cannot chew meat or chicken so i bought this hoping that i would be able to mash up meat for her.  this merely shreds chicken and even to do that, it needs a lot of liquid.  i put chunks of cooked beef in here, that i had cut up and it did nothing.  the meat chunks just got stuck on the ends of the blades and all that happened when i pulled the string was the meat wiping the bowl.  terrible product.  excellent idea, but poor execution.  what it did do well was with noodle soups - the noodles were cut into bitesize pieces but i don't think that it justifies the keeping of this product.i can see how this would do well with very soft foods with considerable liquid - but if foods are already that soft, i don't need to use the boon mush for it.use at your own risk, make sure you can get free returns.  also, clean up is not as easy as it claims.  any liquid splashes out, gets inside the top of the lid, and sometimes on the inside of the lid.  when you chop up hot foods, the lid has a tendency to get stuck from the suction.  so either you need super strength to undo it, or wait until it cools down.i will be returning this.  i'm surprised by all of the good reviews.
