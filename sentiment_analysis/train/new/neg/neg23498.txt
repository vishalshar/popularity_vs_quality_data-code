This shade works pretty well however I have a Chrysler 200 and the window is an odd shape so the shade doesn't fit perfectly. It covers just enough for the baby to see and not be blind most of the time. The top suction cups are ok, but the grey one used to hold the shade down against the window needs a little work. Its very flimsy.
