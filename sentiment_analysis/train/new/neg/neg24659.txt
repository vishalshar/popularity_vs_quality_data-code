I threw in a second star because it's not in any way unsafe, but there is zero point to this product. Once your baby can roll it is totally ineffective, and if they can't roll, they can easily sleep safely just about anywhere. A play mat or, heck, a towel would be just as good and likely more comfortable. And while this item folds down, it is not super compact for travel.A total waste of $60 when you can get an entire Pack 'N Play for that price.
