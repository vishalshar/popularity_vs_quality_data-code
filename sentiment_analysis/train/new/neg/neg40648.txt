I really wanted this sling to work for us... My baby just hated it.  I re-watched the video countless times to see what I could be doing wrong.  I repositioned, tightened, loosened and shifted, tried it with my baby awake, asleep, happy and upset and it ended in a meltdown every time. I originally got the moby wrap before my daughter was born and used it quite a few times before purchasing the maya wrap.  I wanted to switch because I live in the south and with all of the fabric of the moby and my daughters super efficient circulatory system, we could only use it indoors or she was sweating and bright red from overheating.  The maya wraps fabric isn't near as soft as the moby, so I don't think my daughter was as comfortable in it. Especially when we have to strip her down to her diaper just to be in a sling at all.I don't think it's the worst thing ever created though, I know some people who love it, but their babies are a lot less particular than mine.
