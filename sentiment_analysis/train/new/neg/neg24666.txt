I do not recommend this car seat.  I have been using it for 6 weeks.  I don't have latch in the center, so I tried to install the base with the seatbelt.  The base simply does not install securely like this in my Prius.  I use the latch on the outer seat which is more secure like this, but the seat has a lot of "wiggle room" in the base, which I don't know if that is normal, but it seems unstable.  The seat is lightweight, but it is no smaller than seats with higher weight limits so it takes up a ton of room and is still bulky and cumbersome.Also, it does not seem to install securely without the base because Maxi Cosi no longer allows for the European belt path.I had to remove all of the padding because my baby didn't seem to fit well and got so sweaty in the seat. This helped somewhat.  The seat is very narrow inside and my 6 week old already has both shoulders touching the sides when we put her in it, though she is a big baby.  I missed returning the product by 1 week.  I will likely buy another seat and try to consign this one.
