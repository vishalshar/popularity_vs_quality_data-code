This basket may be okay for some people but not for me.  The basket has a designated space for each part of the Dr Browns bottles including the cap.  I rarely use the caps and dislike how the basket has reserved room for something I am rarely going to put in there.  I also own the munchkin basket (I used to use the Avent bottles and placed these in the munchkin basket.  They were a tight fit but you could still make it work)and decided to try this out with the Dr Browns bottles and it holds 10 nipples in the top section, 8 vents on the sides (in the straw holders) and all of the other parts in the lower section.  The Dr Browns fit perfectly with the munchkin basket and I was happy to see that the vents worked with the straw holders.  I am going to send this basket back and stick with my munchkin basket!
