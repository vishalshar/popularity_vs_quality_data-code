Very cute and matches the Adorable Dino bedding perfectly. My son loves to look at the hanging dinosaurs. But as a parent the music part is HORRIBLE for the price of this. It lasts for just a couple of minutes... Not even long enough for me to wash bottles in the next room without having to restart it once or twice more. Also, when my son is falling asleep and the music stops, there's no way for him to not notice me having to wind it up again - then he's wide awake. Not worth the price, I'm looking for a different crib toy (even if it doesn't match).I really can't believe for $45 it plays for two minutes and the toys don't even turn or anything?
