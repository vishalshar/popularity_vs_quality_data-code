I bought the P&T Sports from a local retailer one week ago. Upon assembly a day later, I loved the look and functionality of the stroller, but immediately found that the front wheel swivel lock had broken and the front wheel kept locking on its own or falling off - must have been a manufacturing fault as the stroller is brand new and straight out of a sealed box.The stroller was returned to my retailer for repairs. They phoned Phil & Teds in New Zealand, who informed us that they would do the repair back at their factory, but we had to pay for shipping from Australia (A$200 or more each way). Considering the pram is brand new and it was an obvious manufacturing fault, and the wheel was broken at the time of initial assembly, we are incredibly annoyed and disappointed. I can't believe they would ask us to pay an extra few hundred dollars on an already expensive stroller to ship their brand new FAULTY product back to their factory for repairs. We will never buy a Phil & Teds product again simply because of their appalling customer service.
