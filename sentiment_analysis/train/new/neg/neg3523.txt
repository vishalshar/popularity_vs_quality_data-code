This is a good toy if your child is in the three to four month range. Any older than that, and your child may not fit appropriately in the spinner. My son is a reflux baby so he doesn't enjoy tummy time and this toy helped for a little while but now that he is 5 months he is already tipping out of it. I do still use the mat, which is awesome. My son loves to just lay and roll on the mat.  Another tip if you choose to buy it - do not leave your child unattended. The tummy seat could flip if your child is intent on getting out.
