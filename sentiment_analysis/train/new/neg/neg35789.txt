I really wanted all organic for where my baby sleeps given the amount of time she spends there.  But these sheets already have a hole where they stretch over the mattress.  Given I change and wash the sheets at least once a day, but that should be expected with a baby as they spit up a lot, and I've only been using these sheets for just over a month.  You would think when buying organic that the workmanship would match but with this product that doesn't seem to be the case.
