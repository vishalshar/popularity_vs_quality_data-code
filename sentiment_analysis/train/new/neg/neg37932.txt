I buy these pasties a lot..and this is the first pair that came off the first time I wore them.lasted under an hour.normally i can get about 12 wearings.and if you have ever had these slip off during the day..it is not funny.lol..it is now..but, it was not when i was at the supermarket.i know it all depends on which seller you get em from..and they will not let you list the seller to avoid here.unfortunately.
