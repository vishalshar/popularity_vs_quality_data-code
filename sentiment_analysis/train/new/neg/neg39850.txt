I'm only 5 foot tall. Yep. Five foot zero inches. And this stroller was even too short for me. The handles are short which causes the stroller to be too close when pushing it - I kept kicking the back tires.  I understand how the other reviewers had to "hunch over" because that is what I had to do to keep from accidentally kicking the brakes and bringing the stroller to an abrupt stop.I tried steering it with one hand (so that I could stand to the side and walk normally), but it pulled so hard to the right that I had to keep both hands on it.  After one mile, my right arm hurt so badly I had to retreat and head home.PROS?  The stroller IS light and very compact. I bought it hoping I could use it for an airplane trip. I think it could work, if it was, again, longer on the handles. The stroller itself is cute too.
