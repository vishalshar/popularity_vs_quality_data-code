We used this bag to carry a booster seat on the plane from the U.S. to Europe. The good: it's bright green, so it's impossible to lose, and it's the first thing you'll see on the baggage belt. It has a pocket in the front that will latch on to the handle of your rolling suitcase, so it's convenient to carry around the airport. And it is big enough that I think it will fit any backless booster seat.  The bad: it's made of a very thin material, and not suitable for checking on the plane (Would be just fine for gate checking, I think). Ours ripped the first time we checked it.  They clearly warn against checking this bag, so it's not their fault. Unfortunately, there do not seem to be other bags on the market that are strong enough to check, yet are compact enough to not be overly cumbersome. So if you do check this bag, just assume that it will only last you one round trip.
