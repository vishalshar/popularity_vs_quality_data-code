*UPDATED* FEB. 15th 2016.Mirror broke off the mount after less then a year of use.  Very disappointed in this mirror and will lower my review to 1 star.  The mirror is too heavy for the cheap plastic mount that holds it to the base.  Our base strap broke too when I removed the mirror.  The plastic is just too fragile.The pros:great viewing area and easy adjustment on the view angle.  We like it.the cons:it bounces around a lot and may cause you to get car sick if you look at it often.
