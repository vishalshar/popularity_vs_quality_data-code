I purchased 3 sets for my 3 kids thinking, " Great! No more plastic bags!" They are very cute but not very practical. They are only good for maybe a day trip to the park or school lunches. We are military living overseas so we travel a lot and for long distances. These bags would not work so well since they don't keep food fresh. I repeat- THEY DO NOT KEEP FOOD FRESH!! Cookies, Cheerios, graham crackers, chips, etc all become stale after I would say 6 hours or so. We took a day trip to a small island by ferry for the day and by the end of the day all my kids snacks were soft and stale on the ferry ride back. :( Also, I forgot to clean out my daughters lunch box over the weekend and by Sunday night I found a snack bag full of moldy 1/2 eaten strawberries. I went to wash it out with warm/hot soapy water and saw that the moldy strawberries had eaten away at the inside lining causing it to crack apart. My fault for forgetting to clean out my daughters lunch box but it made me so mad that I had to throw it away. Money in the trash!! I gave it 3 stars for the design, the short term use for food, and the many other non food usages but still not what I was expecting. Hope this is helpful.
