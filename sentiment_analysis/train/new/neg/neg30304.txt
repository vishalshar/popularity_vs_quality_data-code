I don't know why I expected to just throw this on my son (who pees EVERY TIME we change his diaper) but it flys off with the pee, lol.  You have to have a hand holding it at the same time.  when you use it in that way, it keeps the pee from going everywhere, but you have to be ready.  If you just put it on while changing the diaper, a squirmy infant will flop it right off.  I like that you can wash it and it is reusable, and small, and lets face it, pretty cute.
