I suppose I should have read the other reviews. Lesson learned. We have another brand of mesh feeder that does have slightly larger opened mesh but it works fine for us, even with a baby with swallow issues. The pros on this feeder are the easier to hold handle and the removable mesh. The con, in my opinion, makes this not worth it even counting in the pros. This thing is impossible to open. If you have a baby genius with super human strength then maybe this is for you but otherwise, this thing is near impossible to open.
