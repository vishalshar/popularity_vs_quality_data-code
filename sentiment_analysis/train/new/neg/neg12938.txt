I wish the seat had wheels, the toy bar is flimsy and won't stay put, other than that it's a good product. My 10 day old baby seem to like it, she stays in the seat for short periods of time, I'm sure when she's bigger it will become more useful.the color is great if you don't like all the bright crazy colors of other baby seats.
