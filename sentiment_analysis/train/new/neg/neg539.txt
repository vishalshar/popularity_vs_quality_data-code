I ordered 6 caps. 4 caps were fine but 2 were stuck together so tight I couldn't pull them apart. Instead of throwing them both out I managed to cut 1 and keep the other. Just thought it was such a pain to deal with that problem. Suggestion would be to have better packaging so it doesn't happen to anyone else.
