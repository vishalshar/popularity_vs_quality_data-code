the doll was cute.... but fell apart sooo fast :( less than 10 uses my a 6 mo old. I was sent emails from the co saying to contact them before giving a negative review... they were rude, trite and just awful. Be cautious in giving this doll to a small child the pig tail wraps are attached by a single thread and come off as the babys chew :( a waist of 13 bucks:(
