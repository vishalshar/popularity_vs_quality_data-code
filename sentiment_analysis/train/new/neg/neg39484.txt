i bought this bath sponge when it was about $5 so i thought for the price we'd see how it is. when it arrived i was pretty disappointed with the size of it. it's much shorter than the $7 ones from target i've been buying for the last several months (my baby is 7mns old) & the target ones just don't seem to hold up well. this frog sponge is much shorter so i have a hard time laying my son on it. he's soon getting to the age where he won't need these soon so i'm not that worried about it but but i think i'll get my $7 target one again considering this one only covers his head & partial back (his tush hangs off). for the price this sponge is good & it seems to hold up to getting rung out, hung over the shower bar, etc. but this seems much better suited for a very tiny infant.
