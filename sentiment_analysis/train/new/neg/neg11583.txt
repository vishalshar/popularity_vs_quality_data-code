Purchased these as a stocking stuffer for my son, who was nearly 4 at Christmastime. He loves to participate in whatever we are doing, so eating with chopsticks is appealing to him. I work, so getting dinner on the table in time is a struggle most nights without distractions. Without fail, we would sit down and the interrogation would begin. He would want chopsticks. Why couldn't he have some. I'd finally give in because unlike most of his accusations of unfair treatment, I didnt really have a good reason for why he couldn't try to learn to use them. Id spend 5-10 mins trying to find another set and roll the paper and get the rubber band just right. He'd use them for about 2 mins and they'd pop undone (im not the most crafty person ever). I'd redo it. And so on.Found these by mistake and thought, not this is genius. Santa must know about these....They arrived and a few days later after making pad thai we pulled them out for the inaugural use. It took, LITERALLY, 20 mins for us to figure out how to use them. We got the kidlets hands on the juuuuuust so, but the first time he put them down or moved his had he couldn't get it back the way the were supposed to be. We looked at it again, and this time it only took a minute or two to re-configure how your hand should be positioned. We put his wee little hand back on them. He used it a few mins...then...wait for it..he put it down and asked for a fork.::bangs head on table::So, basically, they are fine. They seem good quality. They dont NOT work. But man are they hard to use and a sorta aggravating. They were the first thing that made my son NOT want to use chopsticks. Its not that it isn't a cool idea....I love the idea...just not the practice of using them.
