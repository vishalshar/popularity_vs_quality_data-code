I was very excited to use this when I got it.  We tried it with cooked peas and corn.  1) When we put in just a little bit of food, it seemed to process all of it.  But when I put in more food, it was difficult to get all of it thru.  2) I also had a hard time getting the crank shaft put together just right so that it would work properly.  What they don't tell you here are the instructions.  You have to tighten the top really well in order to turn the bottom to the right to lock it or to the left to unlock it.  Then you have to loosen the very top a little in order to be able to turn the crank and operate the food mill.  This leaves a lot of room for user error and makes for frustrated mommy when baby is fussing for food or you are trying to do the dishes in under 2 minutes.  It kept getting stuck in the locked position and my husband finally had to rescue me. 3) It was much larger than I expected especially since I read where someone took it with them out to eat.  It would need it's own diaper bag!  4) The whole business about "just put all the little pieces in your baby item basket in the top of your dishwasher" is crazy.  You need a basket that is made of mesh to hold these tiny parts, otherwise half of them are just going to fall thru.  5) AND just during the few trials with this thing the plastic around the metal masher part started to scratch and fray.  That doesn't make me feel all warm and fuzzy about what I'm feeding my baby.I am returning the item and may go back to my original plan of spending more money to buy the "ween machine".  The video I saw for it was very cool, neat idea...but the reviews are mixed.
