I bought this pump after reading all of the good reviews and when i noticed the price was decent compared to other models. Unfortunately i can say the reason i didn't breastfeed longer than 2 months was because of this pump. At the time i was juggling going back to school as well as a new baby, and the fact that this pump was slow, and didn't have very good suction made it hard to continue. If your dependent on expressed milk, invest in a more expensive model, if you need this just for pumping for the babysitter or something then it would be alright.
