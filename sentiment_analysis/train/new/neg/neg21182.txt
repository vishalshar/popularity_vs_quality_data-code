We love the look of this!! It really capture the attention of our little one and he wants to pull it around the house. The problem with it; It is terribly off balance and as soon as he goes to pull, it flips over on its side or face and he is dragging it around. It is very unfortunate because it IS really cute. We are trying to figure out a way to 'weight' the bottom of it somehow, before he grows out of playing with it. My guess is that it will just end up being decorative on the shelf in his room.
