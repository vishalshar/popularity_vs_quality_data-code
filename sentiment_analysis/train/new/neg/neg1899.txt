After reading reviews of the 6" pig mary meyer bank and hearing how small it was i decided to go with the cute 10" elephant one to make sure it was a good size for a toddler girl. The only thing that makes it 10" is the trunk and tail of the elephant! the actually bank size is no larger and can fit in the palm of your hand. It is much too small to fit anything in really. it probably the size of a very small coffee cup inside and i was hoping it was larger and could hold more. Also the color looks very bright but it's not. The pink is actually a very soft baby pink as well as the ear patterns. Both the blue and yellow are very dull so i was really disappointed that it was as bright and cute as the pic.
