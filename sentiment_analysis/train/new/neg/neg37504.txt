I read many of the reviews on here about these bumpers and it seemed 50% of the buyers said this product was great and the bumpers stuck well. The other 50% said the bumpers were horrible and fell off the tub. I'm in the latter category. I have a standard tub, nothing fancy and I did everything I was supposed to beforehand. I cleaned the tub well. I tried applying the bumpers while the tub was dry and then while it was wet just to see if it made a difference. They fall off very easily and don't stay on for long at all when they do stick. My 10-month-old son can pull them off with no problem and even a high water level makes them float. I'd return them if it wasn't such a pain but I would not recommend them to anyone. Just find a way to DIY before buying these! :(
