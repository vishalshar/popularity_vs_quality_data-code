I was so excited to receive these for my 8 month old. I have used mesh and found them to get dirty and stay dirty quickly but my babies loved/love feeding themselves. I also love the idea of putting whatever I am eating in there for them to enjoy without worrying about choking or having to spend hours of my meals cutting everything up. Anyways these were not like using mesh at all. Sure they clean up great but my daughter has a rough time getting food through the holes. Also they don't hold much food and considering all she can do is pretty much suck the juices from the food I am constantly dumping and refilling them. They are best for purees only and considering the price I cannot recommend them for replacing a mesh feeder. I have not tried them with frozen food yet but I think these would work nicely for the teething babies.On a positive note, they travel well and seem to hold up well in the top rack of the dishwasher. I also love that two sizes of feeders come in the package. I also love the clip that keeps it attached to baby.  Overall it is a great product for young babies who are on purees. For older babies I would stick to the mesh and just replace the mesh frequently.
