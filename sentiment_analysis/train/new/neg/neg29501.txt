I bought this product as a Christmas gift for my mother.  I specifically ordered it NEW since it's a gift.  The box looked a liitle crummy as I was wrapping it but I didn't too much thought.  Then came on Christmas day, I opened the box with my mother and can noticed the dry water mark on the tank wall.  So you can picture how embarassed I was and that I had to explain I ordered it new but the seller sent me a USED one.  Very diappointed with Amazon.
