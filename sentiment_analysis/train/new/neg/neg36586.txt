I bought this product because I needed something to carry my son's bottles to the sitter in. The color did not look as bright and cute as it does in the picture. It was very dull. And, the Dr. Brown bottles I used would not fit in the bag, it wasn't tall enough. In my opinion, it was overpriced for the quality. Returned it the next day!
