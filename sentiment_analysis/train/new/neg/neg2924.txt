I purchased this product because it claims to hold 6 cups of liquid...WRONG! Every single time my son wets the bed (and lately I put down two mattress protectors and a thick blanket and then this pad on top) the urine STILL soaks through to the mattress!!!! I've never been so disappointed in a product.
