This seat is adequate.  Our objections follow.  The buckle sits very low to the seat, with no possibility of pulling it out further.  So, it's very easy to pinch the baby's thigh in the mechanism when you're struggling to get her in.  There is a "belly pad" (more like a "crotch pad") to prevent this, but it's not easy to flare it out properly across the crotch and inner thighs.  This is especially true when you're trying to make sure the child's head doesn't bump the top of the doorway as you put her in (not easy, as the chair sits very high in the car) and the buckle/belly pad is flopped over facing down in the seat.  Also, we had a problem of the shoulder strap catching a hook in the back, preventing it from being loosened or tightened.  We fixed it after struggling to remove and replace a plastic shield covering the whole mechanism behind the seat.  Our other objection is that the seat seems overly complex, overly engineered in the wrong places, and unintuitive, with belts and buckles galore for every conceivable attachment possibility.  In simpler matters, like making adjustments to the shoulder height and removing the cover to wash it, this thing is maddeningly complex.  The directions are a voluminous mess, full of legalese and in many languages, so it's hard to find the standard installation method in English. (We have a Honda CR-V with the shoulder belt; I would think this is the type of seatbelt that most people have these days; installation directions should put this one up front.)
