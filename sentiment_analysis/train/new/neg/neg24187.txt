The bread explodes any moisture when you press it down, making a mess of a sandwich. . .easier to cut the sandwich yourself especially when you figure in the time it takes to scrub each little hole.  Definitely not recommended for any sandwiches with peanut butter, jelly, mayo etc. Worthless for us!
