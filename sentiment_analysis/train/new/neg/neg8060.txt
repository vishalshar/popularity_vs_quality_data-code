This is a very nicely made item and seems durable. As with any one size fits all item there are compromises. We put ours in a Subaru Tribeca.The reasons for the 3 rating are (really is a 3.5 for me, but not a 4):*There is no cut out to use the seat back pocket in the car - you lose one place to store kids stuff in the back.*The strap on the bottom goes across the entire seat - aesthetically sticks out when you get in the car - doesn't allow you to secure it to the seat braces on each side which would be a better fit and look - also sticks out slightly and touches your lower back unless you are sure to tuck it deeply in the seat. I will probably modify it to make it work/look better.*Expensive considering it is a generic fit item - for the price it should address my criticisms above. Price is also for 1 cover - it clearly says that in the description, but i assumed for the price it came with two.Positives:*Very well constructed and quality materials.*I am sure it is better than 95% of the seat back covers out there.*Velcro head rest attachments are smartly designed and do a nice job of getting the cover up against the seat.Overall we are satisfied with the cover and it obviously serves its purpose. There is probably a market for custom fit seat back covers that fit and look appropriate in your car.
