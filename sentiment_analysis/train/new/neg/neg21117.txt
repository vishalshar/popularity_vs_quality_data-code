I've loved these cups for years (have been buying them for 8 years for 4 kids,) but they've altered something in manufacturing and now the lids are slightly too big for the cup. They pop off with no effort whatsoever. Chocolate milk vs white rug...guess who won that battle? It wasn't the rug. I bought the cups 3 different times recently and had the same problem each time.
