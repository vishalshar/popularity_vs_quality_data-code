This book is very disappointing.  The cover looks great but the book its self is lacking.  It is flat....of course it is lacking half the content of other baby books.  For example each month until the 1st birthday.  If you want a quick fix this is fine.  I like to be more elaborate for my girls & I to look back on one day.  I am currently shopping for a better book.
