I really wanted to love this tank but I just don't. It's ok, which at almost $50 for a tank top doesn't merit more than 3 stars. The fabric does feel like it will hold up well but it's not super comfortable...it feels like it will hold up, kind of thick and slightly coarse. The mechanism for nursing is just like any other nursing tank, you unclip and pull it down. The mechanism for pumping is what could use some work. You lift a flap and then pull another one from the side over to the middle. Since the fabric is fairly thick it is not super comfortable. It does hold the flanges in place but I have a harder time centering them over my nipples than I do with my simple wishes hands free pumping bra. It takes one more step to put on the simple wishes pumping bra but probably less time and it's more comfortable. Plus the pumping bra can be reused several days in a row as its only worn for a few minutes at a time...and it's cheaper. So, I'll still wear this tank occasionally but it's not the first thing I'll reach for.
