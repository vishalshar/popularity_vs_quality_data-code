Why didn't they make this mirror like the ones on our cars that amplify the image? This mirror seems to make the baby look SMALLER than he is in person. This is not useful when I'm driving and can't keep my eyes on him for more than 2 seconds, after all, how long exactly should I have to stare into my rear view mirror to actually assertain how my child is doing?This product is barely worth the money. I could have propped up a hand mirror and probably had better luck. And the light, well it fades on and fades off almost before you even know it. Again, when driving and you are pressing a remote control, wouldn't it be great to just have the light turn on quickly so you can SEE while driving, instead of having to wait and then hopefully you aren't rear ending the car ahead of you waiting for the light to come on? Gimme a break.
