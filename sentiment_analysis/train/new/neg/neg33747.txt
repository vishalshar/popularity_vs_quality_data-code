I love the print on this bag and it does what it's supposed to.. it fits 5 diapers or so.. The closure on mine came off and I lost it.. then the string came out in the wash. I'm guessing that's why it was discontinued.. so it's pretty much useless to me now except for using at home. I'm sure I could repair it myself but if I wanted to make a bag I wouldn't have purchased one in the first place..
