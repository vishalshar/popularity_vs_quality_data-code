This monitor does have the ability to pick up a lot of sound which can give new parents peace of mind (i.e. I can hear the clock ticking in my daughters room through this thing). However, what I DISLIKE greatly about this product is that the range alarm will randomly go off for no reason when it states that it can go up to 300 feet. My receiver in the bedroom is probably a max of 50 feet away from the monitor end and the alarm will randomly go off but then reset itself. Also, it makes an obnoxious clicking sound even when on the voice activated mode. We have tried changing the channels several times but can't seem to get that to stop which is really irritating in the middle of the night because the noise will startle you awake for no reason when your child hasn't so much as stirred in their crib. Another problem when using the voice activated mode is that it sometimes cuts out when your child is crying so you cant tell if they are just starting to cry or if they are in a full blown wail. In summary this product does what it is supposed to do just probably not as well as it could.
