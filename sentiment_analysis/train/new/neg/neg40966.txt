So, this item does have several pros to it.  I chose to rate these a one star because of the biggest issue.  THEY LEAK EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!  I have a set of twins and needed something to warm their bottles.  I purchased 2 of the warmers and they both leaked.  Here are the con's and pro'sCONS:  THEY LEAK!!  I read the directions and did everything exactly as I was supposed to and nothing I did stopped them from leaking.  They leaked from day one.  I also used only filtered/purified water to warm my bottles and it still leaked.  I tried everything and they still leaked.PROS:  I did like the size of them, and really loved the turn dial timer.  The turn dial timer really is much better than the one where you push the button.  The push button was a pain and when you have to warm two bottles in a row, you have to wait for it to cool down.  The water reservoir was a nice option because you are filling it up like once a day instead of every time you warm a bottle up.  I do think because you have this option, this is the reason that it leaks.  The other biggest pro is dealing with Amazon.  I contacted them about the issues and they handled it quickly and professionally!  It is sooooo worth it to purchase items from Amazon and I try to purchase everything from them! LOVE YOU AMAZON!!All in all I would not recommend this item because of the leak issues.
