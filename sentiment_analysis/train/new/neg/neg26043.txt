First of all, this stroller was great right out of the box. Very little assembly required, everything was packaged nicely and arrived intact. The Eucalipto color I ordered was the same shade depicted on Amazon's site, so no surprise there.The stroller wheels very smoothly, and the stroller did not feel rickety at all. We tried only indoors over carpet and tile and had no issues at all. Very maneuverable. Handle height was also comfortable (I'm 5'5").The basket also seemed usable and easy to access.The included belly bar was wonderful.. soft, padded, and apparently tons of fun for my toddler. It was a cinch to snap in and take out. This part was very thoughtfully designed and executed.Ultimately though, I had to return this stroller for these reasons:1. My child is about 33" tall; her feet were very close to touching the wheels as we strolled along. The footrest was set a couple of inches too far back for her to comfortably rest her feet on it, so she ended up dangling her legs out in front. I kept wondering why she was sitting with her legs so far open though.. which leads me to...2. The harness buckle is very wide, and the included crotch strap was just too short. The end result is that when my toddler sat in the seat, the buckle ended up between her upper thighs, and it could not be moved/adjusted to where the hard plastic ends were not digging in and leaving marks. She was trying to avoid the buckle so much that she ended up trying to straddle it, which was probably why her feet were going to touch the wheels in the first place.So while my child loved the belly bar and the seat looked nice/cool/comfortable, the buckle on the harness ended up being the reason we could not use the stroller. I would give this overall 3.5 stars --  If a longer crotch strap were included, this would have been perfect for my needs. it may be great for children of different sizes, but it just did not work for my toddler.
