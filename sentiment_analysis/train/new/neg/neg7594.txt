Well, you get what you pay for, I suppose.  I looked for months for the perfect nautical themed bedding for our first child.  I was so pleased with the look of this product online and also when I got it home.  But when I washed it (a mother wants things clean for her child), the material pilled and shredded.  What a disappointment!
