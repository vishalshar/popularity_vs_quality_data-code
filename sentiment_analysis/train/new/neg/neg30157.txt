These are great for road trips however there seems to have been a change. I bought one of these a few years back and my son loved it. We make at least one road trip per year and we now have a second child so I got another one. The new tray looks exactly like the other one we have EXCEPT it does not have anything support in the bottom of the tray. The first one we bought (and still have) has something to stiffen the bottom of the tray but this one doesn't so if a child is driving cars or coloring on it it starts to sink down and curl up. That's pretty frustrating for a little kid and kind of defeats the purpose. I forsee some squabbles in my future over who gets the tray that doesn't fold up. :/
