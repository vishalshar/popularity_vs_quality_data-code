It's cute and cheap... but it's hard plastic and just not comfortable for a first time potty user. I think doubling it up into this whole "fun" toy thing is distracting for the child and they might not really understand what they are meant to do... (when they're young, obviously for an older child - who should be on the small side - they might get it.) So, if I would be able to go back in time... I would spend more $$ and buy something with a padded seat and nothing that forces the legs apart so the child can decide how to sit and what is comfortable. (I have a girl though, so I don't have to worry about "the guard" in the front.)
