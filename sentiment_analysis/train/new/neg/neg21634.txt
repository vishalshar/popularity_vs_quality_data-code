I ordered this to try to use with MAM pacifiers.Here's what I like about the Paci Plushie: It works with a MAM pacifier, it's cute, and the pacifier can detach from the bear so you can remove the pacifier to wash/sanitize.Here's what I don't like about it: It is an awkward angle. It doesn't rest on my son like the wubbanub does. The pacifier won't stay in his mouth because when the bear is laying flat, the pacifier is angled towards his chin. You can actually see this in the photo. I really wanted to like it because of the positives, but haven't been able to use it. I've tried with multiple pacifiers, including the Soothie, and they all end up at this weird angle.  I will try again as my son gets older (he's 4 months now). For now my son is attached to the Wubbanub and he likes it so much that he now takes Soothie pacifiers, which he originally refused and would only take a MAM.
