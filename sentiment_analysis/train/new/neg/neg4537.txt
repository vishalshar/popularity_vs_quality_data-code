Love these little hair bows for my baby girl! They are the perfect size-not too big, not too small. HOWEVER, the clip is just metal, it's not wrapped in fabric or anything like other bows we've bought. We haven't had any problems, but I'm careful of her with them because of the pointed metal clip. Also, the bow is actually two ends of the ribbon that just pull through the middle loop. My little girl has pulled the ends all the way out before. It's not easy, but you can pull them back through to fix it. I might use some glue on mine to hold it better. I love the price and the variety of colors is perfect. She has a bow for every outfit!
