We love the pull over bibs, They are convenient. However; we got a Bird, a butterfly, and a lady bug and the description says a lion, a crown, and a hippo. We called customer service to exchange them for the right ones and were informed that we would get the correct ones, but we got the same wrong designs on the bib. Now we have duplicates of the wrong designs. Oh well, they still work.
