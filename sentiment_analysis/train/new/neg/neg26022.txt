What they don't tell you is this: You know that annoying 2-beep thing the monitor does when you start it up? The one you can't disable? Well, guess what? The camera in your (sleeping) child's room ALSO makes that 2-beep noise when it's turned on. So, when you lose the signal between monitor and camera (which will happen frequently), and the only solution is to quietly make your way into your (sleeping) child's bedroom to reboot the camera, you WILL wake them up by turning the camera on and off again. BEEP BEEP! Think the solution is to just use batteries and take the camera out of the room to reset it? Think again: The camera sucked my 4 AAA batteries dry in about 2 hours the first day I got it. So don't count on the battery option.So sad this wasn't the video monitor I'd hoped it would be. The search continues...
