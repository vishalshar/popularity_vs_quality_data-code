We haven't had much luck with this, although my husband and I were really excited to try it. Here's what we've struggled with:- It's too big for a queen sized bed (or smaller).- The bottom is a bit flimsy compared to what we expected from the product photo. It doesn't lay flat on the bed and it tips when an adult moves on either side of the cosleeper.- The enclosed area is only about 22" long, and our baby was 21.5" to start; she'll outgrow this quickly.- The mattress makes a crinkly noise that disturbs the baby if she's sleeping lightly when we put her in, or if she stirs in her sleep.- It is not realistic to nurse without getting the baby out of the cosleeper. There's no comfortable way to manage that.- The light that comes with it is VERY bright; it's blinding to suddenly turn on in a dark room. The light is also pretty difficult to remove, it's really stuck in there.Despite these drawbacks, our daughter has napped a couple of times (one hour or less: in this thing, so I think for another baby it might work decently just because all babies are different. But for us, unfortunately, this thing spends most nights folded up in the corner of the bedroom.
