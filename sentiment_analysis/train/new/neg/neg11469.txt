These ducks were prizes for children to get them enthused about nursing. When I opened up the box I saw these small little ducks. I thought they were supposed to be bigger, but that could have been my misunderstanding. They are the exact same ones you can order out of oriental trading magazine and they were all scuffed looking. The coloring of the ducks bled into other colors and had marks on them. Luckily the children did not care. If you are giving these to children I think they would be ok but if you want to give them to adults that are nurses for something cute, I wouldn't advise it.
