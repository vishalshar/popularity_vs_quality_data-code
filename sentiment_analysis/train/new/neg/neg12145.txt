This toy seemed like a great deal for the money--the least expensive rocking horse out there.  There's a reason it's so inexpensive--it's cheap!!!  There are stickers which must be manually applied.  They're not that easy to line up and they are easily removed by a child, posing a choking hazard.  In addition, on more than one occasion, my son turned the horse upside down and attempted to mount it from the wrong angle.  The rungs on the bottom are spaced just closely enough together for a child to get a leg caught between.  They hold his leg very securely and he almost severely injured himself twice since he was unable to get his leg out on his own and twisted it badly.  It also left a large, red mark on his leg after we got him out.  He literally was unable to get out himself.  A toy made for such a small child should not have stickers that can be removed but, rather, molded, colored plastic.  I called Fisher Price about this toy and have asked them to seriously consider putting a recall on it.  It is very dangerous and we have since thrown ours away!!!
