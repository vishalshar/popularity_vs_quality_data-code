I love the way this mobile looks in person, the giraffe neck is inspired, but my sister had problems winding it. Luckily, she married my handy brother-in-law who was able to take it apart and tighten a loose part. I'm not sure if many devises will have this issue or if it would have been a problem to return it, just something to watch out for.
