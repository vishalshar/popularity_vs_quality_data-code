These sounded great.  I was excited when they arrived.  But they are not perfect.  The zipper is a great idea, but the nature of sewing the zipper leaves nooks at the ends where crumbs are hard to get out.  I searched high and low about the material used for the waterproof interior and could not find anything describing the material.  All I could find is what the material does not contain: BPA, phalate, lead, all those things that get parents running screaming, but there was nothing on what the material does contain.  So I finally contacted the company.  I got vague roundabout answers, and only got a definitive answer when I asked point blank if the material had polyutherane.  Yes, it has polyutherane.  I thought polyutherane was toxic and releases VOC's that are harmful to children.  Either I am wrong, or it explains why they would not say what the material is.  I wonder what other substances the lining contains that I don't know to ask about since the company isn't forthcoming about the make up of the lining.  But I still gave it 3 stars because I like the cotton exterior and fabric designs I got.  The baggies are easy to use and useful - though I wonder if I should continue to use for food.
