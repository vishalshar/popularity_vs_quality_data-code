Before I bought this sheet, I was confused and didn't know if the sheet went on the thin foam mattress that's included with the pack and play, or if I had to buy the separate, thicker mattress to go inside the pack and play. I didn't end up buying a separate pack and play mattress, I just used the thin foam one that was included. And, it's good to know that this sheet does fit on the thin pack and play mattress with one caveat- it is a tight fight and sometimes it causes the bottom of the pack and play to bunch up ever so slightly. Also, I believe that this sheet is very pricey for what it is, but unfortunately this is the only quilted pack n play sheet I can find on Amazon. I never put these in the dryer and I only wash in cold water so I didn't shrink them...both fit very snugly. An extra 1-2cm in the cut of the fabric would have made a big difference.. In a perfect would, this product would have more give and fit a little better, and also cost 30% less because my organic full size crib sheets cost less than this sheet. I do like the thickness of the material- it is about 3-4 times as thick as a regular sheet. Makes sleeping on the thin pack and play mattress bearable.
