My main criticism is that these shrank more than expected. The instructions say to wash 3-5 times on hot before first use, drying fully between each wash "to ensure shrinkage and proper absorbency". Fluff Love University's page on diaper prep says that's excessive and two hot washes with no drying in between is sufficient. I did three washes (the first was cold on accident) with no drying in between. They started out 14" wide x 15" long and are now 12" wide x12.5" long. With the caveat that this is my first attempt using prefolds and I am learning how to secure them, these seem too small. My 11 week old is 13lbs and these seem like they will be outgrown rapidly. There should be enough fabric to fold up the front when doing the angel wing fold but there is not on my baby (see photo). These theoretically should fit up to 20lbs based on the product description but I am guessing they won't fit past15lbs, similar to the comparable size of Oso Cozy Prefold.I do like the softness and so far they seem absorbent. In the photos I did an angel fold with a snappy and covered it with my Lilbit pocket diaper.
