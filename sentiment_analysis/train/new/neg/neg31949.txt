I ordered it for my second son and am disappointed with the quality of plastic that they have used for the baby tray...the fast action fold feature is good but already has so many scratches on the tray and the baby is still using the car seat attachment...also the handle material is very rough and doesn't give a good feel holding it...says its light wt but doesn't really feel that light...tip: spend some extra money and get a better quality product
