This is my 3rd naturepedic mattress. The 1st 2 were different models. I had to send the 1st back bc after a week, my newborn left a sink hole in the middle of the mattress. No flipping it, turning it,  putting the baby in different places, etc helped. I returned it and got another of that model, and it was slightly better, but not great. However, we didn't have the ability or time to take it back to the post office to return it, so we kept it and still have it, 2 years later. It does still have a sink hole in it, too, but my toddler doesn't care.I thought I'd get this model for my 2nd child. It's more expensive than the 1st one I got, but sadly, after 3 weeks of use, it too has the sink hole effect going on. For such expensive mattresses, these aren't holding up well.The reason the hole is a big deal is because my babies wiggle into it at night and I find them there with their heads lower than their bodies. This means more reflux, more spit up,  and uncomfortable babies, which equals increasingly tired parents.
