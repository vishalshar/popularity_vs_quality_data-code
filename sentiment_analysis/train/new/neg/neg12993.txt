this product fits my 20 lb 13 month old daughter and is adjustable to be a little bigger or smaller. it is kind of an uncomfortable looking harness though and very plain nearing unattractive. I hate to be negative because in all honesty the product does what it claims, I just personally don't like it. I didn't expect to love it, but it's a bit worse than I had hoped :) The leash is kind of like a handbag or purse handle and my daughter gets wrapped up in it trying to get the harness off because it is attached to both sides in the back. sure you could probably detach one side, but then she is attached at the side still not the center which makes me kind of uncomfortable. i will probably use this as a spare in my car, and buy a more expensive one like I should've done in the first place.
