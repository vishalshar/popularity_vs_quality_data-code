Too firm.. You get what you pay for. I went with this mattress because of the high reviews and the cheap price but ignored the bad reviews about the indentations. My baby has been in her crib since she was a newborn and we set her in the middle of the crib to sleep. I noticed the indentation after 3 weeks. It didn't bother me at the time but now she's 5 months old and has been rolling over and waking on her belly. She wakes up crying because she can't get comfortable and it's probably not safe because the indentation is so bad now. Spend the extra money for a mattress that will last longer.
