We have the Select A Show Soother for our daughter...  we LOVE that one, but thought we would try this one for our son so that we did not have two of the same thing.  Our biggest issues with this one are - it is WAY too loud even on the lowest volume setting, it does NOT balance well on its side (it will stay that way, but is easily knocked over if it is just slightly bumped while pushing the button to start it), the "light show" does not move, and the music does not last long enough.  The extra 3 minutes with the Select A Show (12min vs 15min) makes a HUGE difference.
