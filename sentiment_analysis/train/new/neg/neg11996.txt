I was mislead in thinking this was a better quality wood then what you actually get. I don't think it is real wood, as it seems more like the fake wood that gets painted / stained over somehow. There are tiny lines that look kinda like cracks in the finish that look like they were painted over. Also, the little cubby areas for lotions and such are a little smaller than I imagined from the picture. I still like the idea of having items up on the wall away from baby (and our dog) next to the changing table. If this product was not so expensive I think I would have rated it higher.
