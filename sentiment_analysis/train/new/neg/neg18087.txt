I really think this toilet has a cute design & a nice concept, but if your a first time mom or dad looking for a potty. I will tell,you right now the best & most economical way to potty train is just buy a fun character potty seat that attaches to your normal toilet. I am a first time mom & with not having too much experience with potty training. I purchased this item. It did not help my son & he quickly figured out how to make it sing & give reward stickers without doing his business. So it quickly became like a toy for him & not a toilet. I finally got him a cars potty seat that attaches to a regular toilet & now hes interested in using the big boy potty. Save your money as your child will quickly outgrow the size of this potty.
