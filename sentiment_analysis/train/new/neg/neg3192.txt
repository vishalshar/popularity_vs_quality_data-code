I loved the squeeze station!!!! It's easy to use and to clean. However, the pouches are terrible after one use. They are not easy to clean at all. And since they are not clear at all, you can't see inside them to make sure you got everything. I tried using a small brush, boiling them, swishing hot soapy water in them, and they still smell like food after they dry. I wanted the reusable pouches for economic reasons, but they don't seem the least bit sanitary.
