Well, *I* like them.  I actually bought them because my bf was staying over and he insists that he *needs* a new fresh washcloth whenever he showers, creating the Great Washcloth Shortage of 2013.  As such I went searching for supplemental washing instruments.  The fact that they appear to be for babies was of no matter to me.  I just assumed they would be softer and nicer than a regular washcloth.  The only thing I don't like about them is that water tends to bead on them at first, but once they are wet they are fine.  My personal rating of this item is 4/5 stars.  The bf hated them.He claims they're too small, and they are definitely smaller than many washcloths.  He also seems to interpret them as flimsy, I think just because they're soft and thin.  None of these washcloths have fallen apart on me yet.  Still, I'm pretty sure if he could he would give these washcloths a 0/5.TL;DR- If you're looking for a cheap, soft, little washcloth here is your answer.  If you're looking for a big, beefy, scrub yourself violently until all your skin is pink washcloth then look elsewhere.
