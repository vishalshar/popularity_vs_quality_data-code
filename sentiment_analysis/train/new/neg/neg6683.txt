My daughter, aged 10, got a Lenovo idea 7" for Christmas and needed a case. Although the entry states it is for the Lenovo--it is not. It does fit excellent on the Lenovo pad, BUT the camera holes are covered by case, the power on/off button is covered, and it must sit upside down in the case just to expose the charging socket.In otherwords, she loves the color, it does a great job of standing up for movie watching, etc, it holds the product well, BUT it is missing all of the specific holes for the Lenovo 7" pad.You really must decide what is important. We chose this one because of color and price. We are dissappointed that it really doesn't work well for simplicity. But it was cheaper than the $40 Lenovo black cover that would have fit perfectly at Office Depot!
