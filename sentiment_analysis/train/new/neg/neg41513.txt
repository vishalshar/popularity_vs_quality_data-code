On the third time I used this with the leash it broke. The ring u hook the leash to broke in half n my son ran off. Luckily not into traffic... Or the river since we were camping. Not only did it break but the pocket on the backpack is so small. You can barely put ur hand in it let alone toys or drinks. Not impressed.
