I will start of my saying that I LOVE the Playtex sippy cups and those are the only ones that my daughter uses.  I am only giving these 2 stars however because they are the cheapest looking sippy cups that I have ever seen from Playtex.  The sippy cup itself does what it is supposed to do but I bought these because they were girly and said Disney Princess... The Disney Princesses have almost all washed or scrapped off. Even before that started to happen, the Princesses are nasty.  It looks like the image was just slapped on the cup without worrying about the placement of the sticker.  The Princesses are printed on the outside sleeve of the sippy cup instead of the inside where perhaps the images would have more protection...  I am still using these cups but only in our house.
