We bought these for our daughter's room, to go with her Sweet Jojo Designs "Butterfly Pink and Purple" quilt and sheets.  The decals are really cute and match perfectly but I'm disappointed that they start to peel off the walls over time.  We've used other removable wall decals before and never had a problem (even after moving them several times), but it seems like every time I go in her room, I'm rubbing the endges of some of these to get them stuck to the wall again.They're cute and the matched the other Sweet Jojo products we have but it's hard to say if I'd buy them again or just go without, as often as the edges peel off the walls.
