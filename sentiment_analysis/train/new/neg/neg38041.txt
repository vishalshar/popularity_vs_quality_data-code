Stay away from this bed. I've purchased two for my kids who are average size and they both sag in the middle.  One mattress is only 1.5 years old because I the company replaced it after only a few months due to sagging. Guess what - it developed the same sag in the middle again and got deeper with size. I am now shopping for a sturdier crib mattress for my 2 year old. I think I am going for the Serta deluxe 240 spring with two sides. In the photo I have gently placed my hand to hold down all of the puffy loose fabric of the mattress to show the size of the depression. Otherwise the loose fabric would make it look like there was no crater.
