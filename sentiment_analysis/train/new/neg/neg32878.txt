I usually never drop this kind of money on something like this for a baby, but out of sheer desperation with twins, we bought this with high hopes it would soothe them at night.  I wouldn't say there were all that impressed with it.  We started using it around 4 months and went until about 8 months.  After all that time, I wasn't convinced it made much of a difference and I got sick of changing the batteries constantly!  While I hate using regular alkaline batteries, it's what we did because rechargeables drain even faster.  Even still, I was just blowing through our Costco-sized pack of batteries and retired this poor turtle.The light effects are definitely beautiful and soothing (and I like there is the ability to adjust light intensity), but I just could not justify the annoyance of late-night battery changes and felt my kids were better off without this.
