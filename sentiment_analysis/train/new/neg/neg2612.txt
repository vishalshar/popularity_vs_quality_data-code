The mirror comes with two different methods of attachment - suction cup or clip onto the visor.  I am using the suction cup and it seems to be sticking very well, though I've only had it up for a few days so far.  However, the image it gives me of the back seat is incredibly small, much smaller than my regular rear view mirror.  I'll be able to see general motion and that's about it.  I guess this is a side effect of the wide view but I don't need to monitor three kids, just one, so it doesn't need to be wide.  There is also a small amount of distortion, right above the center of the mirror, which is annoying.If I can find the packaging I'm going to return it, but I may have already discarded some or all of it.
