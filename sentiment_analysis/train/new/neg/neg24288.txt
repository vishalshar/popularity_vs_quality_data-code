I really want to like this.... But I don't. It folds up nicely in its travel case and is cushy and comfortable seeming; but, when you use it for a child, the weight of a child (my son weighs 22lbs) pushes the seat inwards as if it is going to collapse into the toilet. I originally thought maybe the problem was using it on an elongated toilet seat, but, after trying to use it on a standard sized seat at church I had the same problem... ðŸ˜ž I tried to take a picture of the problem but it's hard to tell in the picture how much it sinks into the toilet. I wish it had turned out as good as it seemed!
