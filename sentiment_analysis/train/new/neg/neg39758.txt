I bought this in November for my daughter born in December. She's slept exclusively in this so far and will continue to do so until she moves to her crib. I love how lightweight, easy to take down, and put back up it is. It's very easy to move from our bedroom to living room everyday so my daughter can always be on whatever level I am while cleaning and she's napping. The feature to allow it to rock or not rock is great. The height, width, and length are also great. I like that the sides are mesh so when she sleeps on her side and gets in that position while sleeping I know if she would roll and roll again and be against the side she'd be safe.The only negative about this product is the pad. The pad makes it not worth the retail price. It's very thin to start with, but does offer enough support. However, if you need to wash the pad for any reason (diaper blow outs for instance) you run into a problem. With each wash the pad gets thinner and shrinks. Even if you use cold water and don't put it in the dryer. Our pad is now too short for the bassinet. The pad velcros to the bottom so it still stays in place, but it doesn't reach the top and bottom of the bassinet. I bought separate bassinet sheets (even though it is advised not to for safety reasons, but I made sure they fit well and can't come off) and changing pads to put over the pad so that if my daughter leaks through her diaper during the middle of the night she'll soak the sheet and the changing pad first. We're still seeing that she sometimes soaks to the bassinet pad, but not as much. I don't want to wash it anymore because I don't want it to continue to shrink.If purchasing this product I would buy sheets that fit the mattress and make sure to always protect the mattress pad. My daughter doesn't even soak through her diaper every night, but she's done it enough to ruin the mattress pad. It's been washed maybe 7 or 8 times on the gentle cycle and air dried and is in terrible condition.
