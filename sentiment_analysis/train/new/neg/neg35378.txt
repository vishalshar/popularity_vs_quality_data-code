I had purchased the Universal because I have a twin slat bed with full bed frame. As this rail folds down at a higher point than regular rails, I thought it might work. And that is the only good feature in this rail.First of all, it only works if you have solid bottom not slats. The width of the rail made it so the legs did not align with the slats.Second, the thickness of the plastic hinges made it very hard to fit the mattress back into place. The mattress stabilizer bar is square which is a bruising hazard. I did not really care if the side did not fold down all the way, but the thickness/bulkiness of the plastic on the hinged legs and the mattress stabilizer bar prevents the rail to stay horizontal against the mattress.Third, all of these unfortunate features are going to make it hell to change the sheets.
