Okay, this is the worst bottle we have, and it was the most expensive of all!1st - the milk flow is too excessive so the milk goes out of our baby's nose2nd - no way to mix the formula without leaking = both hands & the bottle are covered with the formula at the end.3rd - no way for a baby to eat without leaking the formula everywhere - dirtying baby's clothes, face - everything around the bottle!4th - it is too hard to measure the amount of water because the numbers of measurements on the bottle are almost invisible5th  -I was thinking maybe to use the bottle for a tea because it doesn't require for us to measure exact amount of water to make the mixture - but since it leaks when the baby drinks - we cannot even use it that way6th - I thought - well okay, maybe I can use it as a bottle for water when riding a bike - but with that much leaking I believe that's not an option neither.SincerelyWife of Amazon user whose name is written above.
