I have an older version of this stroller and it has been through two kids now. It is beautiful and I love being able to switch directions. You just want to keep in mind that the wheels facing front are the ones that should swivel. I would suggest testing it out it at a high end baby store such as Belini so someone can show you all the tricks, IF you MUST buy it. My BIG problem with it has to do with the Peg Perego company itself, as stated by a previous reviewer (check out the Peg Perego, Primma Pappa high chair to see more comments on Peg Perego items). I feel like the company makes a ton of money and therefore isn't into customer service. My older version had folding release mechanism problems, that the company admitted to. They kindly SOLD me expensive parts for what was THEIR design flaw. Installing these parts was a nightmare. They should follow the example of high end stores such as LL Bean who back their prodcut one hundred percent. I am never going to buy Peg Perego again as their product has snob appeal and little else. It's a lot of money for shoddy merchandise. Check out Combi!! Classy, sturdy and high end with pretty colors.
