This bidet is not worth $190.  My handheld bidet at $35 (newer model is $60 but has a stronger hose) is a much better choice and less expensive.  The BB-300 has pressure and temperature settings that are not very useful.  The sprayer has a splash shield and mounts under the seat.  Unfortunately this did not fit well in my round bowl and fecal matter 'collected' on the splash shield.  This fit up was worse when I had to replace my seat.  I chose a slow closing seat and the BB-300 caused additional problems (e.g. seat would not come down all the way with the BB-300 installed).  With the BB-300 you have to do the bidet dance with you bum to effectively clean your backside.  With my handheld no 'dance' is required.  I eventually disconnected it and it is now a $190 shelf next to my toilet.
