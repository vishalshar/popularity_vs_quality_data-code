I ordered this quite a while ago for our 2 year old son. I have yet to *really* find what we're looking for, but this is close.  What we really would like is a little lunch box/tray with fully contained separate compartments so that none of the foods get mixed together, even if they are liquid/runny (like yogurt).  This tray is *almost* there.  If you are only putting dry food in each compartment, then the food stays separate no problem, but you can't put yogurt in the yellow portion of the tray without it leaking into another compartment.The green dip portion of the tray is nice, I like that you can freeze it to keep the dips cold, but I'm always nervous that if we put this into my sons backpack any other way than flat, it will leak.The compartment sizes are pretty small but I think appropriate for a child 2 and under for a meal, or an older child for a decent to sized snack.  To give you an idea, the last time I packed it I was able to fit:Fruit - about 5 grapesCheese - maybe an ounce of cheese, sliced into  little sticksGrains: 1/8 cup wheat chex cerealMeat - chopped up slice or two of deli turkeyVeggies:  about 2 carrot sticks and 2 celery sticksThat random compartment that has a little smiling sun on it:  about 1/8 cup craisins.Plus the dip.Overall, I probably would not buy this again unless they make some changes.  I will keep looking for a product that has fully closing compartments so I don't have to worry about just throwing it in his bag.
