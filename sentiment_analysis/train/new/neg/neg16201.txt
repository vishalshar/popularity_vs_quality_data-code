If you're potty training and need something on the go, it works pretty well.  It isn't hard to set up, and while it's low to the ground, it's not too much lower than a regular potty chair.  The bags it comes with are very durable, but the instructions suggest after those are used up, you should use any plastic bag.  Beware - plastic bags from grocery stores fit well, but often have holes in them.  So make sure you check for holes or set it up where leaks aren't a problem.  My favorite part is the removable seat on top, which is great for trips to public restrooms.  I keep it in my diaper bag all the time.  It's light and fairly compact.
