GEENNY wall border was a complete waste of my money. I was so happy when I put it in the nursery only to find the next day it had fallen off the wall and could not be fixed. It does not stick! I'm getting ready for a baby here and I don't appreciate spending money for nothing. So of course i contact the company and they take the good old time getting back to me. Im told of a refund that has never happened. I bought this in may 12' it is now december. No refund! And they have nerve to ask me to take my review down. Get real! I want my money back and then ill consider removing this.
