These seem great- until you receive them. They are SUPER small. They might hold 1 tablespoon full of food. I cannot image any mom being happy with these. For my 7 month old- I would have to have three or four per meal time! I had to keep handing him a new one every time he finshed the food in one. It was like a never ending assembly line. I specifically bought these to help him learn to feed himself, and allow me time to cook our dinner, while he ate. Well, thats impossible if you are having to keep re-filling them with food. Complete waste of money.
