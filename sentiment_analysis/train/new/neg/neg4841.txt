We purchased these gates after being pleased with the purchase of some other Summer Infant products.  I am an experienced carpenter and installed these gates exactly per the instructions.  The latch mechanism of this gate is a fundamentally bad design.  First, the latch really can't be operated with one hand-- you need one to press the latch lever at the same time you need to use the other hand to lift up the gate at the hinge side (using a significant amount of force).  The gate is also very loud when it closes-- you need to use a lot of force to engage the latch.  Not a good design if you are carrying a baby or have a sleeping baby around.
