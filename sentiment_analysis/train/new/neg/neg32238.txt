I ordered two sets expecting to receive exactly what is pictured.  Highly disappointed when I opened the box and what I received was not at all what is shown in the picture! I was expecting a sports theme (with balls as pictured) Instead I received an ugly blue and white striped sheet set.  NO SPORTS THEME!  The second sports bedding set came with a comforter and no sheets! I did notify the seller immediately and did receive a quick response with a return postage label.  I am still awaiting a refund.
