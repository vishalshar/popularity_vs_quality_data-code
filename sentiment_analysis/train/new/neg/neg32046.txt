Hamilton Beach has started us all down the slippery slope by using "mist" in the name of a non-ultrasonic humidifier. That's already alarming, but I already knew this was a filter-type. (Rest assured, by the time the filter's grungy, the only available replacement filters will be for newer models with slightly different filter dimensions.) Reviews indicated this unit is reasonably quiet, but like most import units, it has a small, overworked fan that makes lots of turbulence, and therefore lots of noise. On the flip side, that urgent little fan does move quite a bit of air, and the unit is built very solidly. Even so, if I had it to do over again, I'd spend a little more for a fanless model.
