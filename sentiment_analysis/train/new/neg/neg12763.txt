I REALLY wanted to like this pregnancy pillow. I'm 30 weeks pregnant and have been having a miserable time in bed for weeks. Unfortunately I've had no success using a body pillow and most advertised "pregnancy pillows" are huge and overpriced. So, I thought this would give me support to my belly and back and be smaller and cheaper than the others. First of all, it is small. It's tiny. A couple pieces of material with a little stuffing and a piece of Velcro. Definitely not worth 40 bucks. You can adjust it to your width so it puts the stuffing under your belly and back, that's it. Nothing to your hips so if you get hip pain, this will not help. Unfortunately, it's just too pathetic to offer anything helpful. think the only thing it did for me was keep me from rolling onto my back. It is also nice you don't have to adjust it when you turn. However, it just does not offer good support. The first night I thought maybe it helped my belly (though did nothing for my back or hips) but after 3 nights, I realized I was waking up more sore than I did initially. It shoves into your back and belly and not in a good, supportive way. I practically feel bruised in these areas after using this for those 3 nights. A nap on the fourth day had me ripping it out from underneath me because it made things so much worse. I think it's worth looking into the more expensive and bigger pregnancy pillows and avoiding this one. Too bad.
