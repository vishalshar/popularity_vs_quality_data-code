The pram was damaged, two holes( almost like cigarette burns to the netting for the storage below. This was very disappointing but considering that my baby was due soon after the arrival of the pram we didn't want the hassle of sending the pram back and being without one.It would be really nice if we could have a replacement netting sent to us. I will no longer be buying products through amazon.I also have photos of the damage.
