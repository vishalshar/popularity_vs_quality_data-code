I was extremely disappointed when I bought these bowls. A friend recommended them to me and I even used them at her house for my toddler and thought they were great then, but ever since I bought them though, the food you eat out of them either tastes like plastic, soap, or soapy plastic. No wonder my toddler wouldn't eat the food in her bowl! I don't plan on using these bowls ever again. I am really disappointed.
