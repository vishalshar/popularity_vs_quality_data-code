This is actually a two part item. One part attaches to the crib as a mirror for baby to look at, and one part stays outside the crib to play music and to project scenes on the ceiling. The music selection is very interesting, and is quite varied. I do like the choices included in the music box. However, the light projection is very one dimensional (not literally), in that it doesn't change or vary much. I guess I was expecting more, and perhaps baby won't care. Truthfully, I have not tried it out on my 6 month grandson, as I bought this one and a mobile which he did like and fell asleep with when he was visiting. I will be using it shortly.  The description mentions that baby can explore the soother (music box) but I don't think that is a very good idea for many reasons!
