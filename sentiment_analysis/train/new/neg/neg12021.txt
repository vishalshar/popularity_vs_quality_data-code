it's an ok product. on the plus - nice, vivid colors, easy to put on and take off (two velcros on each side), I would say pretty entertaining for the baby. on the minus: pretty stiff, you cannot bend it, to adjust to various widths of the stroller handle without it being literally in the baby's eyes. I wish the mirror was in the middle and not on the side, so the baby can see himself in it. the music starts whenever you barely touch the middle toy and there is no way you can stop it (or, if there is, I couldn't find it - which would mean my IQ has seriously dropped) - and that has been an inconvenience several times when the baby fell asleep.
