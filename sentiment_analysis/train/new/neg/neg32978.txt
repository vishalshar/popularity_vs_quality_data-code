I ordered a two pack of these after deciding I didn't like the Nuby dispenser (too difficult to twist to each section as well as pull off the lid to refill/wash - it's like it was too smooth).  I like the ease of turning the dispenser to each section.  However, the cap won't stay closed on one of my containers and the other arrived cracked down the side which makes the main lid spin around and around without stopping at the designated points.  Not the fault of Munchkin, but it makes me question how long the container will survive regular use.  Things happen - diaper bags get squished, containers get dropped on the floor on their way from the dishwasher to the cabinet - it just seems like it's a bit too fragile of a container.  I really needed a two pack, too since I have twins.  So I think I'm better off just packing a small can of formula in my bag and using a scoop like I would at home.
