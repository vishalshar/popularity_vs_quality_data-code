They work exactly as they should for blocking pee.  I have actually only been "saved" once by using these, as our twin boys just seem to not pee during changes anymore after I started using them.  I think that is because they also work by keeping that part of the anatomy covered up and away from cold air, keeping the baby from peeing in the first place.  Either way, they will keep you from being peed on.  I only gave three stars as they are pretty low quality.  After washing just a few times, they are already coming apart.  They are also a little different in material than I expected, more like a conical sock.
