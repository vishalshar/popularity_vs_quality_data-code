Great concept, but boy is this thing loud. It doesn't have auto shut off either, so it's not like I can turn it on, go to another room while it air dries the bottles and have it shut off to conserve battery. think of an electric shaver going in your kitchen. No wonder why it got discontinued. at 6 dollars, I'll keep it, but I'm sure these things were being returned left and right. I don't think it would have cost them much more to get a quieter motor in there honestly. I also don't understand how it passed a design phase. Did nobody realize this thing was loud as heck?!
