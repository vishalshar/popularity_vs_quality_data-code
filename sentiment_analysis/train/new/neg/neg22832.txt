This review is for the brown "Snugglesaurus" blanket. While it is very soft and cute, I have experienced a very annoying problem with this blanket: it is good for 2-3 washes, then it gradually starts to shed onto all your baby's clothes! Lint screen won't do a thing, and neither do fabric softener sheets - it sheds, sheds, SHEDS more than a German Shepard! I had to toss it when baby was 8 months old because there is hardly any blanket left (it thinned out A LOT) and many of her clothes have this stubborn brown lint on them that is so hard to remove I have given up (lint roller doesn't work). This happened with fairly light use: we washed it once or twice a month as we only used it in her infant carrier.If you do decide to get it make sure you wash this separately from everything else, but beware that even out of the washer/dryer it will shed lint onto your baby's stuff. It's ruined quite a few of my baby's lighter pajamas because I can't stand all these little brown lint dots all over them, they look worn and dirty. This is one purchase I completely regret!
