I purchased this for a shower prize. It was really cute and it looked nice in the box. I ended up winning it at the shower so I put it to the test. It broke on the second scoop of ice cream. I would say that this would work better for tea, coffee or sugar. I would purchase it again, since it makes a cute gift but I would warn the receiver of it's limitations.
