Disclaimer: the cups didn't fit me well, and in the end, I returned the pump to Dr Brown's directly. Their customer service is fantastic, and they are very kind and helpful.Pros:The pump itself was a decent size, and had very powerful suction. If the molded cups would have fit me, I am sure it would have been a very comfortable pump to use. FYI, the cups are 24mm, and that's the only size available. The travel bag seemed very practical (although I never used it). If anything was wrong with the pump or if pieces were missing, customer service was quick to courier new pieces, free of charge. That said...Cons:My pump failed on me a couple of weeks in. It would still make clicky noises, but it wasn't making any suction noises, or sucking at all. I called in right away and they promised to send me a new one, and I could return the broken one free of charge. However, I was without a pump for those days, which was bad for my already low supply.It is hard to wash all the pieces involved, and it is a bit finicky to put together.If you don't put the bottles on the stands when the cables are connected, it WILL fall over and all your hard work will be gone. Talk about crying over spilled milk :(It is LOUD. Not like you can't have a conversation over the noise, but it will wake baby up if you start pumping if she's asleep nearby. It's a "CLICKETY click foooomp, CLICKETY click fooomp" kind of noise. The only other pump I've used is the hospital grade Medela Symphony, and that was almost silent.All in all, I don't know if I can recommend it, as it didn't work for me. If you know it'll fit, it's definitely a different experience from using the hard cups. Everyone at customer service is super friendly, and they'll send you things, even to Canada.
