Ok so, first off, practice with plain water over the sink a few times before you actually need this or you will waste a LOT of formula. Secondly, the "99% of water bottles" is a lie. This works ONLY on bottles that have the same neck + cap as standard soda bottles, and even then, some may be more difficult than others. The ones with low-profile caps or narrower/wider necks are hopeless. That said, once you have learned how to identify brands it works on and mastered the trick of not crossthreading it, the Flipple is a useful little device to keep around.P.S. DO NOT use on anything carbonated. I would never give a small child soda, but in my frustration I was trying every plastic bottle in the house. It went on just fine to a 2 liter bottle of Dr. Pepper, but when I inverted it to check for leaks, the soda started violently spraying out of the nipple all over my kitchen. Haha. Learn from my mistakes.
