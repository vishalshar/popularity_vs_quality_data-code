I use to love these cups. They really don't leak and were well insulated. I could put my toddler grandson to bed with milk and it would still be cold or at least not sour in the morning.I noticed a difference in these I ordered. First thing I noticed is that some of the decals are on the outside and get scratched off when you wash them making the cup look tacky.The real problem is the insulation I don't think there is any. Milk goes sour in them in just a few hours.The only thing good about them is they don't leak.Now I'm in search of a good cup cause this one doesn't cut the mustard anymore. For the life of me I will never understand why when a company has a winner they have to change things and screw it all up. If it ain't broke don't fix it!EDIT: Have shopped around and tried others and I will be back to purchase more of these. Even with them not being as good as they use to be they are still better than anything out there! Grandson loves Nemo so these will be the choice again.
