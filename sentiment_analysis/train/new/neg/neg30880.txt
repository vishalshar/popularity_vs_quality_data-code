Don't know why this is advertised to be a "non-skid bottom" since it's really just a thin piece of fabric that still skids across a dress or table top. I'm still going to have to add some velcro to the bottom to ensure it doesn't really skid. Would advise parents just purchase whatever is at their local baby store rather than looking for this specific one since it's just the same as every other changing pad out there.
