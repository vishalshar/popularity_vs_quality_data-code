We got this seat about a year ago for our son.  The concept is great and has worked pretty well, however, there is one major fault....my husband hates it!  When you put the entire seat up for the guys to urinate, it does not stay up on it's own!  He has to hold it up while he is urniating or else the seat comes crashing down.  So, needless to say we will be getting rid of it soon.  Also, my son often complains that it hurts his rear end when he is sitting on it longer than a few minutes.  I wouldn't recommend this product if you have a man living in your house unless you want to annoy him on purpose.  :)
