This bed rail did fit in the platform bed as I'd hoped - as far as I can tell, it's one of the only bed rails made for platform beds.  However, it is a little taller than I think it needs to be, making my 4yo's twin bed seem almost like just another crib.  And it wobbles a bit - meaning, it doesn't stay firmly upright; I can pull on it with barely any pressure, and create a gap between the rail and the bed of 4-6 inches.  I don't think my child runs any risk of falling into this gap, but I do worry that if he and his brother are playing a little too roughly in their room, one of them may pull on it too hard and break it. I also wish that the wood was finished, instead of unfinished.  Even if they offered one or two finish options, I'd rather buy a bedrail that doesn't quite match the bed, than have to go through the hassle of staining the bedrail to match. Overall, it's an okay bed rail, and really one of the only options for a platform bed.
