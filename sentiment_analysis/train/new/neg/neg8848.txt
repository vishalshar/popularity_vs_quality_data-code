This will not properly go on my 1999 Chevy Camaro.  This is more for regular type rearview mirror.  my camaro has lamp combired with the mirror which makes it bulkier and makes it slide/pop off.  But I was able to have it attached with additional wide angle mirror that I have.  It works ok but think of low def.  Compared to your mirror, well think of your rearview mirror as high def then this will be regualr tube tv...from the 70's.  You won't see the detail of tattoo your kid has but you'll see that he has a tattoo...or a smudge.  I do like it that it goes behind your mirror so it doesn't obstruct your rearview mirror.I'd give 5 stars if they made better mirror.
