This cover fits great around our Chicco Keyfit 30 infant car seat. It works really well to keep the wind out and the flap stays nicely put whether closed or open. We supplement the cover by tucking a small blanket around baby's lap to keep his feet and legs warm, leaving his hands exposed to the cover only, but whenever I check on him to see if he's cold, his hands feel warm to the touch. What's disappointing about this product is the zippers. They are just not good quality. Within a few weeks of purchasing, they would regularly get stuck even though there was no material caught in it. When we would drop him off at family's house, they would also comment on how problematic the zippers were. Then about two months into owning this product, the right zipper flew off completely. I was able to get it back on, but it has now come off again and I can't get it back on. It's really disappointing because I thought it did such a good job at keeping baby warm, but I'm hesitant to buy this same cover again.
