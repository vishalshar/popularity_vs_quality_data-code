It took me over 3 hours to try to get one screw in and still couldn't get it.  Besides that, it had a snack tray attached that couldn't come off.  I HATE those things.  What purpose do they serve.  I just went to the church and got back the one I had put there for my special needs girl to use for feeding and brought it home instead--why have two high chairs you hate, when you already own one.
