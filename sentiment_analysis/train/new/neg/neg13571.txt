Sadly, the release mechanism on this stroller has never worked as it's supposed to and from reading other reviews I can see that it's not just my particular stroller. This is frustrating as it means I have to set the car seat down next to the stroller and use both hands to try and get the stroller to open/close. Still, once it releases it works well and is a compact and comparatively light stroller. Other snap-n-go type universal car seat carrier strollers don't feel as secure whereas this one makes two nice audible clicks to let you know that the carseat is secure in it. Its weight is great if you are recovering from a c-section or live up stairs. I find the storage beneath the stroller to be adequate and comparable to my much larger citi mini GT stroller. This stroller doesn't give the smoothest ride but that's not really what it is intended for and it does fabulously indoors and along smooth sidewalks. Rutted sidewalks lead to a pretty bumpy ride but it's do-able with this stroller. If they fixed the release mechanism I'd bump this up to 4 stars but for its price it's frustrating to have to struggle with opening/closing it every day. If your handle release doesn't work, like mine, and you don't want the hassle of returning this stroller, you can use the slider things on either side just below the cupholder bar- pulling those up will allow you to collapse the stroller but this takes 2 hands and can be a bit finnicky.
