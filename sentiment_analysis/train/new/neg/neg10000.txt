This is a nice little snack cup that's super easy to toss in my purse for my 18 month old son.  The only problem is that if he happens to drop it on the ground, the lid ALWAYS pops off and then the entire contents end up all over the car, store, or ground.  Then I'm left with a mess to clean up and a crying toddler because the snack is all gone.  I still use it because I like it's small size and that it has an attached lid but I wish I could find something a bit better.
