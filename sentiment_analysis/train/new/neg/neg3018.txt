The price of this wrap attracted me to it but unfortunately I ended up returning it. The material is very coarse and not soft. I know people say they get softer with washings but in my opinion it should ARRIVE much softer than this. There is also no tag to mark the center...ANNOYING. That is like a hallmark of every wrap, and they skimped by not putting one on. The fringe is unnecessary, and I found it to also be annoying. The photo does not accurately depict the color of the wrap. It is much more vibrant. Some may like that, but I was hoping for more subdued colors.
