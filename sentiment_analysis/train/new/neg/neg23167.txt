I was excited to buy this based on the reviews but was disappointed when it came out of the box. The fabric/plastic on it is very loose and not fitted to the pad itself making it awkward and unsightly. As a result, my cover that I put on it doesn't look fitted and looks messy. I know this is not a big deal for some, but I expected it to look nicer and actually look like the pad and its cover are meant to be together. It looks NOTHING like the photo displayed. Ill keep it of course, because of the inconvenience of sending it back, but we are not happy with it.
