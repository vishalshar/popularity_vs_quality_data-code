I'm an active Dad who runs and have a wife that's always on the go with 3 kids. This stroller is perfect for someone who wants to take it shopping or walking in the neighborhood, this is not the stroller for jogging and barely lasted us past the warranty. Im a DIY guy and was able to fix the stroller for now but its not built to last and we will be buying a real jogging stroller now.For everyday use this stroller is easier to maneuver and provides a better ride than other types but it can be difficult to close. The seat back must be lowered completely or it will not collapse correctly, which can be difficult unless your empty handed. The front wheel is lockable and MUST BE locked straight unless your going less than 3 mph! It will SHAKE the stroller violently like a bad shopping cart wheel but this wheel is 5X bigger, so its worse. Don't buy for jogging , its impossible to drive in a straight line because its front wheel is pointed slightly to one side (the most complained about defect) and with the wheel locked straight that makes jogging almost impossible. There are many other accounts of this in other reviews, unfortunately I read these after our purchase when we started having issues. This week on vacation to Disney the front wheel seized and stopped the stroller completely in the middle of the park and we have only had this stroller for less than a year.Pros- Cost, better than an "umbrella stroller" , nice for shopping or walkingCons - Broken in less than a year, No brakes for jogging, wont track a straight line, hard to collapse, 180 day warranty, Shakes horribly on anything other than pavement.
