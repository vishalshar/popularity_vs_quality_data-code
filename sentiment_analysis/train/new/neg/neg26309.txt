I wanted this SO bad. After using it w/just the stroller (not the bassinet) I wish I didn't spend the money.  While it works great, looks amazing, great ride and control when pushed (and great for tall parents), it is very difficult to assemble and disassemble to put into the car.  I feel unsafe alone at night w/the baby trying to get this into the trunk bc it takes too much time to break down. AND IT TAKES UP A TON OF ROOM in the trunk. Not much room for anything else, and that is in a mid-sized SUV. My son is not yet 2 1/2 and he barley fits in it, although he is on the taller side (38 inch tall).
