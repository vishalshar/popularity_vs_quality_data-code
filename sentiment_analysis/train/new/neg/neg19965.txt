Don't make my mistake and snip the black string in the front when unpacking this toy.  The string attaches the key to the toy and isn't part of the packaging.To the person who thinks it doesn't turn off--it does; the key is the power switch that shuts off the sounds.Not super impressed.  Was trying to replace an old similar toy that died--the old one had more fun stuff.
