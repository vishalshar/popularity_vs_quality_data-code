The safety harness on this chair is a pain to operate. It's a big hassle fixing it every time I put my daughter on this chair. The clip keeps getting stuck/locked under the seat. Poor design.I haven't used this in the forward position so can't comment if it's better in that direction, but rear-facing, lots of issues...Also, I was hoping my daughter's head wouldn't wall forward and the side pieces will hold her when she falls asleep; incorrect assumption.
