I love the look and style of this PnP, however, don't be in a rush to put it together, there are lots of extras that take some figuring out, due to the lack of good instructions.The pad for the bottom of both layers is so hard, but this is a complaint I have with all PnP's.One of the reasons I choose this one, was the changing station; however, they need a "REAL MOM's" help in a re-design...the holders are odd, it should hold a whole refill pkg of wipes, and there's no safety strap. I have a 6 mth old that grabs the edge, and pulls herself almost over the edge while I reach for a diaper. So keep your hand on them at all times while changing!My biggest frustration with it is the canopy...I love that it has the canopy, but whoever designed the velcro tabs that hold it up - is an idiot! So I have taken them off and made a better system myself.It is a nice PnP, but not worth the extra cost.
