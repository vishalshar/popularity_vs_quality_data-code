LOVE:I am very pleased with the purchase of this pack n play. This is our third baby and second Graco pack n play. We upgraded because we wanted the extra storage (the removable shelves) as we are keeping this baby in our bedroom for a longer time than our previous children stayed. The print and color is beautiful. Perfect for us since we are not finding out the gender until baby comes. It was easy to set up. This style can hold up to 30 lbs so it will work for a long time (My 1 year old isn't even close to 30 lbs). We purchased the dream on me mattress for it for more comfort.DISLIKE:I was disappointed with the newborn napper. I wish you could remove it and use it outside of the pack n play. it doesn't work outside of the playard. I also wish that the diaper changing bed had the side storage for wipes and diapers like our previous one had. i understand it doesn't come with that since there is already storage below but we are using that for clothes and blankets. and there isn't much storage room left for diapers or wipes. and also once you remove the bassinet portion but want to continue using the diaper changing area, there is no storage!
