I bought these for a joke, but when we went to try it with our baby, he didn't like it.  we tried it at several ages.for starters, it weights about 5 times more than a normal pacifier.  The shape of it is also different.  I think babies like to feel the pressure around their lips as well as having the nipple in their mouths, and this one doesn't put any pressure on their lips.  Hard to describe, but most pacifiers are very slightly U-shaped from the top to the bottom, and this one has less of a curve in it.Worth the money for the joke, but worthless as a pacifier.
