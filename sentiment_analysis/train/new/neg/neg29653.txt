I was really excited about getting a balance bike for my 3 year old son.  I was either going to get the Strider brand bike or this one.  I thought this one was cooler and since it was recommended for 2-5 year old children I thought it would fit my son - He isn't exactly the biggest 3 year old you've ever met but he is not smaller then the average 2 year old.  Anyway, when I got the bike and put it together the seat looked awful high for him.  I measure the seat height at the lowest setting to be between 14 and 14.5 inches from the ground.  My sons inseam is ~ 12.75 inches.  I ended up returning this bike and getting the Strider which has a seat that will adjust from 11 to 16 inches.  I wish they would have just noted the limits of seat adjustment in the add for the prince lionheart bike.  I measured them before packing the bike back up - they are ~14 - 16.5 inches.Other then the seat issue the bike looks cool - the wheels and tires make it...  The front fork is a bit looser then I would prefer but its not like the kid is gonna be going off any sweet jumps with the thing.  Also the handle bars are not height adjustable - I wouldn't really foresee that as being a big issue - the child will probably be on a pedal bike before you would need to adjust the bars.
