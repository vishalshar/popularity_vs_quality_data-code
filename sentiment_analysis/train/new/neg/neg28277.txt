I will start by saying I'm not very picky, I typically take things how they are and work with it, I'll try to make this review accurate and not emotional. So to start with my purchase experience, I HATE those squishy foam potty seats, so was looking for something plastic, and thought this attachable one would be nice. Well, although it does it's job, I'm actually a bit heartbroken at the quality. My daughter is excited with it, but the plastic is very cheap. The hinge broke before I even installed it I have no idea how either. When I say it's cheap I'm not implying I expected a 5 star seat for ten bucks, it's a typical cheap plastic seat, say the consistancy of one of those big plastic leggos, just thicker. I would have paid twice as much for something that I would feel safe with, this will definately not last through a second child, and will probabally need to be replaced at some point. I feel it's right for the price though. The blue part is ruber, hollow and squishy, I was afraid it would be foam. It's thick enough and secure. I don't ecpect any water to get underneath it. I had two toillet seats I tried this with, one nice wood one that would not fit the seat (the hinges collided) and another cheapy one from walmart which fits it perfectly. As the other reviews state it doesn't stay up well, so I tuck it inside my decorative lid cover, but my husband would have to hold the seat up if he needed to lift the regular seat. This doesn't seem a  huge deal breaker to me but it's something to considder. I added a bunch of pictures, since there were none when I was buying, it may help someone in the future make a decision. To me it seems a nice budget seat but I would like a sturdier option. Good Luck!
