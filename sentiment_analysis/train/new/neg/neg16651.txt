We returned this. Though it states it fits over the standard spout, it doesn't fit over anything beyond JUST a spout... meaning that little doohickey that you pull up to have the water come out of the shower... yeah it doesn't fit over that.  The box even shows that it fits over ANY spout but it doesn't. I tried to wrench it onto ours and ended up bending the spout and cracking the seal between the tub and spout trying to get this thing on.  Since we had ordered it, I have been peeking in at every house I go to at their nozzles / spouts in their bathtubs and I have yet to see one it would work on.
