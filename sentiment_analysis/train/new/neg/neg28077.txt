I received a hand-me down Medela pump in style from a relative and was very happy with it, but needed a more portable pump for "emergencies" and when I was out places where I couldn't find a discreet place with an electrical outlet (the manual pump that came with the pump in style I got was broken).I purchased this pump because I liked that it could work via an AC adapter, battery pack, or manually.  The pump works well, but I don't get as much milk as with the pump in style, and it takes much longer (even longer than if I pump each side individually with my pump in style). It is quieter than the Medela pump and I like that there are no tubes, which makes it easier to clean.
