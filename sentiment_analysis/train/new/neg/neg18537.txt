This is a very cute idea but it didn't work so well for us...First of all, we have an Uppababy Vista and the fit of this toy against our baby's face is a bit weird.  Even now at 9 months she is always a bit too close to it to really notice all the 3 toys. When on the stroller bar, she doesn't pay too much attention to the mirror and chews on the monkey only occasionally. The pear and the zebra go completely unnoticed.Also the toy ends up rotating around the stroller bar and often ends up facing out.It's a really cute idea. The toy is well made. It wasn't a good fit for our child and our stroller. I wouldn't purchase this again.
