We originally bought 12 Bum Genius 3.0 one size diapers for our son and 12 fuzzi bunz one size diapers. I recognize that for many parents, it is just about what fits your children better. But for us, fuzzi bunz was much better - we ended up reselling most of the BumGenius and replacing them with fuzzi bunz.Cons:-The velcro doesn't work well for us. We could never get it tight enough so that it wouldn't leak (especially at night when they would ALWAYS leak at the top) but loose enough so that it wasn't too tight around his tummy. It was also always hard for us to get the legs the right tightness. At eight months (we still have two left - so we use them when the fuzzi bunz are being washed) the legs are already too tight no matter how we adjust the velcro. Part of this is that he has very chunky legs and a big round tummy. So maybe they fit better with skinny babies. They tended to fit our son better when they were the smallest size and he was a baby and when he was less chubby, so maybe, again, better for skinnier babies.-Another downside the the velcro is that you have to always make sure the tabs are down when you wash, and things are always getting caught in it anyway.-It would be nice if there were better designs. The colors are nice and bright, and the blues are especially good, but a few designs wouldn't hurt. Also, the white ones fade and discolor, so I wouldn't get them. They don't stay crisp white at all.Pros:-I do like the flap at the top (as compared to the Fuzzi Bunz which is open).-I like how the material on the inside is micro-fleece rather than the fuzzy stuff that fuzzi bunz uses. The FB softness is nice at first, but it wears thin soon whereas the micro-fleece stuff doesn't seem to wear down as fast.In short, if these fit your baby well and don't leak, I'm sure they are great diapers. Buy a few to try first. I know lots of families like them. We just never could get them to work well - both because of the fit/size and because of the velcro.
