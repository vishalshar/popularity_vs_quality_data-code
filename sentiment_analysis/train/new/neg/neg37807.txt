This is a very beautiful, soft sheet but it does not hold up after washing. I read the reviews before I bought this sheet and saw that others stated that the sheet snagged very easily in the wash, so I made sure to wash and dry it very carefully as per instructions, and only with other soft clothes without zippers or buttons that could possibly catch on the sheet. After only three washes, the sheet already has small snags in the fabric all over it. I am really disappointed considering the expensive price of this sheet. As much as I love the look of it, I would not recommend it due to the quality. Whats the point of paying 34.95 for a sheet that doesn't hold up for more than a couple weeks?
