THIS ITEM IS NOT machine washable. Out of the package it fit my mini crib just fine. Then the first wash on COLD and hung out to dry , now it no long fits, at least a foot smaller than what it was. I'm very disappointed that I just now found out of it would have been sent back immediately. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
