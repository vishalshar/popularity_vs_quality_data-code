Not even sure how this product has such a high star rating. My daughter put this to the test 4 days after using it and it leaked through this mat into the car seat. So I thought maybe it just didn't soak it up and ran out onto the car seat. So I washed it, let it dry completely then poored 2oz water in it and the water literally soaked right through the bottom and onto my counter.
