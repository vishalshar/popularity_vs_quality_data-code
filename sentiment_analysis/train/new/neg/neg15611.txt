I bought these for my twins' cribs after trying several other products to stop them from chewing up their cribs.  At first I was really pleased with the rail guards because they went on so easily and looked really cute.  After a week or so, however, I started finding clumps of white fluff in the boys' beds and on their pajamas.  I discovered that they were picking at the underneath side of the guards, which look smooth, but if you pick or scratch at them you get lots of fluffy white fibers that look like stuffing from the inside of a stuffed animal.  I had to remove the guards when I saw that the boys were actually putting the fluff in their mouths and chewing on it.  If your kids are pickers, I would definitely recommend you not purchase this product.
