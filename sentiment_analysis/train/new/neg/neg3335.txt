We bought this for our son when he was 4 months old. My son liked it, but didn't love it. What he loved was the Comotomo Silicone Baby Teether, which was also cheaper! I think the defining difference between this one & the Comotomo teether is that it doesn't have as many "fingers/ears" and it isn't completely made of silicone. At my son's young age, his hand-eye coordination isn't the greatest, and he was/is still learning to fine-tune those skills. As such, he tends to aim towards his mouth, and hopefully some useful element of the teether ends up in his mouth and he can chew to his heart's content. However, with only 2 ears that are made of silicone, the rest is sort of useless - outside of having something to hold on to. With the all-silicone Comotomo, my son can grab on to any part of the teether, and he can also put any part of it in his mouth and chew! Overall, this teether wasn't worth the price at $10.
