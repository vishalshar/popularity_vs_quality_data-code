It is a novel idea but not for babies.  I would say not appropriate for babies less than 7-9 months and weighing at least 25 lbs as I tried it on a 4 mo. old weighing approx. 17 lbs and another 4 mo old weighing about 12 lbs and neither one liked it as there was no real support for them to hold onto and they were very insecure in it.  I was also very uncomfortable with just the small straps to hold them in the seat as well.  My husband tried using it to carry them in on his chest and it seemed to work a little better than as a sitting chair but said it was not very comfortable carrying them in it and no real support.  I ended up returning it as I was very disappointed in it.
