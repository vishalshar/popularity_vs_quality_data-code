I feel fortunate that I had already purchased another Sophie set from the manufacturer store. When this item arrived it was apparent to a naked eye that the toys were fake. They are a little bit bigger than the authentic one, they are much sloppier made, and the logo is a little bigger and again, just sloppier. Again, if you put authentic and fake toy side by side, it is very apparent which one is genuine.  It is a shame that Amazon allows this item to be sold on their website, but I raised an issue with them. Again, Sophie the giraffe is a great teether. My daughter loves it. But the best thing about it, that it is made of natural rubber and safe for little ones. Well, that would be the case ONLY if the item is authentic. This particular seller provides a fake version of a well known teether toy and they should be banned from Amazon. Please do not purchase this item if you care about the quality of your baby toys.
