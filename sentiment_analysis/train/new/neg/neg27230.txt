Since most of these sets contain items that are unneeded or unwanted, it's nice when the pieces that you care about are of good quality. The mobile is cheap and doesn't feel like it will hold up over time, but the blanket, sheets, etc are better. If you use the mobile, I recommend putting something soft between the plastic piece that attaches it to the crib and the crib so as not to scar the crib. Good value for the price.
