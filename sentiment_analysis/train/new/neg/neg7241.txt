I have a couple of different nursing covers [Bebe Au Lait, MyBrestFriend, & Udder Cover] but I decided to try this one because it covers the back too.  I thought this cover would provide great 360* coverage, but what it really provides is only front & back coverage with insufficient side coverage.  Especially if you have a squirmy baby!  The front & back are a good length but the sides are drastically shorter, making the entire cover full of gaps.  It is also hard to see down inside of the cover without the rigid neckline that comes standard in a Bebe Au Lait.  The fabric is about twice as thick as my other covers, so I think it'd be unbearable during summer. But I do tend to run warm these days!  ;)Lastly the little pouch is a nice idea, but who has the time to fold a cover up once baby's done eating?  Usually I am trying to get baby right side up to burp while putting myself back in order.And in response to this product touting itself as a versatile 4-in-1, all the things this product claims you could do with any other cover, so don't let that be a buying point for you.
