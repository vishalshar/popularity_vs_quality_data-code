This car seat is definitely great for the price. I fully recommend it as a secondary car seat for short drives.  I do not recommend it at all to be used as the main car seat.  The problem with it is, like many others mention, if my 3 year old falls a sleep in it, his head keeps falling down. The side head supports do not work well. I purchased this to leave it at my brother's who lives a couple hundred miles away and we fly to see his family regularly. This way, each time I visit I don't have to worry about how to get a car seat for my son.  For my purpose,..the car seat is excellent :)
