Don't judge this product on looks alone, yes the monitor appears to be the original one NASA observed the moon landing on, but IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH OUR WIFI!  Operating at 900 MHz, this stoneage contraption works as advertised. Night vision, check; sound, check; reception, ok. Monitor must be plugged in, that's a downside, but no wifi interference, priceless. Best money spent to keep the baby safe and the rest of the family online and happy.
