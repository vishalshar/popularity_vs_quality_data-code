This is the worst brush I have ever purchased, the bristles are falling apart within just a few days of use.very disappointed with this. Also I would recommend munchkin brand over this,which is much more strong n better than this one.it doesn't clean the bottle properly. No use of buying. I bought it after seeing good reviews, but I would not recommend it.
