With this kind of money (more than IKEA but less than "real" furniture), I expected more.  It is really hard to assemble this (took 3 hours), and it is clunky when the drawers open and close although my husband did an awesome job assembling it.  It is a bit better than IKEA, I guess?, but I am not really even sure by how much.  The DaVinci crib was so easy to assemble and it was very sturdy, so we ordered this one to match, but I kinda wish we did not.  I would say go with IKEA instead or invest a bit more and go for a real piece of furniture that does not require this much assembly and comes with niceer wood and finishes.
