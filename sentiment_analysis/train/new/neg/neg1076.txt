While the product is cute, it is VERY POORLY MADE.  Strings hanging off, cheap, thin cotton that wrinkles easily.  For the price I would recommend buying a better product.  It looks okay, but I have concerns as to how durable it is.  Definitely not worth the price.  Do yourself a favor and go with a better brand name.  For the price you could get something  that is better quality
