This was ok. It's a one time use which is probably my biggest complaint. It's nice that it doesn't make a mess since it's clear ink that's wiped on the child's foot/hand with a piece of paper, but the one time use factor made it difficult to use the way I wanted to. I was using this for hand and foot prints for my newborn. I got his feet, but was struggling to get his hands flat. There were plenty of pages to keep trying to make additional prints, but he was ripping the paper that you wipe on his hands to make the print rendering it useless. I would have tried again another time rather than forcing it then, but since it can only be used once, that wasn't possible.
