It's hard to find a single piece pacifier that's orthodontic for an older baby. This does the job, but unless its attached to a paci clip it's nearly impossible to find since its clear. We also have dogs and it is a fur (and blanket fuzz and lint) magnet, so I am rinsing it off every 5 minutes. My 12M old has no problem switching between this and her Soothies and Gumdrops.
