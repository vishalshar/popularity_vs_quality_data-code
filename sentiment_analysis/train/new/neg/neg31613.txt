I bought 3-4 different brands of these straw cups for my 16 month old. I had used Avent bottles for my baby and loved them,so thought of buying the same brand straw cups,but these are not good! The straw is thick and required a lot of effort for my kid to drink from this.He just refused drinking from this.not good.. :(
