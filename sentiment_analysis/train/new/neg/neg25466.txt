So displeased. This was supposed to be the fix to our slippery bathtub but instead became part of the problem. First, don't buy this if you have textured bathtub (it WONT stick.) Second measure your bathtub before hand. I found that it was far too big for the standard size bath tub and because of that slid all over the place. Al in all, not a good buy.
