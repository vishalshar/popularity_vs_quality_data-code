I thought my son would go crazy for this- he lovesss stuffed animals - cuddly things etc... and I read on the review of this product that it was one of the best cuddle buddies- which i found to not be true. Anyway, I was disappointed my son didnt enjoy it- because I think they are precious and love the idea/theme behind them
