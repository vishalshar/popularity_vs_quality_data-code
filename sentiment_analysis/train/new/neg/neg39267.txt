I am editing my glowing review due to issues. The elastic on one leg of the Lorax cover I bought gave out, and the stitching at the top of the Cat in the Hat one has also gived out. As of today I have had these covers less than two weeks, so this is disappointing. The patterns are cute, but these are not sturdy covers.
