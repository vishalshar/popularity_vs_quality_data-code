This changing station serves it purpose. It has two great compartments, one for wipes and one for the diapers and diaper cream which are comfortable. The mat is also good for changing in public places, especially nasty bathrooms where you don't know how many soiled babies were changed or when was the last time those were cleaned.Overall its ok, but the fabric tab that is connected to the metal closure is too soft and the tab always moves so it never closes tightly.I did not have the wipes case problem as others mentioned that the color fades, mines was fine, but i find it easier to use the travel wipes than to use the case.
