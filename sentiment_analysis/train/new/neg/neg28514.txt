After reading all the reviews I was excited to get this hi-chair. My 13 month old hated it... The tray sat too low, it was lined up with her waist and she is tiny. In addition there was no way for her to sit up straight in it. She was at a constant recline scooting around and trying to sit up. Therefore while eating lifting the food from waist level, while being slouched back, all the food was falling on her chest. The tray is indeed too small, and only has 2 adjustable options: at the one setting is was squishing her guts and the other was too far out. The tray is also difficult to use; requiring both hands while holding the baby was challenging. We tried it out for 2 days and at the end of the two days this was returned. The only reason I even gave this 1 star was for the easy-clean up. The design is completely awkward. Thanks to Amazon for their easy return policy!
