The suction on this plate is extremely good.  I tested it out on my kitchen counter tops, painted wood dining table and my daughter's plastic high chair.  The release is extremely easy.  I do recomment adhearing it with the quick release tab away from your child becuase curious fingers may figure it out quickly.Update 6/15/2015 - suction no longer holds on this plate when we use it on her high chair.  It's always been handwashed.  It worked perfect in the beginning, but wore out.  The outer ring still holds tight to the base though.
