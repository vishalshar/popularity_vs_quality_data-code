I got so tired of washing the valves from my pump by hand, so I purchased this basket. It's large enough that I can fit 7 bottle rings in the lower compartment, as well as the valves from the pump. I use the Phillips Advent Natural bottles, which have wide base nipples, and those fit easily in the top compartment.However, I noticed that when I ran the dishwasher with the nipples the compartment they came out with an almost oily film on them, inside and out. I've washed the nipples in the dishwasher before by just placing on prongs on the top layer and they came out perfectly clean, so I know it's not the dishwasher. My other issue with this basket is that it's too wide to comfortable fit between the prongs in my dishwasher.I rely heavily on reviews when it comes to deciding whether or not Iâ€™m going to purchase something, so my reviews are completely honest. If my opinion of the quality of this product changes, I will update my review accordingly.Please let me know if my review was helpful to you by voting yes below, and let me know if you have any questions!
