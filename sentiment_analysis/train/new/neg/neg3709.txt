We really wanted to love these as baby bottles because they're glass (yay!), however the nipple isn't the best kind for feeding baby, as with most types of bottles, the flow allows baby to drink WAY too fast, and doesn't have features to reduce gas via air escape.  Because our baby couldn't breastfeed at first due to tongue tie, we had to bottle feed.  After a month or so, we learned about Comotomo bottles, which 1) have slower flow to reduce/eliminate colic (we never had any colic issues), 2) have valves to help air escape as milk level drops while baby feeds , 3) reduce/eliminate nipple confusion because the shape mimics a breast, 4) is super easy to clean because of it's large-mouth, round shape, and 5) allows you squeeze the bottle to help milk come out when baby starts dozing off (just like doing breast compressions to squirt more milk into baby's mouth when he starts dozing off).  This may sound like a plug for Comotomo, but I have zero connection to them... just so amazed how great they are, zero colic, happy baby, easy burping, easy cleaning... I just feel the need to share this with other parents who also didn't know about Comotomo.Anyway, now that baby is 11-months, we have bought the sippy cup lids for these Lifefactory bottles, and are using them as sippy cups instead, which are great.  So buying them was not a waste, because now we have glass sippy cups! (yay!)
