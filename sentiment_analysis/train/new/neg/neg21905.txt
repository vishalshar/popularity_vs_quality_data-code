I have purchased Chicco Cortina Travel system about 5 monh ago before I had my son. At first it seemed to be good stroller and carseat but when my son was born it all looked in a different way. He is my first child so I didn't know much about carseats and strollers, I saw alot of parents with this travel system and assumed it wad good. The things I don't like are: stroller is practically useless for a newborn. My son was born in May so we had a summer ahead of us and we like to go to pak by our house. When you put such a small baby in you wan it to be safe and comfortable well for one you can't really see or hear your baby while walking and it shakes around too much also wheels started squicking after about 2 walks. Wind blows from every direction. When my son was 2 month he barely fit length wise in the stroller and foot rest doesn't stay up to provide more room. So I started looking for a different stroller and when he was 3 month finally got a stroller that's great.Carseat infant cushion was a good thing but it's made of unbreathable fabric and my baby would always sweat. After he outgrew the cushion carseat seemed not so safe without it since he was still too small, also the seat is very deep which is not comfortable for a baby because he's legs have to be up so high it makes diaper squeez his tummy too much. At one point when he was 3 monh I thought he is bigger now so I don't need a different carseat but he cries and wiggles when I put him in. He is 4 month now and it's still not comfortable for him so I'm in a process of finding him a new carseat. Also shoulder belt adjustment holes are way open which is not good for cold weather since it makes baby's back exposed.All the ratings say otherwise but in my experience it's the worse so far. I think it also depends on the color you choose. I've heard that some stroller foot rest does stay up and my friend liked her careat not the stroller
