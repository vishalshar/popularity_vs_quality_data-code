I shopped around for a soothing crib attachment since my daughter loves my nephew's.  I should have gone with the one he has.  I have a convertible sleigh crib and it doesn't fit on the side as shown on the pictures.  It also has a huge battery pack on the back that makes it a pain to put on.  You have to remove the batteries in order to attach it to the crib and it fits so snugly that it won't go over my bumper.  So she has to lay sideways in order to see it with the bumper pushed down.  For the most part, she likes it.  The interactive part on it doesn't really serve much purpose since I turn it on for her to go to sleep.  The motor that makes the animals go around is very noisy but she likes the bubbles.  I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.
