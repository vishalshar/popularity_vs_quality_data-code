I recently purchased a splat mat for my 11 month old son.  I brought it home and realized that it was much too small. Also, the material was very flimsy.  Here's what I did.  I returned the mat the very next day.  Then I headed over to [another store] and purchased a circular vinyl table cloth.  It only cost me [$] and it works great! It covers a larger area to protect my tile against the inevitable spills. It's heavier so it doesn't bunch up when my son's high chair gets moved around.  Finally, I was able to find a pattern that went with the decor in my kitchen.
