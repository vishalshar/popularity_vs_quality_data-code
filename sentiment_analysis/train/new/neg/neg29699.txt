Our son doesn't like these nipples at all. Not sure why. Every baby is different and I would not give a 2 star review just because our baby doesn't like it. However, I don't like that there is no way to determine from the nipple, whether you have slow, medium or fast flowing nipples. Heaven forbid you have more than one speed in your home you will be reduced to counting the drips that are coming out of them.Evenflo's website is equally unhelpful.  There is no "m" or any other distinguishing mark that I could see, though the nipples are numbered in what appears to be some random fashion.
