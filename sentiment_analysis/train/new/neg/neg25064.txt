When my son was first born, the MAM pacifiers were the only ones he would take. At about six weeks, he decided he wasn't interested in them and chose another brand. When he was three months old, I just randomly grabbed a MAM pacifier when I couldn't find a clean one of his favorite hoping that it would work. It did; however, I noticed that when he cried and I would go to insert the pacifier, the whole thing could fit in his mouth! Maybe these would work for a smaller baby up to six months (mine was 14lbs 3 months), but I wouldn't use them past 3 months.
