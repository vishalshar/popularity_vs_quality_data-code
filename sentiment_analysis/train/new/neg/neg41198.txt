I have been using "fast flow nipples" for the last few months but they are the clear ones.  I ordered these and even though they are a different color, they have all the same labeling and imprints ON the nipple and are called exactly the same thing.....but these are certainly not a fast flow like the clear ones.  I don't know why they would be different but these are equivalent to my slow flow nipples that I also use sometimes.  I use the fast flow nipples when I add a bit of baby cereal in the bottle, have no problems when I use the clear fast flow nipples, however with the exact same amount of cereal (and I have also tried a bit less) it does not go through these.  And I tried all of the nipples that came in the packages.  Stick to the clear ones if you really want a fast flow.  Unless the couple packages I received happened to be defective.....
