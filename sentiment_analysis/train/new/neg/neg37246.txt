I purchased this rattle because I really like the Green Sprouts brand and the fact that it's BPA free. Unfortunately, my son doesn't seem to care for it much at all. I think it has to do with the fact that it's curved - he can't really grab onto it securely. It's always falling out of his hands. If the toy was straight I think it would be a big improvement! The two balls on the end seem to be too large, he wants to chomp on them (teething) but they are way too big to fit into his mouth.  So the curve + rattle balls too big = not much fun for little one. Overall I feel I wasted my money which is disappointing to me as I like the brand for over items.
