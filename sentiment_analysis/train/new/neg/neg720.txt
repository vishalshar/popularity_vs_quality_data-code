Back to the drawing boardThis product is not designed to fit the average North American bath tub rail. The suction cups are too big!An average tub has a 4 inch wide tubrail with a 1/2 to 3/4 inch radius. The Mommys helper Safer Grip Tubrail came with a 4" diameter disc which hangs over the edges of  the tubrail and will not adhere to the tub for any length of time. Apparently the designer and the manufacturer have not prototyped the product and conducted any usability testing before manufacturing.The product however, is well made and good looking; but some serious redesign is necessary if it is going to be sold as a "tubrail" assist.It may work if you have a customized tub or a hot tub, but do not buy it for use with an average tub.Product is returned to Amazon.
