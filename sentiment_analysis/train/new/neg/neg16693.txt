i just pulled the shell off to wash for the first time and the foam underneath is broken!! The side head rest piece, just fell off!! Is this normal. I may have had the seat a year, but used in my second car. As I said just washing it for the first time!!! I called comfort first after googling the compass name and they were not helpful!! I did not expect this from a seat I thorouly investigated!! NOT HAPPY. HELP??thanks,Heather
