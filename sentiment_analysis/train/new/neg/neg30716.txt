I ordered this about a week and a half ago and finally got it late last night (seems Amazon usually doesn't take that long to send stuff).When I took it out of the packaging I was happy to see how tall it was because I'm 5' 10" and my husband is 6' 3" so it will be nice to not bend over when changing the baby.However, there were some issues with the table straight from the box.  The partical board shelves have quite a few chips in them.  I had to decide which side looked the best when putting it together.  Also, when it was painted, some of it ran, and now it doesn't have a nice smooth finish.When I ordered this I noticed that a lot of reviews said it was wobbly...and it kind of is.  It seems like it's top heavy, then add a baby to it and that might make it worse.All in all....if you don't look too close it doesn't look too bad.  I'll keep it and use it because that's easier that packing it all back up and sending it back.
