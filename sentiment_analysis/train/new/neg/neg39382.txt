This seems to be a great bag. Have not yet used it, but seems to be sturdy and serviceable. My only complaint about it is the color. I ordered the beige, and I was expecting something much more subdued and brown/gray. This is a very orange-tinted color. Almost similar to a carhartt color, but not quite as dark. I may send it back due to that. It's also on the large side for me. I'm a minimalist and this will be my only child, so I don't feel like I need anything quite this large.
