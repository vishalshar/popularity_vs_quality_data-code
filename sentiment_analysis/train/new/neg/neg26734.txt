The 3 stars indicate it's okay, and it is. I LOVE that it folds narrowly for storage. I love that the height can be adjusted for our kitchen table which is a little lower than the dining room table. Those are things that highchairs, in the days of my own kids, could't do. I dislike that I feel I need to keep the instruction book handy to remember the steps to open and close it. Too many sets of buttons, that are a little bit hidden, to squeeze to adjust positioning. Granted, if I did it daily that wouldn't be the case. What on earth is the purpose of having two trays, one on top of the other? Just wipe it off, for heaven's sake, don't take layer one off to toss, (where... the floor?) so there's a second layer. I don't get this fad at all. Hate to sound like Grandma, but here it is... things were simpler in my day.
