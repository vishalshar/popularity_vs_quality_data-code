I do not always leave reviews, but in this case it seems important since there is a legitimate safety issue with this product. As other reviewers have said, these toys grew black mold inside of them. We tried to never put them away wet, always squeezing them out after baths, but unfortunately it is IMPOSSIBLE to squeeze them out completely and they were filled with nasty mold after about 2 months.Even worse, the toys are not terribly transparent (some of them not at all) so you will not even know immediately that they are moldy. Until the mold grows to the point where you can clearly see because the toys which were more translucent have clouded you will not even be aware of it.Since the whole idea is to use them to squirt water or for our baby to handle and chew (which involves squeezing water out of them) this is almost sure to lead to your child ingesting mold spores. I strongly do not recommend this product.
