These puppets are very sweet and very well made. The material is high quality, soft, and perfect for a young toddler. The problem is that the finger openings are GIANT and short, so the fall off your finger immediately. If you can shove your finger up into the heads of the puppets, the stay on nicely, but it is tight even for tiny fingers, enough so that you wouldn't think you're supposed to have your finger up that far because it takes so much effort and coordination - too much for a toddler. Maybe there's too much stuffing and fabric in the heads? My daughter loves to carry these around and she tries to use them as puppets but can't get them to stay on her fingers. Often she brings them to me to do the puppeteering for her.
