For what you pay if you buy this monitor you could buy two, TWO, others.  I just ordered a older b/w "Summer" video/audio system and a "Bebe" colour video/audio system.  Why do I say that?  Because my 7 inch colour "Summer" video/audio system just broke.  The on/off button broke.  On other older "Summers" this switch is a dial.  On this new model, and there are two offered here at Zon, the on/off switch is a spring loaded push button.  It cannot be taken apart to be repaired, there is no warranty after this much time, and it is simply ridiculous that the on/off switch on an otherwise competent working system, was not designed to be more reliable.  After all, being able to actually USE this system is why we buy it!  Right?  The screen of this model, however, is large but intrusive at night.  You can actually read a book by it!  The reception is good but can be interfered with by anything prompting a constant moving about of this model to maintain reception.  The picture is crisp and good and so is the sound.  But what good are these features if you can no longer turn the darn thing on!  Talk about built in obsolescence.  I recommend staying away from any model with a push button type on/off switch.  Starting with this model.  I intend to from now on.  As I said, buy the two I revealed above that I bought as replacements for this big waste of my money.  Not only do these other models NOT have push button switches, together they cost only a few dollars more than this model I'm reviewing.  You'll have one for the bedroom and one for the living room or family room.  It's really stupid and such bad business to make a good product with some faulty engineering details such as an unreliable on/off button.  That is sooo stupid.
