This gate does the job for what I needed it for (to keep a cat out of my bedroom so I may leave my door open for air flow).  However, I don't believe it would be sufficient for use if you have a toddler.  I personally could not get the gate wedged in the door tight enough to prevent a toddler from being at risk of knocking it over.  I believe there are probably better products out there for this purpose.
