This is more a review of Amazon than of the item.  The item was ordered and shipped from Amazon.com and not a third party seller.  The bumper is supposed to be a one piece all around bumper (I have another one so I know what I'm talking about).  However, Amazon sent a 4-piece bumper instead which is not what I ordered.  If you, like me, would like to get the one piece version of the bumper don't order this item from Amazon.com.
