Yes this is a lifesaver, but at the same time, it is a big waste of money. We luckily bought ours used so it isn't a big loss for us, but I would say hold off. It is really only good for your baby when they aren't quite big enough to sit on their own and when they are strong enough to hold their head up on their own. My daughter really only used it about a month. It's very akward and she always seemed uncomfortable in it. She spits up a lot in it becaue the middle part of the seat pushes into her stomach when she leans forward at all. It she drops a toy if front of her she leans forward to try and get it. I think when you are at a certain stage of motherhood you are looking for anything that can hold your baby for a minute while you go to the bathroom or wash the dishes or whatever. Get something more like a papasan. We have used that since birth and she still likes it. It has good support and you can strap them into it. Really, this thing doesn't help your baby learn to sit. It only let's you set them down without them falling over. I wouldn't invest in this.
