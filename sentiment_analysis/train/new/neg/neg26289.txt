The item I received is not the same as the one in the picture. It is very similar and it is not satin. Its pure cotton. The only satin material was the bow. I was really waiting on the satin one like the picture for my nephew to use at a party. It is not even worth returning since shipping might be the same or more than the price of the product itself. If I would've received the satin one that "I ordered" most likely I would have rated it 5 stars since it seems very nice and adequate for a party but I just happened to receive the wrong order.
