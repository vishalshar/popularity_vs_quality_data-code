The problem: After 4 months of use, the motor died and the swing will no longer swing.  We use the swing a lot, as it is our son's happiest place to be, awake or asleep.  I called customer service and they quickly agreed to send us a replacement motor head / dome.  Problem solved to our satisfaction.The overall opinion:  The swing itself is my son's favorite thing in the world.  It works (until it didn't - see above), but there is a built-in timer on the music and mobile functions.  After maybe 15 minutes, the music turns off.  I wish I could tell it not to do that!  As far as baby swings go, this one will get the job done and we are happy with it.  We knew we were not buying a top-of-the-line, most expensive model on the market, and we are OK with that.
