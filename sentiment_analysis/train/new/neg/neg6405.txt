I love that this is a clean product for my baby, unfortunately there is a problem with the design. I have a 9 month old who weighs 18.2lbs. We received this mattress April 1st. Already there is good dent the size of my son in the mattress where he sleeps and we have been using this mattress for about a 1.5 months. I was considering buying a mattress from Naturepedic but decided to go with this one since the companies had a connection and the mattress was a little cheaper.  Now i wish i would have spent the extra money on a mattress that lasts. Sadly cannot recommend this product.  :(
