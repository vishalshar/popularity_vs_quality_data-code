Beautifully made rattle for my little baby girl. But looks can only go so far, it should be a rattle first and a cute doll second. This rattle is so quiet that I can barely hear it. Also the handle where my tiny baby girls hands are suppose to hold is so thick that she is unable to do so. This rattle has the potential to be the best thing since sliced banana bread, but lacks where a rattle truly counts.
