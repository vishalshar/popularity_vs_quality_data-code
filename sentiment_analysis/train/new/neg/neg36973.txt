We've only had these bibs a couple weeks and they already look years old. The printed fabric shrunk more than the terry back fabric, causing it to curl up. The cute patterns have faded terribly over just a couple of washes. These won't last long. I love the pullover style, and the neck hole is just the right size, but other brands (I like Green Sprouts) are holding up better. The bibs themselves are a bit smaller (less coverage) than other pullovers, though I'm okay with the size. They do still serve their purpose of staying on my little Houdini who can pull off any bib with Velcro or snaps.
