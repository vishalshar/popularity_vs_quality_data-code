Pros:+ very nice design, the bright colors are exactly how it is pictured. Look-wise this is by far the best looking baby feeding dish/container I have seen so far.+ good quality, so far no scratches, stains, or cracks. Survived my son's abuse+ the shape and rubber makes it easy to hold while trying to feed a struggling toddler+ rubber below the dish prevents dish from sliding when my son was starting to learn how to self feed. I think for older toddlers that are 2+ years old would require a dish with a suction.+ the ring around the dish helps with toddlers learning to feed on their own, the ring around it is similar to the CaliBowl Non-Spill Toddler Suction-Base Bowl with Lid, 12-Ounce, Sky Blue. except for the OXO ring is removable.+ easy to washCons:- not a container to pack foods for on the go- Not sure if it is air tight, I have packed this feeding dish once and had a bit of puree food leak out- not for pureed foods, better for finger foods and foods for toddlers to learn how to self feed (rice, macaroni etc.).- divider is pointless. this dish is way too small and shallow for a divider to be useful. you would have to put very little amount of food on both sides so that it wouldn't go over the divider and be mixed togetherOverall great for 6months (starting solids) to 1 years old. I can't complain about it being too shallow, as it is a dish, not a bowl.*********DO NOT BUY IF:- you are looking for a container to pack foods for your baby on the go. As one reviewer noted, you can't pack much since it is technically a dish. You can't even pack snacks since it's too shallow and too small/ anything as watery as a puree (slightly leaks).- you are looking for a feeding bowl (this dish is not deep enough to be considered a bowl for food)
