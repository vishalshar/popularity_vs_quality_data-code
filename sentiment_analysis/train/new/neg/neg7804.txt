They leak.  They leak often.  And when they leak, they leak a lot of formula.  There is usually enough formula on the baby with out the need for a dousing from the bottle itself.It doesn't matter how you tighten the bottles.  Hard or lose:  they leak.Obviously there is a problem as so many people at this site have had the same frustrating problems.  We contacted Avent, and they gave us the story of don't tighten so much.  "Only use your finger tips."  How vague.  How strong is your hand?  They sent us two new nipples.  They leaked too.We have used Avent bottles and others as well.  The babies can't tell the difference.  They drink just as well from the other bottles as from the Avent bottles.  However, the others are cheaper, cleaner and more durable.We have decided to get rid of these bottles and buy others.  Do not buy these bottles.
