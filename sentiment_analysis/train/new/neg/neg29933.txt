My husband and I bought this glider before our first son was born. It was easy to assemble and was fairly comfortable for the price we paid. We enjoyed it for about a month until it started to squeak loudly when we rocked in it. We tried lubricating the moving mechanism, but the squeak stayed and eventually got worse. After about another month it started to have a clunky motion instead of a smooth glide, in addition to the squeaking. Needless to say, after two months of use it wasn't soothing at all. I tried to claim the warranty on the glider, but Graco said to claim it through La Jobi which makes the chair, and La Jobi said they never heard of the product. Thank goodness for Amazon's 365 day return on baby products! We sent it back (Amazon even paid the shipping!), and got our money back.
