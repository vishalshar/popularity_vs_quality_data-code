First of all, I'm not sure why the product description says, "large;" it is very misleading. When the mirror arrived, I was rather disappointed in the size. It is quite small; the mirror itself is 5" x 4". The frame is 12" x 7"... if that is considered large!?! Secondly, the melodies and sounds are not soothing; they are upbeat and entertaining. I don't mind the music, but it definately won't send baby off to dreamland, especially if he bumps it with a hand or foot while asleep. Baby goes in the crib to sleep, not play. Yes, the music can be turned off on the back of the mirror, but my 8 month old is able to turn it back on! Lastly, the mirror does easily attatch to crib; however, it is secured only on top, so baby can lift and bang mirror... during all hours of the night! There needs to be a bottom strap as well, so the mirror can't be lifted up; it would also keep baby from being able to touch the power switch. As far as quality, the mirror is well constructed; unfortunately, it just isn't practical.
