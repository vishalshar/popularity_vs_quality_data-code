I wish I could give this product a better review.  We purchased months in advance of having our son, so it sat in the box.  I wish we would have got it out and played with it ahead of time.... I would have sent it back.  This is not our first child, but there is an 8 year gap between our youngest and "new" youngest, so we had gotten rid of our previous baby items.  For my last child, we had a Grayco Pack n Play.... I wish we would have purchased another one of those.  It was SO easy to use.Issues with this one:  The bottom of the unit flexes, it is not solid to the frame.  This means as baby moves, he REALLY moves.... making it much harder for him to stay asleep (we end up wedging towels or laundry underneath to beef it up a bit).  After the third use, the handle that is sewn to the strap to collapse the base frame, came off (the strap that feeds up through the bottom).  Also, the base does not collapse properly, you really have to work at it and find the sweet spot for it to fold up and fit inside the mat that folds around the unit.  I suppose we could just "force it" but it feels like it will break if we do.All in all, great concept.... poor execution and design.  I suggest testing different models out at the store before purchasing.
