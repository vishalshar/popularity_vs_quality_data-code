What I disliked most was that it didn't turn off after 20 minutes like so many other kids toys. My son is also a rough and tumble boy so the plastic part cracked within a month. BUT my kids did enjoy it while it lasted and I think if it had a timer and was just used as a goodnight toy it would have lasted much much longer.
