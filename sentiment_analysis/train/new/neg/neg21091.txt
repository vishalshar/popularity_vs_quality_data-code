Not sure who came up with the idea to make a baby mirror that magnifies, but it was a bad idea. This mirror magnifies so badly that you can only see the eye balls of your kid in it. And as if that wasn't bad enough, it distorts the image so badly that it gives me headaches while driving.The only good thing about this mirror is the suction cup, they got that one right. I think I'll keep it just for that, and improvise something with a better mirror...Lesson learned: don't buy something online that has no reviews, unless you've seen it in person...
