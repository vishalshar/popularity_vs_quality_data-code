I bought these for my daughter when she was four months old. She is six months old now and still doesn't like to use them. They hold a lot, but the nipple flow is too fast and she chokes on the milk because of it. I notice she doesn't eat much when I feed her from these bottles. The nipples are very soft, which is probably good as far as comfort, but it seems like they easily collapse in a lot of the time when she grabs hold of it or I touch it, and it causes milk to leak out. On a positive note, the top of the bottle, where the nipple screws on, is very easy to clean. Her other bottles have grooves that are almost impossible to get clean, so I really appreciate this. I also like that this bottle comes with a cap for each bottle and a piece of plastic that fits between the bottle and nipple to keep it from leaking if you have it in your diaper bag and it tips over (you take it out to feed the baby).
