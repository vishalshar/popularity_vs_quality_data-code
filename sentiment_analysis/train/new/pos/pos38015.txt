I love these! I wish my regular underwear were made from super soft fleece!  I actually use them because I am about 6 months pregnant and need a little protection when I sneeze or laugh because I leek a little....Anyway these pads have been great!  They stay in place pretty well, don't stick to your skin like disposables and go right in the regular laundry!  How easy is that! And, you can feel great that you are not adding to the already overflowing landfills!
