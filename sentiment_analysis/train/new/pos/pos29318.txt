I have been searching the stroller market for quite some time now in preparation for my new baby. I cannot tell you how many reviews I read and videos I saw on hundreds of different products until I came across this product and everything just fit. This is a very high quality stroller. It is not made in China, like so many products (and most of our strollers!!) we find in our stores now a days. It is made in Poland, with great thought and consideration put into the design both for mother and baby. A large part of the product is made of METAL and not some cheap plastic (including the spacious storage basket which I found quite impressive). It has a very nice durable feel to it, and I love the suspension. The wheels are great, and allow you to maneuver over pretty much anything if need be, including snow if you are an outdoorsy type like me. It is like getting a comfortable city stroller and durable jogger all in one!! It comes with so many features (like being able to rotate both the toddler seat and the bassinet to either face you or the world), and it has basically everything you could need right down to the rain & mosquito covers.Overall, this was a great buy and was definitely worth the money. I was going to spend almost the exact same amount (and in some cases more) on a stroller that can be turned into a pram, like the Contours Bliss ($400) or the Britax B-ready ($550 when bought with the bassinet) but these strollers do not measure up in either the amount of features or the quality of products. Any other product that is remotely like this costs close to and in many cases well over $1,000. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality product that will last them, and will provide great comfort both to the baby and the caregiver.
