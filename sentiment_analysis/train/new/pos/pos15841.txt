buyer beware, this product does not work well with newer vehicles.  We have a 2014 Prius and the sensor will not let the window close all the way up.  It does work in our older car, but it pushes up the seal between window and door. Our solution, we leave the window down by about 1/2cm.Otherwise, it works well.  I prefer to tint the windows of the car, but since I'm borrowing the car, I use this shade and it does the job.
