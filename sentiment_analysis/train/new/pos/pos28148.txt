I was reluctant to purchase this at first, because it's a fair amount more expensive than some of the generic alternatives and I'm frugal.  I have to say, I've been very pleased with the purchase.  We've used it for air travel 3 times, all on major holidays.  One of the benefits to getting the Uppababy bag if you have an Uppababy G-Luxe or Lite is once you register both products, they provide an additional warranty on the stroller if you travel with it in this bag.  That was a major selling point for me.  The bag zips all the way down it's length, making it pretty easy to put the stroller in the bag and zip it back up.  It also rolls up relatively easily, and has a velcro strap to secure it.  The rolled up bag does take up most of the G-Luxe basket.  The straps left enough room that you could put it on your shoulder, and the bag wouldn't slide off. The bag is certainly sturdy and I feel like the stroller is well protected. If you're going to invest in a moderate to expensive umbrella stroller, and you travel fairly frequently, this is a good way to protect your investment.
