I won't reiterate what many have already said about this product.  I have attached a few images so you can see for yourself.I almost didn't buy this product due to the numerous negative reviews about children pushing or pulling the latched gate to the point where it came loose and retracted.  After looking at their pictures and reading the instructions that came with my gate, it is obvious they installed the gate latches incorrectly.  If you read the instructions and use the convenient templates provided, you'll have a product that functions well.I'm a full-grown man (a beefcake of a man if I do say so myself), and I can't get the gate to "accidentally" come loose if I don't first "unlock" the spool on the opposite side (using the same unlock button necessary to close the gate).  Look at my images, don't be misled by CAPITALIZED REVIEWS, and make your own decision.  It's not perfect, but it does the job adequately.
