Purchased this product after much comparison and research on similar items.  Just found this item to be most bang for my buck.  Because this is an item that my baby will soon outgrown and I will not be able to use for more than a year, i did not want to spend too much money on it but at the same time wanted a safe and quality product.  After recieving item, slight assembly required (had to mount four wheels w no tools required - very simple)and i followed instructions exactly.  After that, was highly pleased with product.  I use this in tandem with my Graco snugride and it fits perfectly (as manufacturer suggests).  I have used this stroller all over the place and find it to be highly maneuverable and much lighter than conventional travel systems.  It is very convenient and useful overall.  Love the trifold convenience and compact size when folded (although you do need both hands to fold and unfold stroller - still really easy to do so).  When folded it also a lot more compact than its graco and snap and go competitors (which is the reason i chose this product over both options).  I have had it only a few weeks so cannot comment on its durability but seems sturdy enough so far and is constructed of good material.  I ended up giving my first one to a relative from out of the country as a good bye present when it was time for her to return home.  She let me know it made it through baggage handeling and made her trip home with a five month old baby much easier.  I have just purchased a second one for myself again.  That's how much i love this product.
