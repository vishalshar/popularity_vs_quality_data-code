My Granddaughters love to ride there bicycles and play in their Georgia front yard.  Traffic into their subdivision has a few "fast" drivers that don't think about children playing.  Bought this and stuck it out on the street and it really works.  Only one middle aged woman stopped and bitched about it and when we refused to remove it from the street she called the cops.  The cops came and we explained the problem and they congratulated us on our efforts.  They then went to the woman and told it was staying and it was because of drivers like her that it was needed.  No problem since.
