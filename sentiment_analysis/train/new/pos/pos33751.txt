We love our organic storage bins!We purchased two of these bins for our child's playroom. He uses one to hold blocks and one to hold trucks/cars. The design is cute and modern, the organic fabric is soft and safe (no dangerous chemicals, no unsafe glues, etc.), and they are HUGE. These bins hold A LOT -- ideal for toys.Unhappy reviewers have commented on two issues: 1) Floppiness and 2) Smell. We had NO problem with smell. In fact, given the reviews, I was careful as soon as I took these out of the packing-- no smell at all. As far as the "floppiness" goes, these bins are MEANT to be folded/collabsable. They are accurately described as made of 100% cotton and "collapsable." So be sure you are aware of this. If you are looking for rigid/structured storage, I would go with the boxes made by this same company. These bins are made of soft cotton and they fold right up for storage, packing, etc. They are sturdy enough to hold toys, but soft enough to fold.Highly recommended.
