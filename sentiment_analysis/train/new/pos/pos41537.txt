These are super cute and I love that they come in a neutral color. We wanted them for our playroom on the main floor, so I was so happy to find something still kid friendly, but without super bright non matching colors all over the floor. They were not as big or thick as the typical bright colored ones I was finding, but when I double checked measurements it was what was in description so that is my fault. The thickness of them works for the purpose of protecting the floors and my kids knees and heads though, so for the options you have for neutral colors, these are worth it.
