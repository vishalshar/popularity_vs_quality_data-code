I purchased these for my son who absolutely loves Finding Nemo. I had purchased another set of bath toys like this, but a Toy Story theme and was very happy with them. The toys are super cute, well made and do not have holes in them where water can collect which in my experience that makes them last longer. The only thing I don't like is that the little pink octopus is hard as a rock while all the other toys are very soft and flexible. It's kind of weird that one would be completely different. Not sure how that is going to go over in the bath tub, but I guess we will find out. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I think my son will enjoy them.
