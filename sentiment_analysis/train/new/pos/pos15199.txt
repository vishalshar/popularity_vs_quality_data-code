This rattle was one of the few that my son could actually grasp and keep ahold of when he was just a couple months old. Most of the others we tried were too large or too heavy for his little hands.I would definitely recommend for 1-3 month old babies. However my 4 month old has little to no interest in it anymore. That's the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars. But, since there are few toys out there geared towards tiny babies, this one was a good 2 month investment!
