I actually ordered this mattress for my Great Danes to sleep on. It's so much cheaper than the XL dog beds out there and it's also much easier to care for! I simply pull the toddler sheet off , toss it in the washer, and put a clean one on. Every so often I wipe the mattress itself down with a damp cloth between sheet changes and it cleans easily. When not in use, I just slide it under my bed! My 2 Danes, and 1 "Great" Pomeranian (who thinks it's a Great Dane) love it and it has held up wonderfully! Not just for toddlers! Excuse the bare floors. Pic was taken after the old carpet was removed and before the new carpet was installed.
