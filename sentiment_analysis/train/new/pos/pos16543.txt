It has taken our family 9 years and 4 kids to find the perfect sippy cup.  I have 2 one year olds who have been using the NUK learner cups since they were 6 months old.  They easily transitioned from bottle to cup due to the soft spout.  I love that I didn’t have to buy all new cups I just bought the replacement silicone spout that fits onto their existing NUK bottles.  There are no special valves or straws, I just wash the removable spout.  I have 3 cups per baby and after 6 months of prolonged use the spouts have shown no indication of wear.I will say that the bottles/cups can be pricey but given our success and the durability of the cups I say it’s well worth the investment.We recommend this to anyone with a baby or toddler needing a sippy cup.
