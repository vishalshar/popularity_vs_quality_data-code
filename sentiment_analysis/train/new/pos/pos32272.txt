I do understand the desire to not be over protective.  However I like the helmet because it is not a matter of *if* your child will fall and smack their head, not a matter of *if* they will face plant, but *when*.  I had a relative wondering just how badly their child scrambled their brain when their child's fall put a small  (temporary) dent and large bruise on his head.  Wanting to minimize the chances of that happening, I bought the helmet and so far it works well.  The chin strap doesn't bother my child most of the time.  If the strap does, I just put the strap over the top and the adjustable helmet fits firmly enough to stay put (most of the time.)  The helmet does retain some heat, so be cognizant of cooling your child---for example, I don't have my son in the helmet 24/7, just certain falling risk periods so to speak.  So far he has taken a few tumbles and bopped his head while wearing the helmet.  He a hasn't cried yet when he hits his head while wearing the helmet.  He certainly has cried when he has bumped his head without.  Not exactly scientific evidence, I know, but that is something I've noticed.  My son also likes to chase down our cats and grab their fur.  One cat took a swipe at him, but the helmet saved his forehead from a cat slap.
