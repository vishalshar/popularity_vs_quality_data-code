In our bedroom, the odor of waste still seems to be absent unless you are standing with your face a few inches from the diaper bin.  The non-biodegradables conceal the odor even at that proximity, however, I feel like whenever we can make compromises in favor of the environment and our long-term survival where the repercussions are slight in terms of inconvenience, it is imperative we do so.  The odor entrapment provided by the biodegradable version is definitely effective for those whose lives are lived more than 5 inches away from their diaper bins.
