I have four kids and they all take lunch.  We had purchased another style of all in one lunch box, but it had too many nooks and crannies.  My kids like to take stuff like pesto noodles for lunch and it just wasn't cutting it.  I found these and they looked fantastic.  We LOVE them.  There was a bit of a learning curve to getting the hang of shutting it all the way, but I make sure I always check them before they leave the house.  The different compartments are fantastic and the lid keeps anything from mixing.  We regularly put pasta with sauce or salads with dressing or breads with dips and they never mix together.  We've got four thumbs up from this house.
