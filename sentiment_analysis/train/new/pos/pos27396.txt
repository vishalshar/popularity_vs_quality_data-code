My daughter loves this! She's 6 months now, but has had it for a few months. It's long so even if she loses her grasp on one part of it, she can usually grab another part. She loves trying out her pincer grasp on the little legs.My grandma refers to it at a snake, so we call it a worm-snake now. Ummm, grandma, snakes don't have legs. But I digress...It's a fun toy, in fact my 7 year old cousin has hers still and sleeps with it as one of her toys she liked it so much. It's fun, colorful, noisy, and soft. They can bonk themselves with it and it doesn't hurt. It also isn't terribly overwhelming like some of the other toys. The colors are kinda cute!
