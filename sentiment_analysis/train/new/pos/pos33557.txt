It was exactly what I expected.  With my daughter still being a bit small (6 months) it sits up nicely.  It also folds up and tucks away in many easy places.  The only thing I have to complain about is the tray is a pain in the butt to connect to the chair but I tend to leave it on and fold it up with the chair which is a nice bonus.
