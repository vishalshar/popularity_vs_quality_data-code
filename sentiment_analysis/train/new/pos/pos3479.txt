Awesome awesome awesome. Both our boys love these!  The youngest was 7 months old when he started using it and didn't need much assistance at all (just observation in case he decided to make a mess on purpose). They are now 17 months and 4 1/2 years old and still love them. The older one loves applesauce or yogurt in it.I would recommend skipping the regular one and going right to the Sili Squeeze with Eeeze. The hole is a little smaller than the baby food pouches sold in the grocery store but very similar so it is a smooth transition and very little learning curve. Just make sure really little ones don't squeeze it before putting in their mouth or it could squirt into their hair and face. Lol! But naturally, that happens with the prefilled ones too. Very young ones may also need help with the final squeeze to get the last drops until they figure it out. It is very soft silicone but stands on it's own and comes apart completely for the dishwasher. I would also recommend considering if you little ones likes to play with lids and if this is a problem for mealtimes. The lid is tied so that it can't be tossed or lost, but our youngest loves to put tops on and off which sometimes distracted him from eating. If you are debating how many to have on hand, I can say 1 per child is probably plenty and then wash by hand if you need to use it again that day otherwise run the dishwasher overnight so it is ready for the next day. If you have an infant and are using it for baby food several times a day, maybe an extra one would be helpful considering the frequency of use.
