I have 2 little ones and I needed a bag that would allow me to organize, and also would attahch to my double inline stroller. The 2 square pockets on the front are big enough to fit size 3t-4t pull ups. The side pockets are quite large with a wide mouth so as to fit my childs odd shaped Lansinoh bottles in them. There is still the standard large pockets on the fron t and back with zip closures (which makes it easy to store the changing pad and a wipes case. There are 6 pockets on the inside that are designed for tradionally shaped bottles and a plastic removable wet clothes pouch that can be clipped to the string on the inside so as to not get lost. (the changing pad has a D-ring on it to also be clipped to the bag.) There is another zip pocket on the inside of the bag as well. I am able to store both kids diapers/pullups, wipes cases, and the changing pad all on the outside of the bag which allows for clothes, toys etc to be stored inside the bag. The outside of the bag is coated, so it has a vinyl feel to it (which I am growing accostomed to) and is easy to wipe clean. The interior is the same color as the changing bag and the pattern looks a lot better in-person. My only complaint is that the zippers tabs are in the center of the pocket when i recieved it and required me to pull it in one direction and then back in the other to allow for proper zipping functions. The stroller straps are metal clips (which i like) rather than your traditonal plastic clasps, which in theory will make them harder to break. I like the long strap that allows for cross-body carry and it is hard to have a tote on your shoulder and handle 2 small children. Overall I like this bag and it does what i want it to do.
