Gorgeous baby pink color that matches the Abstract Quilted Porta-crib Sheet Saver also sold at Amazon.com.  These mini-crib sheets fit my Dream-on-Me 38"x24" x 3" coil spring mattress perfectly even over the quilted mattress cover.  There is just enough fabric to nicely surround the mattress.  Not sure if it would fit the 5" think mattress as well.  Soft feel and a nice snug fit.  You cannot tell from the photo but the corners have a seam making the fit free of wrinkles.  Only washed them once so far but they came out soft and did not seem to shrink significantly.
