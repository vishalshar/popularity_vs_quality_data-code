Used cotton prefold diapers with my newborn from when she was 5 days old until she was 10 weeks.  After that she could fit into Best Bottom (daytime) and Bum Genious (nighttime) diapers I'm now using for her).  The snappis have held up great and I will be used on our next baby.  Make sure to take advantage of the wrap around rubber ends that protect them from catching on clothes and other cloth especially when tossing them in your diaper bag.  Considering the alternative (diaper pins?) this is an awesome product!If its helpful: For 10 weeks of newborn diapers I use the following: 2 Rumparoozs newborn covers, 2 Thirsties size 1 covers, one package of Snappis, and 18 prefolds (12 infant and 6 infant shorts from a local store).  I did laundry every 1.5 days with this stash but was doing my older daughters diapers as well so not a problem.  But to do laundry every other day with a newborn I would have needed 24 prefolds and maybe 2 more covers.
