At most hospitals - they will give your newborn a soothie pacifier - and your baby probably loves their soothieMy son sure loves his!!! We tried Mam bottles, Avent, Medela, Playtex, Gerber (and a handful of others) - he would only use the Mam bottles but even then, it took him forever to drink, and we'd have to encourage it. Finally (after getting a solid night's sleep) - it hit me that maybe we should see if Soothie makes bottles since he loves his pacifer so much. Lucky for me, there's the internet, lo and behold, YES! they do make them!! We went to our local stores to see who carries it - we found em, we bought em, we cleaned em and ever since, it's the ONLY bottle he'll use. This ba ba is awesome for the sole reason that my son loves them. They are very easy for him to grip, especailly when he was little and used the shorter ones. We originally got the starter kit which came with these little green tubs that we used to store snacks in (they were intended for powder, but we had a powder holder already). The tubs would snap onto the bottom of the bottles so that was kinda nice/neat.The bottles are great b/c they're dishwasher safe, the nipples seems to last a bit - I think we mostly changed them every 3-4 months. I don't think these are ortho friendly, or on any super mommy's list - but the fact that my son loves them, makes them a hit with me!! Happy baby = happy mommy.
