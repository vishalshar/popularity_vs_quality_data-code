We purchased this based on Moms of Multiples recommendations. We thought it might work, but weren't positive. After nearly 2 years of ownership, I must say that this has been the best 'diaper' bag that we have owned. We had 3 different ones with our first child and none of them worked very well.We used to have to carry 2 diaper bags for 1 child if heading out for a day of shopping, 1 to carry with us and 1 to refill it as needed during the day. Now we just carry the Baby Sherpa and are set for all 3 kids.This backpack is large enough to accommodate 16x size 5 diapers and 8x 5T pull-ups, 2x packs of wipes, 2x complete outfits for each of 3 kids, 2x tubes of Butt Paste, snacks for 3 kids, 6x small toddler juice bottles, 3x sippy cups, and a large bottle of water along with a few toys for the kids.We are going to purchase a 2nd one this month as we have a 4th little one on the way and plan to use one for the twins and 1 for the oldest and youngest kids.If you have a lot of stuff to carry for a single child, or you have twins, triplets, this is the diaper bag for you!!!
