Because it's Fisher-Price, I expected it would be good, but I was surprised at how easy and comfortable it is to use. The harness system is so simple, you don't have to spend hours trying to figure out how to put it on. It was very easy to put my son in, and I like the back support it provides. The buckles seem very sturdy, and because there are three sizes, it's very easy to get the right ones buckled. My wife likes the "extras" they provide--the pacifier case, cell phone holder and a pocket for keys and stuff. We didn't know if we would use the carrier that much when we first bought it, but our son is so happy in it and we like the hands-free convenience. We plan on having more kids, so the lifetime warranty is nice. I haven't tried out all the other carriers, but if you're looking for an easy carrier you and your baby will enjoy, this is the one.
