I switched to cloth because I was tired of night-time leaks. After trying different systems, I thought I would go with wool. These covers, once lanolized, are absolutely bulletproof. I use it together with either fitteds, countours or prefolds w/snappi. Love them!Not a trim fit but since I use it for nighttime, who cares. They are nice and soft to the touch, don't retain odors and you only need to wash it like once a month.Did i mention I love them? lol
