We purchased these for our daughter when she was about 18 months old and she has always really enjoyed them! They are a good step up from the simple chunky wooden puzzles and offer a bit more of a challenge to her at this point. She loves searching through the set to find the matching tails for all the animals -- overall they are quite entertaining for her! The puzzle pieces are thick & sturdy - she's been playing with them for about 3 months now and so far the only signs of wear & tear are on the box - the puzzle pieces still look great! And speaking of the box . . . my one small complaint is that the little rope handle that goes over the box lid is so short that it is difficult for us (parents) to open and therefore nearly impossible for our daughter to open - hence the ripped lid of the box. But, I guess I don't know if we just somehow ended up with a shorter handle than most of them have. Overall, a very fun product and I would recommend it if your toddler loves puzzles!
