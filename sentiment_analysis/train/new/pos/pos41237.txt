I've spent SO much time looking for the prefect stroller for my 22 month old son.. I consider myself extremely picky. When my son turned a year old I purchased a chicco lightweight stroller, loved it but my son is 33lbs and the stroller weight capacity was 40lbs so I sold it and purchased this City Mini stroller. Love it!! I purchased the bellybumper bar (for an adadditional 20$) so glad I purchased it even when my son would throw a tantrum I felt safe having him in the stroller. I loved the storage space underneath it was easy to fit essentials down there. I also love the canopy, its an extremely big canopy with 2 peekaboo windows! (A BIG PLUS!) Now, sadly I ended uo returning this stroller :( after a trip to the mall by myself with my son and niece (both are the same age) I realized I was going to need a lighter option, this stroller is hands down amazing, but for when my husband's not around and I'm out by myself I definitely need a lightweight option - the city mini is considered lightweight (17lbs), but I feel as though my chicco (22lbs) was lighter and easier to get in and out of the car - probably because my chicco folded 3D rather than flat like this one. Overall this is a great stroller I would have definitely kept it if I had the option of having this and a lightweight but unfortunately I couldn't. However I do reccomend this stroller to any mom out there as a stroller, but keep in mind it's not so lightweight.If you do purchase this stroller get the belly bumper bar as well.. keeps baby entertained and safe.
