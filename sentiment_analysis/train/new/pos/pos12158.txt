I have had this for months now and no matter what I or the baby does with it, it never leaks! The grips on the handles are easy for my 10 month old to grab. It's so fun to watch the satisfaction on his face when he can hold it on his own and get a drink. Everything is super easy to clean as well. The drinking tip is a soft"ish" material so I don't worry about the baby's teeth getting hurt on it either.  It is a sturdy rubber (somewhere in between the hard plastics and soft rubbers) and I think it is perfect.  My son hasn't tried to chew the tip off it yet and he has 6 teeth now.This is a no brainer 5 star product for sure and the only sippy cup we use!  We'll be ordering a couple more so I have some backups . . . you never know when one will go missing under the couch, between seats in the car or in the depths of the diaper bag :)If this review helped you in any way, for or against this product, please help me by clicking yes so I can continue to help improve my review language.
