Okay, its not the typical "disney" character.  It appears to be a bad knock-off but is so cute we couldn't return it. It has character. We refer to it as the "raggedy pooh" who looks like he has been on a honey bender with the red eyes and nose and shaggy fur and bend flower.  It was to unique to send back!
