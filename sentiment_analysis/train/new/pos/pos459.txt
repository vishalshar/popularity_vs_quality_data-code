While every child is different, mine was able to latch to EVERYTHING, so I feel I'm a pretty good judge when it comes to nipples.1. The slow flow is a PERFECT flow. The doctor even tested it out and was very pleased.2. I have tried avent, lansinoh, doctor browns, & these... these create the least mess. I don't know what it is about other nipples but they don't keep the milk in his mouth. I believe it is the extra round shape around the nipple that creates a block if he opens is mouth wider or becomes lazier while eating.3. NO NIPPLE COLLAPSE. Avent nipples were AWFUL with nipple collapse!4. No air bubbles! Even when I get lazy holding the bottle and think "shoot get t together" there are never ever bubbles in the nipple part. It seems great! (My son has acid reflux and I trust these the most)5. They're easy to clean. Cleaning all the different bottles we've tried, it's a pain when nipples have extra creases around the rim part or when the nipples do weird things like bulge out or indent in certain areas.I would greatly appreciate if you marked my review helpful as I hope I have helped!
