I bought this for my 5 1/2 month-old grandson.  It was a little smaller than I expected, but a nice size for babies. He absolutely loved it!!!  He understood the concept of placing the key in the 'ignition' to have the lights and sound.  I could even walk away from him momentarily without the fear of him hurting himself since it is all plush.  The front of the car is open at the bottom seam so kids will have the ability to keep pushing/sliding themselves out the front, but that could also be a good thing so the car won't squash their legs all up making it uncomfortable for them as they become toddlers.  Besides his Mom can always put something in front of him later, if it becomes an issue.  Also, will be an excellent climber for him when he starts crawling...without the fear of having his face banged up.  He loved the mirror,it has a built in bottle holder just like a real car and the steering wheel can come off and has velcro straps for alternate uses, e.g. stroller, car seat, etc.  Well worth the extra money to get it here in time for Christmas...especially, since no one else, even the actual company who makes it said that it would not get here in time regardless of the expedited shipping options.  Overall, absolutely adorable!! So glad that I finally decided on this and not one of the other plastic options that I had been considering...those I will leave for later :).  A very unique baby toy that I knew would not be a duplicated toy.
