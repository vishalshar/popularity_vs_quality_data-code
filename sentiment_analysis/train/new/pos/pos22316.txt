This bed rail arrived in about 1-2 days!  It fits my daughters converted crib- now daybed.  The directions are ok, not perfect, but the product is pretty self explanatory as far as assembly. It fits snugly to her toddler size mattress, only complaint being that it does lean inward slightly due to the design. Its nothing that causes an issue, just something I noticed.The inner frame part is unfinished and had a little bit of factory dust on it.  I simply took a wet cloth and wiped the whole thing down before hooking to her bed. I did run my hand along the unfinished parts to check for potential splinters. None found.  But if you have a biter/chewer might be one thing to consider. And the little "wall" clicks in and out very easily. In general I would definitely recommend this to a fellow parent!
