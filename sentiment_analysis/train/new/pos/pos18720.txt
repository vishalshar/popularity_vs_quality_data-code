Well, this is a GREAT alternative to the 6-12 month GERBER'S ESSENTIALS PACIFIER that was discontinued.  The only complaints that I have is that the handle tends to get in the way of little ones flailing arms resulting in it being knocked out (where most pacifier handles lay down) and it has a very strong rubber smell.  BUT, being that my newborn would only take the ones that I can no longer find, he doesn't notice a different with these, so I'll take it!
