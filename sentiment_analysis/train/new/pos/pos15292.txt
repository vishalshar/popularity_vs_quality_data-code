I have seen these in the past, but lived in a single-story apartment with my first two babies and the kitchen was close enough I didn't need one.  When I was expecting my third baby, we were in a two-story with all the bedrooms upstairs.  I didn't want to go downstairs at night, so I looked for one of these.  After scouring the local stores (they didn't carry them), I ordered this one off Amazon.When I ended up having a C-section, I was so glad to have this!It works wonderfully!  If you want the bottle warmer/cooler, just adjust the amount of water you put in up/down.  We like ours just room temperature to avoid risk of it being too hot, but not shock the baby with freezing cold formula.  The table in the instructions gives the right amount of water for a room temperature bottle.It's great to keep this by the bed.  I just have my husband stock it before taking the kids out, and I can stay in bed with baby and nap & recover, and still be able to feed him if he gets hungry.You can order extra ice packs (or so says the instructions).  My only wish would be that it came with two to start with.
