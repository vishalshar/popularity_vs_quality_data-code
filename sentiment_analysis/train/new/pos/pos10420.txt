After reading the previous reviews for these breast flanges I was hesitant to order them.  However, once I received them, sanitized them and gave them a try they work just fine. I used the larger size flange as my nipples tend to swell while pumping.  I think they are just a tad too big, so I gave the inserts a try.  I remembered some of the other reviewers said that they couldn't get a proper seal so I kept this in mind.  When you insert the smaller flange into the larger one the circle parts don't meet up, however, it didn't create a problem when pumping.  One thins I always do whenever I pump, regardless of the breast pump or flange (I have 3 different breast pumps) I use a bit of coconut oil inside the flange and on my nipples to prevent rubbing and chaffing.  So I believe that may have helped create a better seal.  If you are thinking about getting larger flanges these definitely helped my comfort level during and after pumping.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish the insert came as a flange instead of an insert.  It just adds one more step and more items I have to clean and store.
