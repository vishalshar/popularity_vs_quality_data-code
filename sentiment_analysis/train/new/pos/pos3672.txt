I bought this for my 8 month old that was starting to teeth really bad.  She had 4 teeth coming in at once and upon opening the package and giving this a quick cleaning, she started chewing on this like crazy.  After she went to sleep, I dared not take it away while she was awake, I looked at it and really got the feel of it and it made me almost want to chew on it.  It has a clean crisp smell that would attract any baby and a nice texture that a baby's gums really need.  My little one enjoyed it and I think yours would to.  Plus the price is right.
