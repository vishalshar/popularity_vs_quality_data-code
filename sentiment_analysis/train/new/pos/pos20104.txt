My son has the prayer doll boy edition so naturally when I had a girl this little lady had to join us.  She sleeps with it every night and has taken to regularly chewing on the puff ball at the end of the night cap.  The doll is durable and I consider it safe for my now one-year old.  It's holding up well so far - so is my son's which is now 3 years old and still says the bedtime prayer in an adorable little voice.  My husband bought me the bear version of the same thing when we were dating - 15 years ago - and the bear is in good condition although the voice gave out a year or so ago when my son discovered that it was "just like HIS baby."If you found my review useful, I would appreciate it if you click the button indicating that it was helpful!  Thanks!
