Do you NEED this? No. Sometimes I see it as just another thing to wash. Though it's simple design makes cleaning it a breeze. However, it does make things easier; I find I "need" it with some blends but not others. Not sure why that is. Either way, It's 4 bucks, so it really doesn't hurt to have on hand. If it cost more, I might only give it 3 stars, but considering the value I would say it's worth buying.
