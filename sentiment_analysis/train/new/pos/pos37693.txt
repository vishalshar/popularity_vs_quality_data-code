The snack trap works great (yes, buy the lid accessory set too).  The lid is easier than other snack cups for little fingers to get in and out of.  The cup is also smaller & less bulky than some of the others available.My one complaint is that it is not gender neutral.  I received a green cup with a dinosaur -- I can see this being almost gender neutral... but the other one was primary blue with a primary red race car on it.  As far as gender color themes going, this is as boy as it comes.  Oh well... it's still a good product and we're using it anyway.  I'm on baby #1 so if #2 is a boy, then I guess I'm all set.
