While Lumitusi is cute, the spinning mechanism stopped working almost right away. I attempted to contact the company, but there is an error and their website won't allow me to submit my e-mail (there is no number listed). I wouldn't order again!UPDATED:A day after writing this review, Lumitusi contacted me via e-mail and phone. They are shipping out a brand new Octopus at no charge. Fabulous customer service! I would absolutely recommend this product not only because it's cute and my and soothing, but because of the great customer service.
