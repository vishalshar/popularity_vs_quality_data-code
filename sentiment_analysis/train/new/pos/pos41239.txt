This stroller is one of the best that I have used. It works with one hand and it really stands alone. It was easy to put together I did it in about 15 mins. It has a slim frame and the wheels are great they do a full 360 so you can go anywhere and they roll over bumps and curbs with ease. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the hood on the top to me does not cover enough the sun still gets in baby's eyes. The boot is nice also
