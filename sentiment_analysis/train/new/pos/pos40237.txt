I looked at A LOT of bath toys before choosing these. I didn't have a lot of money to spend and of all the similarly priced toys these seemed to be the best choice. They arrived and I was instantly positive I had made the right choice. They look like the pictures and are made with a variety of textures (soft, hard, scratchy, smooth). They are also easily washable. I throw them in the washing machine and then set them in front of a fan to speed drying.My daughter (22 weeks) LOVES these. Especially chasing them down with her little flailing hands and chewing on them. If you wring them out and place them out to dry they don't take too very long. Similar to a wet towel after a shower.The squirter toys get the water out a good distance so be careful!I am very pleased with this purchase.Oh - sidenote - I was at BabysRUs and saw these for sale. The price was $5.99 for the octopus and the fish. So purchasing onine at Amazon was definitely the way to go.
