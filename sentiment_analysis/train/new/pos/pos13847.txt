Absolutely love these pouches!! I'm not sure why others are so confused as to the contents of this item when it clearly states "Spouts and Spoons sold separately." We have been using the Kiinde Twist system and are now using the Foodii system that baby is older. I love pumping into these. It makes life so much easier. We have not experienced any leaks.I did previously own the Infantino Fresh Squeezed station. I didn't have issues with the product, but once Kiinde came out with the Foodii system I abandoned Infantino completely. I LOVE that my daughter can use these pouches and have the white outer plastic part to keep her hands from freezing while she eats a cold yogurt pouch. Such a great idea.We actually do re-use the pouches but in order to do so you have to make sure that no food is spoiling in the pouches and spreading bacteria. I have a degree in food safety and am comfortable with the process that I use: When my daughter is finished with a pouch I rinse it out with hot soapy water. I then place the pouch into the freezer until I am ready to refill pouches. There is no way to fully dry the inside of these pouches and ensure that mold and bacteria do not grow inside the pouches. This is why I freeze them to be sure to stop anything from growing inside the pouches.
