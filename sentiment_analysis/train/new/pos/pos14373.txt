I bought two of these for my twins. My primary car seats are Britax Roundabout 50s. Comparing those to these is like comparing a Mercedes to a Kia, but these Cosco seats are perfectly adequate for my second car that I use for quick trips to the store on weekends and sometimes for short trips to or from daycare during the week. I give them four stars rather than five because (1) they aren't blue as advertised (they're black) and (2) I had some trouble installing them rear-facing using the latch system in an Acura TSX. I had to get a really strong neighbor to pull the straps tight enough. It takes brute force. Also, the seats don't recline quite as much as I would like them to. When I tried putting a pool noodle under the front to recline them more, we couldn't get the latch straps tight enough. Another thing potential buyers should be aware of: Some Cosco Sceneras seem to have more padding in them and have higher quality fabric than others. I looked at a couple of Sceneras in a Target store that were cheaper than the pair I ultimately bought here at Amazon. The Target seats had no padding in them at all and had really cheap fabric. The seats I bought from Amazon were, I think, $10 or $15 more expensive but have nicer fabric and extra padding.
