Simple design and highly visible when placed in a not obstructed spot in the rear window of the car. While others have noted that the suction failed to hold securely (and the sign would fall constantly), I have not had this problem. I wet the suction cup and made sure I cleaned the spot onto which I placed the suction. This is sign is different from the standard yellow sign, but I chose this because I have a baby girl and thought the pink color would be fun. This is an add-on item through Amazon, so make sure you meet the minimum order amount to get this sign at the very low price.
