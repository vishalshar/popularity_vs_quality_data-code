This teether works great for babies of all ages.  It is especially good for younger babies due to it's small size.My son has been using this teether since he was about 3 months old and absolutely loves it.  He's able to easily hold and manipulate it on his own.  He can reach both his front and his back teeth with it.The orange part of the teether is appximately 2 1/2 inches in diameter.  The yellow nubs are approximately 1 inch.  The opening in the center is approximately 1 1/2 inches.The only thing I don't like about this teether is the rattle.  There are two small holes on the bottom of the rattle.  Water gets into these holes when I clean the teether and is very difficult to get the water back out creating a potential breeding ground for mold.  If your baby chews on this part of the teether then the rattle can also fill up with drool which is very difficult to clean out.  I check this part of the teether frequently to make sure there is no mold developing.
