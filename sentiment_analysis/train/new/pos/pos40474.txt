Super cute, love the design, but the batteries die after one use, which doesn't have anything to do with the type of batteries, I've tried them all. Not leaving it on either. Also this isn't collapsible which is a bummer since most rock and play sleepers are. However my baby loves it and this is the only thing I can set her in without her screaming and crying.
