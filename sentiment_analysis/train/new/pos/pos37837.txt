I've been researching strollers for the past 5 months of my pregnancy. With just 3 weeks to go, I finally made the choice to go with the Fast Action. My main reason for choosing this one was for the reclining feature. I decided to go with a convertible seat for infancy to toddler, so I wasn't going to have a traditional stroller travel system. I wanted a stroller that would comfortably and safely fit an infant. The assembly was a cinch, with the exception of the little wires that go on top of the washer before the hubcap on the back wheels. It took my a good 10 minutes each wheel, when the help of a flat head screw driver to get it on. It's such a tiny piece and doesn't open well. Be cautious, it flung across the room a few times. This is a very light stroller when a convenient folding feature. I appreciate that. It also glides so easily, very smooth. Lots of storage underneath and two cup holders on both parent and child tray. The last thing is I liked is the all black plastic trim. I see a lot of gray or brown plastics that get really grimy and unattractive. I think the black looks great... it isn't very 'girlie' but with a little pink ribbon or something, it will be cute.Over all, totally excited about my purchase and can't wait to try it out when my baby girl arrives.
