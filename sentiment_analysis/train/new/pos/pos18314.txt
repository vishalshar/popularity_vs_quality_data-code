This has been the #1 purchase of my year.  I get stopped on the street almost daily with people wanting to know where they can find this carrier cover.  It's easy to use and gives us great warmth (not so much from the thickness of the fabric, which is like a thin sweatshirt, but more from trapping mine and baby's body heat in to warm him.)  Super great price, too, when you compare it to the others that are available.  I don't know how a baby-wearing city mom could live without this.  Almost all of my friends have purchased this now.
