After receiving the Green Toys Tea Set for my daughter's second birthday, I saw these plates, bowls and spoons and ordered them.  They are a great size for a young toddler, not too big but big enough.  This is a wonderful company, making safe plastics from recycled material. Unlike other plastic dishes, these are dishwasher safe (they don't emit poisons when heated).  They are not recommended for the microwave, but we use a glass dish to heat in the microwave and transfer over anyway.  Even their packaging is great.  The price also can't be beat. This would make an excellent gift for a new eater, but is great for any child who likes to eat :-)
