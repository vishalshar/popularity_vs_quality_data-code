I purchased these for my kindergarten daughter. She wears uniforms to school. NAVY BOTTOM, light blue or white top. So I wanted something to JAZZ up her uniforms. These are an alternative to tights,so for a small child, that's still wearing pullups, these are perfect. The stay up, and in place.I would not put these on a boy. The are for girls.I only hand wash them, and let them hang dry. I imagine these would pill up, in the washing machine.Overall, a good value and items arrived well packaged.
