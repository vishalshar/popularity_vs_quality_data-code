We bought this to use at my Mother-in-Law's house so we don't have to take the one from our house (different brand).  I love this play yard.  The standard sheets (27x39) fit this much better than the one at my house because it's slightly larger than mine.  The sheet goes on great and I don't have to tuck any extra material under the mat.  It has a nice organizer on one side and a cute pattern on the front.  I think the pattern is supposed to act as a shade from the light because there's no piece of material that covers the front, but I can't tell.  Also, at least one of the sides doesn't have mesh, but it may be both the left and the right that are solid (I can't remember).  There's a mobile that can be placed in one of two spots on the front or two spots on the back.  The only downside is the mobile doesn't spin unless you move it by hand; I wish it had a motor.  We haven't used the changing table, but it seems sturdy.  The mat is also sturdy- it doesn't sag, and it's easy to set up and take down.Overall, I love this play yard.  I love the bright colors and it's a perfect size and build.
