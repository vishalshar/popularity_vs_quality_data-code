Awesome case and battery pack.  Adds some extra weight and size but thats how i prefer my phones since i'm less likely to drop it if it has some weight.  Only complaint is the headphone jack is too long for normal earbuds, and the ones that come out sideways from the jack have no chance with the battery pack on your phone.  Not being able to charge the battery pack and phone at the same time is kinda lame, but it has doubled my battery size and now i never have to take chargers with me.  Definite must-buy for college kids who spend all day in classes or out all night drinkin, No more dead phones late at night when you try to call a buddy to crash at their place, or when you try to save a chicks phone number lol
