I registered for this bear and received it early before my little one was born.  I would hold it up to my belly and play the different sounds.  Then when he was born 5 weeks early and with some medical issues, I made sure to put it in the NICU with him.  When he came home 35 days later we use it every night to help relax him and so he could easily fall asleep.  He is almost 17 mths now and we STILL use it.  He loves his little bear for night time.  I also bought one so he could have it at Grammy's house and have since bought a pink one for a friend.  This is my new go-to gift for new Mommies... this and wubbanubs are the best things EVER!
