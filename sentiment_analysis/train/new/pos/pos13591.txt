Those elusive caps for baby bottles do an essential job protecting the nipple from contamination especially when you are on the road. They are so easy to lose or misplace and that is why extra on hand is so important. I am glad I found those selling on Amazon, because I could not find then anywhere (meaning going to the local usual suspects of chain stores). At any rate, ordering online was easy and fun and I am glad I got them. Will go back to this seller for more stuff as needed. Highly recommended.
