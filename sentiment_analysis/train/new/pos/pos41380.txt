I really like this juice box holder, as it has solved my problem with the "juice box squeeze".  However, it is awfully expensive! My son seems to like the fact that it has Sesame Street characters on it, and it's very durable.  I also like how it fits many different sizes/brands of juice boxes. Also, it takes a little "elbow grease" to get the top part to snap in, so my 2yr old can't take it apart.  All in all, a great product!
