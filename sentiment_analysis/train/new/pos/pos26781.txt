We have a less usual style of bathroom faucet.  Instead of pulling up on a spigot knob to activate the shower, we pull down on a ring at the water spout.  Most spout covers don't leave enough room at the water opening to allow fingers in to pull down the ring, but this one does.  Well, it does for my average-sized woman's hands.  My husband finds it a bit easier to lift the cover a little to give him more room to grasp.  But even so, it does lift a little without having to take the whole cover off!  (It also easily accommodates the more common spout style.)We are actually on our second spout cover.  We had the first for about a year before my energetic toddler manages to rip the silicone securing strap off.  (Thus the 4 rating instead of a 5.)
