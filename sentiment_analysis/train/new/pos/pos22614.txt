My two year old little boy had been showing a lot of interest in potty training. I wanted to find him something that helps motivate him in the process. This chart helped quite a bit! We pinned it at his level, just outside our main floor bathroom (the one we use most often). I wrote with erasable marker the times I wanted him to attempt going potty (7,9,11,1,gap for nap, 4,6,8) on the chart. He didn't always need to go, but we would take advantage of the opportunity to try and practice the other important things in training, like flushing and washing hands. I explained to him that if he tried each time and filled up his chart, he would get a small toy (dollar store). If he filled up his chart for a whole week, he would get a $5 toy. We also gave him stickers or tattoos for a in the moment reward. He loved adding the stars to the chart and really enjoys books, so the fact it came with one was great. We just added it to our collection of potty books that he reads over and over while he sits and waits. We didn't use the certificate. Honestly, it took about 6 months before we got him 100% potty trained. This means he stays dry at night too! We no longer need to remind him every two hours and he tells us when he needs to go. So at that point, I had forgotten about the certificate. I didn't give it 5 stars because I think it should have left a step for something we write in. Pulling up his pants was the hardest part for him, I wish that would have been a step I could add. Other than that, I'd recommend this potty chart and would use it again for my next child.
