I can't say enough good things about this swing! We started using it the day my son came home from the hospital and spent time in it (and often napped in it) every day until he was about 6 months old. We loved that the colors were very neutral and pleasing. Since it was in our living room we didn't want anything to bright or "babyish". I was a little worried about having to replace the batteries often, but we only had to change them twice in 6 months with daily use. We never used the tray so it was great that it could be completly removed - this also made it easier to get him in and out and to place blankets over him. My son loved the music and nature sounds, and they weren't annoying like some musical toys. He didn't really notice the mobile and mirror until he was about 2 months old, but once he found them, he was mesmerized. The mirror was great because he loved looking up at his reflection when the mobile wasn't moving. One minor issue with this swing is that is takes up a lot of space. If you have a small space then this might not be the best choice.All in all, this swing was among the best purchased we made for our baby and would recommend it to anyone!
