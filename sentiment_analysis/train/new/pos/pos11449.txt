The umbrella stroller works well and is very lightweight making it easy to use, especially in stores since it can actually fit through the aisles. It also folds up very small (for a stroller) so it's easy to store. My one and half year old uses it as a play stroller as well. I got the monkey design,which is very cute and playful.
