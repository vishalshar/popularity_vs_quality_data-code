After trying a Gerber suction bowl set from Walmart, I decided to read some reviews before trying again.  I'm glad I did!  The base stays on the bowl MUCH better, and sticks very well to the high chair's plastic tray.  My daughter did manage to slide and get it up eventually, but only because I let her play too long.  I just wanted to see if she could.  She's over 14 months and very strong/coordinated, so I don't think little babies could budge it at all, and it's probably among the best available for toddlers.The bowls measure 3.5, 4, and 4.5 inches in diameter (inside the top rim).  The lids snap on very tightly.  According to the package, the lids & bowls are dishwasher safe, and the bowls are microwavable (with lid & base removed).  The colors/designs are cute for girls or boys.  Basically the same as the photo, but mixed up...  (For example, my small bowl/lid are green/purple instead of green/orange.)I do wish there was a base for each bowl so I could leave a set at Grandma's, but I suppose I could order another piece..?I left off one star because I'd like extra bases and just a little bitty bit more suction.
