These little bibs were perfect when our tiny granddaughter was drooling buckets. She has extremely sensitive skin, and these bibs never caused any irritation. They are soft and feel good to the touch. They also absorb a lot of drool.If you have a large-necked baby, these may not work for you, as the bibs have a small neck opening. Our granddaughter outgrew them by the time she was nine or ten months old, and she is a skinny little thing, so I do not recommend them for a larger baby.
