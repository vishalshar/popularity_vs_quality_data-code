In hindsight though, we could just fill up the bottom of the sink with hot water. This uses much less water though and we can take the warming bottle to another room. Easy to clean, dishwasher safe. All the pieces come off and are easy to put back on for cleaning. Its best to put the bags of breastmilk in here, it warms super fast. The hot sensor is silly though, we peeled it off. We just use the hottest water that comes out of the tap, and it is about 130 degrees F, the milk is warm in a few minutes even from frozen. There is no need for boiling water or anything like that.
