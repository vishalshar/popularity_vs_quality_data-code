I was looking for a non-creepy anatomically correct doll for my son.The boy doll has all the necessary parts, but not butt crack (there is a seem, but it doesn't go "in") or nipples.The hips & shoulders have swivel joints.The hair is less than adorable, but not a big concern for me. The doll sits on the potty easily enough.
