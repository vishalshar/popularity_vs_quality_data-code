Its not perfect but i havent found something that is as simple and easy to use for breastfeeding while moving around. One thing to note is that youll likely need the xs size vest if you are size 12 or under. However the xspouch is tiny. My 4 week old baby fills the entire lenght and will probably be dangling her feet/ legs out of the pouch before too long. I would order the larger pouch to start and see if you can make it work. Otherwise you'll probably be buying the small pouch for a couple of months only before needing to size up.
