I read a lot of reviews before I purchased this for our 2 year old daughter's room. I saw the complaints about this falling apart, flimsy materials, badly written instructions, etc. So here's my take:I bought this dresser knowing that essentially, it is disposable. I figure we may get 5 years out of this dresser before it's time to yard sale it or haul it to the dump. So why would I spend this much money on something I figure I'll end up throwing away? Because I'd rather spend a little money on something that I am won't be too upset about getting knicked, hit, and marred in various manners and degrees by our 2 year old and her little sister. It is a good option for ample storage, and something you do not care about getting damaged.The unit, when assembled, looks very nice. I found the instructions to be pretty easy to follow, so I can't say I understand other's complaints about them being badly written. The materials are flimsy, particularly the bottoms of the drawers, but unless you're planning to store 100 pounds of children's clothes in each drawer, they're adequate. The main reason I didn't give this five stars was because there was some marring on finished surfaces from the packaging - fortunately, it's on edges that are unseen.Bottom line, if you want a nice looking, easy to assemble piece of furniture for your child's room, this is a good choice. But if you're looking for something that will be extremely durable and can become "heirloom" furniture, this is not for you. You will not find real hardwoods, tongue & groove construction, etc. While you CAN find that type of furniture online (perhaps wayfair, or other comparable retailers) your best bet is to go to a quality furniture store, and be prepared to pay for something that is highly durable and built to last.
