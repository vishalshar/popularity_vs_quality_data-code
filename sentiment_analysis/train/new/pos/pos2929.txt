I love this stroller. Its very lightweight which was our top priority. Not bulky at all.easy to unfold and fold. Easy to manuever even with one hand!it comes with the rain cover which is excellent.the recline seat level is great enough for my 6 months old baby I used it when he falls asleep during i do the shopping.The only con I see is that the wheels get the canopy a little bit dirty when you fold the stroller down. But no biggie!I really recommend this product!
