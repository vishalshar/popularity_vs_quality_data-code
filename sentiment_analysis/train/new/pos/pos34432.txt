I love this. I used to think that the leash thing was sort of torturous and in ways inhumane, but of course so is that split second when your kiddo goes running off. My little guy is so eager to explore he seems to forget he want to leave mom and dad behind. All it takes is a blink and boom, he is heading out. He is one that will throw a fit if his independence is interrupted by hand holding or dare i say carrying, if you arm is feeling strong. He loves animals, especially monkeys, and this is great. He wants to wear it feeling like a big kid after seeing his older siblings with their backpacks coming and going from school. Keeps him at the safe distance to travel around on his own two, but not to where he will put himself potentially in harms way. Plus i can keep the wipes and an extra in it for yhe just in case while out and about. Cute, helpful, and the extra go go gadget needed for a zoomer.
