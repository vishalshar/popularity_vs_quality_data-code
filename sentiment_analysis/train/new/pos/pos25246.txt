This is the best thing a person can invent for a baby other than diapers! My 5-month old daughter absolutely loves it. Though she isn't eating solids yet, she sits with us during out meals. She enjoys being independent while watching mommy clean up and cook. I can rest her down to sit within distance. Best thing of all, when I need to shower, I put her right next to me to watch and remains happy. She loves being a part of the show and enjoys being involved within her surroundings. Beyond that, the entertainment tray keeps her thinking and she now can twist the toys.
