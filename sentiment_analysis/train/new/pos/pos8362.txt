My husband and I bought the Cosco Slim Fold High Chair when our son was  finally eating solids. We lived in a one bedroom apartment with 550 square feet, therefore space was an issue. We needed to find something useful yet easy to store. We didn't have a table so a chair that attaches to the table or chair was pointless. We needed a high chair. We shopped around for the best price.The Cosco Slim Fold High Chair was our pick.For starters the Cosco Slim Fold High Chair, slim fold is exactly that slim. The slim fold allowed us to store the high chair easily and without taking up too much room. The slim fold also allowed us to trandport the Cosco Slim Fold High Chair to grandmas house or other family members houses without a struggle. The Cosco Slim Fold High Chair is easy to clean which is nice , because lets face it kids are gross when they eat. Smearing food and spilling can be a terror if you have something difficult to clean. The Cosco Slim Fold High Chair literally allows you to hose off the chair with no damage or taking a wet cloth to it, if you do not want to break out the hose. It came in handy with things besides meal time as well, like play time. Finger painting was a breeze in the Cosco Slim Fold High Chair.
