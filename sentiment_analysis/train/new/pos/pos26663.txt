I love these crayons. The trick to keeping them from turning to mush, is keeping them out of the water. I have a little bowl that I keep them in and my daughter (2years old) sets the bown on the edge of the tub and just takes out the crayons she wants to use. She has dumped the bowl into the tub once or twice, but if you pick them up right away then they're fine. It's like a bar of soap, if you let it soak in the tub, it's going to turn to mush. If you keep it mostly dry when not in use, it will last a lot longer.
