This swing is smaller than some, and doesn't have all the features that other larger swings have, such as the music options.  But we owned a bigger one with our first child and then ended up giving it away and then buying this one with our second child, and all those extra features are pointless to spend money on.  I also actually like that this swing is a bit smaller because it takes up less space and does the same job as the bigger swing.  It's also battery operated and that's all I really care about.  We never used the music or other sounds with the other swing anyway, so why pay more for them?  Also, if you aren't sure if your child specifically is going to like the swing, it's nicer to find out by spending less money than paying a lot for some "elite" swing and then your baby hating it.  I would recommend this swing.  It was easy to put together and it takes "C" batteries, so make sure you have some on hand when it arrives!
