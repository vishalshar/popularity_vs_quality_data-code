I bought this for my 1 year old. This is a really cute 2 pack set. If you have purchased Sassy products before, it's the same quality as usual.These are nice since they are easy to grip for your little one. It makes plenty of noise to keep them entertained and safe to chew on. This is very inexpensive entertainment, so enjoy that while you still can. I also included a photo of how they are packaged together and you can see how they will arrive.Overall, great set for a great price.
