I have to preface this review by saying that the 5 Star Rating is based on MY particular needs.  It works perfectly "out of the box", with no assembly or hardware, and has a simple easy to operate design. This is a small lightweight pressure gate which I use to keep my 8 lb. poodle confined in the kitchen when necessary.  I also do some volunteer work for animal rescue and sometimes will foster a puppy, whch obviously has to be confined to a specific area!  To that end, it works perfectly for me.  It has just enough tension to withstand the slight pressure of my dog or a puppy leaning on it, or jumping up and pushing on it.I would NOT use this gate for a child or larger dog.  It's too lightweight and, in my opinion could be easily overturned.  In that case I would give it 3 Stars.  For a child I would recommend a heavier, sturdier type gate, especially at the head of a staircase or other potentially dangerous areas.But if you're looking for an easy, lightweight "room divider", which is also small enough to step over so you don't have to keep taking it on and off, this is a perfect solution.
