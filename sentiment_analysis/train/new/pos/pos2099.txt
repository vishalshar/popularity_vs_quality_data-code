I was hesitant, after reading some not great reviews, to buy these giraffes. But honestly both my husband and myself are very happy with this purchase for our 6 week old daughter. We have the travel giraffe downstairs in her pack and play and always attach it in her car seat when we leave. The bigger giraffe is in her crib. They both have 4 different sounds (play, calm, relax & sleep). The only sound they don't share is the sleep sound. The big giraffe has a mothers heartbeat and the travel giraffe it's a waterfalls sound. My daughter seems to like the calm sound the best , which is crickets and toads. I will actually fall asleep listening to that sound with her when we're both laying down. The batteries are still holding up but we've only had the giraffes for about 3 weeks. There are 2 timers which are 20 and 45 minutes I think. I don't have an issue with how long the sound plays (some people wish they would play longer) because it doesn't take my daughter 45 minutes to fall asleep. And I don't want the sound to constantly play to the point where it has no effect on her. And this doesn't calm her down EVERY time. But I wasn't expecting that. She's a baby ... She's going to be fussy and mad for whatever reason for however long until she's done. No amount of soothing sounds, bouncing, back patting, bribing , begging and pleading is going to get her to calm down when she's reached that level of mad. So if you're aware of all of that and still looking for a soother then this one is pretty great. And I love giraffes so that made it even better , for me :) Hope this helps.
