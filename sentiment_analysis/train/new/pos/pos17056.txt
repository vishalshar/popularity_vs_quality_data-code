I bought this to protect my Britax Pavilion 70-G3 car seat. It fits fine without any struggle. I traveled by myself several times and managed to pack my car seat into this bag on the curb at the airport sans any issues. I managed to put a good many diapers and a couple coats in this bag, too. The bag held all comfortably and didn't see any straining on the zipper.Unfortunately, the bag started to come apart where the front canvas meets the plastic. After a few flights the hole grew and so did my disappointment in the product. It still did it's job but I think the hole would just get worse with more use. On a whim, I contacted Brica via their website and told them of my troubles. A few days later they responded and are sending me a new bag. I couldn't be happier with the outcome. I would have had to buy this bag again when the original one became unusable. That's right, I would have bought the same bag although it got a hole in it. I like the general design and the fact that I'd be replacing a $40 bag and not a $250 car seat.
