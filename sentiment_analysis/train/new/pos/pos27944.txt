I was looking forever for a plate that has 3 sections that were not just one big section and TINY other sections and this is PERFECT..she can have her fruit, vegetable, and a meat right there for my daughter. I own 12 of these plates and they go through the dishwasher (top rake) and microwave (very short time is all ive tried so far) and they are not warping or anything. I love these plates. Wish i could pick which color I want, but its ok since they are such good plates (i see them lasting and being able to use them for the next baby).
