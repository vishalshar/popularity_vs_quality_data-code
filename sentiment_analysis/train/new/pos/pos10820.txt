I live in NYC, so a stroller is pretty much the only method of baby/kid transportation. It can get very cold and windy, so a warm stroller bundle is a must. There are many polyester options on the market but this is the only one that I found that is made of actual sheep fur, so my babies stay warm, but never hot or sweaty. I can't tell you how many times I get asked on the street about this "lamy" - everyone wants to know where they can get one!The reasons I am not giving it all 5 stars are all relatively minor. They are:a) it would have been drastically better if it had a zipper, not buttonsb) it needs an extra button/loop to stay tight around the baby's neck/chest area (but it's easy to add)c) it doesn't have any way of attaching to a stroller, so it may slide down, especially when your baby is an active toddler. However, you can fix it with a large safety pin, or a ribbon (thread the ribbon through the slats for shoulder straps and tie on the back of the stroller).Oh, and don't bother with the small size - get this large one, as it's not that large anyway. We have tried it with the Bugaboo (both the bassinet and the regular seat) and our Maclaren umbrella stroller and it fits both perfectly.
