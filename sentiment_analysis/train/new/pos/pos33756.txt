This is a perfect quick solution for getting meds out of little hands.  The dial can be a bit tricky to open, but that is the point!  Lightweight, fits in the vanity drawer when I want to get it off the counter, and easy to clean (when the bottle of cough syrup leaks.)  It is on the smaller side so if you have lots of larger bottles, you may have an issue without lying them down.  But the domed lid lets it hold more than you think.  We are ordering a second one so his meds and her meds can be separate.
