This was very easy to assemble. I bought it nearly a year ago for my sister's baby shower.  My nephew is now 9 1/2 months old, and it has held up with him all this time! I would advise this basket to anyone with a baby!  It feels a little rickety when you are first feeling it.  It's really only good for a sleeping baby until they start to sit up and roll over on their own. It has however been a godsend to continue with a place to put him down for a diaper change so he can't roll away (of course without the hood).  It's great, it's cute.  It makes for a really good baby shower decoration, that can then be used functionally with the baby actually here. Then after the baby gets too big to lie in it themselves, it can be used to keep their toys or books in. It's a basket that keeps on giving until it breaks.
