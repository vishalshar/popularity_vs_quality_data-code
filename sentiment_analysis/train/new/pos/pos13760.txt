The gate was pretty easy to install and seems sturdy. But it's been a few years since we bought a baby gate and boy do I wish I had thought more about what makes a truly good gate before buying this one.  So a word to the wise:  if you anticipate needing to open and close your gate one-handed (it's not as easy if you're using your non-dominant hand, i.e. the one you carry your child with), have preschoolers who might need quick doorway access to avoid potty accidents, or generally don't want to bother with closing and latching it each time you walk through--you're going to want a gate with the auto-close feature.  $15-20 more for highly rated models that auto-close is money well-spent in my opinion.So if you're a first-time parent or just need this for your pets, go for it--it will do the job just fine.  It's just a real pain to manage with multiple kids with various hand strengths and safety needs.  I'll be shopping for an auto-closing gate within the week, if not by the end of the day.
