I absolutely loved the Kolcraft Bassinet. It was perfect for my baby till she was 5 months old. The Vibes mobile was beyond comforting for my baby and she loved the sounds. it had birds chirping, rushing water, crickets and i think one more setting. then it also played classical music and had a light with stars that turned. the basket below was perfect for storing sheets and toys. I loved it so much i actually gave it to a friend who is currently pregnant.I would buy it again if i needed to.
