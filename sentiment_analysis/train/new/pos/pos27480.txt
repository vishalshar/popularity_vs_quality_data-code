We have a Baby Jogger City Mini GT and we love this bag.  There is only one con, but the pros far outweigh the one issue.The pros are:Once you remove the wheels (which is super easy on these strollers), the stroller fits easily into this bag.  I'm not sure why others said it only fits one way.  I haven't found that to be true, and I just toss it in (after putting the wheels into the pockets).  The bag also has an expander zipper.  In our recent travel, we also fit in a crib wedge along with the stroller, for example.The bag is slightly padded so that your stroller is protected.  This was great - especially after seeing the other gate check items come back wet and roughed up...When packing the car full of stuff for a vacation, this bag packs the stroller flat and small.  Once the stroller is in the bag, it is much easier to pack things around, under, and on the bag vs. the awkward stroller alone.There is a removable shoulder strap for this bag that helps with carrying.  Which brings me to the only con:The con:The bag does not collapse.  So, when not in use, though it is flat, it is not small.  We were still able to hang it on our stroller handlebar, and others said they forced it to fold, but it is not small.  We could have just used a gate check canvas bag, but we wanted to protect the stroller more - and this bag did that.Still, this one issue is not a big deal compared with the benefits!
