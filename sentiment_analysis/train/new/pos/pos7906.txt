I don't even remember how I stumbled upon this but I'm so glad that I did! We bought two of these for our twins when they were about 15 months old and I wish we had got them much sooner. These are perfect for eating out at restaurants and not having your children throw plates on the floor.  We used to scrub the table when we sat down and have the kids eat directly off the table, because plates would automatically get thrown on the floor.  Now I carry these in the diaper bag and pull it out as soon as we get to the restaurant, and the kids have a nice clean sanitary place to eat off of! When they are done eating we snap these up with all the mess and dirty utensils inside, shove them back into the diaper bag, and they get put in the dishwasher when we get home.  After many uses and trips through the dishwasher they are holding up great! They have also been scribbled on with crayons and they cleaned up well with a quick scrub.Suction Cup Note:  You have to wet the suction cups to get them to stick & to stay stuck to the table.  If you don't they will pop up quickly after sticking down.  Yes, your child may be able to pull this up eventually, but because it is hinged in the middle they will only get one side up, leaving time for you to intervene.  My kids got bored and stopped trying to pull it up after some regular use.Dimensions:16.5" x 9.5" footprint when unfolded13.0" x 8.8" of flat eating surface (minus ridge down the middle)9.5" x 9.7"x 1" when folded
