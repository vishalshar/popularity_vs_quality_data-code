My son loves it!  I purposely bought a larger size than he needed so that it was long on him to help cover all his clothes.  Plus, kids grow - like adorable weeds.  I wanted this to last for a while.My son played in the rain for a very long time in this.  Giggling the whole time.  When he came back in, the only place that was wet on him were the bottom of his pants.  Which is what I expected.  I am super happy with this jacket and will buy another one if I ever find I am in need of another.
