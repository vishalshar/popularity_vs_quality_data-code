We bought these before my daughter was born to put on the kitchen cabinets. We also bought some other products just so we had options. These were by far the easiest to put on and adjust while still working properly. W bought a second set for the bathrooms since these seem to work so well.Adjusting is easy. You just cut the center strip to the length you want. Open both sides and readjust.Opening after they are in use just requires a quick push on both sides to release then pull open.Both sides are stuck on with a 3M type stick pad. This also makes it easy to pull off and replace if needed.The only problem that I did have is that both myself and one of my friends before getting use to the fact that we had them pulled so hard that they snapped the connector in the middle. I just used leftover that I had after cutting it and it was not a problem but that is something to note. My daughter does pull on the cabinet and has been unable to break it so it does not seem to be a problem there. Also getting these to work on a lazy-susan cabinet can be a problem.
