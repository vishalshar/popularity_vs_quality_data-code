First you should know that my husband has a huge collection of hand carved ducks...so the family is a bit nutty about ducks.  When I saw this ducky spout guard I knew that there was no other choice but to buy it.  It installed easily in our guest room bathtub and the grandtwins just adored it, especially because of the bubbles it makes (you have to add bubble bath of course).  One small problem is that, for our tub at least, once it is on there is no way to access the diverter that controls sending the water up to the telephone showerhead (if there was I would have given this 5 stars).  So you have to take it off, use the showerhead to rinse the twins hair, and then put ducky back on.  Since the grandtwins only visit a couple of times a year, this is not a big deal....but we did remove the ducky guard when their uncle visited us shortly thereafter.  And now the ducky is put away, waiting for the next grandtwin visit.  Ordering was easy and the ducky came quickly, no problems.  I would order again.
