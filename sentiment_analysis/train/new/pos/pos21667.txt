These diaper pins are a terrific value. I pay about $9 for only 16 of them at my go to local store so paying 50% less for more is s win.  They are made out of non toxic materials so they are safe for you baby's tush.  They are also made of stainless steel which is far easier to keep clean and to sterilize when you need to. It also makes them more durable than other metal pins.  Why I bought them? Well I like to make diaper cakes for expecting friends.  These are absolutely perfect for this.  I love how the pins look when I hang baby socks or pacifier clips from them and drap around the top of the cakes. They are also practical since they double to help new mom out if she cloth diapers. They are durable and easy to clasp shut as well as easy to open. That's important because I often change the look of my cakes and have to reposition things.  And I imagine this helps mims reposition the diapers too. I'm very pleased with this purchase.The colors I revieved are blue, pink, green, yellow, red and purple.
