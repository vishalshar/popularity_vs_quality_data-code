As I have noted in my other product reviews, I have been transitioning from BPA-free plastic to stainless steel and class for our kids' eating ware. I bought these cups because they are glass, have protective silicon sleeves, and have lids (albeit BPA-free plastic ones)to minimize spills. So far I have been very happy with these cups. Both my four year old son and two year old daughter use them regularly.  They are small enough for kids' hands, and the lid is easy for them to sip from. The cups also work well without the lid if/when you think your kids are ready for that.The only spills we've had occurred when our daughter deliberately tried to pour her drink on the table. Given the small size and position of the drinking slit, however, she had to work to get her yogurt to come out! (Fine motor skills and problem-solving skills in development!) But a few spills are okay with me, as I am more concerned with my kids having non-toxic/non-plastic drinking cups than with spill-proof ones.
