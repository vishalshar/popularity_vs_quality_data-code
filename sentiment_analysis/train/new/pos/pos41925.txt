This giant gift bag was perfect for an umbrella stroller that I was giving as a baby shower gift. It was SO giant that it would have easily accommodated two umbrella strollers or other items equally as large or even larger. The theme on the bag was super-cute and fit in with the shower them. It fit my needs perfectly and although I could probably find something similar for a lesser price, I didn't mind paying a little more for since it was exactly what I wanted.
