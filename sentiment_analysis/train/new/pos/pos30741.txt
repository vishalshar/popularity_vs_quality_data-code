I make all my own baby food, so I needed a food storage system that worked for us - and these are perfect!  The 2 oz size is perfect for us right now (my son is 9 months old), but if he's still hungry, it's easy to just grab another one!  We have several set of these, and they do stack nicely on top of each other for convenient storage.  The cubes "lock" into place in their tray - but that makes it easy to carry them to the freezer - it's not designed to hold them in place upside down!  The cubes themselves have securely closing lids - but if you fill them past the max line, they do sometimes pop open in the freezer (I just used those first, before they can get freezer burn!).  They are not very good for travel, though, as the lids can come open fairly easily in a bag - but it's very easy to pop the food out of the cube and put it in a sealed bowl for later!  They are also microwave and dishwasher safe, but I don't microwave mine, and I only hand wash them - I want to use them again and again for future kids, so I want them to last as long as possible!  I absolutely love these, and I think they're a must for anyone who wants to make homemade baby food.  They're the cheapest and best product on the market for freezer storage!
