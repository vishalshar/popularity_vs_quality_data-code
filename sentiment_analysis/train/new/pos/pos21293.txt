Received these along with the Prince Lionheart wipes warmer at my baby shower and thought they were both totally unecessary...but kept them since it was a well-meant gift. Now I think of these as indispensible! Gets the baby cleaner than disposable wipes, with no chemicals and no waste.As stated in other reviews, the bamboo material is somewhat delicate and may fray at the edges- IF you don't care for them. But care is simple! I keep a lingerie bag next to the changing table and place used wipes in it. When I get 5 or so wipes soiled, I toss the whole bag in the washer with other baby clothes or cloth diapers. You don't need to dry them (they're WET wipes!) This has worked great, my baby is now 4 months old and we're still using the original wipes. We do also use other, thinner cotton wipes (available on Amazon also), generally for pee-only diaper changes. But these thicker bamboo ones are fabulous for cleaning up poopy messes!My favorite part is that I mix a few drops of tea tree oil, lavender oil, olive oil and organic baby soap in 2 cups of water and pour this mix over the wipes before putting them in the warmer. The end result is a soft, warm wipe that smells great, softens baby's skin AND we've never had diaper rash! LOVE this product!----UPDATE: my baby is now 8 months old and we're still using the same wipes, which get washed in hot water every few days, and I'm now too lazy to mess with the lingerie bag ;) They just go in the wash with the diapers and that's that. Oh, sometimes they go through the dryer too. A couple have frayed at the edge but we still use them. Am back today to order more since we never use disposable wipes any more. These are great!
