I ordered this for my 6 year old son who has been chewing on his shirt at school, he is nervous and it's becoming a habit.  Since I couldn't stop him from doing it at school, I thought this was the next best thing.  This necklace is more than what I was expecting!  The silicone is very high grade and the star fish is big enough I don't have to worry about him swallowing it, but small enough that it doesn't make him feel self conscious.  I did shorten the string a bit because otherwise it hug to his belly button, but too long is better than too short so you can adjust it.  It also has a pull clasp so it won't strangle anyone or get caught....this is important for a baby or a kid running like crazy on a playground.  I am super pleased with this product!  Thank you
