I love this car seat!! My 4 year still uses hers as a high back booster.  We tried other seats for our one year son and no other could compare! All the other seats made his little head fall foward when he napped. Not this one!!! It has amazing recline!!! Totally worth it!! And you can use it forever!! It is a little bulky. We have no room in the back seat but I feel like the kids are super protected! And I do have a little trouble getting the slack out the harness. But overall I would definatley recommend this seat!
