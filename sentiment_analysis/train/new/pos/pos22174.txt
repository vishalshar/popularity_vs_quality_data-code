We use this cover over a mason jar as we prefer our kid to drink from glass instead of plastic. It works great, is cute and attractive in a modern way, and protects the glass from minor bumps. We added an "inchbug" personalized silicone nametag band around it. The bottom is partially covered in the silicone so it also helps keep the glass from slipping off a table.If you drop the jar off the table onto hard concrete it will definitely break but contains the broken glass for the most part. Mason jars are relatively cheap. A ceramic cup would be safer.Throw it right in the dishwasher.Overall we love this!
