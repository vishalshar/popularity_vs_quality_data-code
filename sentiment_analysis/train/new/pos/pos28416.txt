This is a great cover for my 32" LA Baby 4-sided Changing Pad.  It looks "tented" when I first put it on but after setting baby on it, this cover settles in and hugs the contours of the changing pad.I've washed this many, many times and it looks brand new.  The colors shown in the online picture are true to the product.  The finish is similar to a low-pile, looser version of velour.  It is very soft!Tip: I top this with Carter's flannel lap pads under baby's butt.  The lap pads catch and absorb any accidents so they don't reach this changing pad cover.  Saves me the hassle of switching out covers!Recommend!
