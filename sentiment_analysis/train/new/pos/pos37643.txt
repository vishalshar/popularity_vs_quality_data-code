I'm a first time young mom. I didn't want a diaper bag that "looked" like a diaper bag. I also didn't want a diaper bag where if I go somewhere someone else will mistake for theirs because its so common. I found this diaper bag on the original site but the original site wouldn't take my American Express. I was thrilled when Amazon had it plus free shipping. This bag is everything I wanted. I read one review that said its not big enough and the bottle department is too small I'm not sure what they were looking for a suitcase? This bag is perfect in size. Just what you need for the baby. It's cute and chic. I can't wait to use it!!!!
