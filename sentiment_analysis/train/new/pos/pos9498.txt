I didn't want anything with soft edges and stuff so I got this and I LOVE it..It sits right next to my bed and I can reach her easily.  It even breaks down fairly easily to take on road trips.  We took it with us to Houston and when we stopped along the way my husband would take it into the hotel room and put it back together - it takes about 5 minutes but for us it was the only option.  We use a special organic mattress with it and I am paranoid about SIDS.My boss had one of those bassinet things they sell at Babies R Us and said her son outgrew it already at like 2 months old.  My DD is about 14lbs and 4 months old and still fits just fine in ours.  I think it will last a few more months at least.It's gorgeous and sturdy and will last us for our other children as well.  My mother-in-law saw it and wanted one so now she has one at her house (she watches my daughter 2x a week)
