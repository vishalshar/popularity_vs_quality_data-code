Ok so I have an 8 month old daughter and I am a nanny so I have A LOT of experience with using these bottles. I've used both the white & the pink bottle and they are exactly the same. I just purchased the larger bottles once my daughter started drinking 6-8 oz. I will list the pros and cons ⬇️ All this goes for both the 4 oz and 9 oz Dr. Browns bottle.PROS*tummy problem FREE all 8 months!*collapse free nipple (avent bottle nipples collapse)*easy to hold for mom & learning baby (my daughter was holding her bottle at 4 1/2 months)*bpa free/dishwasher safe*bottle shape fits all bottle warmers and warms milk fastCONS*very tedious to clean, but cleaning tool is provided for hard to reach areas.*small opening for formula fed babies, easy to spill formula*leaks if filled over the FILL LINE (men never read, that goes for her Dad & Gpa) lol*level 3 nipple leaks so easily.. When my daughter falls asleep with the bottle it soaks her bed and sheets if I don't instantly remove it.I thought the 9 oz bottle was a bit larger than others so I tried another brand 8 oz bottle and was not as happy with it as Dr. Browns so I went ahead and purchased these, Glad I did! I feel like from day one when my daughter was born we were doing the right then when using these bottles. A lot of the families I nanny for use these bottles as well, and one baby has an extremely sensitive stomach. I highly recommend Dr. Browns bottles. I would give it give it 4.5 stars because it is slightly difficult to make a formula bottle one handed with a baby in the other. But I have mastered it so don't think it's impossible. And because the hand washing is difficult but overall product is a 4.5-5⭐️
