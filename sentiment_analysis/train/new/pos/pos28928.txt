We bought the all white version and really like the way it looks and functions. It's not top quality but I really like the price and think it's a good value. I also like that the changing tray can be removed later on so that the dresser can stand alone. You do have to be careful with assembly, just like you would with ikea furniture, or you can damage it. So far, with daily use (baby is 7 months old), it has held up great and we have not had any problems. Assembly instructions were pretty good but be organized and give yourself a good amount of time (I think the matching crib and dresser took over an hour, that's with rearranging furniture and figuring out other things not directly related to assembly). I would definitely buy this again. The Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad is a teeny bit long for the tray but I squeezed it in there (with a cover on too) and it works just fine.
