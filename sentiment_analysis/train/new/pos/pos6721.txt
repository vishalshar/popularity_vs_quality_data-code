I really love these. They fit the crib perfectly and alleviate worrying about the hard head snacks from my rough sleeper rolling over. They needed to be aired out a little (had a weird plastic smell) but otherwise work perfectly. Regular bumpers didn't work for us for safety reasons and even the breathable bumpers seemed like they would only give her leverage to step on to climb out (I swear j gave birth to Macguyver). Pictured is the bumpers paired with the teething guards. I did have to purchase two extra separately to cover all the slats.
