I was so ready to throw this thing away because I couldn't get it to stick so my son would end up pulling it off and smacking himself in the faceðŸ˜• I tried water, spit(gross I know) and just pushing hard nothing worked. Then I wiped it with a regular unsented baby wipe on the bottom and it just freaking stuck lol and it's a bit hard to get off now!! He's 9 months and can pull at it and spin it and it now stays so I'm pretty satisfied and will buy more!
