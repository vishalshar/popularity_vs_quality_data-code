I agree with the other reviewers that these are difficult to stack but I think they will be great when my baby is older. He is 9 months now so he just bangs them together and chews on them. I like that they are more challenging - they will be a good learning experience in perserverence, steadiness, problem solving and patience when he is older. Plus, I love playing with them myself. Ha ha. The colours are great too.
