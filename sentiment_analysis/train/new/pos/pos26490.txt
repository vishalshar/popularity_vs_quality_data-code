I'm brand new to cloth diapering, but I figured out pretty quickly that I'd need somewhere to keep those wet diapers until laundry day.  I purchased a simplehuman CW1322 Slim Plastic 10-1/2-Gallon Step Can, Grey to put in the laundry room and purchased two Kissa liners for it.The interior lining of the bag is similar in feel to a light vinyl; the outside is a stretchy, smooth cloth.  The bag opening is highly elasticized and fits very snugly around the rim of the garbage can.When it's time for laundry, I turn the bag inside out and add it to the wash.  After everything is cleaned, I hang the liner up to dry.  The second bag goes in to the can while the first is being cleaned.I'm very pleased with the quality of the product.EDITIt's over a year later and our two liners still look brand new!
