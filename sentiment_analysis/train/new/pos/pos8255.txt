This fan was great for our recent Disney World trip as a stroller fan.  It was definitely great when the baby was in a seated position, but was a little harder to angle properly when he was reclined flat in the stroller.  It lasted about 6 hours on high speed.  Does not charge quickly so bring backup batteries if you need it to last longer than that.
