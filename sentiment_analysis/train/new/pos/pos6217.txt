I bought four of these for my infant son. He took to them right away at 6 months of age. I like that they screw on to the pouch, they secure well this way and I have never had him manage to pull one off. These are not spill resistant since they are effectively a soft, straw-like extension.  They are very sturdy and well-made, and after 7 months (so far) of serious teething with my youngest son, they still look brand new. They are the only pouch topper my baby has been willing to use in the 8 months since I bought these as his first. They are also the only topper I have found to be compatible with EasyPouch EasyPouch Independence - The No Squeeze, No Mess, baby food pouch feeder. [2 Pack]. QHwn used with the EasyPouch, the inly mess is whatever was contained within the straw portion will spray out when it is thrown firmly onto a hard surface. I have 8 ChooMe toppers and 4 of these, and I have to wash all of these every single day since they are so heavily favored by my kids. Great product!Update: my son is now 14 months old and has just pulled one of the toppers off for the first time. He really chomped down on it and yanked. When it came off, I realized that it isn't a choking hazard. I am a bit paranoid about airway clearance. (I'm a nurse) and wasn't the least bit concerned about him choking on it. Once your child is older and stronger, this may occasionally be pulled off, but it will not be a danger to your babe.
