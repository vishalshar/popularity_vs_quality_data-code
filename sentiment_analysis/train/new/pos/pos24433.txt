The only thing wrong with this diaper bag is that I didn't know about it sooner and that I have never seen it sold in stores! Seriously, it's compact but fits everything. There are many little pockets inside to hold all the little baby things you need securely. I like the material because it does not stain easy. The straps are comfortable and the right length. The side pockets meant for bottles and sipppy cups actual hold the bottle and sippy cups without slipping out like most of my diaper bags. The pack also stands up by itself which is so handy when you are changing a one year old because you dont have to dig through everything. The changing pad that comes with is a little small if you have a toddler but you can easily pick up a bigger one if needed. I am so happy to have this now and not have a bulky bag hanging off my shoulder all the time!UPDATE (7/1/13)So I do indeed still love this diaper backpack and would buy it again. My only complaint is that the zipper did break after 5 months of hard use but it does have two zippers so I am still able to use it fine. Otherwise it still looks brand new and I have used this backpack pretty much every day since I purchased it 5 months ago. I hav never had a problem with not being able to fit everything in it that I need too and will most likely purchase another one soon to have a replacement when this one is no longer usable.
