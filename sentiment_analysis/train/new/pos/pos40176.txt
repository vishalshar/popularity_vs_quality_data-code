I ordered these Tommee Tippee bottles after serious research.  The nipples are apparently very similar to the real thing, making it possible for us to easily switch from bottle to breast and back as necessary.  According to my three month old son, this is an accurate description.  He's happy to take the bottle, but doesn't prefer it to breastfeeding.  The bottles are apparently anti-colic, eliminating fussiness resulting from gas etc.  My son informs me (with various cries, grunts, spit-ups, and squirms) that this is only sometimes true.  I'm not sure if I'm somehow using them wrong, but sometimes he seems to get a lot of air while sucking.  I don't fault the bottle, because it may be his "latch" on the plastic nipple.The only real "minus" I can share is that the bottle needs to be tilted at odd angles to get the last of the milk/formula into the nipple area; the shape of the bottle causes the last .5oz or so to get stuck.  That maneuvering can lead to a temporarily cranky baby right at the end of an otherwise pleasant feeding.
