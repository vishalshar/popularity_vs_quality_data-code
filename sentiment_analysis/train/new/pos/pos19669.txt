I just got this stroller as a replacement for my larger stroller.  My previous stroller was not overly large, but it did fit the car seat, as a frame of reference (Graco brand).  I needed a lighter weight stroller for my toddler.  I will compare this to the Maclaren Volo since I tried that as well.My toddler never wanted to sit in the Maclaren.  I was so disappointed because that stroller was so lightweight, easy to fold up and carry.  Ultimately I'm glad it didn't work out because the Maclaren has no cup holder and it did not recline.  My Graco had 3 cup holders plus it reclined.  I was having a hard time transitioning away from that.The Chicco C5 has both - a (read 1) cup holder and it reclines!  The wheels are also larger than the Maclaren and it has all wheel suspension.  It has a very smooth ride and folds like a dream.  The only caveat is that it weighs about 5lbs more than the Maclaren.We do a lot of trips to Disney and I really wanted something to fold up more compact than my Graco for those bus rides back to the resort.  This fits the bill.  Additionally, there is a carrying handle when it's folded and it comes with a rain guard (which the Maclaren Volo only offers as an added ($$) accessory).I really liked the Maclaren but they should improve upon its included options.  My son is happy in the Chicco C5 so that's what we're sticking with.
