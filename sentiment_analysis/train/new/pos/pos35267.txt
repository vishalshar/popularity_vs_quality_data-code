I rarely write reviews (too lazy, maybe?) but this duck basket is just TOO DARN CUTE to not recommend! It's very well made with a soft "fur" fabric body in a lovely light yellow color, and velveteen feet and beak. The handle is sturdy (bendable) wire, so it will not break if it's rough-handled or dropped, and I can feel that the interior (inside the fabric) is traditional woven wood. It's not very large, but not unusably small either- a nice medium size for children. It really is a beautiful heirloom-quality Easter basket. I'm SOOO glad I bought it!
