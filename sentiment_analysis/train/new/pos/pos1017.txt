I like these for eating out with my toddler, for providing a clean surface to put her finger foods and protecting her from germs on restaurant tables.  I tried a rubber (non-disposable) table cover but ended up using these more because it is so convenient to just be able to throw it away when you're done (sorry environment!).Two downsides (in my opinion)...  My 2-year-old is starting to figure out how to pull this off the table and thinks it's fun to do that.  And I wish they weren't covered with Sesame Street characters since my daughter doesn't watch TV and I'm trying to delay the whole "character" frenzy (i.e. "I want Elmo!") as long as I can.
