I LOVE these pacifier clips by Booginhead! I bought a few of these as well as some from Ulubulu. I have to say that I definitely prefer these over the other brand. These clips are much longer, have a larger loop to attach the pacifier on to and the clip seems to be less difficult to open. They clip on easily and stay in place well. You can hand wash them and then to dry them, I hook the loop on the edge of my Boon Lawn drying rack. They come in a lot of fun colors and patterns too which is a bonus!
