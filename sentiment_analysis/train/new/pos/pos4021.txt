I'm not quite sure what these other Moms are talking about, but I think it's fantastic.  I always park near a shopping cart area to begin with and I just grab one and put it in there but even if I don't, I put my son on my hip and place it in the cart and strap in the velcro and I'm good to go.  I shop at Walmart and I haven't found a cart yet that it doesn't fit into.  I love it and so does my son!  It's bright and colorful and the toys don't pull off unless you rip at it, so I'm not sure what happened with the other parent.  Anyway, and he's 6 months old, sits up in it nicely and I love the fact that it as a nice pillow behind him to help him fit in the cart better and is comfy for him.  I think it's cute!  I mean, you're in the store pushing your child around.  I don't know what people expect as far as durability goes.  I mean for the hour or two a week I'm at Walmart or Target, it holds up great!  I've already washed it several times and still looks brand new and it's cute and fun!  I think it's worth the $20.  Just my opinion.
