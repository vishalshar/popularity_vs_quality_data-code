This is a great little toy.  It is rather bright in complete darkness but my daughter has loved it since birth.  she is now 9 months old and still loves it.. I do not think it soothes a baby to sleep only because of it's brightnes but it does distract.  Distraction is great at 9 months old.. if she starts her night playing then she plays herself to sleep which seems to keep her happy and content, which keeps me happy and content!
