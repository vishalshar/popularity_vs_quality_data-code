I gave it 4 stars because does not have a way to fit snuggly in our elongated toilet seat.  It slips back and forth.  I'm trying to find a way to add something at the back to keep it in place.  My grand daughter loves it and the fact that she can use the 'big' potty. The hook is a nice feature, as I can put the seat on the side of the back of the toilet when the Princess Potty seat is not in use.
