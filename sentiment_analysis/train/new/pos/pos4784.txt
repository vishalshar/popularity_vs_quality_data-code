I ordered this for my daughter - who will be breastfeeding.  She will also be pumping so that Grandma can give her a bottle when she is babysitting.  Having nursed all three of my children I was truly surprised by the great nipple design of these bottles.  I think that it will be very effective at reducing "nipple confusion" for our baby.  I was also really surprised to find out that each bottle comes with a sealing cap - so that the bottle of milk can be brought over tightly sealed.  Anyone who has ever gone to the trouble of pumping a bottle only to have it spill knows how horrible that is!!The two stage nipples come apart - making cleaning very easy!  That is a great feature.Finally - I couldn't believe the cost!!  A friend bought my daughter the Tommie-Tippies and those are nice - but these are much less expensive and have so many extras - like the sealers.  I am really excited to try these out!!
