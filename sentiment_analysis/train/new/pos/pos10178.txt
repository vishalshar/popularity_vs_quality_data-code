We bought one of these at a local baby store before my daughter was born and paid more than double the price. My husband picked it out and I thought it would be a waste of money. Lo and behold, it has become my little ones favorite animal and the one that she must sleep with and take in the car.I bought this as a replacement in case the original gets lost or destroyed.It is a super soft lightly stuffed monkey so it is very cuddly. And after two years of cuddles and her playing with it, it is a bit dingy but no rips yet.
