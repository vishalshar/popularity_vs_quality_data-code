Our 4 month old (15lbs) fits great in this. We put a blanket behind her back to steady her because she's still a slight bit small for it, but she can touch the bottom and can spin herself around in it. She loves this toy...so many objects to play with and to keep her attention. It's very sturdy and seems to be comfortable for her. At this stage, she wants to put everything in her mouth and none of the toys are in reach of her mouth so she gets a little frustrated with that, but we'll lay a teething ring out for her if she gets the urge. Very pleased with this purchase!!! We've gotten so much use out of in a month. I feel safe with her in it while I'm cooking or putting away laundry. There is nothing on it that raises concern for her safety. That makes this mom happy. :)
