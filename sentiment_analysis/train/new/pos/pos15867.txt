I read several reviews before I purchased this about it putting dents in the doorway or being too loose.  The solution is simple: there are approximately 20 or 30 grooves (a guess based on my recollection...gate not with me) to put the metal "thingy"  in  that determines how wide the gate pushes when the bar is lowered (thingy is a technical  term).  When it arrives spend a little time with it and find the EXACT groove that doesn't push too hard or too loose against your door frame (they are every 1/4 inch or so there are a lot of them.).  Once you find the perfect spot then take a magic marker and color the groove.  Now it is simple and quick to go to that groove every time if or when it jumps out after removing the gate and you won't damage your door frame (too tight) or it won't be too loose.  I actually have 3 colored grooves on mine now for 3 different door openings and it works great to keep the dog off the carpet when her paws are wet or muddy.  The only negative about the design (4 stars instead of 5) is that the bar when lowered easily moves left or right before it clamps on the piece of wood to hold it in place.  This means you have to take a little care aligning the clasp every time you lower the bar...otherwise the hardware just bumps into the wood and could bend the hardware or mar the wood if you are not careful.  ...still...I highly recommend it for the price.  I love the gate.
