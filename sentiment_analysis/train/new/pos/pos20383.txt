I never owned the original Boppy pillow (I couldn't stomach the $40 price tag), so I can't compare the two. I can say that this pillow works excellently for nursing and for half the price of a Boppy.  I love this pillow.12/05/13 To clarify, the pattern of the pillow is on the actual pillow construction and is not removable for washing. The solid color is the removable slipcover.
