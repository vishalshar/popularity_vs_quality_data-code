We love these placemats!  They are so colorful and stick to every surface we have used them on so far (including a wooden picnic table).  Love how there is adhesive on all four sides, that is so much better than the ones that only have it on two sides.  My son has been good so far about trying to remove it once it is down, and I think it is because we are able to stick all four sides to the table.  Very happy with these placemats!Update:We are still using this brand placemat two years later.  Our older son no longer needs them but our baby is at the age where he needs them.  I have tried other brands in between, and these are still my favorites! The best part is still the four sides of sticky tape.
