It was a bit hard to remove the old battery, but once I did, it was easy to snap this one in, and it's been performing well.  Love my snuza and the peace of mind it gives me.  Order this battery with confidence.  Not much else to say about it - it's an authentic Snuza battery, and a good replacement when the original dies.
