Got these for my son after he became attached to his one and only other one like it. In fear of loosing his one Nuk, and not being able to replace it with just any other kind, I found these! I love these because they don't look ridiculous because of wild colors, it always match his outfit, and most importantly, I love these because my son loves these.  Its what keeps him...and ultimately me calm!
