i thought the handle will be longer but when this spoon arrived in mail it's not what i am expecting. now i have been using this spoon for a few months and i can say it has served its purpose. safe for baby's delicate gums because of the silicone but for me longer handle makes it easier to feed baby because sometimes i use this spoon then baby's hands knock it over and the food spills sometimes the spoon fell off my hands (just can't keep baby's hands still when she gets excited while i'm feeding her). wish handle is longer and everything will be perfect i have no complaint on the depth of spoon although it is more on the shallow side it's fine to use with baby food.
