Trend Lab specializes in nursery decor.  As we create a kitty play room for our cats with a leopard theme.  I bought the valance that matches this clock...not knowing that the clock was available.  It adds a nice touch to the room.  It's battery operated, easy to hang, balances nicely for the number placement (unlike others have said).  When the 12 is directly over the 6 in position, the flower is evident.  After weeks of use, it keeps perfect time.  For it to be a perfect match to the window treatments is a plus.  Other items are available as well.  We also bought the diaper bag as that will make it handy to move grooming items, air fresheners, etc from room to room as we need them.  The pockets are nice for clippers, scissors and about anything we need.  Well made and highly recommend.
