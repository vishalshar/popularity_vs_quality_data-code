Very easy to install as others have mentioned - took minutes.I mistakenly put the first lock  in the middle of the top edge of the cupboard door instead of close to the end. This meant that the first door would start opening a tiny bit before it would be stopped by the lock - no big deal.Also, I found that on the second cupboard the key wouldn't open the lock easily because the hook part of the lock was wedged up against the catch part (as it is supposed to do, but) too tightly. All I had to do was push the door in slightly to loosen it as I applied the key and it opens easy. Something to consider in case you can't figure out why it isn't unlocking.Also, the lock has a switch you can deactivate it with if you no longer want to use the lock any more.If you want to buy spare keys cheaply, don't get a single key for 7 or eight dollars through the manufacturer. Instead go somewhere like dealextreme and get 10 super strong rare earth magnets (stronger than the key that comes with this lock) for about $4 (get the 2mm thick ones as they are stronger).
