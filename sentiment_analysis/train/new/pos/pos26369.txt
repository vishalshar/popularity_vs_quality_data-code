I love it. Love, love, love! The manual / recipe book is so easy to read and understand. I don't usually read directions very well and mess things up, but I can understand the directions in the recipe book easily. I've made food my baby likes and I've actually tasted the food myself and it's pretty good. This system makes it fun to make baby food. The cleanup is pretty easy. The only thing I don't use is the spatula. I don't think it fits as nicely inside the storage containers without spilling some on the outside. I've even made applesauce for my three year old and she loved it.
