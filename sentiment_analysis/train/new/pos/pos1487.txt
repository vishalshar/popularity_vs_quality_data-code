Works great and just what I needed!!  I have a pass thu kitchen with a back door to the yard.  I have 4 small dogs that are confined to the kitchen (and the back yard via a pet door) at night and when I leave home.  For years I've been using regular baby gates for the 2 indoor doorways.  Because of this I basically never used one doorway and put up/took down the other gate as needed.  With these semi-permanently installed gates I now use both doors and don't have to prop the old baby gates when not in use.  The gate swings shut easily when you let go and locks in place.  I have installed a screw-in a metal "eye" under the counter next to each doorway.  So if I want the gate to remain open I just hook a really small bungee cord between the gate frame and the "eye".  I am VERY happy with my purchase of this product!
