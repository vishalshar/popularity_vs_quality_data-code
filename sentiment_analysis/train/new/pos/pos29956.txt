The Podee is the only bottle we've used for our 8 week old. We've used it for about a month and a half... a month and a half of fuss-free, hands-free, more time-to-do-everything-and-anything-else. And more time for yourselves.Nipple and tube replacements are a must have. why? well...1) You should not wash them in anything hotter than lukewarm warm water. The tube plastic ruins from the heat. Not even, don't even chance it, wash them in cool or cold water. When I said ruin I mean the plastic becomes sticky causing it to be harder to connect to and disconnect from the attachments (which is a pain in the behind)2) over time, depending on how often you use them, with all the excessive brushing, and washing they will start to show buildup of residue in scratches that can not be cleaned out, they are just done after that3) eventually, (I'm sure as it happens to all nipples and tubing) they will start to dry-out and crack.Basically, replacements are something to have in-case the tubing shows signs of wear and tear. We bought the Podee Double Pack Feeding System, so when we washed that first set of tubing in warm to hot water and noticed the change we had the tubing from the second bottle there to back us up until we got the replacements. If you have just one Podee or plan on ordering a Podee or two you should definitely get the replacements too because you WILL go through nipples and tubes.
