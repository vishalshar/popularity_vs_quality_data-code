I've been searching for a bottle because I'm trying not avoid buying the Playtex inserts for the Nurser system.  They are super expensive and plus not good for our enviornment.I bought a trial one of these and checked it out for a week and then decided to buy a couple of three packs.  Here are my tips for these bottles and I got allot of them from this site:1.  When mixing your instant formula.  Have the cap on over the nipple and give it a good shake.  This avoid the formula from sometimes leaking out.2.  After washing the nipples and rings, when they are still wet put them back together and it forms a nice seal3.  Don't put the cap on too tight as it could cause a massive squirting from the nipple.  I've only seen this once but I always test it before it goes into my babies mouth.My only recommendation about these is the nipples could be a little more softer like the Playtex ones.  They are very hard but my baby is getting used to them.Another great thing but haven't experienced it yet is these bottles convert to sippie cups for later use.I would recommend these bottles as I swear I've tried them all.  I wanted something simply without extra parts to clean and that was available at either Target, Toys R Us or Walmart.My baby has never had colic or real gas and doesn't seem to have a problem with these.  She burps fine when using these.
