I was very excited when I received this product and I so loved this stool each time I used it for my son.  We received our stool on Sept 6 but by Oct 12 it broke.  After just a few uses, one of the Lift and Lock Support Links jammed and now it is useless.  I'm so disappointed and Amazon is not allowing me to return it.UPDATE:  I googled Tip Pee Toe and went to their website for a contact number.  Called them and spoke with Ana.  She was very nice and helpful.  After I explained that my stool was broken, she told me that she would be sending a new one, priority, to replace.  I can't wait to get a replacement.  I just hope the next one lasts longer cause this stool is very helpful with my 2.5 yo, expecially in public.
