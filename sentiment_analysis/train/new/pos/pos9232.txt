I bought this toy for my granddaughter just after she turned a year old.  It became a favorite toy then, and she still plays with it now at 27 months.  I bought the extra Bright Starts balls to go with it, and they have worked fine.  This is really more of a busy box shaped like a kitchen than an actual kitchen set, so, if you are looking for kitchen play, you might want to look elsewhere.  But we have had a lot of fun with the ball play, lights, and sounds of this toy.  It has stood up well to daily use, and for us, it just never gets old.  Kudos to Bright Starts for this one.  I am about to buy another one, along with the extra balls, as a first birthday gift for my grandniece.  This is a great little toy.
