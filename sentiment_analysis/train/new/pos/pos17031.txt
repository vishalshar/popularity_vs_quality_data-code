A lot of places we go dont allow you to throw away diapers or it's an open trash can. So I hated holding on to them or stinking up the room. These bags fixed that problem! I used these quite a bit when traveling in the airport as well. Flight attendants even commented on how well they mask the smell. Idk what diapers other reviewers have used but this bag easily fits both a diaper from my toddler and infant. Hardly notice it hanging on the side of your diaper bag but major lifesaver!Like other moms, I rely on quality Amazon reviews to make my purchase decisions.  If you found this review helpful I would really appreciate you clicking, "Yes," next to, "Was this review helpful to you?" Thank you!
