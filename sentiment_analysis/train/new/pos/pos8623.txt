I bought one of these Hudson Baby blankets in pink with the cute little horse for my newborn granddaughter. We couldn't get over how soft & cozy it is. And it's top-quality; very well made! So I had to come back and look for more, to see what other 3-D animals they come with. Found this blue one with the moose & I just fell in love (I love mooses). Had to buy it! Told my daughter-in-law about it and she had to have one, too. She says that she has other blue stuff for her little girl & this blanket would be perfect. So I had to come back and buy yet another one! They are THAT nice. The moose is just adorable, as is the little horse on the pink one. We really can't get over how well they are made; very much worth the price. Fantastic service from the seller, too!
