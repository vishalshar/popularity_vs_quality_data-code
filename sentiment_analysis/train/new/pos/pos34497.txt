My sister in law gave me her Medela breast pump so I had to buy all the parts which I also purchased on Amazon for $13ish. This included, 4 storage bottles, lids for the storage bottles, 2 breast shields & the parts. After I started pumping I realized I always had to transfer the milk into another bottle to have my husband feed him b/c the kit didn't come with nipples for the bottles. So I went to babies r us to purchase the nipples, then realized I didn't have the collar to fit the nipple. I wish this would have all come in the set together instead of having to buy everything separately. But eventually I got all the pieces & haven't had any problems.
