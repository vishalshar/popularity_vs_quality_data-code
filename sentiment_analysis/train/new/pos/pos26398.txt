I love this pillow! I had a smaller version of a nursing pillow like this (diff brand) and it wasn't big enough to keep my baby supported. As soon as she learned to roll, anytime she got fussy or pushed against me she would roll right off it! Luckily I always caught her, but I knew I needed something else. This pillow is much bigger and its nice and soft so she sinks down in it instead of being perched on top where she can roll. This is about twice the size of my other pillow, so it holds her up to the right height, i was always having to prop my other pillow up with one hand. Not so with this one. Its more comfortable for mom and baby!
