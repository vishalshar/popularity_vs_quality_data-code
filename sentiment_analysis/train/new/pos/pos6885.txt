I like these the best because you,can keep counter space clear and don't have to take up room in the cabinet either. The only suggestion I could make would be to include mounting hardware for people who don't have flush bottom cabinets. If you don't be aware you will have to scab them down to the bottom of the cabinet face. A piece of 3/4" plywood cut to fit and screwed in place from the top worked just fine for me. Also, be sure not to torque the mounting screws too hard or you will create an uneven surface for the slide and, essentially create a vise that will make the tension on the slide much higher and more difficult to operate. All in all works great though! Love the extra space.
