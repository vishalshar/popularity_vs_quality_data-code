We had a great video monitor for the babies that we liked. Unfortunately you know how re-chargeable batteries are, eventually they just don't charge all the way. So for our handheld device we ordered this. The battery lasted a solid 2 years before we had to replace it. Very happy with the longevity and how well it held charge. Would have bought again.Anyway the price was right and we love to save money so we went with this. Can't complain, plugged right in and everything turned on just like it was supposed to.
