I wish I had this with my first son. Our baby is 3 months old and he loves it. He is inclined in it and he's quiet for long long periods of time when I put him in it. I guess he finds this new view of the world fascinating. He's also very snug in it, so no chance for him to roll over.I do wish the cover came off. It is a flannel type material, very soft but it can only be spot cleaned. My 16 month old "kissed" the baby and got chocolate milk on the cover that I had to clean up immediately (and I just received it today). :o)Other than the minor issue with the cover, I absolutely love it. My 3 month old is very tall for his age, so I'm sure I will no longer be able to use this in 2 months, but it will have been worth it.
