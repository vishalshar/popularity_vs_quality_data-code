This took all of 60 seconds per outlet to install. Just unscrew your outlet cover, put this one on top, and put the screw back in. It is very roomy on the inside, and we were able to fit our power-strip cord, plus a regular thickness cord, in it without any problems. The power-strip cord is pretty heavy duty-much thicker than a normal cord.  I have a one and a two year old, and I am a little curious as to whether the two year old will be able to figure out the latch, but I have already decided that if he does the solution would be to use a knife to cut off that little tab that you see on the left hand side. The unlatch mechanism would be much harder to depress if that tab weren't there. My one year old just got done inspecting it; she messed with it for a minute and then left it alone. I would call it a success, so far. Definitely easy on the wallet and easy to install.
