My 4 month old son loves this jumper.  There are so many activities that keep him occupied long enough for me to do household chores or take care of my other two kids.  He loves the bright colors and the music on the piano keyboard.  The only negative to this jumper is the location of the bars on the side because they get in the way of taking a good picture!  Other than that, I have no complaints!
