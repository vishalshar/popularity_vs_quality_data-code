My granddaughter loves to play with this at our local library and they have had it for well over 7 years and even still has the vanilla scent.  However, the product I received was not working.  Of the tentacles, 4 played the same sound and the other 4 barely played at all.  The product did not come in a package, nor was the song book included as stated in the description.  There was no light vanilla scent.  I have re-ordered this product because I know its a great product and I just happen to get a lemon the first go around.  Amazon made the return process simple and easy. Thank you Amazon.
