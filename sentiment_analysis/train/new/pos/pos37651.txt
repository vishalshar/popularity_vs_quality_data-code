My inlaws gave us an Evenflo Embrace 35 travel system, but only included the carseat and the stroller, but no base. Could not find the base on any store (US or Mexico), so ended up buying it online.Fits perfect, seems strange that evenflo sells something called a travel system, without a base. Perhaps they think it is not necessary a base to travel, since you can fasten the car seat using the safety belt, but still, it is recommended.
