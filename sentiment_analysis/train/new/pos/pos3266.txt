I bought this pad mainly for its sheer size. It's the largest changing pad I have seen (Even bigger than my Ju Ju Be's Be Prepared pad which is large itself). I use it everywhere in place of any other pad-the car, on grass, public restrooms, knowing my baby won't be touching yucky surfaces given it's size and water resistency. I've already washed it 5-6 times and it still looks new. If you follow directions and use the delicate cycle you shouldnt have problems. I don't understand why anyone would have those issues. It's not very thick, so it's not really a "pad", but my baby is always on some kind of soft surface. So if you're looking for a larger, comfortable changing area for when you are out and about, this is it. I am planning on getting atleast another color now that there are new ones out!
