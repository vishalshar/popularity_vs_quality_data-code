This has a very limited amount of space. I was able to fit a diaper some wipes and her juice cup and that was it. Disappointed there wasnt enough room for a spare change of clothes. Since we only used it for church it wasn't that big of a deal, but I'd say this isnt big enough for mother's day out or preschool...
