I had the old hotsling from years ago which I used very often.  I've since lost it so I wanted to purchase one for my new baby.  Since then, Hotslings has redesigned the product to make it adjustable, which I just love!  As my baby gets bigger, I can adjust the sling to make us most comfortable.  Yes, slings can make your shoulders and back tired, but the convenience is wonderful and my son loves it too.  He giggles and grins when he sees me put it on.  Recently, as I was carrying the baby around, my daughter (who's 5) commented that she remembered the "pink and gray one" that I used to carry her around in on my hip.  I asked her if she had liked it and she said that she loved being in the sling.  I thought that was a nice little first-person review.I do also own an ergo baby which my son has never really taken to and I find the hip carry too much trouble to set up when I have a fussy baby who wants to be held.  With the sling, I can just throw it over my shoulder, pop him in and go.  I highly recommend it.
