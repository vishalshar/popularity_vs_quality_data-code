I love this toy! Only flaw is that the part for the head is very flat and the little neck support pillow is useless so I have to roll up little burp cloths and put them on either side of my baby's head or else his neck starts to slump! He also slides down if you don't buckle them in! But he falls asleep so fast! Loves the vibrate function for gas!
