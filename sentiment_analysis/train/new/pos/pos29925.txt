I have been cloth-diapering for several months with a mixed stash of Kawaii, FuzziBunz, BumGenius, and TotsBots diapers (almost all one-size pockets) that we acquired secondhand through Craigslist and consignment sales. I decided to augment our stash with a few brand-new diapers, also one-size pockets, because a few of the secondhand ones are reaching the end of their useful lifespan. I decided to try these out because they are more affordable than the brands we already have.One of the things I love about cloth diapers in general is that, for our baby at least, they do a much better job of containing things. When we use disposables, we have regular blowouts, but when our baby is in cloth, the problem all but disappears. I wondered how these would hold up in comparison. I am happy to report that they have done an excellent job so far of containing what would have been disastrous in a lesser diaper.On the whole, these diapers are very similar to Kawaii Baby, with a couple of differences: the pocket opening at the back is narrower and doesn't have the extra flap to cover the insert that Kawaii's have. They also have a slightly different arrangement of snaps and a slightly different cut to the wings, which are basically cosmetic differences that don't seem to affect performance one way or the other. My only (minor) criticism is that the colors in real life are surprisingly different from how they look on-screen, but that's as much to do with the computer monitor settings as anything else. HOWEVER, a couple of the color names are also a bit misleading: specifically, the one called "Blue Green" is much more blue than green - in fact, to my eye there's no green at all in this color. A better name would be "sky blue" or "light/pale blue." All in all, though, I'm very happy with these diapers!
