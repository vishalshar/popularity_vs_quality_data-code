Great stroller for the price. VERY VERY smooth compared to most strollers (you will notice a difference in handling). Easy to adjust and put together.PROS: Swivels in a 360 rotation (great for conditions of the environment), smooth, compact, not too heavy, has add-ons, nice brake system (one push locks both wheels), medium pricedCONS: main handle has soft rubbery material that can easily rip, reclining the seat isn't the best system, the actual seat is good but even when adjusted to a toddler its a little flimsy, NO TRAY, NO FOOT RESTOverlooking the adaptable cons... I still rate this puppy a 5 star for its quality and smoothness. I would buy again for sure.
