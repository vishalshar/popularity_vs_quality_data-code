This is by far the easiest travelling stroller.  We had it shipped directly to our Disney hotel.  Loved having it in the parks for our 4 and 5 year olds.  It was easy steer, small enough to go through all doors, and kept the kids together in massive crowds.  The 5 year old didn't need it much, but when she did it was there.  Little bag for your things, and we just hung our back pack on the handles.  Disney does rent double strollers, but for a four day trip, this was cheaper and free shipping for Prime Members.  Best deal.  When we left we gave the stroller to a couple checking in.  I feel like I saved about $50 doing this and was able to save someone else money.  Worth it.
