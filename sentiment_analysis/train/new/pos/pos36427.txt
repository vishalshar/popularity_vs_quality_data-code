These covers are awesome! I like the Velcro better than the snaps because it's faster to close up the diaper. Do not listen to the people who say the Velcro "wears out fast". This is NOT true if you close the Velcro before washing. If you leave the Velcro open it sticks to everything in the wash and gathers a bunch of lint. This will of coarse makes the Velcro wear out. There are little soft Velcro pieces right next to the rough ones that were put there so you could wash with the rough patches firmly secured. It also keeps the rough Velcro from rubbing babies soft skin when you put it on.This cover will leak if you do not use it properly (like I did the first couple of times ðŸ˜‰). All diaper covers will leak if they're put on incorrectly. When you're done putting your diaper cover over the cloth diaper, make sure all parts of your cloth diapers are in the diaper cover. If any part of the cloth diaper sticks out, it will leak. When the cloth diaper is filled with liquid and touches another piece of cloth, say a onsie, the liquid will be literally sucked out of the diaper by the onsie. The diaper covers were made to keep the cloth of the diaper away from the cloth of baby's cloths.Also make sure to change baby's diaper atleast ever four hours or else leakage will occur. If you would like to hold off longer, do what I did and buy extra diaper inserts to put over your cloth diapers. This will add about two hours.I had leakage problems before and these solutions totally fixed it.Over all, great diaper cover. Been using it for a long time and have not had any problems that were not easily fixed.
