We bought this bouncer for our granddaughter, who we keep around three days a week. We purchased it because of the space saving design. Overall, it was a good purchase for the price, but there are improvements that could be made.First the pros:*EASY to put together... I did it with my 13 year old, and I'm not handy at ALL*great space saving design, takes up very little space*batteries last FOREVER in this toy, even if you forget to turn it off*really cute design, attractive to the baby*easy to pull the seat out and wash it, easy to cleanNow, the cons:*a little too high for some shorter babies*some of the toys are pretty pointless*only two settings for height*a tiny bit on the heavier side, but is much lighter than any others we've foundOverall, I'd probably purchase it again.  I don't care for the mirror, a smaller baby cannot see into it. The chicken toy is odd, it's attached with a ribbon, and shakes, but not loudly, and is really boring for most babies old enough to use this. The bug that slides is hard to slide, and our granddaughter can't move it.  However, the froggy eyes are very cute, and the baby can make sounds by rolling them, the teether is great, and the toy bar is very nice, she really enjoys the hanging toys, and the beads that spin, but our baby seems to be favoring her left hand, so I wish they had put beads that spin on both sides of the toy bar.We bought this when she was around 4 months and she wasn't ready for it, now, at 6 months, she gets quite a bit of use out of it. I'm anticipating that she'll use it for awhile still.
