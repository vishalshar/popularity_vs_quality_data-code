Pro:  Lady Anti-Monkey Butt powder helps so much to keep me dry, comfortable, and rash-free, especially in the summer time,  while exercising, working, or having hormonal fluctuations resulting in hot flashes .  The calamine is the pale pink tint in this powder and it really does soothe skin.  This powder prevents irritation, as well, by decreasing friction between touching body parts (e.g.: breasts, thighs, arms, etc.).  Keeps one chafe-free, soothed, and comfy; what's not to love?Con:  noneAlso, another item that works great together with this, especially in the summer to prevent rashes, are bra liners.  I use Pambra's The Original Bra Liner (Pack of 3) Size M, Nude.  Keeps breasts and area under breasts drier and thus bras less damp.  Seriously, the powder and liners together are terrific!Thank you for taking the time to read this review.  If this review has been helpful to you, please click "yes" below.
