This is our first adventure in cloth diapering.  After copious amounts of research, we decided to start with this brand.  I purchased prefolds, the duo cover, a duo fab fitted, stay dry inserts, the duo AIOs, and the wipes, all from Thirsties.  The AIO has been the easiest to use.  My husband has no complaints about these versus disposables (and I'm shocked).  These wash well, don't stain, dry in about 1 1/2 cycles in the dryer on medium (not too bad).  The snaps hold up well to both my 2 month old and my 2 year old who wears them to bed.  I haven't used them with a liner yet.  I do recommend the snaps over the velcro though.  The velcro doesn't hold up well in the wash after only a few weeks, and I've been careful with it.  Also, one of my other diapers arrived with a damaged snap (still functional but cracked).  Thirsties customer service immediately sent out a replacement and postage paid return for the damaged one.  Great customer service is a great bonus.  Everything arrives in eco friendly packaging and is made in the USA.
