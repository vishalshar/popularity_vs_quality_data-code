My baby granddaughter was trying to learn to crawl in a house full of hard wood an tile floors, blankets just scrunched up under her and she couldn't get anywhere. I wish this was available larger, but the backing is perfect, it is plush and soft so it stays in place and is comfortable for her crawling efforts. It is small enough to easily move from room to room or on vacation to grandmas or anywhere,  She loves it!
