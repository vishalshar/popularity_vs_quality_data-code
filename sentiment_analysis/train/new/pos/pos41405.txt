I read alot of customer reviews for washable nursing pads and decided to plump for this set.  Partly through price but also I have had good a experience with "Natural Organic Cotton" products.  (I have their organic crib sheet and knitted baby blanket, both are soft and have washed beautifuly)  So far these have not dissappointed.  I have washed them three times now on a warm wash, I always pop them inside a mess bag, and air dried them and they have retained not only their shape but their softness.  Granted I did need to smooth them out after the wash but only a little.  I do wonder whether reviewers that stated they came out all screwed up and rather worse for wear have a washer that has a very high spin? I would say my top loader has a reasonably forcefull spin, it can knot up shirt sleeves, but as I say they came out the wash great.  Can't comment on the absorbancy as I'm a month away for from having my daughter.  I'll report back when I've used them for their purpose.
