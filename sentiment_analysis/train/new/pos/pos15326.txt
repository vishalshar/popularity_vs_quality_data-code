We bought this graco monitor as a replacement for our useless fisher price monitor (we used the fp monitor once and then put it away for a month when we needed it again the receiver was dead) and the difference is something big.PROS:1.- Auto Channel selector: Great feature just turn it on an it will set automatically the channel on both receivers, if you feel it has lots of interference just press "ch" button and presto!2.- Vibe function: good but nothing i couln'd live without. It's too sensitive, almost any noise will activate it.CONS: THE channel button: It should be on the parent receiver and NOT on the baby's transmitter, Here is how it goes, imagine yourself sleeping, and the monitor begins to sound with static are you going to go to baby's room and to try to change the channel at the risk of waking up your baby? so the channel button should be with the parent unit! (HEy the baby is not going to change the channel)
