When I ordered pumpin' pals, I had two main objectives - the first, to make more milk and the second, to have a more comfortable pumping experience.  So this review is based on these two objectives.  As for making more milk, the pumpkin pals definitely work.  However in terms of comfort, major fail.  I felt like these pinched quite a bit through the entire pumping experience.  I used them for about a week before eventually putting them aside and going back to my original Medela flanges.In the end, fit is very personal and these might work well for some. But for me, the lack of comfort outweighed the benefit of the extra half an ounce I could pump in 10 minutes.
