As with any new mom, I did a lot of research on everything I purchased - EVERYTHING! I decided to go with Born Free glass bottles. I am so glad I did. I have been using these bottles for 6 weeks now. My husband noticed that inside the glass ring is plastic. We realized the plastic valve was breaking and adhering to the inside the of the glass bottle.
