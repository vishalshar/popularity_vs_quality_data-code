I LOVE this cup and, most importantly, so does my 15 month old son. He hates sippy cups but loves to try to drink out of my cups so I figured this would be prefect.I was hesitant because of negative reviews regarding the disc being too loose or too tight. BUT I've had nothing but good experiences so far. I push the disc down really firmly and test it before I give it to him, and I am easily able to remove it with the little handle.My son is now happily drinking from a cup at meals!UPDATE 8/8/15 (now owned for almost a year) -Still loving this cup! I have noticed that filling it more than halfway makes it a bit more likely that the disc will slip out when drinking from the cup or when its knocked over.  I actually recommended this cup to a client bc the kiddo was having a hard time transitioning from bottles to cups, and they had tried SO many types of sippy cups (just like I had).  They love it as well!
