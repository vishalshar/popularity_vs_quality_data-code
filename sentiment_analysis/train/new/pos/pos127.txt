I really love the O ball line of toys. The concept is amazing, as it really helps a child's clunky, clumsy, little fingers get a grasp on the item. This instills confidence in anyone! This football mostly makes my husband happy, seeing his little guy tossing a football around even before he knows what a football is! But he does however know what an object you can put in your mouth is, and this is it. My baby is five months old, so that's pretty much where everything goes these days. What's great about this particular O ball is that it has the tapered ends that can easily be sucked on. The original O ball is great for gripping and flinging around, but my son gets pretty pissed when he can't get it in his mouth. This football solves all that. I also really love that this ball (and the other O balls do too) has some give to it. In other words, the plastic is slightly soft, just in case my little guy bangs his head on it or takes a little tumble while he's practicing sitting up. I know it won't hurt him. Btw, in the random color draw, our football turned out to be red & white, Cardinal's colors. I hope you are as lucky!
