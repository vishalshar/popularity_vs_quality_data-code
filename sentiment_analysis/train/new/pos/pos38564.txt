I am not one to write reviews but this has been wonderful!! My son was chewing his sleeves sooooo bad. If I put short sleeves on him he would chew the collar. This necklace has saved me Money from having to buy more shirts that will just get ruined.  I think this necklace helps his chewing problem ;) totally worth the money! But you do only get one charm. Just heads up.
