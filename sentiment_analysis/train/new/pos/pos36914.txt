This is a great basket and it doesn't even quite "fit" the corner of my tub!The two walls of our tub "corner" meet at a 4" wide middle panel, so the interior suction cups on this basket don't actually reach the wall.  Instead, the two outer suction cups - those in the picture - are the only things attached to our tub.Our tub walls are made of linoleum (or whatever that material is, but not tile), so I don't know if that makes a difference, but all I did was push those suction buttons down and they stay fairly firmly attached.  In the half year or so that I've had this, once or twice one of the suctions came off, but the basket stayed in place and I just pushed the button back in.Currently the basket holds: 4 Boon ducks, a temp gauge duck, 7 small stackable cups, 4 plastic "beads", that ball/shower toy, a mechanical penguin boat thing, 3 squirt/floating toys, and the 3 Skip Hop Dunks stacking bath toys.Yes, maybe too much (you never know what interests them!), but all of them fit (and a bath pitcher on top!) and they stay neatly in the corner.
