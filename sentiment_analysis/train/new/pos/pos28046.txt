I found it expensive and the side rails were not included yet, were the ones I needed to purchase first because we have a conversation crib and the front bar will be eventually removed to turn into the toddler bed... so by the side rails first!!Holds up nicely to washes. Velcro is strong and universal. ( that's the best part, it fits my crib) the 3 play loops..... well my 10 month old figured them out after 2 weeks.  But we still strap some in. It's padded very nice - not too thick or stiff and again holds shape after washesThis is a wise investment when kiddo turns 8 months old. Not so much in the beginning.
