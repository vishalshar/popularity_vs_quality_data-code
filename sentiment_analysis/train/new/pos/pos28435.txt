I received it today in the mail and tried it out.He is 10 months and having trouble walking and building confident.I got this to see if it helps, and it does!It's going to take some time because he thinks its a game and will start to jump lol.But at least he likes it :)The only way that I can see that the baby will fall from the side is if you didn't strap the baby in the right way and adjust the straps. If the baby falls its fine because they need to learn how to walk without falling from all angles.My advise is get it and try it out I assure that the baby will like it and build the confidants to walk on its own :)
