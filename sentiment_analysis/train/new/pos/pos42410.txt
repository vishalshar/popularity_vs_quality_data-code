I bought the boon bathtub faucet dispenser because it was the only one amazon that is made to fit the bathtub spouts.  http://www.amazon.com/Boon-Deflector-Protective-Faucet-Dispenser/dp/B000G7WU50/Like may others, I had a mold issue with the boon.  With the Pricne Lionheart Faucet Extender, I was able to cut the plastic so that it would fit around my bathtub faucet.  Now it works great for giving the kids a bath and no mold issue whatsoever.
