My baby loves this rattle! I got two different kinds, and this one is by far the favorite. He liked it at 3 months, and he's liking it at 5 months. It has 2 different sounds - the tiny balls inside the large ring, and the 3 colored rings that clack together. Between the two sounds, and the variety of gripping/chewing areas (including the dotted ball, there are 3 different surface textures on the large ring), the baby can be entertained for several minutes at a time on his own, and several more minutes of watching me rotate the rattle and have the colored rings flop all over. A couple of times, he's even stopped screaming and fallen asleep, hypnotized by the moving, clattering rings (a HUGELY appreciated trait in our household). I'd highly recommend this rattle for any baby!
