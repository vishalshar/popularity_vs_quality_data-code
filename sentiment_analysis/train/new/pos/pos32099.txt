I bought this for our newborn after researching baby monitors for months. This product has the best price and reviews of all we found. We have it set up currently in our room facing the baby's bassinet and so far it has worked great. The picture is good quality for the price and the sound kicks in whenever he makes any noise including moving around. It has not messed with our wifi which we were concerned about.
