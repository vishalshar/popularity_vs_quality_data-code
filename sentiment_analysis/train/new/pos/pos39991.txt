We've had the crib for several months now. My main complaint is how easily the paint chips. We barely touch it with anything and it scratches. Other than that though, the crib has been great so far.  Our baby is 5 months and fits in it comfortably, although she's on the smaller side. We live in a one-bedroom apartment so it was necessary to buy a crib that wouldn't take over our room.We went through several different sheets and other such things to find what fits this crib so I'm going to share my tips.We bought the Davinci Crescent Mini Crib Universal Fit Waterproof 50-Coil Mattress from Amazon and went with no mattress cover (since the crib is waterproof). I tried several sheets on Amazon and finally went with the Babies R Us portacrib sheets. They fit much better than any other sheets sold on here for portacribs. Finally we use the BreathableBaby Breathable Bumper for Portable and Cradle Cribs and it works great.
