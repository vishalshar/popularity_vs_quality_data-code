I have used this bag for 17 months and am very pleased with it. It can hold A LOT of stuff, and it has survived a lot of use and not scuffed/scratched. It sits up on its own and opens up big so you can easily find things. I love the numerous deep outside pockets which make frequently used things easy to access (like a bottle or pacifier). I used the zipper pockets for my own stuff, as they're they perfect size for a credit card, keys, etc. The stroller clips are really handy, and I was so sad when one got lost. But then I realized I could attach the big shoulder strap and hang it over the stroller handles, and it worked just the same. The handles are starting to fray a bit where they attach to the silver "O rings" but that's to be expected when you have a synthetic bag that has been overstuffed. My only complaint is that the little sliver zipper pulls all fell off! I found two of them and "crimped" the zipper so they'd stay on, but I whish I'd known about this so I could have done it before I lost one of the pulls. Great buy and will serve you and your baby well!
