I have an incredibly cuddly baby who is just a few months old and I love the bonding opportunity the Moby gives us! This is the perfect accessory for parents who want to get a little grocery shopping or housework done but like to keep their little one close.Learning to tie the Moby is a breeze. I'd recommend looking at a photographic tutorial rather than reading one... It's much easier than it sounds!The baby is genuinely very secure. I started wearing our little girl when she was only a couple of weeks old. Having tried a sling carrier and a Moby, I feel there is NO comparison to how secure and confident I feel with my daughter in the Moby carrier.It's portable! So easy to fold (or let's be honest... wad up) the Moby and toss it in the diaper bag before heading out for the day. To be so long, it's surprisingly compact.Anybody can use it. Since it's just a long, stretchy cloth, my husband and I can easily share the amazing experience of doing every day life with our sweet girl coming along for the ride. There are no irritating sizes to sort through or buckles to figure out. It's a one size fits all cuddling system ;)Look up the health benefits of "baby-wearing" as well... Our little girl has been an absolute dream when it comes to fussiness and sleeping at night, and I have to say that I think the skin on skin contact during the day has heavily contributed to her sweet disposition!
