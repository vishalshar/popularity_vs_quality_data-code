Overall, I am happy with this product. My purchase was based on other reviews and I was counting on getting a playmat without a harsh synthetic odor.  I am extremely sensitive to all different types of synthetic and chemical odors.  When I opened the box, there was a very slight odor from the playmat but the majority disappeared after I wiped it down and left it out on my deck overnight.  I roll around on it with my baby and never feel overwhelmed or sick from the smell of it.  With that said, it has other qualities I like.  It has enough cushion so that my baby can hit his head on it without that horrible thumping sound. The individual squares go together and come apart again and again without any damage.  I like the puzzle type edges but you can also purchase smooth edges if you want to.  I have 2 dogs and a cat and their hair wipes off of it easliy with a paper towel or washcloth. It doesn't scratch easily but did get a few scratches from my dogs - but only after they were playing rough together on it (my fault). When my baby spits up on it, I clean it right away and it does not absorb the spit up.  It wipes clean very easily.  I purchased it because I have all hardwood floors and I want my baby to have a safe place to play, since he just started sitting and crawling all on the same day!!!Hint: Although I like all of the colors included, I'm sure some of you out there want to order playmats to match your decor.  If you go to the manufacturers website, you can order all of the same color, or you can order each square individually in whichever colors you want. There are lots of choices.  The mats also come in a bigger size.  The website explains everything, including the smooth edge available for the playmat. The website also has a calculator so you can put in the demnsions of your room and it tells you how much playmat you need to cover the floor.
