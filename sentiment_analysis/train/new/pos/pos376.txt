I have been looking all over for the perfect smaller diaper bag, instead of carrying around my HUGE Columbia diaper bag. I got tired of carrying around the big one to short trips to the store or Dr. Munchkin is my all time FAVORITE brand. I have always liked the things they came out with. I came across this online and HAD TO HAVE IT!! I looked at pictures online thinking it would be the perfect size. Well I was wrong. It is a little smaller than expected. I can only fit about 3 diapers and a pack of on-the-go wipes. You probably have room for one bottle and the formula dispenser. I had to switch wallets just to fit one in there.All in all, its perfect for a short outing, but I wish it came just a little bit bigger. I got the beige one and I was wanting the blue one. Amazon should let you be able to pick what color you want... that's if it's available.I do recommend but be prepared to not be able to store much in there!
