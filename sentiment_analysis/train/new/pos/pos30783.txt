I ordered two of these seat back protectors to install in my new Jetta Sportwagen. We have 2 1/2 year old twins and need to protect the new car from shoe marks. This product fit  nicely behind the two front seats. It covers the entire seat back, top to bottom. The product photo is deceiving because it makes the product appear triangular, which I suppose it is, but it fits flat and flexibly and covers the whole seat.I agree with another reviewer who reported the only drawback to be that the straps are too long. It's easy, though, to cut off the excess for a custom fit. The top and bottom straps tucked in to hide them from little and big hands.I would purchase this product again for another car.
