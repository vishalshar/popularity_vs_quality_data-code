PERFECT.  These are the best baby hangers.  Those cheap plastic ones hang up when you try and put tiny babe's clothes on them.  These are not like that - they let you slide baby's clothes on and off with ease.  Did not experience any issues with fitting them on the closet pole - they fit snug on the pole, yet easy (no catch) to take off pole.  Clothes stay on the hangers and they look great, too.  Much better than plastic ones.
