The motor on my Medela single pump had gone on the fritz so I needed a new one. Pumps are not cheap and I hated the thought of buying a new one, especially since my son was starting solids and would be taking less milk in. Regardless, I still needed one and searched reviews. This particular pump had very mixed reviews but I honestly think it works great and is an excellent value for the money. The flanges and handlebar are a little awkward, but once you get them positioned just right so there is no air gap, it works like a charm. Powerful suction as long as you have a good seal and again, it's a little awkward to position at first but once you get it just right it's great. Definitely worth the money. It is significantly priced lower than other pumps and works very well!
