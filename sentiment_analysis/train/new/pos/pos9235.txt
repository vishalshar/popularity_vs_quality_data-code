Pros and ConsCons first:The sections are small like ice cube size but this is a freezer tray so...Price.Pros:The lids do not warp if you wash them by hand.If they are frozen just run them under warm water and it resumes its shape.I make organic food in them.I make fresh herbs in them.I put almonds, coconut water, and pom juice in them for my morning fresh fruit drink.I mash bananas and freeze them for my pancakes.There is so much more...And they never wear out.You can put the trays in the dishwasher (not the lids) just air dry them after a wash cycle.If you are cooking for one, like me, you can even make spice cubes, sauce cubes, avocado oil cubes, etcI can't say enough about these trays and my children are deceased so I use them for my personal use.
