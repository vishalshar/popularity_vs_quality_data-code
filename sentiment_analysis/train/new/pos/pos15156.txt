I hate to gush too much, but this could possibly be the greatest baby toy ever.  It really keeps my baby entertained.  Things I love:--The toy bar is adjustable so that it can angle down toward the baby so that baby isn't just looking up at the bottoms of toys.--I like the interchangable cards that go in the slots of the toy.  Offers some variety.  And it would also be a good idea to put family photos in the slots as well.--Colors of the toy itself aren't too obnoxious.The only thing I don't care for is the music--very repetitive, and too loud.  We usually have it turned off.
