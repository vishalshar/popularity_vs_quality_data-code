I always purchase items from Amazon..so much that I'm even a Prime member...yet I have never written a product review for any of my purchases regardless of how much I liked/hated the product. But in this case, and in hopes of my review possibly helping someone purchase this for their infant, I have decided to write my first review.At first I thought this product was pricey but after comparing it to all other breathing monitors, I found this to be the best choice and most reliable of them all. I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews on here and about the batery life but decided to purchase it anyways for my first born who always had nasal problems since birth. Having used it nightly for the past 3 months now, I never received a false alarm, dead battery, or sound/vibration errors.Tonight, my four month old daughter (who sleeps in her own room since she snores loudly yet is a very light sleeper) fell into a deep sleep and stopped breathing. The monitor tried to vibrate her after 15 seconds and because she did not respond to that, it started to beep loudly. At first my husband and I thought it was our phone alarm going off but then realized it was the monitor. We rushed to her and yelled her name yet she lied still. I picked her up and shook her a bit while we both yelled at her and made loud clapping noises to which she finally responded and woke up. If it wasn't for this product, I honestly wouldn't know what to do with myself. Please don't let the price deter you from buying this...I would pay 3 times the price for what it did for us tonight. Also it's hard to get false alarms since it's easy to put on and heck even if you do get a false alarm, I'd rather have that then something worse happen!! I hope my review has helped. I never upsell anything until tonight
