This item is extremely sturdy although not unbreakable. I bought this item as a gift for my younger so that she may hang the baby's bag on the stroller during their walks. She really liked the gift, even though she was concerned about how much weight it could hold. This item holds a lot of weight. Daily in the item was able to hold: a thick diaper changing mat, 3 bottles, a Similac jar, at least 2-3 standard size water bottles(Dasani), a blanket, an extra set of clothes, wipes, cream, cell phone, keys without a single problem. However the clicky part of the item did brake after it was thrown multiple times against a tree and then against pavement by an energetic 2 year old.
