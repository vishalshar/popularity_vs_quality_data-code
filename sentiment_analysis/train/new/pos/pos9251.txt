I bought this bed and received it in 2 days. I LOVE it! I put it together by myself no help from my hubby.I bought it in Cherry. It came VERY well packaged, the fastest shipping. The wood as intact. No scratches, dents, scrapes. No missing nails etc. Perfect holes. I have zero complaints. It loos adorable and best of all my 15 month old son loves it that's what's important. The bed is very secure. No worries about that what so ever. Standard crib bed fits perfect. So does the crib bedding set also fits amazing. I recommend this bed 100%.I wanted to point out that I read some reviews that made no sense. Plz read reviews that make sense people.For example: "I jumped on the bed to test it and it broke, that's why I gave it a 1 star" -_- are u serious??"I hammered the nails and the wood broke it's a piece of crap" Where does it say u need to hammer anything??? -_-"My mattress didn't fit the bed beware of buyer" Umm... READ DESCRIPTION people!! Take one second to READ! -_-Should I continue? I mean all I gotta say is "I recommend this bed";)
