These are easy for my kids (even the 4 y.o.) to open and close completely. That's what I was hoping for. However, I only gave 4 stars because they really have to be inside a bigger container. Since they're so easy to open, you run the risk of the little tab on the lid catching on something in the lunchbox and opening. But I will definitely buy more!
