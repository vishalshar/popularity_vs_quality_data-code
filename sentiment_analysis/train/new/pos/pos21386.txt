Best blanket ever. My almost 4 year old still has to have it every night! It's taken almost 4 years of at least weekly washings and is still like new. Super soft, no pilling, no fading (even with occasional bleaching). It has two tags on the side and is his"taggy blanky" ;) An easy choice for a baby shower!
