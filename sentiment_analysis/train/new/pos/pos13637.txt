Not as pictured.  Colors do vary however I received a couple that are gender neutral.  The ones I received were the clips that come with a gift set you can find at Wal-Mart.  I couldn't find them individually without buying the gift set so I am very happy that they arrived given I had the same one with my son.  I will be using these for my girl that will be arriving soon.  Even though I ordered the green ones shown on the item page, I am glad to have received the "dot" one I attached a photo of.  Even though the dots have blue in them with a blue strap, I still think it would work for a girl.  I wish they made this item with interchangeable straps though.  Color doesn't matter so much to me given I know how much this clip works and doesn't fall off the child's clothing too easily.These clips came well protected in a air pouch envelope and inside NUK packaging.  I wish Nuk still had this same item in the stores that carry their product.  This was my most valued clip with my son and I wanted more in because sometimes if you send things to daycare or grandma's they don't always make it back to your house and it is really good to have an extra of something you know gets the job done.  This clip has a grasp strong enough that it is not easily removed from the shirt.  Other clips I found came off too easily and this one gets the job done.  I would recommend this product for anyone that needs a durable and easy to use pacifier clip.
