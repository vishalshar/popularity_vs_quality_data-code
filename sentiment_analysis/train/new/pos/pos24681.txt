I heard great things about Badger Sunscreen from a friend and was very excited to try it!  We live in sunny Florida and my kids are often outside in the heat of the day.  I have been very pleased with the results of both the face and body sunscreen cream.  I have not seen any red on my kids and I feel much better about using this product than with traditional, chemical filled brands.  I like that this product is safe and all natural.  We will be taking a tropical vacation this summer and I look forward to putting these products to the true test.  So far so good!
