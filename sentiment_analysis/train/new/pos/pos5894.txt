Pros:Baby can't get photos out by him/herselfPages have tabs to help baby turn pages easilyStandard 4x6 photos fit in very nicely, no need to trimFun colorful borders around each page, keeps baby's interest upReally great for showing baby/toddler photos of friends and family without fear of damaging the photosHighly durable (we've had ours for about 3 years - it's in with the kids toys) and neither the photo book nor the photos themselves are damaged in any way.Cons:Wish there were more "pages" to itOne of the photo places they count is the tiny one on the front page (I wish they hadn't counted that as a photo place, because it's so small! - the rest are standard size)Near the border but on the clear bit where the photo goes, there is often a small cartoon cat, or dog, etc - although it's very small this can actually be a bit distracting from the actual photo, and my child seems to think that it is part of the photo! NOTE that this issue is VERY minor, we're talking a tiny thing near the corner of the page, but I still wish it wasn't there.The bottom line:Overall the pros more than outweigh the cons.  A great book, my 2 kids use it a lot and it's held up perfectly to the rigors of life! If you're looking for a good photo book, I would recommend this.
