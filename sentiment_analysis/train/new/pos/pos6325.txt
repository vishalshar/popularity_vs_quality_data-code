I wanted to buy drool pads for my Beco Gemini carrier, but found the $20 Beco charges for their branded version to be too expensive.  These Pognae drool pads fit perfectly on my Beco and are soft to the touch.  Plus, they are cheaper than the Beco ones, which was the main reason I purchased these instead.  My daughter is currently not teething so she has not been chewing on the straps of the carrier, but these also protect against spit up and boogies.  So far I've washed them once and they washed well.  So far it's a 5 star product and for the cheaper price, I'd recommend these.
