This jumperoo was a lifesaver for us.  When we needed to do something and make sure the little ones were not getting into anything, we could put them in here and know that they were safe, having fun, and exercising.  If we weren't in the same room, we could hear the laughing and giggling, along with the plethora of toys that come with it.The best part is that it comes with little loops that you can attach additional toys to.  We used them for strap toys and the links that you can purchase to make large chains.  Overall, this was a great value.  Don't know what we would have done without it.
