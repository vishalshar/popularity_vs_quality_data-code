I bought this as a baby shower gift for a friend that has a owl themed nursery.  When I saw this robe online, I knew I just had to get it for her.  The quality seems really good and it's just too darn cute for words!  I must say though that the size is a lot smaller in person.  It says the size fits up to 9 months but I really don't think the average 9 month old would fit in this robe.  I have two small kids myself that are tiny for their age and I know that they would have outgrown this robe long before they turned 9 months old.  Even still, it's a nice robe for a great price and highly recommend it.
