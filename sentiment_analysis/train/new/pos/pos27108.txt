Don't listen to the bad reviews!!!  This is really a nice diaper pail.  I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.  In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.  Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.  Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.  I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!  We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.  We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.  So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!  With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.  The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.  He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".3.  Bags are easy to change.  Pop the lid, fold it back on its hinge, pull the trash bag through the ring, and take out the dirty diapers.  To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.  It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.4.  It keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room!  Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.  Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!  To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.  Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.  Works great!!!!5.  The price is right.  At $30 we put one in the nursery and one in our toddler's room.
