I reviewed it before I purchased car seat base for their babies, since my girls have THE CHICO KEYFIT carseats for their babies,  I needed the base for my car and its perfect. I have read the reviews in consumer report about these carseats and base ands they are rated extremely safe and top of line. when they come to visit. I know my grandchildren will be safe in my car
