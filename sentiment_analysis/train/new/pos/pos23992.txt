I read a lot of reviews of people complaining about how bright the lights are. I also read one in particular that said they're bright, but that's a GOOD THING. A couple of others didn't mind the lights so much. So I went with the awesome review about it being good to have them bright. Honestly, I can sleep with the tv on, so a little blue light isn't going to bother me. I wanted something bright for the baby's room to double as a good night light. It's really NOT that bright. I suppose if you were to have it right by their face it might be, but it is clear and sensitive enough to be places across the room from baby. I've had three other monitors. I purchased one @ $400 (video)and it was a nightmare due to the static. I had one that was $30 and it worked well, but no lights and the other was also noisy with static. My son is getting older and I will probably not need it for too long, but I really wish I had bought this first. The only light on parent unit is the power button. Sides light up when he cries. It's a beautiful blue glow. We're big fans of that. I can't imagine what sort of sleep people get if they couldn't sleep with a simple blue power button...especially if you have a baby.
