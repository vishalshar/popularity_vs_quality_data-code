we own the Brookline crib but they don't make the conversion kit for it any more. so this was a good option. The bed rail matches perfectly and the toddler rail is just barely a lighter shade. it worked out wonderfully our little one loves climbing in and out of her bed. If I would have been thinking I would have bought two so she could get down on either side.
