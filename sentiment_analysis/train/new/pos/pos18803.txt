I tried out the other two brands, Graco and Kolcraft with my Chicco Key Fit 30 in  a local boutique and this was the only brand the Chicco sat in comfortably.  Also, the other brands didn't have the safety belt which I felt was lacking in safety because of the clip system in the keyfit, it wouldn't "snap" in.I have been a huge Maclaren fan for over 9 years now.  I have a Quest from 6 years ago that I use for my day care and just received a pink/grey one for our new baby girl.  I love this line.  No, its not for everyone, but I definately set a trend with mine a few years back in our small community.  Its lightweight which is great for new moms because our arms, necks and shoulders take a beating with a new baby.  It doesn't take up a lot of space, even with my crossover SUV, I didn't want the bulk of a large stroller,  With two olderkids in sports; coolers, chairs, bags and unbrella's, stroller space was tight and this and the Quest are the perfect fit for our lifestyle.
