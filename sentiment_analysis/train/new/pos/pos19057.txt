We don't have any problem with it falling out of our Pacifica. When you install it, you really have to make sure it's in the correct spot. It goes through the fabric and INTO the plastic part of the seat. If you just put it through the fabic, but miss the little slot in the seat,  I can see how it would come out easily. My kids are 4 and 2 and neither have taking them out.
