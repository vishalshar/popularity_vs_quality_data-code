This is a fairly attractive piece of "jewelry," but of course, is main function is as a teething toy for babies. My wife liked the convenience of having it around her neck and at hand for those teething moments, but it was hard to remember to put it on when our focus was mainly on finding the diapers, the wipes, the snacks, the bibs, etc. That is, it just wasn't a top priority, and so she didn't use it that much.But, when she did, it was fine. It didn't keep our son occupied for hours, but he did work on it a little. The color is nice too--quite bright (although the logo is pretty visible, which we couldn't really tell that from the photo.)
