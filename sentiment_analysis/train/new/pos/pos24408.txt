We bought this toy 6 months ago for our then 6 month old niece. She LOVED it. Used it daily. She is 14 months and still plays with it all the time. We decided to buy one for our 8 month old and she loves it, too. It is not like a true tablet...it isn't flat screen or digital by any means. It has 9 buttons that light up and make noises including ABCs and days of the week and the "track ball" at the bottom rolls and all the buttons light up when you move the ball. We don't believe in allowing our baby to play with our cell phones or real tablet or watch much tv, we try to keep her low-tech with the classic baby toys but I am comfortable letting her play with this toy for the tactile stimulation and for cause and effect practice, too. Plus, its small and I just toss it in the baby bag and let her hold it in the car or in her stroller.
