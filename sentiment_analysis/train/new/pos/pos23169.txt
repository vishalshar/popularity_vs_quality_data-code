These spouts are very stiff and have only one slit.  They would probably be for a younger child just starting to get off the bottle.  I was looking for the softer ones with the triangular-shaped slit, and the main reason for 4 stars was that it is impossible to tell which one you are getting from the description online.  These work fine, and our daughter doesn't seem to notice the difference, but would have preferred the exact one I have that have worn out.
