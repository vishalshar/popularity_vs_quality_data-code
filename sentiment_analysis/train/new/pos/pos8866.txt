I have now bought these bibs repeatedly for my own children, as well as gifts for several others.  They are by far, the BEST BIBS EVER!  They are soft & thin & comfortable for the kiddos to wear, yet waterproof & protect their cute little clothes.  The velcro is secure but easy to use.  I love the pockets, as they catch a lot of the mess & end up protecting little laps as well(& my kids have learned to eat "seconds" out of the pocket).  They are so easy wash or rinse & they dry very quickly.  I usually use one bib per day-rinse between meals/snacks & hang dry-then the bib is dry & ready for the next meal or snack.  Perhaps a bit more pricey than some bibs, but worth every penny!  You will NOT regret this purchase!
