We didn't use a product like this for our first two kids but our third spent time in the NICU for breathing issues so we wanted the added peace of mind. This mat works really well. The breaths per minute it records are right in line with the NICU monitors which gives me confidence. I also like how large the mat is.I didn't give it five stars because you can't set the extra alerts individually. For example, if you want it to alert you if the baby moves off the mat you also have to have the alert on for the baby waking up. It's also kind of annoying that there is no low battery warning for the actual mat. Nothing like hunting for a screwdriver at 3am to change batteries.
