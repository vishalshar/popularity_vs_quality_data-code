Our 5 week old seems to like this pillow for tummy time.  He really likes to hold his head up and look around, and without any support this poor little kid was really at the mercy of gravity.  Propping him up on the pillow makes it much easier for him, and he is able to last a lot longer before he gets tired or frustrated.  He isn't yet at the point where he can enjoy the colors or play with the crinkly toys, but I'm sure that will add to the usefulness of this pillow soon.  This particular Boppy product seems to be very reasonably priced too, which is nice.  He spits up quite a bit and I'ce already had to wash the pillow a few times.  So far it has held up well, crinkly toys included.
