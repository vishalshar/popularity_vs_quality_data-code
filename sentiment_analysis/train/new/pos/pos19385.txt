I've been collecting different collections of Classic Winnie the Pooh bedding from different websites for almost two years now and this is the last one I think I'll ever buy. No bedding I've ever purchased lives up to this set. It was/is incredibly affordable compared to how much other sets have cost me and the construction and embroidery on this is just beautiful. Most Classic Pooh bedding I've encountered is "unisex" but tends to lean toward feminine, while this set is ACTUALLY unisex. I would use this in any girls or boys room! After receiving it, I ended up buying a bunch of extra matching sheets, the changing pad covers, a few window valances, and the diaper stacker of the same collection! The only thing I'm disappointed about is that it doesn't come with a matching hamper too! But I've found that the "My Friend Pooh" Collection that is discontinued but available on some websites has a great hamper that matches very well and is very unisex too! Couldn't be happier!
