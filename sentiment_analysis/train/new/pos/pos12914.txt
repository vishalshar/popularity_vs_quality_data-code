I've been using these for a very long time now. My son went straight to these, never used a bottle. They don't leak, the seal on lid and the valves/ spout inside are made so well. If you are debating on whether or not to purchase, PURCHASE! The most important factor to me in these types of cups are leaks. You can throw this in your purse, diaper bag, let it roll around anywhere and as long as you have the lid within the LEAK PROOF zone everything will be dry. They are breakproof. One lid cracked on me but only after 2 years of use and it withstood TONS of drops, slams etc. Best cup out there and we have tried many!
