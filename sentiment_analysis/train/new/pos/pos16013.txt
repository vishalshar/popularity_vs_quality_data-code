Cute frame and beautiful idea of pictures. Only complaint are the picture sizes. Walgreens and most local photo printing services don't offer the sizes this frame is mentioned to hold. Ended up creating a 8x10 collage print and using the frame to hold that since the various print sizes I ordered didn't fit well enough for the frames provided.
