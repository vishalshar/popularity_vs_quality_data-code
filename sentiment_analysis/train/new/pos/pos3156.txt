I've tried several brands of covered bowls including Sassy and this bowl. The Munchkin is by the far the superior product.  The lid snaps on easily, stays on, doesn't leak, and does not warp in the dishwasher.  The suction ring also continues to stick, even after multiple washing.  This cannot be said for the Sassy.  My only complaint is the higher price and the unavailability of this bowl.  Why can't I just by it in a store like Target?
