I needed a lunch box because my food kept vanishing in the random ralphs bags in the community work fridge.  i figured the thieves would be less brave to steal from a lunch box.  and also i love hello kitty.  walla.....  2 birds, 1 hello kitty, 1 stone.  my lunch is there every day.  unless i leave it on friday. then the cleaning staff sets it on top of the fridge and whatever i had in there spoils.  le sigh.it was bigger than i thought, but exactly what i needed.  im sure kids would love it too.
