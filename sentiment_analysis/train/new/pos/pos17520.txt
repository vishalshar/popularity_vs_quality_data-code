We bought this for our 5 year old daughter for her iPod touch.  It's great, she loves it!  Perfect way for her to comfortably watch movies and play games, without having to continuously situate or hold her iPod.  Does exactly what we hoped!Pros:  functionality,  weighted feet help prop it and keep in place  soft yet good quality/durable  easy to slide her iPod (5th generation) in and out, even with the protective case on it  iPod stays in place, does not slip  free app in the app store goes with it!  My daughter LOVES it, even sleeps with it at night like a doll (but without her iPod in it)Cons:  There is a plastic screen on this, we keep a case on her iPod, even while it is in this, so the screen protrudes and she can't really do anything. I even tried to take her case off, and still she couldn't get the touch screen to work through the plastic.  So, we used an x-acto knife and cut away the screen, (leaving only about 1/2 of plastic on the left and right side for stability).  Now it works great!  And the iPod still stays in as it did before.(The plastic screen is the only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5...they really should leave that off.)
