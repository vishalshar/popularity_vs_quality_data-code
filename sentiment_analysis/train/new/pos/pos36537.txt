I bought this crib when my daughter was already a toddler. We've had it for a little over a year now. She really likes it. She jumps on het mattress ask the time and she has a lot of space for play. She moves all over the place when she's sleeping so this gives her ample room. Although since she's gotten bigger, her arms and legs poke through the bars and sometimes she gets stuck. We bought crib padding which helped. Its been moved all over the house during spring cleaning and when we moved. It's really easy to put together initially, but does take some time. I think it took me 2-3 hours by myself. My only complaint is the screw holes connecting the front to the sides are slightly off. Also, because the crib is so big, you must be sure to buy the right size mattress.
