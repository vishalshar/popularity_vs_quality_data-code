Pros: Interchangeable parts with mam bottles, great for little hands, soft spout like a bottle yet it works similar to a sippy cup.Cons: Not spill-free, after one day the spout drips when turned upside down (like a bottle would) but I think it is due to my daughters biting rather then a defect in the product.My daughter has loved many Mam products since birth(pacifiers, bottles, etc.) so naturally I got her this cup when I decided to wean her off of the bottle.  It works well for a transition, I just wish it was more spill-proof.  And you have to be prepared to get any color when ordering these smaller products from Amazon.  If you would rather choose your color than it is best to find the item in a store.
