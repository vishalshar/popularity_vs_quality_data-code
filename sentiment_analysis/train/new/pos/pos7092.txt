I can't rave enough about this product.  It's truly a life-saver if you're a breast-feeding mom trying to save every drop of precious breast milk for your precious baby.  When I first received this, it's bigger than it looks, but it's comfortable to place upon your breast and it has a circular hole on the inside where you can slip your nipple into securely and snugly to be held up by your bra as you nurse your baby on the other side.  When you nurse, your milk flows freely on the other side and it drips into the milkies appendage, thus storing it safely.  The only negative thing about this is that you cannot bend over forward too severely while having it on or the milk will fall out.  But, other than that.  I can't complain about getting an extra ounce or two feeding from it without having the need to pump, and trust me, that takes a lot of my time and energy since I have a hard time producing enough breast milk for my growing son, so I need to supplement with formula accordingly.  But, to those who are looking forward to breast feed, this is a "MUST!"
