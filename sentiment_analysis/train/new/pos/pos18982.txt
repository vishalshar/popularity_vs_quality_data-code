I have a tall, very thin, three year old girl and she just adores this stroller.  She doesn't (always) complain about riding and it's high enough to push comfortably without making my back hurt.  I am 5'7 and it's nice not to have to hunch over to push her through the zoo, or the mall, or park.  It has a very nice sized basked under the seat that will hold quite a bit and a little more if you stuff creativly. the colors mix very well and it's a nice stroller for an older child when the original travel stroller has gotten too small or you just need something taller for you.  Delivery was prompt and arived a day sooner then we expected.
