When it comes to my son and my budget, lol...I don't have a lot of room to be playing around with worthless toys that he won't have any desire to be entertained by.  Therefore, with the cost & all of the great reviews, I went with it..This weird lil contraption has so much going on with it, with all the different interacting sides until you would think, 'what curious child wouldn't be entertained by it'?  Anyway my son is always grabbing this thing, turning it on all sides and playing with the lil gadgets.So for the reviews & the price, and more importantly the smile on my son's face, it was definitely worth it.  I included a pic of him on the customer-shared images section.
