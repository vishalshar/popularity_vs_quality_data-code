Best dog beds for a cheap price. Ortho dog beds run in the hundreds of dollars and aren't as sturdy and comfortable as crib mattresses. I buy the spring mattress, not the ones stuffed with foam or fiberfill. I bought one once and it fell apart under wear.I highly recommend this as a dog bed. I get crib sheets and can just throw them into the wash. If you dog is smaller there are travel crib mattresses and bassinet mattresses.
