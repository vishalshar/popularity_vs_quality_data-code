This is the best toilet seat.  The fancy ones with all the parts are always falling apart and difficult to clean; the ones with removable pee gaurds are annoying (the ppe gaurd is always getting lost).  It is a great height for most kids so their feet are not dangling (if the knees are not up a little it makes it hard for them to have a stool).  After flailing with the "bells and whistle" ones we now have our two useing this one!  Good luck!  p.s. I also like the idea of the black basin but our also came all white but that is ok with us.
