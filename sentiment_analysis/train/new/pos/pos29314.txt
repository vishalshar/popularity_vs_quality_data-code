I actually use it on my 2 year old daughter's crib.  We removed the front side of the crib to get her used to sleeping in a regular bed style before we buy an actual twin bed.  It's a little long for a crib and doesn't leave much room for her to get in and out, but still leaves just enough room for her to still manage it.  I wish the metal part at the sides had some covering as that part doesn't look so nice, but it's a great affordable bed guard option, especially since it can work on the crib and then be moved to a twin.  Was easy to put together and easy to use.
