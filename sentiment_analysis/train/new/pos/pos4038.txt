My daughter turned one year old in October, and we decided that we would wean her from the bottle.  We tried several different brands of sippy cups - Nuby, Born Free, and Nuk Gerber Graduate.  My daughter threw the Nuby one at me.  Thankfully she missed, but it hit the floor and leaked milk all over.  Of course the dog was excited, and he promptly cleaned up the mess.  As for the Nuk, it was just a mess.  Although my daughter will drink from it, half of the milk dribbles down her chin onto her shirt.  She loves the Born Free cup, and once we realized this was a hit, we immediately packed up her Avent bottles, put them in the basement, and purchased 3 more of the Born Free trainer cups.  My daughter doesn't sit still for long - she is just too busy.  So she often drops her cup on the floor, and I am so happy to say that it doesn't leak milk.  My dog is not so happy, but I am okay with that!  Its also a much cleaner drinking experience - no more dribbles down her chin.  I can dress her for the day, give her a cup of milk, and know that I won't have to change her again before school.  My daughter and I both love this cup.  It may be more expensive than others on the market, but I believe its well worth it.
