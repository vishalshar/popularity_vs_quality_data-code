This became a staple for our child, and actually found that on several occasions, other little kids were trying to get their mitts on them, which was hilarious but also ended up with several infants shrieking at each other after you've snatched it from the hands of someone's grabby child, which leads to several parents trying to sort out who-had-what-first.  Luckily the name I wrote on it didn't wash off; a handy fact when another parent insisted I'd stolen it from her child.
