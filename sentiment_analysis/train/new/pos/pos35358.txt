We tried and returned 3 other baby monitors. I was so frustrated that when I bought this one I unpacked it just enough to try it out really quick, fully prepared to be taking another monitor back to the store. But it worked great!!! The problems we had with other monitors were ridiculously heavy static at all times, and gritty sounds when the baby made noises. They also didn't get a good signal, or even any signal at all, in a different room. I had to be out in the hall right in front of baby's door. Worthless.This monitor is mostly clear (there's low, hardly noticeable static). We keep it just a few notches below the loudest setting and you can't hear the static unless the room is completely silent, and even then it's not bad. Also, the sounds from baby are SUPER clear. You can even hear someone whispering in the room. And we have the monitor about 10 feet away from the baby's crib! I also get a clear signal anywhere in our house, garage, or elsewhere on the property. I love this monitor.So then we got a second one. We keep dogs at our house for training. We got another one of these monitors for their room. We actually have to keep in outside of their room because it's so sensitive we were hearing every shuffle and sniff all night and just need it to hear barking.Another perk to this device is it doesn't look all cutesy. Probably not important, I know, but both my husband and I appreciate that.I'm sure there's better monitors out there. But if you're not looking to spend a ton of money, and find that the cheap ones are crap, then this is the perfect buy. I'm on this site right now to buy a third one. My toddler son go a hold of one of the base units and messed up the wire.
