To provide some background, I live in a townhome in Northern Virginia where people have wireless networks on either side of us. We use our own wireless network extensively (typical Linksys 2.4 GHz) and we own a cordless phone (Uniden 5.8 GHz). The Mobicam Wireless System works fantastic in our house! I am incredibly impressed with the quality of the video. The screen, while small, works well and if I need a larger view then I can just use the AV jacks with the television. I'm glad I didn't allow some of the other reviews on this board prevent me from purchasing this system! Also...few things are cooler in this world than infant-surveilling-night-vision!! I mean, c'mon people! It's night vision! For babies! That's cooler than monkeys juggling bananas!Being that I'm 9 months pregnant I had more than ample opportunity to play around with the night vision function (during my vampiric hours of insomnia) on the camera and it works great despite the bright nightlight we have in the nursery. Like most cameras, an interior camera works best facing away from the light source (window during daylight) but you can adjust the brightness on the monitor so that's not too bad. This is definitely worth the big bucks:) I am very pleased:)
