My LO fell in love with Sophie at the first sight! This product is truly amazing. I'm not sure what is the most attractive part of Sophie, but the baby seems just happy to see it. The Bath toy is really cute as well. It is not made from rubber, so parents who are addicted to the "Natural" things, please consider about it before making decisions. But I suppose even if it is natural rubber as well, I won't let my LO chew on it. It suppose to be something used for bathing, not teething. Also, I got the yellow one instead of the blue one shown on the picture. I am totally okay about that. But if you want certain color, maybe you should contact the seller first.The only reason I am not 100% satisfied about it was the package. When it says it comes in a gift box, I thought it would be an extra box designed for the combo, but they actually came in the two separate original boxes, the same as when you buy them separately. Also, the box for the teether was squashed a little bit. I don't know if I chose the gift option at check out, should it come differently.
