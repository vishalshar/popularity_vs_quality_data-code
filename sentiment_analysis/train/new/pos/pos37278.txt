The Rain Cover designed to fit a few of Peg-Perego strollers.It fits Pliko Mini stroller good.There is no elastic, which suppose to fit around the hood, that edge is made of plastic. However, seems to fit just fine. I don't know, how it will handle heavy rain though.I also noticed, that bottom of the cover is shorter, then shown on the picture, not below feet support, rather on top of it.I like the fact, that cover is relatively small, it fits in a Stroller Mesh Bag, I am using with this stroller. Stroller could be folded easily with it inside. The other brand's rain cover,(one which cover the stroller completely, with hood and back covered) did not fit in a mesh bag.Keep it mind, that you can not keep the cover  in the basket underneath, because the stroller will not fold with anything  in it.
