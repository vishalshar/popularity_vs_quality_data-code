Haven't given it the time test but my wife loves this bag. She always carries more than she need so this bag is perfect. It is very large and has lots of pockets. Come with some nice little extras like purse and bottle cooler. She thinks its very stylish and fits her perfectly. One negative is that since she does carry a lot it can get heavy and the over the shoulder strap provided is thin and without padding so it can cut into your shoulder. Just an FYI.
