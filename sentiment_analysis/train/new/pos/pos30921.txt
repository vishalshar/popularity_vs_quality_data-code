This High chair is great for my needs. I purchased this for my granddaughter. I didn't want a real high chair taking up a whole lot of room in my kitchen so this one did the job. It fits snuggly in my kitchen chair. She fits perfectly in the chair as well. She is almost two. I like the way the tray snaps in but it doesn't always do it's job properly. Sometimes my granddaughter tries to escape while eating so she can roam around and she has been able to remove the tray. However the tray is easy to clean. The harness is snug though but don't put the baby in the chair and snap on the tray without the harness,if your kid removes the tray they will fall as this almost happened to my granddaughter. Also their are two straps on the bottom and side of the high chair that adheres the seat to the kitchen chair.The reclining feature is amazing. Plus the pattern is nice. It's not the sturdyest high chair overall however. I like that the tray is removable because my granddaughter can sit up to the table without it and eat with the adults. The tray has two cup holder slots as well. As my granddaughter gets older she will be able to sit in the chair as it converts to a seat but this feature is ugly. It's just a hard plastic tan seat. You will have to remove the cover. But hey,what can you do! I like that this chair can grow with her.
