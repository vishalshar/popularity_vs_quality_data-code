Pros:1. Adjustable camera (for angling it just so)2. Excellent visibility for night time (thanks to its night light)3. Excellent visibility for day time (a crisp, COLOR image)4. Monitor screen size is perfect (I can see what's going on when standing across the room from it instead of squinting at a small monitor)5. The volume control is great (on the highest/most sensitive setting I can hear EVERYTHING, a whisper, a heavy breath, etc)6. The "talk" feature is great (that button is on the monitor screen and by pressing it, you talk into the screen and your baby can hear your voice coming out of the camera. Has proven ESPECIALLY helpful when I'm running up the stairs to my one year old who has decided nap time on her parents' king size bed is officially over. So, I talk into it if she's making a beeline for the edge. It stops her dead in her tracks until I can make my way up there.)7. The monitor screen works off of its charge for 2 hours.8. The camera has a light that allows me to adjust the angle of the camera so that it pin points where I want it to (instead of guessing if I angled the camera just so only to go downstairs and discover on the screen that I pointed the camera all wrong.) Because of the soft light that turns on (which is what allows for visibility in a pitch black room), I use that to guide my positioning of the camera.9. When room is pitch black, the image is good.10. When the room has a night light illuminating a pitch black room, the image is excellent.11. I've used this monitor every day for nap time and night time religiously for over a year (my baby is 14 months) and I've never had a problem with it. Excellent product.ConsNot to sound like a jerk but I don't have a single con. It's  worked great for my needs.
