I searched high and low for the perfect first easter basket for my 9 month old baby. Looked at everything on Amazon, Pottery Barn, Etsy, and in all the stores and kept coming back to this one. It arrived today and is even better in person. It looks like a luxury stuffed toy worth several times what I paid for it on Amazon. Simply adorable!!! Such a beautiful soft shade of butter yellow with a perfect blue gingham bow. I love it and know gat once he grows out of it, it will look great as an Easter decoration in our house. Highly recommend!!!
