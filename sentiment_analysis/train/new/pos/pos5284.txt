I got these as overnight undies for my 3 year old. Thankfully she pretty much stays dry through the night, but these are perfect "just in case". We had some training undies with vinyl covers that were a disaster. When she had an accident, the pee wicked right up onto her back and shirt (and sheets, etc.). These are pricey, but so far they seem worth it. They do take a little while to dry after washing, so you may want to get more than one pair.
