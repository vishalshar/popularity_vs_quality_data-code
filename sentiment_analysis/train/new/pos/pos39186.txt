When you take this item out of its box and unfold it, you see 2 separate valves (one very large valve and one standard inflating valve).  The standard valve allows you to blow air into the border of the mat - that most people can figure out.  The large valve is the way in for water filling.  Sounds easy enough... until you notice that this valve is 'blocked' - in other words, where you expect a big, fat opening, there is very thick plastic.  Here's the part that's easy to miss: the opening to this valve is 'blocked' with a very shallow 'cup' that has an inch long slit at its bottom/inner seam, on the side opposite from where the valve cover attaches.  When you squeeze this shallow 'cup' in at the sides, that slit opens into a conveniently sized access point for filling water from a tap.  Don't forget to work out the folds and kinks in the mat (especially near where the fill valve is) to allow water to flow smoothly into the mat cavity.  And one more thing:  When you are done filling with water, some suggest adding a few drops of non-chlorine bleach.  Then hold the mat by the filling valve (so that the valve is the highest point) gently resting the mat in a sink. Then, gently squeeze out as much excess air as you can before closing the valve.Different people might prefer different water fill levels.  I filled it such that as I held the filled mat by the water filling valve and let the filled cavity hang, it appeared just over half full.  That level seemed to work well for my daughter.We just received and filled the mat today and my daughter, who is a very late crawler and has strongly resisted tummy time, spent over 30 minutes supporting her upper body with her arms and playing with the mat.  I am very pleased with the purchase and believe I have found the key to giving my daughter the incentive she needs to build those weight supporting muscles.
