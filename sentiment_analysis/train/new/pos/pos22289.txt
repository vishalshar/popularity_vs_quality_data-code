I bought this as I became obsessed with finding a good SPF blanket to block out the suns rays in the stroller, and was really impressed with this blanket for a few reasons.Pros:cost, much less than other SPF blankets.lightweight, you can throw in diaper bag or purse or pocket.quality, also much better than a few of the other more expensive brands on the market.dark color, I like that as a throw over for the stroller it also darkens so it is not so bright for baby.Use, I have actually been able to use this blanket as a breastfeeding cover, the velcro ties are awesome.Cons:if you don't have it secure over the stroller it can blow off or shift quite easily due to how lightweight it is.Size, it is fairly small but adequately provides coverage over stroller. I would maybe like it to be a tiny bit bigger or have size options.Overall, I'm beyond happy with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an SPF blanket. I have seen and felt all the other ones (I also like the SunSnapz blanket, but they are very expensive and also light in color, but can be used better to wrap the baby in as a regular blanket...)
