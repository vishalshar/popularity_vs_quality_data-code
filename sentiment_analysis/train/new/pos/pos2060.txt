I bought these to help entertain my 5 month old daughter, and she just loves them.  I put them on her car seat, used them to distract her during diaper changes, put them around her wrist like a bracelet when she is in her bouncer or on her mat.  The packaging says to not wash them, so I held off for a while with just "wiping" them clean as directed.  It bothered me after it was dropped several times (especially with puppies in the house), so I just threw one in the washer with the rest of her laundry to see how it would fair.  (I figured I had two and could spare one or order more if needed.)  I'm happy to report both toys have survived many trips through the washer and dryer and they are still intact (and still chime).  It helps ease my mind that I can wash them, probably just a new mom thing, but it makes me feel better to give her toys I know are clean.
