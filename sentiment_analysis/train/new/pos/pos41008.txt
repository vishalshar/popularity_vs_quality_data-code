I purchased this Puzzle for my Grandson who is almost two. Of course, Skip Hop products are always a safe bet but a Grandmother still wonders if the child will like it and to my delight he absolutely loves this puzzle.  We sat together the first time and I marvel at how bright and focused children are when they are enjoying their new "toy."  The pieces are solidly built for little hands and each square is much more than just putting the pieces in to fit, they tell a little story and give toddlers "clues" that are both entertaining and educational. Of all the gifts we Grandparents and parents purchase for the little ones, put this one on the top of your list, you won't be disappointed but very surprised how one puzzle can bring him/her such joy when he is able to finish it all by himself and know and understand why the pieces fit where they should and how the pieces can be used "outside" of the puzzle.
