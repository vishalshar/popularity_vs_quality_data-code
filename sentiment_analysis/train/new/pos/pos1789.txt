I've had the stroller for about two weeks now, and I like it. It's easy to maneuver and pretty light for it's size.  I had no trouble figuring out how to operate it.  Took my husband amybe 5-10 minutes to put together.  My oldest daughter (3 and a half now) refused to ride in a stroller since she turned 18 months, but when she saw this stroller and realized that she could get a ride with her infant sister, she was thrilled.  However, she is very tall for a 3-year-old, so it's a little uncomfortable for her to sit in the back, but standing is no problem at all.  I have to say, this made my shopping trips (if you can call them that) a lot easier.
