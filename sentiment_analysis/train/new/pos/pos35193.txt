It’s a cheap wig, for Lords sake.  I didn’t expect much.  It came in a flat bag, but expanded enough to snugly fit my head.  The curls were not at all even as shown in the picture, but easily unfurled with contact.  That didn’t bother me, as it’s a darn clown’s wig!  It doesn’t need to look perfect.  I purchased this for one event and it worked fine.  I looked like a clown in a clown’s wig, which was the point.  Anyone who expects more for their money is a clown as well.  If you want a perfect afro-clown wig, grow one and dye the hell out of it, for Lords sake.
