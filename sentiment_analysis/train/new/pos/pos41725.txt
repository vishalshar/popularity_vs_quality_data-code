We have tried all the cloth diaper systems, and we are happiest with (1) green mountain fitteds with covers and (2) GroVia covers with snap in pads. We first got our GroVia covers to wear over the fitted diapers, and later bought the soaker pads just to try - very glad we did. It's even easier to swap out these pads than switch a fitted. There's no leakage. After reading other reviews, I bought these over the organic cotton soaker pads because they stay drier against the skin and don't take as long in the dryer. We currently have the hook and loop (velcro) diaper covers and they fit very comfortably on our 6mo, 18lb daughter; she's been wearing them since she sized out of her newborn fitteds, around 12lbs. There's no leakage from the gussets and there's no elastic imprints on the skin on her back (my only criticism of her Rumparooz covers). Happy to answer any questions about how these stack up against other systems.
