I wasn't really sure what these were going to be like but once I received them I was pleased to see they look exactly like the sides of my son's pack and play.  I was very hesitant purchasing gates that have bars because he is attracted to anything that he can grab or looks like his crib (He is 8 months).  Since this looks like his pack and play, he really has no interest playing with the gates.  They are very neutral and you can easily remove them if you are having people over and want to tone down the kid-ness in your house.  I think these would be perfect for anyone who has pets and the mesh removes and is washable.  If you are looking for something in a high traffic area, this gate may not be the best.  I am 5'2 and it is very difficult to step over the gate and I definitely would not feel comfortable stepping over the gate holding my child.  I just remove the gates when we are done playing rather than step over them with my son.  The gates set-up like a shower curtain rod, so if you are renting or don't want marks in your wall, you will also like the fact these remove easily.  Definitely measure your doors prior to ordering.  These are for a larger door frame and would work great in larger spaces and hallways.  The instructions from Evenflo say 38 inches (97 cm) to 60 inches (152 cm).
