Very satisfied with this bedding set. Originally bought a 4 piece set at target for $69 but after seeing this online, I returned the other and ordered this. I was skeptical about the reviews but after receiving at setting it up, I couldn't be happier with it. It didn't come with a mobile which was a downer for me but definitely wasn't anything I couldn't find on Amazon elsewhere. Definitely worth the $10 extra and you get the entire set plus the diaper bag set. Happy customer here.
