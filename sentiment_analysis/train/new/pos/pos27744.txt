I am in love w/ these dividers. They definitely make our nursery for our little girl look even more classic. The labels are stickers as well which can be changed at any time and you can definitely use these for years to come. It changed the closet as soon as we put them in. We were able to find out what more we needed for her and what we didnt need.We love them. My bf definitely thought they were just so cute and no one else would have them. I agree. Definitely cute and just original.
