My cat loves to rub her face on our power plugs and unplugs them in the process sometimes. We have a chest freezer and after I came home to find the plug out and freezer off , I realized I had to buy this asap! This installed in seconds and fit over the large plug. Now I never have to worry about it being unplugged. I now want to buy these for all of my outlets but I'll look for smaller ones. For regular plugs I don't need a large cover like this one. This will work amazing to safe guard outlets from kids and animals in my case.
