Got this for my daughters carseat just before a long trip. She lived it! I was skeptical on whether on whether it would stay in place when she pulled on things, but it worked well. The side attachments were adjusted and you could stick them on the side of the carseat. They twist opened and then you tighten them shut. One side detatches from the screw part so you can swing it open and out of the way to get baby out. The mirror is attached by velcro straps to you can adjusted the direction or remove it completely. It would be a little tall for a newborn to about 3 or 4 months, depending on babies size, but babies mostly look at those ages.I definitely prefer this over all the separate toys you can put on the handle. It comes off easily, so I just remove the arch and leave the short part on the car seat. It has a monkey woth some rings on it.
