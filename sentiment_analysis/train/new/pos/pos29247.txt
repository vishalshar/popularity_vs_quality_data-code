Positive:Spider man graphics are bright and big. My kid loves his bedding.  It was good purchase, worth the money, I would buy it again.  Washing washable and dry-able – important with kids.Negative: pillow case is a little slippery and comes of the pillow sometimes.  Comforter is very thin, it works for us because we keep heat at 69-70 even at night.  Size of the comforter is not wide enough to tuck under the mattress securely.  I turn comforter sideways and tuck it that way – my kids are still short enough that they are covered all the way.All in all, good for a 3 year old.
