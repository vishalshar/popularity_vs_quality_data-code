Bed fits perfect in our Kalani Crib. Tight, but good fit. The original mattress we got had major gaps on all sides. It is super super firm on the infant side, and firm, but soft on the toddler side. Our son loves sleeping on it (or so it seems to us) - The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the toddler side says it is water proof material, but it still seems to absorb the uh oh our son had. Overall though it is a good buy.
