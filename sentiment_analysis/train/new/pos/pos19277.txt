If you have more than one child you do not have the time to clean a difficult-to-clean highchair. Been there and done that it was misery when I only had one child. With more than one child now I need a chair that is:1. Easy to keep clean (easy means wipes off quickly and there are no cracks, crevices, holes for food and drink to get into and mold away)2. Sturdy and strong3. Attractive4. Easy to assemble from the boxThis highchair meets all of those requirements and I highly recommend it.
