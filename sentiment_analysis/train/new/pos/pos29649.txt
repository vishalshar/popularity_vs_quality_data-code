When we decided to get a baby gate to prevent our chihuahuas from tormenting our new cats when we aren't home, I methodically researched every baby gate on the market before making a decision.  The First Year's Baby Gate seemed to have the features we needed at a fair price, so I bought one.  As you can see in the video, putting it together was fairly easy and it seems to be of very good quality.  We've been using it on our bedroom door for about six months and though it gets a lot of basic use (we don't have any toddlers swinging on it,) it is holding up just fine.In the video I tried to cover the basics of assembly, installation and use, as well as addressing some of the common concerns like the height of the threshold and whether a child or dog can open it.  Though it doesn't have some of the bells and whistles that the more expensive units have, like an auto-closing feature, it is solidly made, opens and closes smoothly and stays closed when its supposed to.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.I hope this helps,ClairePS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful.
