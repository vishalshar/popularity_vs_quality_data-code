I received this monkey blanket in my diaper cake when my first son was born. When my boy was about a year old we decided to take the paci away and used this security blanket to help ease him. He took to it like a charm! It is cute and very durable. Now that he is teething he carries it all over the house or comfort and we even purchased a "back up monkey" just in case. Another reviewer mentioned that you can't wash it. Regardless of what the tags say you can most definitely wash this little guy without it falling apart. Monkey has been washed over a dozen times and is still holding up nicely. My boy loves this little guy and once he casts it aside as he grows older I will be sure to turn it into an ornament.
