My daughter really enjoys playing with this book. She is almost a year old, so I'm sure she will like it even more as she continues to learn words and point things out. :) I don't really recommend this for younger children as they will probably try to chew on it. Also, the points of the triangles in the middle are fairly sharp for babies.
