This car seat is among the lightest if not the lightest and most narrow on the market.  It fits easily into an economy size seat and my 2 year old thinks it is comfortable enough.  It does not have a lot of cushioning or a great deal of head support but is a good extra seat to have for travel.My only complaint is that the seat is sold by resellers such as Connect Buy who order the product to directly ship to you from WalMart.com.  They even include the invoice with the much cheaper price on the invoice.  Amazon customer service is superb.  Connect Buy is among the worst I have even encountered.  Amazon should end their relationship with this company.
