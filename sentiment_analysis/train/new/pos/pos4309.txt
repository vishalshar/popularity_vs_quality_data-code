This stroller is more of a showpiece.  It is really cool.  I loved the pedometer, and of course the automatic folding. The lights just set it off.  You will get lots of double takes and questions.  I had to take one star away because this baby is HEAVY.  I love that they put a lot into the safety features so you dont have to worry about it closing up with your tiny human in it.  Oh, and hello...it charges as you use it.  THAT IS RAD!!!
