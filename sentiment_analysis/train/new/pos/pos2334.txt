I LOVE IT -- the perfect combination of lightweight + recliningit is light -- easy to fold and open -- the one hand open and close option works very well (after you 'figure it out').  very durable -- we have taken it on 5-6 trips -- it has been (man)-handled by the baggage handlers at many different airports (in the US and in a few South American countries)the reclining is more than enough to get my baby to sleep comfortably --- the hood is a little small (especially when the seat is reclined), so we used a jacket or blanked to provide additional shade while she was sleeping.it is easy to maneuver in small spaces and on all sorts of surfacesfits easily in a regular sedan trunk
