Great product.  Our baby needed had a hard time sleeping on his back at first so this bed was a life saver.  He still doesn't really like sleeping on his back, but he'll stay there for hours at a time now.I like the height of the side walls and the fact they are mesh.  The walls help to create a nice pocket for the baby to nest and the straps are definitely necessary so he doesn't slide to the bottom of the bed. The back is also very soft and provides a good amount of support and contributes to the nice pocket.The base is super sturdy and rock solid.  No issues with it ever being unstable.  I have no idea what the people are talking about regarding the bed not folding up.  There have been many reviews that say it's impossible or they could never figure it out,  but we don't have any issues at all and constantly fold it up to put it away when not in use.Our baby is about 3 months old now and is almost outgrowing it, but I guess every baby is different.* Just a heads up......We had a hard time finding this product in stock.  It was ordered twice through various sellers and each one said it was back ordered with no estimated delivery date.  We eventually bought it straight from amazon.
