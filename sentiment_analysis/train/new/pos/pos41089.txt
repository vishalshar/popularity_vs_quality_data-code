I absolutely love the zee.  I am a bit of a stroller junkie and have owned many different popular strollers (bugaboo cameleon, city mini, bob revolution, quinny zapp, maclaren quest & volo, cybex onyx, mountain buggy duet) the past 5 years.  This is one of my very favorite.  The push is amazing and goes over all different terrains with ease. It folds very easily and I  carry it like a baby carrier in the crook if my arm with my baby in the other arm to go up and down stairs no problem. It also has a very small footprint in the trunk of my car.  The recline, sun coverage and storage basket are all stellar in my opinion.  The basket is super easy to access when the seat is upright and though more difficult to get to with the seat reclined it is still accessible which is a big problem with other strollers I have owned.  I really don't have any complaints, and i'm pretty picky about strollers, I have been very happy with this stroller.
