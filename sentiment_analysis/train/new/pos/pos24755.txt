We purchased this toy last Christmas for our son who was 19 months old at the time.  It has taken him a little while to warm up to it (at first he wasn't too interested) but now it's one of his go-to toys and is almost always a tripping hazard somewhere on the kitchen floor.He likes the clacking crocodile mouth as he pulls (more like slings) it around the house, and the wheel base is wide enough so that it actually stays on all four wheels.  So far it's a little beaten up but no chipping or peeling paint nor any rough spots in the wood. I like that the mallet is attached (and neatly stores in croc's mouth) so it doesn't get lost, but as others have said the string is a little short so using it to play on the xylophone is awkward at best.  However, I would assume a longer string would be a safety risk.Before purchasing this toy, I read dozens of reviews on various toy xylophones that complained of poor intonation driving musically-inclined parents crazy.  My husband and I have four degrees in classical music between us so I was concerned about being annoyed by anything we purchased, but honestly this toy is really not that bad.  I will say that the "fa" note (the green key) is WAAAY sharp.  We're kind of used to it now.  Yes, it's a little grating on the ears, but it's no more grating than any of the other noisemaker toys scattered around the house.  In fact it's way less annoying than some of the songs on his light-up singing toys. I think if we were expecting perfection we would expect a much bigger price tag. But for just $25, it's an excellent value and a great introduction to making music.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a durable first xylophone.
