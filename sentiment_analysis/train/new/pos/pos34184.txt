I was excited to find this hamper on Amazon because it completes the Baby Bear collection I am using for the nursery.  It's very cute and roomy, and the mesh bag inside is convenient for carrying dirty clothes to the laundry room.  The color was slightly different than what was pictured (I was expecting sage green, but it's really more of a mint green), but other than that I am happy with this purchase.
