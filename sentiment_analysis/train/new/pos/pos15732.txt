I initially thought that purchasing a shopping cart cover was absurd, but quickly changed my mind when my son started sitting up and was riding in carts and then gnawing on the handles - YUCK!  So I decided I wanted to get one, but I didn't want something bulky and ran into someone who had one of these and I liked it.  [This product comes in two pieces - the seat and the shopping cart handle cover]What I really like is that you can use this product to strap a child into a chair, cart or high chair, and not have to use the disgusting straps that are full of goo from other yucky things, and that the product isn't too bulky.  The sad part is that what I initially purchased the product for (covering the shopping cart handle) didn't work so well because my son figured out how to easily get the velcro undone - didn't take a genius - and it didn't fit all carts (especially new ones).  There is also no way to protect the edges of a restaurant high chair. and those are particularly gross.Anyway, It does come in great handy when carts and high chairs don't have straps to use, but if  keeping the gross out of reach is your goal, this probably isn't the right product for you.And I have used this with a normal chair, and it works okay - but I have a very squiggly little boy and he would consistently slide down and not look so comfortable.
