I just got these yesterday and immediately put them on. I am almost 49 and have always had severely inverted nipples. I could not breast feed either one of my kids. FYI I am not pregnant so doing this for myself.  I have never seen my actual nipples until yesterday ( I saw half of it after attaching). They do hurt/pinch when you first put the niplettes on but within 5 minutes you forget all about them.  I also purchased Medela Softcups (they aren't soft really) but they keep the nipplette in place and I can wear them under my bra so that you don't just see a point from the niplettes. I plan to wear the softcups all the time even after taking the niplettes off for the day until I achieve my goal. I am hoping these work to bring my nipples out.UPDATE:  This is day 6. Still a little painful but more like a pinch kind of pain. Right one is staying out for about 3 hours now after I take these off. Left one only stays out 15 minutes. I leave the Medela Softcups on after I take the Niplettes off. I wear the Niplettes for about 8-10 hours a day.  So far so good.UPDATE:  Day 8 today and doing pretty good. Took off niplettes yesterday and both nipples stayed out for over 6 hours.
