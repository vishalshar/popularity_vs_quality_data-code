I care for my grandson one day a week and so he needs to have a bottle during that time.  These bottles cause less gas for him than other bottles I have tried.  I have had no problem cleaning them but I am pretty vigilant about washing them out right away after use.  They come with a little brush for the narrow areas and I use a regular bottle brush for the bottle itself.
