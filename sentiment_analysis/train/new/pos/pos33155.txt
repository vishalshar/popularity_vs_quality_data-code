I was surprised by how small it actually is, however the product works well. I think the directions need to be more detailed, and come with more specific water amounts to add for the fruits/veggies. The blade is very sharp and works well, I am pleased with the overall performance of the product. I have sucessfully made several meals with the machine. Compared to the significant price break vs. the competitor version of this (which my friend has) I feel I can do all the things with my machine and feel like I got a good value. I am enjoying this product.
