Yes, I confess it's a little difficult to open.  Not that difficult- it just requires two hands which is kind of a bummer when you're holding a baby.  HOWEVER, this item has a major perk.  The loops stretch out pretty wide- wide enough to lock a closet with french style doors.  Show me another cabinet lock big enough to handle that.  Plus, unless your child is truly determined, you can loosen it just enough that you can slip a loop over one of the knobs one handed.  So, it works for me in places where no other cabinet locks will get it done.
