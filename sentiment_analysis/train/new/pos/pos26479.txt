We got this to keep diaper supplies in so my husband could stay in the living room with the baby without having to move to the bedroom to change his diaper. It holds about 12 newborn diapers and a container of wipes in the main compartment without any trouble. The pockets around the outside are the right size to hold hand sanitizer, diaper cream, and other small or medium size bottles and containers. I do wish that there was a longer pocket along one of the long sides for holding a hanging mat or extra clothes, but it works fine without that. It's a sturdy little bag that can hold a decent amount of weight.
