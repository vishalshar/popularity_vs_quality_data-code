My mom purchased this for me for my new baby.  This is my 5th child so I have owned quite a few diaper bags.  The best thing about this diaper bag is that it is cute and stylish.  It's a good size but you cannot really stuff the bag too full because then it will not close.  I cloth diaper so of course my bag is always stuffed - I've had to just really pack it in a certain way... and have a plain old canvas bag of extra diapers and other items tucked in my vehicle for "back up".  It is not small, though - it is a very nice size - bigger than a purse.  I love that it has the two side pockets - that is a must for any diaper bag I carry!  The changing pad it came with was such a generous size - a big plus.  I could not tell from pictures what this bag was made out of - it seemed to look like it was made of a fake leather or something but alas it is not quite that "fancy".  It is merely a white material that may be wiped clean but is not plastic so it could potentially stain.  I could be wrong but I think maybe it's vinyl?  (Not cloth).  The strap is adjustable but not too comfy - no padding - so you don't want to have it on your shoulder too long.  The bag itself is not too heavy (hmmm - maybe glad now it is not made of fake leather material) but once you fill it with baby stuff of course it gets heavy and a padded strap would be nice but at least it is thick.  All in all it's not the most functional bag I've owned but I wanted it for looks and it is a beauty and does function well enough.  It is not going to look like a purse - it will still look like a "bag" because of it's nice large size, just so you know ;)
