I love love love this canopy. I purchased the aqua drops and its just perfect for my 2 month old son.  I really wished I knew about this product 3 years ago for I would have gotten one for my daughter.  No more using blankets and fighting it in the wind and rain ( I live in san francisco) .  My son can now fall asleep and stay asleep with this canopy. The took off 1 star because it just kinda slumps down near the center part of the seat.  Otherwise...I love it and my son loves it.
