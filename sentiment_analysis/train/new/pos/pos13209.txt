My almost 3 year old son has randomly decided that having his hair washed in the bath is absolutely torture. You would think I'm pouring acid on his head the way he freaks out when water gets near or in his eyes. I started looking around for something that I could use to rinse his hair that would prevent water getting in his eyes when I came across this bath rinser. All the good reviews had me hoping that I found a solution. It's quite larger and holds plenty of water. My son likes to use it as a toy too. It can be hung up or it can sit on the side of the tub. The rubber yellow part that presses against his head is soft and I'm not worried that I'll hurt him when I use it. It took me a few tries to get it down but I did figure it out. Just fill it, press it against your child's head and pour as you move towards the back of the head. It's easier for me if he looks up while I do it and it took him a few times to trust me that I wouldn't pour water in his eyes. He still gets a little tense when I say it's time to rinse his hair but he no longer flips his lid so for that, I give this two thumbs up and 5 stars.
