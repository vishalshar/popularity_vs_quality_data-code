I had been trying to find a sleep sack for a while, and had only seen the Halo brand until this one.  And I'm so glad I waited and got this brand - the outside is this lovely fuzzy velour material, and the inside is super-satiny.  Our baby girl loves to kick her bare feet in it!  We got the medium for her even though she's just 15 pounds now - but it works for her.  It also has a mesh vent at the bottom so that the baby doesn't get overheated.  And the zipper zips up from the bottom - great for middle-of-the-night diaper changes.
