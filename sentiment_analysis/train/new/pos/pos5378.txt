They are exactly what I was looking for. Being a plus size mother to be it is easier to stick the buds to my belly, and not try to make headphones fit. Baby actually moves around when she hears a song that I sing. I'm excited to see if she will react to the same music after she is born. I am not sure what to do with the buds after baby is born, but they work for now.
