Our 13 month old refused to drink milk from anything other than her bottle, until we tried this cup.  She immediately took milk in it and never needed another bottle again.  In addition to taking milk from this cup, she also easily transitioned to drinking it from our other cups that she had previously refused it in as well.  Amazing!
