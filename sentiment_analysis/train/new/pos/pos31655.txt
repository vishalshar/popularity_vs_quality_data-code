This thing is one of my favorite baby purchases!  It fits over our Chicco Keyfit 30 car seat really well.  It's great for when it is cold and its great for when you just need to cover baby from the sun's glare.  It is so much better than trying to wrangle a baby blanket over her car seat.  The bottom has elastic that grips the car seat really nicely so it doesn't keep falling off.  The strap can go over the hood if you need to cover the baby completely when she is sleeping or if its very cold out and you just need to transport baby from the door to the car.  I sewed a piece of fabric over the nylon strap as it was a little rough on my skin when used as a carrier cover so now it is great for that as well.  I don't need to bundle up baby before going out, I just throw this thing on both of us and were good to go!  And it is easy to take off too when were back indoors so baby doesn't overheat. Cannot recommend enough!
