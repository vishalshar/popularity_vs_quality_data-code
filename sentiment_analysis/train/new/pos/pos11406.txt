I bought this stool because my 2 year old daugher's new twin bed is pretty high off the ground, and this stool is high enough (just under 13") for her to climb on the bed by herself.  It was fairly easy and quick to assemble (even with two little ones standing over me trying to grab the screws away).  It's very sturdy and solid so I don't worry about it tipping at all, and I think it looks really cute in my daughter's room.  Like some other reviewers, I didn't bother with the hinge on the storage area since it seemed kind of useless.  My only other complaint is that the lid doesn't line up completely flush with the sides of the stool, but it's not too bad.  Overall, I really like it, and my daughter loves her new independence.
