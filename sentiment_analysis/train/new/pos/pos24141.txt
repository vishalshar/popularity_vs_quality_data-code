I ordered the Knee Cap for my 6 month old son. It was nice and comfortable for him and it helped him crawl freely. Because of them he never had scratches on his knees while crawling and they also worked like a cushion when he used to stroke his knees against the floor. The Knee cap was suggested to me by a friend who's daughter has developed dead skin (dirty knees) as she used to crawl without the knee caps, but thankfully after using these knee caps my son never had any issues. They are comfortable in Summers and Winters too. We still use them as warmers to keep his legs warm in the snow. I would recommend the product for kids especially when they start crawling.
