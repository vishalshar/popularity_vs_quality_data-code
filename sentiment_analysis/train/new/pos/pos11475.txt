My mom dropped off a beautiful wooden cradle which I will be using next month, but the 1" pad was torn and old.  It also didn't seem to offer much in the way of support or comfort.  I was afraid the 2" mattress would be too soft and allow the babies face to sink into the mattress causing possible suffocation.  It exceeded my expectations because it is very firm, so a newborn cannot sink into it, yet it offers more comfort and warmth from the wooden bottom of the cradle than that flimsy 1" pad. It fits in the cradle perfectly. Just make sure you measure your cradle. I'm extremely happy that I won't have to worry about her sleeping on it. Thank you very much.
