This is a fun taggies toy!I have a 1yr old who loves tags and balls so this was a perfect toy for her. It is very soft, but contains several textures(all soft/velour), it has many tags, and makes noise! What could be better?!?!?!?!?The ball was much larger than I expected(which was a good thing), I was expecting baseball/softball size, but this is much larger(I know, I shouldve read, but somehow it doesn't seem the same until you see/feel it). This ball is just smaller than a playground ball. This makes it perfect to roll back and forth with your child(ren). I have 3 girls(3, 2, 1) and we all sit on the floor and roll this between us, they giggle and have a blast...until the 1yr old ends the game when she picks up to snuggle with the ball and play with the tags ;-)It appears well constructed with good solid construction(like all taggies toys).I will update if anything changes upon washing/use.
