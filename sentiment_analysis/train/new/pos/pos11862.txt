I'm a nanny and bought it for one of my little ones. It seemed to work fine, no leaks and as for rhe consumer that mentioned mold in the bottom...use a bottle brush to clean it.I would have given it 5 stars, but I have several issues with it. The holes in the nipple is quite small and when you order I don't think it tells you what type of flow it has. But on the packaging it does. Also, you have to push the bottom up with your finger. Sort of defeats the purpose if you still have to help the child eat.My kids are 23 and 27 and it isn't at all like the ones I used for them.But it got the job done.
