Features I love:reclining back (though I don't really like the mechanism, I love the fact that I can recline the back...my 7 month old likes to take his bottle laying back a bit, but prefers to be sitting upright when being spoon-fed baby food)material pattern (great for boy or girl)bottom storage rack (great for bibs and washcloths for those messy mealtimes)leg stability and raise/lower capability (sturdy and stable - I even hang some bags on the side that I use to store toys that my son uses while I'm getting his food ready)Food trays (love that there's a big one that is great for playing and self-feeding and easily removes and a small permanent one under it that I prefer when I'm feeding him b/c it let's me get closer)Things I don't like:wheels (back one's swivle which is great, but front go only straight which makes it hard to rotate chair around...it scratches our wood floor if I don't lift up the front wheels when I'm moving it b/c they drag)seat cover clips (they keep coming unsnapped when I recline the back - it's not a huge deal, but annoying that the fabric keeps getting loose on the sides b/c the fastener mechanism pops off)mechanism for reclining back (I don't really like the mechanism that reclines it b/c it's a little hard to do with one hand and doesn't easily lock into place...there's 2-3 holes for degree of recline on each side - they don't always line up when you recline it at first)Overall, I'm very pleased with this high chair and felt is was the best quality for the money. I wish it had come with an extra cover - I'll probably look into getting one now so that I'll have it if we have a second baby.
