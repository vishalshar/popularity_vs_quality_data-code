Product came on time and as described.  I like that it has a microfiber liner which makes it easier to clean and feels softer on my LO's bottom.  There is an elastic adjuster on each leg and one on the waist to make the fit as snug as possible.  The craftsmanship is good quality.  The fuzzibunz are one of my favorites to use.  I gave it 4 stars because the back part to place the insert is overly large and has the insert sticking out which isn't too big of a deal.
