I love this mat! It fits perfectly in both of our pack n plays and the softness is just right. It has enough give to be comfortable and not flatten my baby's head, and it's not too soft to be dangerous. Just be careful not to shrink the cover! I machine washed and then let it mostly air dry and just fluffed it up in the dryer on low for a few minutes. It took a little bit of effort to get the foam back in but it looks the same as it did before I washed it. The Mamadoo Everlasting sheet that I purchased to go with it, however, was not so great. It was too large even after washing and drying it, and had a hole in the corner where it had been(poorly) stitched. I bought this sheet instead:https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00VKXGZS2/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1It fits the mattress topper perfectly, it's soft, waterproof, hypoallergenic, and won't shrink. I highly recommend this combo!
