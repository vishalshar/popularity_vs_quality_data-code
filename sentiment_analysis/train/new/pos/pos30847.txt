I got this for my Uppababy Cruz so that I could lay it in the flat position to mimic a bassinet.  Somehow I thought it would create a flat surface for her entire body, but it doesn't! Her legs are still bent in the sitting position, though her back is flat.I still like it, even now that she is 9 months old! I've just taken off the head cushion/frame about a month ago and keep the rest in as a soft stroller liner. Eventually I will take the wedge out too, but for now she's quite comfy as is (she's below average in her weight).I'll try to upload some pics so you can see what I mean about it not being a complete flat surface!
