I chose to go with these wipes primarily because I appreciated the recatangular shape which makes them so easy to just lay in a wipe box instead of trying to fold. The colors are also great! I have been 100% happy with them. They are big and thick and get the job done. I typically only have to use one, maybe two on a big poop. I was using 3-4 disposables so that is a big improvement. I put them in a disposable wipe box and pour water mixed with a squirt of baby wash on top and they are good to go. I used to use the thin cheap cotton wipes or baby wash cloths and they would always bunch up in my hand as I wiped because they were so thin and flimsy. I love that these are heavier and don't do that. They probably are a little too heavy duty for a newborn but otherwise they are awesome. A little pricey but they'll have themselves paid off in a few months of no disposable wipes.
