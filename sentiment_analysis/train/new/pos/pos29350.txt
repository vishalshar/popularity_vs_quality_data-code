Because im a prime member i got two day shipping for free and USPS delivers on sundays and the guy told me they only deliver amazon products on sundays. Very interesting! My son is 17 months and we were down to one pacifier. Dont worry people he rarely uses them only during fussy car rides and sometimes during naps and nightys. But these are his favorite pacifiers and we are weaning him off but the faces and colors are great. Havent found these exact ones (not the brand,but the color and style) anywhere else and i saved about 2 dollars from where i normally buy them. These are amazing pacifiers, my sons face is chubby and it fits his face well without digging into his chunky cheecks. They have all sizes and deff recomend for ur little and buying these ones from amazon and becoming a prime member if ur not already. We love them thank u for quick free delivery and the new style and colored pacifiers! Came perfectly package completely sealed!
