My son loved Sophie to an unreasonable extent so I have been buying this toy as a gift for any baby showers I attend.  Two of my cousins were having babies (due the same day) so I went ahead and bought the double pack.  I was disappointed that both toys were shoved into one single package.  I hoped they would each have their own box.  I ended up using one of the toys as a decoration on the top of the wrapped gift, so that worked out fine, but I wanted to warn anybody else who was wondering the same thing.
