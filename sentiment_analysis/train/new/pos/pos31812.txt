Elecare is the only formula my baby can take but it is expensive so i found it cheapest here at amazon and found out i could get reimbursed from my ins so i contacted amazon who was more than helpful in getting me in contact with the wholesaler who has also been amazing cant say enough good things about amazon, the wholesaler, and elecare. Happy mom and happy baby o and daddy now has happy wallet lol
