Overall I am very happy with this cup so far. A couple quirks would be that the nipple part is a little harder than most. But since my kid is 6 months old and gnawing on everything he touches that's probably a good thing. Also it comes with a tiny plastic stopper to put in between the lid/nipple and the actual cup for when you take it places so the liquid doesn't spill out. This stopper does not screw or snap into place at all and I know I am going to eventually lose it. But considering it was one of the cheaper soppy cups I found and it got here before any of my other purchases I am very happy with the product.
