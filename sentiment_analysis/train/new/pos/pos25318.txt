My 3 1/2 year old was close to the end of her crib mattress and my almost 2 year old was ready to move up to take her toddler bed. I didn't want to compromise on quality to save money but I also didn't want to break the bank. Her crib mattress was rock hard and she never slept well in it. My son hasn't loved it either. When I moved her to her toddler bed, I got her an organic latex crib mattress and she slept through the night first time!I read reviews of another popular organic twin mattress being very hard. I decided to take a chance on this mattress despite the lack of reviews (I'm a review hound), although I did other research online and have heard amazing things about the nook pebble crib mattress. Nook is a great company and I trusted their materials would be safe for my child.I received the mattress immediately and it was packaged very carefully. The mattress was vacuum sealed in plastic, then rolled up in a nice burlap-like bag that zipped up and can be re-used. Upon opening the plastic, the mattress began to inflate and I really didn't notice any chemical smell! There was a slight natural scent (I have a sensitive nose to toxins, but it didn't smell chemical) but I let it air out anyway. There was no smell 24 hours later.The organic cotton pebble cover zips off and is very soft. The mattress is very comfortable but not too soft. It's still firm enough to support my little girl without being a board. If they made a king size mattress, I'd be interested!My daughter loves her bed and I've asked her several times if it's comfortable, which she always says it is.I'm super happy with the price, the delivery, and the product. I would definitely recommend this mattress to other Mommies.
