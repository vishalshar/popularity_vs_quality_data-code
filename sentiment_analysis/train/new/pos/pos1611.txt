My wife and I love to go running together but we live in a very windy area and in the summer it often rains. We bought this to ensure our daughters were comfortable even if the weather changed unexpectedly. We have only had to use it a few times but it worked as described. It easily folds up and stores under the stroller and when needed is relatively easy to put on.
