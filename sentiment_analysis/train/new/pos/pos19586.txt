Our little girl absolutely LOVES this seat.  When she was newborn, it wasn't useful but now that she is getting a bit older (2 months old) she is really growing into it.The folding and storage is unparalleled as the seat folds neatly flat so we can store it right in the living room easily out of sight.  It is a bit difficult to switch from the folded position to or between any of the three seating positions and usually requires two hands.We can place our daughter in the seat and very easily bounce her with one foot resting against the bottom fabric.  Of course, she can bounce herself too but as this is one of her favorite napping spots at the moment she isn't inclined to put forth the effort to move!I know the price looks steep on this one, but we've found it to be a simple design that just works.  The high price is what holds back the fifth star.
