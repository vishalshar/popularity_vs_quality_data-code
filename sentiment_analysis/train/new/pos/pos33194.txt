Bag is a little smaller than I expected but baby Loves it.Not only can this be set on the floor for tummy time and tied to the crib rail But we used the Bright Starts Links to hang it over the car headrest.  Definitely a cheaper alternative to the $30+ musical car mirror.  Music is a bit on the 'quiet' side much quieter than most mobiles.  Handle is easy for 3 1/2 month old baby to grasp for restarting the lights & music.  Giraffe rattles and apparently 'tastes good.'PROS:  Stable when sitting on the floor  Can be hung around vehicle headrest for car use (need baby links or similar)  Can carry several small baby toys inside the bar.  Easy to operate handle for starting/restarting lights & musicCONS:  Music is quieter than most baby mobiles, etc.
