we purchased this compact swing for the grandparent's condo. it's small, and works great. my son loves it too. please note, you can't use energizer batteries (which i typically purchase) for some reason - if you use them you'll think the swing is broken, but it's not, just use Duracell batteries (that's what they told us when we called with the issue)overall great swing!
