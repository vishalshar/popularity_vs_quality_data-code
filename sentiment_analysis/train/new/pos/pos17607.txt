I was looking for a portable high chair for my daughter when Stokke brought the HandySitt from Minui.  I decided to go with the HandySitt after looking through some other options.  I love this portable high chair because I am not a big fan of plastic.  I also like the fact that you can get a floor leg for this chair so it becomes a toddler chair.  You need to do up the bottom strap as tight as possible in order to ensure a secure fit.  Setting up the two handles to the proper height, of course, is very important too.  My husband and I always test the chair by wiggling it before putting the baby on, and it is always nice and secure when the chair is set up properly even though my daughter is a very wiggly baby.  Parent supervision is important too, of course, and that goes for any portable high chairs.  I give this product four instead of five stars because it can only fit on chairs with a back no higher than 17" (we have been to a few restaurants where the HandySitt won't fit because their chairs have higher backs); however, the two handles give extra support to the chair so that's good.  I've actually been to a restaurant where they use HandySitt as their booster chair, it was a nice surprise!
