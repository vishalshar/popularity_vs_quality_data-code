We have been using this audio monitor for about a week with our 15 month old.  We replaced an older analog model that was driving us crazy with the static noise.  This works great and is super quiet!  It has multiple volume settings so you can turn it down at night when you don't want to wake up at every little shuffle in his crib and then turn it up for use when he is napping and I am working around the house etc.. Linking the base to the monitor was very easy and we have not had a problem with it "unlinking".  Battery life is long enough for our purposes and recharges overnight when we have it plugged in.  We also keep it plugged in when not in use.  Great product at a great price!
