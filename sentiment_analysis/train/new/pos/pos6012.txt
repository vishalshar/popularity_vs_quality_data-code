We bought this for my daughter for Christmas and I love it! It is the most adorable wooden puzzle we've seen. It is very well made, great quality and I love the colors. My daughter just turned one and she loves it. She hasn't quite figured out how to put the birdies back into their place but she'll sit and play with this for the longest time. Great product! I'd recommend to friends & family.
