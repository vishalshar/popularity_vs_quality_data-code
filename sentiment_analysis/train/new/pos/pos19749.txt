I bought one of these in ecru which matched my plaid print infant travel system perfectly. The two sizes were a wonderful option as my newborn had a very small head and his head would have been flopping around without the additional headrest. As he grew and gained more control of his head I removed the interior headrest and continued using the large (outer) headrest which he has recently outgrown. He had developed perfect head and neck control/strength well before he outgrew it.I recommend this to all moms and dads to be. Buy it, use it, you will not regret it. It is well made, launders perfectly, and it is super soft. This mommy of 3 LOVES it. The best out there!People who say they are unsafe: I'm sorry but the amount of padding behind your baby with this item in place is no thicker than a baby's sweatshirt which puts the "padding compression theory" during a car accident to rest. You would never pick up your newborn without supporting it's head. Your Doctor tells you that you need to support their head until they develop sufficient head control and the strength in their neck muscles to hold their head up without fatigue. Why would you not follow through with Doctor recommended advice when transporting your child in a motorvehicle?For parents-to-be who are still unsure about using one of these in their car seat, I would ask your Pediatrician for their opinion on the matter. They have the knowledge and training to give you an answer that you can feel confident is safe for your baby.
