Best ever!!! saved me from cleaning the floor every time my kid eats! I use it with Tommee Tippe plate and it stays put. She likes to pick up her tray or  her bowls and dumps it out or swings it around. With this, it hold it down tight and she can't pick it up! I went from on my knee scrubbing all day to just sweep up little mess here and there! I think all mom can relate to this one
