This is a very good stroller. It is safe and very comfortable for our 35 lbs. toddler to ride in and nap on the go. It has a large storage basket (great for shopping or you can just put anything there!) That storage basket, after reviewing all pros and cons, was actually the deciding factor in our purchase - surprisingly, it is not that easy to find a good stroller that also has a nice big storage. I also like the fact that the stroller has good trays - for the baby and for the partners (again, not all good strollers come equipped with those). The stroller is light, and I we haven't had any problems with folding. Oh, and the price is great.The only drawbacks, however small, are: 1. It could be a little more maneuverable; you really have to use both hands at all times, and sometimes the stroller even seems to veer to one side when pushed with one hand, although that could be just the uneven surface. 2. The shade is not big enough to provide sufficient sun protection, so you need to put on an additional sun shade on sunny days 3. It doesn't fold flat, it's still a little bulky when folded and sometimes doesn't want to stay upright after being folded and left in the hallway.These cons are no big deals for us - the pros far outweigh them - so overall it is a very good buy and a great value!
