We were looking for a family ornament for our first Christmas with our baby and ordered this ornament.  We ordered this on sale right after Thanksgiving. It arrived quickly and was in great shape when it got here. It is very cute, but for the amount we paid for it it's pretty small and seems not the highest quality. I love it though, and it looks great on our tree.  If you don't mind a little splurge on a plastic ornament, then this is worth it, but it's certainly not an heirloom.
