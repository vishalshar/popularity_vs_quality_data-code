Wish it would have come as a standard accessory, but Amazon did a great job with cutting the cost. It costs close to double what is offered on Amazon plus you will pay just as much as the item to ship from the company = $30! Thank you, Amazon, for offering this item on your site for the discounted price!I checked on Britax's website and it confirmed that this model would fit my 2012 CS 70 Advocate. Amazon's description confirmed the same, so I was confident in buying it. It does fit. On their website it says it does not fit models prior to 2010. I am happy with my purchase. My daughter is 3-1/2 years young and can reach her cup fine while strapped. I will post picture(s).
