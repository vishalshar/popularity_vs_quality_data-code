AMAZING!I was determined to breastfeed my little girl, and had a lot of trouble in the beginning. My milk did not come in soon enough for her, and she had trouble latching, also she was a month early so when her weight dropped my husband I fed her with a Medela bottle of my pumped breastmilk for the first 4 weeks. I decided to give her a go on the breast once more and she finally took to it. I began EBF'ing her, my husband went back to work and we fell out of practice of giving her a bottle.3 months rolled around and Grandma tried giving her a bottle and she WOULD NOT take it. I was at a loss! I really wanted her to be able to switch between my breast and a bottle so Grammy/Grampy and Hubby could feed her. Also so hubby and I could have a date night eventually and not worry about her not eating.I tried Medela bottles that come with my breast pump system (nope!), Dr. Browns (nope!), MAM (nope!), stupid "breast-like" COMOTOMO (nope!). Finally I was reading a forum about other people having my same issues and someone mentioned using the "old school" latex nipples. I bought these, got them today, expressed some milk and gave her 2 oz in a bottle...... she took it! And without any hesitation, just right into the mouth, and sucked away all the milk.Some reviews have said they have a weird smell, well mine smelt like latex (to be expected), and some said theirs were slimy (not mine). I boiled them for 5 minutes and will hand wash each one between feedings. True these can only be used for about 2 months, but it is worth it!! Especially with the very cheap price.If you are having trouble getting your EBF baby to take a bottle at least give these a try!
