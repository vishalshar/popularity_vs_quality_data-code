I purchased two of these to keep my one year old cool in her stroller on a recent vacation. This was a complete lifesaver for her! I debated buying a more expensive "sturdier" looking fan but I'm so glad I went with this affordable option as it was just what we needed.Pros:- Such a good value! Can't beat the price.- Circulates a lot of cool air to keep you cool even in very hot heat. We had my daughter in a stroller on our vacation for long periods of time in very hot heat and this kept her very cool and comfortable.- The foam blades are completely safe. I was somewhat concerned that if my one year old touched the blades it would hurt, but that is definitely not the case. The are very soft and she often would stick her little finger on the blades to hear the sound it made without any issues.- The bendable neck and large clip made it super easy to clip just about anywhere on my daughter's stroller and point the fan towards her.- The battery life is better than I thought it would be. We would use this non-stop for several hours before we had to change the batteries.Cons:- You have to be careful with the foam blades as they can easily rip or bend. We put this in a backpack at one point on the trip and one of the blades ripped which greatly reduced the airflow.- You need a small screwdriver to access the batteries. This was a bit of a pain because we did have to change the batteries while we were out and about but had to carry around a screwdriver with us to make sure we could get to them.
