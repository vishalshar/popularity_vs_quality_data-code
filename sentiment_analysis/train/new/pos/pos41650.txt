These are the best little forks for little hands. My son loves eating with them and they are so easy for him to use. We love the fun colors and the large handles. Three come in a pack and that's really all we need. The forks are a great value and I'd buy them again. The photos show the size of the fork and the size in comparison to a standard dinner fork.
