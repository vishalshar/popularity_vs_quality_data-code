I send my 1 year old to daycare with this wonderful food tray.  As some other reviews state, it is not leak-proof, but with dry food he stays cleaner anyway.  I'll fill the tray up with avocado, olives, pickles, tomatoes, frozen peas, canned beans, cheese, cheerios, fruit - you name it.  This gets you away from the feeling that you need to send a sandwich every day, and allows you to give your little one a large variety of fruits and vegetables instead.  I'm surprised that some people are saying it's too small for a toddler - remember, their stomach is only as big as their fist - this tray holds plenty of food for your average little one (and I've never even used the dip tray).  *Update - my son is 2 now (yes, I'm so enthusiastic about this, I'm re-reviewing it) and I send him with this tray, sans dip tray, and one extra small serving of yogurt or cottage cheese or a half sandwich on super skinny bread (in a separate container, or course), and he's full.
