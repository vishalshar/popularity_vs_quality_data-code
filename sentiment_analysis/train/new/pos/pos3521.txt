My kids would always go through the kitchen cabinets and bathroom cabinets until we got these.  They're easy to install and keep the doors locked.  I really like that you can also move them to "unlock" mode, at night after my kids go to bed I "unlock" the one on the trash door, so I don't have to use the magnet every time I throw something away.  Then in the morning I just turn the lock back on!
