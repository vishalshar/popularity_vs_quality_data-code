I purchased this car seat after lots of research on the internet.  It is a very good car seat for it's price.  It was super easy to install and my little boy loves to sit in it.  We are using it rear facing and he is very comfortable where he is at.  I love the ease of adjusting the straps with the knob.  I read some reviews where people had troubles but I haven't ran into any yet, just make sure you read the instructions.  I love the fact that it reclines unlike other models.  I would definatley recommend this carseat over some of the more spendy brands on the market.
