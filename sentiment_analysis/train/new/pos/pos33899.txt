We are on our second set of these brackets, having used them at a previous residence for a couple of years.I never had any issues with our brackets becoming hardened and breaking, although living in Southern California, I imagine we don't experience some of the temperature extremes people do elsewhere (even though it seems we all probably run our air/heat and keep inside temps relatively the same, no?)Yes, the screws are made from a cheap metal, which really makes little sense because they'll pop in two in stud. After initial frustration when I first bought the brackets I ran down to the home improvement store and picked up a package of small screws and used those instead, and drilled lead holes, and have had no problems.As far as holes in your furniture are concerned, I figure it's a small price to pay for safety. We've also used these straps to loop around items so we don't have to drill into them, with great success.Personally, I do NOT use these brackets on anything truly heavy. They're great for smaller items, particularly those you might need to move from time to time to clean underneath, vacuum under, etc.  The brackets are hard enough to get off that my children have never been able to remove them, but easy enough that I don't avoid moving our nightstands, toy organizers, dollhouse, etc. in order to get the area nice and clean.If you're looking to secure something mid-weight, I highly recommend the KidCo furniture straps. For heavyweight items I love using the Quakehold! furniture straps (which don't have to be screwed into your furniture, but can be if you prefer).Growing up in SoCal and living through several big earthquakes and as a mother of three children (one of which seems to be part monkey) I've found that there's no single product that is going to secure everything in your house, but I definitely keep these brackets around as part of my furniture securing "kit".
