I threw a Frozen birthday party for my niece and this kit had most everything I needed.  This party only included family so 8 cups and plates were plenty.  The tablecloth was quite a bit longer than my dining room table (which is where I set everything up), but I just folded it under on one side and looked great!  My niece was thrilled!
