These are fabulous. We did an absorbency test on all three (all size small). The thirsties hemp insert took 3 oz before leaking. The regular joey took 5oz. This is a DOUBLE insert, i.e. two attached ones, but very thin, only slightly thicker combined, than the single regular joey. This insert took about 9(!!!!)oz before leaking!!! It was the clear winner. Highly recommended!!!
