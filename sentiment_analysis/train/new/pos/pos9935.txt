My daughter is 14 months but tiny and with a small head for her age as well. I thought I had ordered the toddler ones but these came and I was a bit worried they would be too small for her. They say infant sunglasses but the packaging says "newborn" sunglasses. If your child is of normal/average size then these will probably fit until they are 9-12 months old but not longer. They fit my daughter perfectly right now and they are adorable and do have a little bit of give to the sides which is nice. The random color thing didn't bother me at all (we got pink which seems to be common?) since I have a girl, although I don't think it would have deterred me from ordering if I had a boy. I like the sunglasses and plan on ordering the toddler sized ones when she outgrows these.
