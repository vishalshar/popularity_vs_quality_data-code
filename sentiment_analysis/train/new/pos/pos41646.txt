I've purchased dozens of "custom" spoons for my toddler at this point.  It seems that every day, some new design comes out that looks like it would be easier for him to use.  The truth is that development-wise, he's changing so quickly, that I could probably keep buying new spoons every week until he's old enough to use regular ones and still not be happy.Pros:  Heavy-duty plastic.  He chews on these with his full set of teeth and only makes a small dent in them.  The angle helps since he doesn't have the wrist motion to easily get a straight spoon into his mouth without spilling.Cons:  Slightly concerned that I'm unnecessairly encouraging right-handedness (I would like to have the option to allow him to use either hand).Wash:  The holes don't seem to help or hinder.  I don't see them holding solid foods on the spoon any better than non-holes.Overall, a good product, but not quite perfect (though nothing might ever be).
