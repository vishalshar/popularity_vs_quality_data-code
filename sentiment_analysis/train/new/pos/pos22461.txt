We were looking for a large play mat for our 8 month old son to keep him off the rental carpet.  This play mat is definitely large.  My husband, my son, and I can easily play on it together.  The thickness is about as thick as a foam place mat and it works great on the carpet.  I think this would be a great product to have on hard surface flooring to provide a little padding when crawling around.  If you are looking for something a little thicker, Prince Lionheart makes this same mat with thicker foam called the play mat plus.  I didn't feel it was necessary to spend the extra money because by the time we move and hopefully no longer have carpet, my son will not longer be rolling around and trying to sit up.  As far as other mats, I can't stand the ones that link together because I didn't want to deal with the mess after my son tore them apart.  Also, I really am not a fan of the crazy colors.  I know that sounds crazy because this mat is very colorful but I think the colors serve a purpose.  The roads and farm encourages play and it is very cute.  It folds up easily and can be put away quickly unlike the mats that link together.  If you have pets that have claws that may get on this mat, I would advise you to look for a different product.  The instructions even say not to use high heels, etc. on the mat.  The only negative I can really say about the mat is it does move around on the carpet a little and I find that I'm having to move it a few times a day.  Not a huge deal, but thought I'd mention it.  If I had it on hard surface flooring, I would probably try a rug backing.  One last thing - super easy to clean.  It has had all sorts of baby mess on it and wipes clean.
