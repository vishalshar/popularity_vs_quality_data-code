I'm very happy with these. They were easy enough to put on the bed and the combination of two side by side make it long enough to safely cover the length of my twin bed- leaving a small space at the end for climbing in and our of. It makes a nice and cozy sleeping area for my son who at 18 months just moved to a twin bed from his crib. I was very worried about him the first night but he stayed right in place and seemed pretty pleased with himself to be a big bed like his sister. The reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I'd like them to be just a bit taller but so far, they seem to work as they are.
