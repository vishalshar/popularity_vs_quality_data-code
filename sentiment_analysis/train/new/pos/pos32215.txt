Initially, I thought I'd just boil my baby's bottles to sterilize them, but that took much longer than I thought and occupied way too much constant real estate in our already cramped kitchen. This bottle sterilizer holds the components for 4 bottles easily. It's easy to load and unload. The little sensor sticker increases newbie confidence that the bottles have been sterilized... though now, i just routinely put it in the microwave for 5 minutes... the bottles get plenty hot and steamy. And, my baby has not had any trouble with thrush since we've had this. This is a "if i had known then what i know now" sort of item. If you're pregnant, get this inexpensive little bottle sterilizer. It's more than worth it, and it's a "need" and not a "want."
