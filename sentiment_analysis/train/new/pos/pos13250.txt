This connects into the car seat on top so that you unzip, put baby in carseat like normal and then zip back up!!! Its amazing not to worry about loosing the pacifier because it drops inside of this and so does the bottle most of the time. I no longer need to worry aout bringing a blanket or loosing the blanket. BEST LITTLE GIFT EVER!!! must have for new mom or mom of multiples!!!! This also works in any stroller!! The pink is better looking in person and totally cute. People stop me all the time asking what its called and where i got it. Plus ive notice my little girl is more relaxed and sleeps better in her car seat while we are out now. I just cant say enough good stuff about this. I will buy a few more for our other strollers and car seats.
