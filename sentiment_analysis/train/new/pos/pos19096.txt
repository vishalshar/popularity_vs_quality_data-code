I love these cups. These were the first cups we used for our little guy. The handles are perfect for little hands to grip and the nipple part is extremely durable, and my guy likes to chew on it and pull it with his teeth. It has held up for a couple months now, and I LOVE that all the pieces come apart to wash (no where for mold to go!). It is also dishwasher safe, which also makes life easier. Love the Winnie the Pooh print, and color is great for boys or girls. Comes with an easy snap on lid for traveling, which I completely appreciate, so I can just throw it in the diaper bag and not worry about it getting gross. It doesn't leak either, and believe me, it gets thrown, and no issues.I like that they have to suck to get anything out of it, so I don't have to worry about him choking or making a mess.  My favorite cups by far. It is easy enough to get replacement nipples, but I haven't had to buy one yet! I highly recommend this as a first cup for babies and toddlers transitioning from bottles. Would also make a great baby shower gift.
