We have a 10 month old who loves to wiggle and see the world. Ever since he was a newborn, he has loved to see the world. We had tried the Infantino Balance Baby, the Moby Wrap, and just hand carrying to different degrees of success. Overall none of those we always comfortable (for parents and baby), cool (keeping baby from sweating), and accessible for baby to see the world and for the world to see him. In the end we took the plunge and splurged on the Baby Bjorn. I know you've seen reviews of parents that say baby items changed their lives and probably rolled your eyes...so get ready again. The Baby Bjorn has done it all: from walks on the beach, to the zoo, to the mall, and best of all around the house (both doing chores and trying to put baby to sleep in the middle of the night). It is great at wrapping and securing him as well as breathable enough that he is not in an oven. With the Infantino and Moby our baby would be sweating bullets after a few minutes, but with the BabyBjorn we have not had that problem. The only set back on the BabyBjorn is the front facing view with the flap. Sometimes it flips back u, and it's just at the height that he always wants to chew it. Of course you can buy the pricey bibs, but they're just terry cloth, so we just use our own bibs or let him have at it. Overall it has changed a lot for us: we get to walk with him carried even at 20 lbs and we can comfort him and put him to sleep when he needs to be close and rocked. Best buy!
