I love this pillow! We were gifted a boppy at my baby shower and I was super excited to try it out. Once baby came I found it very awkward to use. I'm not blessed in the chest area so even with the pillow I still had to prop my baby up. Eventually I stopped using the boppy and started using a regular pillow. One day while browsing Amazon I came across this and decided to try it. I have leachco' pregnancy pillow and love it so I figured I would love this too. Sure enough I did. The first thing I noticed was its about twice as thick as my boppy original which is great for me! The little baby straps (or baby panties as I call them) are wonderful because after the baby would get boob drunk I would strap him in and he would snooze for a bit. My baby is now 5 months and I just weaned him but we are still using the pillow. It's great for tummy time and just plain ol' relaxing. I highly recommend this pillow over the boppy!
