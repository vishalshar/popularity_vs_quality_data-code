My husband and I had previously bought the Fisher Price Lights and Sound based on Baby Bargains recommendation.  We liked it, but it had a lot of static.  We accidentally broke one piece of it and decided to try the Evenflo Whisper Connect and we love it.  There is no static and it is crystal clear.  The rechargeable batteries don't hold their charge as long as I would like, but you get used to it.  This monitor is great for us - other monitors had too much static.  (We also had this problem with cordless phones too)
