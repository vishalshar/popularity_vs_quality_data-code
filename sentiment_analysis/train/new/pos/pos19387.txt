I was hoping to find something as soft as Aden and anais swaddle blankets that had a more reasonable price. these are not that soft but I think they will get softer with more wear and washes, but they are soft enough to use. I do like the look of these blankets.I will say that the Hudson baby muslin swaddles are a little softer than these( or at least the 3 pack I got is) Just info for those of you that were like me and were looking for anything cheaper than Aden and anais ;)
