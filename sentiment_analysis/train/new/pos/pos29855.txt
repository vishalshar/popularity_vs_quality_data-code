We have 2 of these, but every 3-6 months they stop charging. Its a simple fix, see the customer pics. Remove the insides with a flat head, be careful not to stab yourself. When the assembly comes out look towards the base. There are three small phillips screws, looks like there should be four, but both of mine only had three. Remove the three screws and the base will pop off. There will be two springs that make the electrical contact. I used some sandpaper to clean the corrosion off of the springs, as well as well as the metal contacts in the base(where the springs touch when the base is screwed on. Put everything back together and try it out. It has worked several times for us. We love these lights, but they are difficult to find now.
