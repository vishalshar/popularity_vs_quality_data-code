Ya sure the charge does last that long but let me tell u that it's long enough for a whole lot of fun. Doesn't take long for it to recharge. Bought it for my 53 year old husband and everybody that comes over has played with it and loves it and wants one. It hit the tables, ceiling , walls, and u name it and it's not even chiped. When it saids easy to use and unbreakable it really is. So impressed that he wants another one or two for the spring time. I know when we get our income taxes back he will be getting them.
