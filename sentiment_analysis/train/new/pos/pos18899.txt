Bought this for a baby shower and my friend loved it! Was packaged it plastic to prevent damage during shipping. Came within 2 days, so I was able to get it monogrammed with the baby's name on it! Came out great... everyone loved it. Just FYI, I had to read the other reviews to see that the design is on the bottom right corner. The blanket is folded in the picture, so the design is not full size. Either way, it is such a great fleece blanket--soft and cozy! And it is a pretty big blanket for a baby but perfect so they can grow into it and use it for years to come.
