Great product but grows out of it quickly, like everything else.  It felt like within 2 weeks my daughter was able to pull out of this.  Worked great initially and as advertised but I think we bought a little late into my daughters age and she just got strong quickly and was able to get out.  I recommend this product as it does the job, just be cautious of childs age/strength in regards to how long you anticipate and hope this product continues to work for you.
