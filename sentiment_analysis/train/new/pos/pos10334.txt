We were very happy when we received the package in the mail. The basket quality is very good, easy to assemble the Hood section onto the basket with velcro. Added features: the foam mattress with a sheet and the liner that is included are of good quality also. We used the basket as the container to "wrap" up the presents for the shower and it was the most talked about present of the day! Can't wait to see the baby in it!
