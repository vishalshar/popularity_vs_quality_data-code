Our twin infant girls love their Creeper Sleepers Cozy Cats. They are small, but a good size for the girls. They're soft, easy to clean (we toss em in the wash), and aren't bulky/uncomfortable if the twins roll over onto them in their sleep. The girls love them so much that we've bought several spares for laundry day and in case they get lost.
