It takes a really hard tug to get this off the tray.  Once it is on there I really don't worry about my toddler pulling it off.  It sticks to the bowl OK but the part between the rubber and the bowl does come off easier than the part off the tray.  If there is any bit of butter or oil, etc on it then it won't stick at all.  The plus side is you can attach the rubber part to other things like plates and suction them to the tray. The bowl is deep so less mess.  The lid locks well and twists so no leaking.  Too bad it doesn't come in fun colors.
