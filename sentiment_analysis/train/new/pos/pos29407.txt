Does your little one suffer from Toddler tummy? You know where the shirt goes up and the pants slide down – under the tummy causing their pants to drag the ground? Or how about those in between times when you need a larger waist and then have to wait for them to grow 4 inches before the pants are not being stepped on? Keeping their pants rolled up can be a real pain. Until now…Let me tell you about a cute solution to this problem. My Hikes Pant Cuff Fasteners solve the “too long pants” problem.My Hikes pant cuff fasteners make your child's cuffed pants look like cleverly accessorized clothing instead of clothing mishaps.We received the Soccer Ball design in exchange for our review. In short? Buy them - They ROCK!! LOL!!Design options include (8) eight choices: Train, Dump Truck, Baseball, Soccer, Princess, Butterfly or Flower.The My Hikes Pant Cuff Fasteners slip on over the cuffed bottom and snap into place. Once in place, they securely hold the material in place. No more walking on the backs of their pants! They are also great for converting those too short pants into capris.For a limited time, you can purchase these on My Hikes site and received 40% off with discount code:  MyHikes40off. This brings the price down from $19.99 to 11.99 with Free Shipping! My Hikes are also available on Amazon.These would be a great stocking stuffer or birthday present. They certainly should be on your back to school shopping list. We use them on sweat pants around the house. With snow boots, they are long enough, however, when running around the house the pants have just enough length that our little ones slip from stepping on the bottoms. My Hikes solve this problem!I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.
