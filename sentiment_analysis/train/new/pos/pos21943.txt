I got this bib and the elephant skip hop zoo bib initially for my child's first birthday.  We were having an elephant party and I thought they were cute.  Upon receiving them and using them, it did not take long to realize that they weren't just cute.  They were EXTREMELY PRACTICAL!  They have wide coverage for my messy eater, a great pocket for catching food, and my favorite feature is that the bib folds up into it's own little travel pouch.  So, for example, when you're at a restaurant and your little one eats a messy meal that you don't want to get in your tote or purse, you fold the mess up into the pouch and no mess! You just take it home to deal with later. It is also machine washable, line dry (though we accidentally put ours in the dryer once - no damage).  I also wash it by hand and dry it over the sink or hang it on the oven handle. It dries quickly and that is another thing I love about it.  This bib is perfect!
