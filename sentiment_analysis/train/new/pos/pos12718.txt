Needed something we could use to travel since we are always on the go and my 2 and a half year old has outgrown the pack and play, but not quite ready to sleep in a regular bed.  So we got this with high expectations and it did not fail, it is absolutely perfect!  My little girl LOVES it and gets so excited when we travel that she gets to sleep on this!  It blows up very easily and fits together, and love how there are little bumpers around the edge so she cannot easily roll out.  Good materials and very durable, all packs up in the carrying bag they send with it and takes up NO space at all.  Our crib sheets/toddler bedding works perfect with the mattress and she has slept great all through the night in it!  Holds air for an entire weekend as well, so we didn't have to keep re-inflating every night.  My 4 and a half year old could also use this if needed, it is long and wide enough to accommodate bigger kids as well.  Would certainly recommend this to anyone with a toddler and even if you only travel on occasion this is WELL worth the money to get and use!  We will get tons of use out of ours!
