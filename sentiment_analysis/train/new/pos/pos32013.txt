Someone stole my original bag that came with my breast pump, with milk inside, on the train if you can imagine!  Some people will steal anything, it seems.  Got this as a replacement.  The size is perfect for two standard 9oz bottles or four 4 oz bottles.  It keeps things at temperature.  When the bag started to look less good I threw it in the was and it came out looking new.  Awesome.  I bought a second to send with the babysitter, the first is for me to bring milk home from work.
