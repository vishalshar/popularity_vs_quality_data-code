I love this high chair. Our goal is to buy things for our baby that will last and not need to be replaced quickly. What I love about this chair is that it is fully adjustable and she will be able to use it for years to come. It's well made; very sturdy, and very attractive. We get a lot of compliments on it from guests to our home. My favorite compliment has been: "Oh my gosh! Look at the high chair! I've been here for an hour and I just now noticed it!" That's kind of the goal. It fits in with our overall aesthetic and isn't some gaudy brightly colored plastic thing!It's fairly easy to assemble. I assembled it alone in about 45 minutes while my daughter napped.
