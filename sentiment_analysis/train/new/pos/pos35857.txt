This rattle is my 7 1/2 month old son's favorite toy.  He will choose this over any of his other toys, even ones with lights and sound.  The rattle is brightly colored (and as red, white, and black are the colors that babies react to most, that is a plus).  He loves the little rings around it as well.  I love this toy due to the fact that at 7 1/2 months he is not aware that he can hurt himself when he is flinging his arms around.  This rattle is soft and does not hurt him if he hits himself with it while he is playing like some of his plastic ones do.  I would definitely recommend this to any parent.  We originally bought this because he is fascinated by the Cat in the Hat on TV.  Even if your child is not a fan of the show, he will be a fan of this toy.  It is worth the price for sure.
