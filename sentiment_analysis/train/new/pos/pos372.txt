LOVE LOVE LOVE these hand held scalp messager's! They're not just for people! Our furbaby even loves them! She will sit and let us massage her back all day long. I have never seen a dog get into being massaged like she does. It is much easier on our hands as well as we can cover more area of her skin. Since she rolls in the dirt all the time, she'll come in and try scratching on the tile floor, so we'll call her over, make her sit and starting by her tail we'll massage a minute or so there, move up her spine a minute at a time. Her legs will get to jumping just like when we scratch her by hand. Heck there are times when I use it on my head I want to thump my leg too,if I could..LOL. Anyways- I highly recommend these for both two and four legged friends and family. Would make a great stocking stuffer gift with Christmas coming, white elephant sale, gift exchange, teachers gift, bst friends, heck even your dog groomer-one for them and one for their fur clients. You won't be disappointed! The wires are really thin but sturdy. The handles are thin but sturdy. Have your kids or spouse give you a nice head massage. Your spouse will thank you later(wink).
