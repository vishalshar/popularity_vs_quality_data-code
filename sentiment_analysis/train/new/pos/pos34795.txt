This is really cute, and I'm glad I bought it - though I might not have if I didn't have a gift certificate.  It was definitely smaller than I expected, but that's my bad for not paying attention to the dimensions listed. It fits quite comfortable on the waist band of the ergo; better suited for a back carry than a front carry if you need it readily/frequently accessible.  I find it a little awkward to reach into for my keys/debit card if I wear my son in front while I'm out shopping since it it sits slightly behind my hip, but it's perfect when I have him in a back carry.
