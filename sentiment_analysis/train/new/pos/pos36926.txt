I did not expect much from this inexpensive seat, but it is perfect! It is lightweight - I just took it for a week-long trip with my toddler. We used it on the plane, and at my parent's house. My son feels very comfortable on this seat and preferred it to the plastic potty chair my parents have. He even likes it more than our prince lionheart potty chair. I think my almost 2 year old wants to be like a grownup. He uses both the potty chair and the dreambaby seat now.I can put this seat on our toilet and take it off with one hand, it does not slide, easy to clean, and looks simple and nice. I think that it works as a travel potty seat better than plastic seats (I have "potette") because it does not slide and is comfortable. A splash guard is helpful for a boy too.
