I have to say... I really love this thing.  I see lots of not-so-good reviews here, but for me, it's been a good and reliable lifeline to my baby.  We've used it everyday for 4.75 years.  One of the speakers is finally wearing out, so we are getting a replacement.  Apparently, if you unplug it, is does give you static--- we rarely unplug it, so I haven't really noticed.  The light on the receiver is a bit touchy, but we keep it up and away from our son, so it's never really been a problem.  For me, this thing is worth gold.  It's always been amazingly sensitive.  At half volume, I can hear my son's voice at exactly the same loudness he produces.  And the lights at the top are incredibly reassuring.  When he was 6 months old, and I was trying to train him to sleep through the night, I could turn down the volume (so my heart wouldn't fall into pieces), but still watch the lights reflecting accurately the loudness of his voice.  Even now, I count on those lights to help me know that the monitor is on and that we haven't turned the volume down.  They are comforting to me.  So... I guess it's probably not perfect, but it's been a reliable old friend.  One I'm not ready to let go of.
