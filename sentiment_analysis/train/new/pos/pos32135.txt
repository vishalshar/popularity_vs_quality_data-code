Anyone looking for a modern, yet whimsical, mobile... this is the perfect choice {or maybe any of the Flensted mobiles}. After finally deciding on the hot air balloon mobile for my baby boys nursery, I am so happy with my decision.  He is only 5 weeks old, and is already staring at the hot air balloons.  The way they float / move in the air is so cool and so "real looking."  The only drawback is how the mobile arrived.  Because of shipping and the delicateness of the string, it was a bit tangled. But once the hubby got it untangled, it was perfect.
