This is our second DaVinci crib. This one is more sturdy and substantial than our son's DaVinci Charleston crib. It smelled like paint for the first couple weeks so make sure you can put it some where to off-gas for a week or two. There are two spots on the crib where it looks like it wasn't primed properly, so the paint kind of looks blotchy. You probably wouldn't notice it if you weren't inspecting it like we were when we were putting it together.  Besides that it came well packed and with all the pieces necessary to assembly it (this has happened to us two times previously with probably the largest company in baby products... the items did not include all the pieces to assemble it properly. This is obviously very frustrating and a hassle to deal with so, to me, it is always worth noting if you do not have issues!) It does not come with the toddler rail like our other DaVinci crib did. All in all, it is a very pretty and classic crib, and for the price I would buy again!
