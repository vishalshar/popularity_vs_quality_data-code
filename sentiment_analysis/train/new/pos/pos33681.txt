This mat was perfect for when my baby was just beginning to sit up and wasn't yet crawling. She loves the colors and the double layers mean that drool and spit ups don't soak through to the floor. Material is soft to the touch, but durable. It feels a little bit like sleeping bag material. Very easy to wash and dries quickly. The top and bottom layers aren't fully quilted together, though (only at the middle), so now that she is crawling the top shifts and bunches at the edges and it ends up getting kicked to the side when she really gets going, so we have to constantly smooth it back out. We joke about stapling it to the floor. Well....mostly joking...hmm....
