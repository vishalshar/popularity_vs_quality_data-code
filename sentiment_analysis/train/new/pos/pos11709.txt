My brother-in-law is Catholic and I bought this for his daughter. This was a great choice, he was speechless. Very pretty too, you can't tell from the photos. But I do have to add for people, if you are looking for top qaulity beauty, you won't it in this. My cross did have a chunk of metal sticking off it, I had to break it off. It's great for the price, if you want more out of a baby's first rosary, you money has to be put in it than this. I happen to like this choice. Wonderful keepsake.
