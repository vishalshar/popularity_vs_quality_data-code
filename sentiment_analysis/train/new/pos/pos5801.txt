I have ordered this replacement sponge when I ordered my Simba Baby Rotary Spinning Bottle and Nipple Brush set. While I am confident with the quality, I got this replacement so if I need to replace the sponge, I don't have to wait for the shipment. This is the place for the best price for the replacement sponge.I have been using my sponge set for 2 months and still didn't use my replacement yet. As long as you are doing a great job in drying the sponge, the life of the sponge could last long. I am still glad to have my replacement ordered as in the back of my mind, I know I could replace the sponge anytime if I need to.If you are reading this and want to know if the original sponge set are good or not, check out the original sponge set review. Me myself are loving it and are recommending this to all my new parents friends.
