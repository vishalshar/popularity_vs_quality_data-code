This carrier is amazing!! I really wanted a soft baby carrier (sling) and a structured one. However the slings intimidate me because they seem so complicated and I'm terrified that I'll tie them wrong and hurt or drop baby. This is amazing because it goes on like a Tshirt and is two steps after you put it on - baby's feet in one pocket and wrap around and then wrap other pocket around baby and done! Even using the directions the first time it took me under 2 minutes. I have used this at church a few times and at a Walgreens stop. The back support is awesome and I like that it has the moisture wicking material. I'm really looking forward to using this in different ways other than the newborn position. By the way, my lo is about 7.5 lbs (maybe a little less), I'm 5 feet tall, and I was a size 10-12 before pregnancy. I got the size M and while it was a little uncomfortably snug when first put on baby, it loosened a tiny bit to be comfortable and secure. Love it! Would not hesitate to buy again for sure!
