This is was the absolute best deal I could find for food-grade silicone teething jewelry. Other companies wanted the same price for just one strand of beads.It's high quality and exactly as described and my baby loves it.I however only gave it 4 stars because it is very gaudy and the beads were bigger than I though and I feel silly wearing them. Also the beads pick up hair and dirt like a magnet and hurt like heck when a strand my hair gets caught in them.But all in all, great deal, high quality and just as described. Color is beautifully accurate as well.
