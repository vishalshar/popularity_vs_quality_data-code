We have been using the Safety 1st prism video monitor for about a month now and in general it has met our expectations in providing:Pros:  clear video image  Good resolution  good sound  Easily mounted to wall.Cons:  Flashing power light on video unit makes it difficult to sleep with. (As noted by another electric tape covers this nicely)  No stand and unit is knocked over easily (we keep it laid on the side which works well with a wall mount but its easy to knock it off the night stand if you're not careful.)We have kept the video unit  plugged in so I can't comment on battery life.  We mounted the camera on the wall above the crib which provides an excellent birds eye view and allows you to zoom in (Although the zoom is really a novelty as you can't see if there breathing).  The video monitor allows you to turn off/on the video screen with a single button press.The camera unit also has a steady blue light when it is on but we have found that it does not bother our baby and actually provides enough light to check in on her without turning on the lights.
