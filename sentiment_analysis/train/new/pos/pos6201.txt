After looking at reviews online, I decided to get the Beco over the Ergo. Besides that, this awesome print won me over. It is just as pretty in person.Using this carrier around my mom has also won *her* over - to babywearing! Yay!Easy to breastfeed in as well.I only wish there was an in-between size for the base since my three month old is still too small for the wider base but dangles a little bit already. ::hint hint designers for the the 2.0 version!::
