I read a ton of reviews before buying anything.  Which might be a little overkill in buying a changing table.  I purchased this table for first kid, who is now 5.5 months old.Pros:1) Extremely easy to put together2) Glad we purchased one with compartments to store diapers etc...3) It actually looks pretty good4) It's sturdy and I'm confident it will last through our future kids.5) The cushion is more than sufficient.  Honestly my kid loves laying on this thing and having his diaper changed go figure.  I remember some reviews complaining that the mattress is too thin.  Which I don't understand since your kid isn't sleeping on it.Con1) It could be a little higher.  But I don't think any changing tables come much taller. I'm tall, my wife is tall.  Of course bending over for period of time eventually hurts your back.  But as a new parent I quickly learned to change diapers in record time, and it's really not an issue.
