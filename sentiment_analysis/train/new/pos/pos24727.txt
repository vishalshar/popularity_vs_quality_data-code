My daughter loves this toy now at 6 months and I can see it growing to be even more fun for her in the next few months since she hasn't even tried to pull the head out of the ball.  It features a magnetic hand that she loves to pull away from the lady bug over and over.  She also likes to play with the attached rattle and there is a crinkle flower she enjoys as well.
