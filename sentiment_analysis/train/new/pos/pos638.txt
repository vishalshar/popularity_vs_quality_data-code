Was looking for a diaper bag that holds everything I needed. It is not as big as it seems but big enough to hold foldable diaper changing pad, a couple of diapers, diaper wipe case, tumbler, baby bottles, sippy cups, toys. Love the pockets outside and sides for other small items. It does not stand on itself because it does not have a base like a cardboard type of thing. What I did was get one of those small canvas rectangular bin at a dollar store and it helps keep stuff inside organized and the I can put the bag down and it stands by itself.
