If you're considering a Wubbanub (which you probably are since you're reading this review), get it.  I've owned several of these and have yet to be disappointed. The animals are soft and cute. But the best part is that they're easy to find in the car or anywhere really. The weight and orientation of the animal makes it so the pacifier has a more difficult time falling out when baby is reclined or lying flat so there's less waking and crying. When baby gets older they can more easily find their pacifier because they only need to find the animal. And these darn pacifiers can escape or hide in a crib pretty easily by themselves. The animal prevents the crib escape. Get a Wubbanub!!  It is the perfect baby shower gift. And this is all coming from a mom of 3 who swore my kids would never use pacifiers... Hahaha
