The tubes work well with my medela. I'm actually using it right now. hahaha.... ^_^ My only issue with it is that I've noticed it gets more misty than the ones that originally came with my pump. Not sure why but so far the moisture in the tubes haven't effected anything.  It just sucks that you have to leave the pump on a little longer on after you've already stop to dry the moisture away. I read online that its a good practice to do that so that you don't have left over moisture in the tubes.
