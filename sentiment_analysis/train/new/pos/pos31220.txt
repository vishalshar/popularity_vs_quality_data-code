When you have a baby, you boil things a lot.  At least you do with the first baby.  ;-)  This system with the pre-sterilized disposable inserts means one less thing to have to boil all the time.The bottle does not have a hard plastic bottom.  It has hard plastic sides, obviously, but the bottom is open.  Some reviewers were complaining about this.  The reason the bottom is open is so heat more easily gets to the milk when you put the bottle into a dish of warm water.  Someone on here was saying that without a hard bottom the liner might puncture or something if you put the bottle down on something sharp.  Dude, really?  You might put your baby's bottle down on a giant thumbtack that just happens to be sitting there with its point sticking up?  No.  This system is fine.  My husband warms by putting hot water into a big coffee mug and sitting this bottle into the mug for a bit.  The hot water gets around the sides of the liner so it quickly warms the milk.  It's fine.  It's convenient.  He doesn't mind doing night feedings so much with this system.
