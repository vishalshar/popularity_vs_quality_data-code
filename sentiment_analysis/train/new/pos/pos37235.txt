I love the idea of this product... I just don't love the price tag. My son loves his bear wubby and uses it all the time. He loves hugging its soft little body and squeezing its paws which is great since he is a little over 3 months and getting very handsy. The bear is very light weight with a small amount of beads in its feat that give it a little character when flopping about, but not enough weight to be too heavy for even the smallest infant. I am not sure what I was originally expecting but the animals are tiny... perhaps a little bigger then baby beanie babies at ~4-5 inches in length. To me it just looks tiny, but it seems to be a good size for him. I would love to see this company have more animal options as well as make the pacifier removable so that both the animal and the pacifier are easier to clean and be switchable.
