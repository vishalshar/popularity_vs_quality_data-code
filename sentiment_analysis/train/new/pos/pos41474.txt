These are perfect for babies who are learning to use the food pouches. My daughter learned with it starting at 6 months. I like that it has a case to carry the spoons for on the go. We're traveling soon & I think these would be perfect for the airport and the little adventures we go. I've used the spoons on the Infantini disposable pouches, Plum Orgamics, Ella's Kitchen, & Earth's Best.
