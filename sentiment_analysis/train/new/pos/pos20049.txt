After reading all the other reviews posted,I was a little apprehensive about buying this monitor. However, there was such a good deal on the price that I decided to take my chances and purchase it any way. To start with, I was surprised at how easy it was to set it up and even more pleasantly surprised with how clear the sound is, it's as if the baby is right there beside me. I really had to wonder if we are all talking about the same monitor. I have absolutely no complaints. It was so clear, I could make out the song in the vehicle driving by on the road. I hear even more than I really need to, ha ha. I would suggest that you just make sure no other appliance in the house is running on 2.4GHz and you shouldn't have a problem.Hope this helps... I have no complaints.
