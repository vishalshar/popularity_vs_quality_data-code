I love the finished product.  The drawers are even, the doors are even, and everything works smoothly.Assembly was a NIGHTMARE.  Instructions were awful, parts were not labeled, and the hardware (about 200 pieces at least) was all thrown into one big plastic bag.  I hate it when care is not taken to package things in a manner that makes sense, and I've owned about 30 RTA pieces.  The cabinet is very sturdy, but the cam-lock construction did not feel very "permanent" to me.  With Sauder products, you turn the cam-lock almost 360 degrees around, making it really tight.  These cam-lock slipped around, and almost popped out on every single joint.  They are made of real metal, so I believe they'll last for awhile, but I'm going to need to go in every now and again and tighten everything back up.All in all, a beautiful cabinet.  But if you purchase the Storkcraft Rochester crib like I did, don't expect the "Oak" finishes to match.  The cabinet is a nice dark brown and the cribs have a reddish tint to them.  I guess I could have spent another $200 and purchased the Aspen cribs in Oak, but it just wasn't in the budget for our twins' nursery.
