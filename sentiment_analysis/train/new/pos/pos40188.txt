Con: Has straps to velcro around the crib slots, for my nephew who is mostly in his pack and play or on the play mat on the floor the velcro straps didn't work to hold it up for him to kick. We of course modified the straps to work for his play area. (This of course is a manufacturer fault not the seller)Other than that product exactly as stated, very pleased and my nephew enjoyed it!Purchase was very smooth, product arrived within 2 days of purchase new in box and shrink wrap! Very happy with transaction.
