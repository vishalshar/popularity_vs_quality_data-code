This is a lifesaver for nursing in public. I had been using an Aiden and Anais muslin blanket tied around my neck, but I had a hard time getting him to latch right unless I pulled it over my head like a ghost so I could see him. Then I would pull it down again and I couldn't see him or make eye contact, and I worried he wasn't getting enough air or was too hot.This is so much easier. I don't have to impersonate Casper to get a latch, I can see him but nobody else can. It covers enough of me, and is a cute pattern. Now I make faces at him while he's feeding and he laughs. The opening at the top let's air in and heat out. And it's easier to slip over my head.It's now in my diaper bag at all times.
