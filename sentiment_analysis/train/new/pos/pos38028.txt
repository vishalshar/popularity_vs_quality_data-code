The reception is fantastic, and the night vision on the camera is absolutely clear. (We have a special needs son and the picture is so clear on this that we can actually count his respiratory rate at night.) We have it mounted on the wall above the crib, pointing down at our little guy. I haven't tried using more than one camera so can't speak to how that works, but with the one camera and monitor it has been great. We don't get extra static or feedback from the sound, either, as we used to get on our other non-video monitor.The one issue is that when the camera loses the signal, there is nothing audible to let you know - the screen just goes dark, so if you're asleep when it happens you wouldn't know. It has lost signal rarely over the few months we have had it, and it tends to find it again fairly soon so that isn't the end of the world.
