Very cute toy. This toy is really cute and is a nice size; however, the only issue we had is it is kind of heavy. The monkey is large enough to make it a little on the heavy side. This makes it durable for older babies, but younger babies have a hard time with controlling it due to the weight. Overall our little guy loved to play with it, just had to make sure he didn't bop himself with it before he could control it.
