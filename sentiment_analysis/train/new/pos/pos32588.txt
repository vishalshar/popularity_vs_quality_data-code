I ordered this toy and then noticed all of the negative reviews. I went back and forth on whether I should cancel the order or not, but ultimately I decided to try the toy and then return it if I wasn't satisfied. I received it today and it actually works fine! All 3 of the doors open, all of the animals talk, and none of the doors fly off. All I had to do was change the batteries and it started working immediately. I'm excited to take it to the daycare where I work because the babies haven't had a working jack-in-the-box for awhile and they will most likely love this one.
