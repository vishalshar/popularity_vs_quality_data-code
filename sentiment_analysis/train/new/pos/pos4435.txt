These are great pants!  The fabric is a really nice thick high-quality fabric.  It's also soft.  The elastic waistband is wide enough it seems very comfortable around my baby's waist.  While I don't consider it a negative, something to consider when purchasing -- these pants run very large!  My daughter is comfortably wearing the 3-6 month size with room to grow, even though she's mostly moving into 6-9 month pants in all other brands.  The only "negative" I have for these pants is that I wish they came in a wider variety of colors and in larger sizes!  Highly recommend.
