These sippy cups are wonderful. They were the first trainer cup that we had our daughter use around 5-6 months old and she still uses them now for her milk at almost 2.1. Actually does not spill, but is easy for my daughter to drink out of. This is huge. I have a cabinet full of sippy cups that I purchased and my daughter was unable to use even though she was well within the age range. Many of the straw type cups were too difficult for my daughter to use for quite awhile. She was unable to suck hard enough to get any liquid out of a lot of the sippy cups we tried. This one really was a great first cup for her as a baby.2. Easy to clean. I love, love, love that there are only two parts to this cup. There are no weird folds or flaps where mold can grow. I usually just put both parts in the top rack of the dishwasher and they come out clean and I do not have to worry about using a small brush to clean any nooks and crannies.3. Easy to hold. There are other cups that my daughter has that she could drink out of, but didn't have handles and was tough for her to coordinate bringing up to her mouth with both hands at first. She was able to manage this cup almost immediately as a baby, which helps keep her liquid intake up.4. Cheap! Great price for the durability and quality of the cups.Cons:1. Once my daughter's teeth came in and her bite got stronger, she has bit threw a few of the tops. This is after months and months of use, and she has not actually bit the tops off, but rather started to break the tip off. I have had to throw away two lids and purchase new cups. Not a deal breaker, and honestly, she's been using them for a year and a half.I would recommend these trainer cups to anyone and have found them to be the cup that we go back to over and over. We will use these for our next child as well.
