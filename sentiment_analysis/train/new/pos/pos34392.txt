I searched high and low for a double stroller that wouldn't break the bank and I have been very happy with my purchase. I have a two-year-old son and a five-month-old daughter and both kids like facing forward. I also like the side-by-side style. I couldn't see myself pushing a "stretch limo" as I've heard it called. It's easy to maneuver, I can fit down most aisles, and it fits in the trunk of my compact car with a full load of groceries. Drawbacks: the canopy could be a bit higher, (my son thinks it's a game when I pull it forward and immediately pushes it back), the seat covers are velcroed in place and tend to slip when I put the kids in, and I need to fold it before it will fit through the front door of the house. I've also taken it on two cross-country plane trips with layovers. Baggage handlers in general aren't very gentle and the front bars come off fairly easily when the stroller is folded. One now has a small rip in it, but I'm lucky it didn't get lost. Overall, I've been happy with it.
