Yes it's cheap, yes it's very pink, and yes it's battery powered, but we use it more than our swing, boppy, or pack-n-play.My baby is 2 months and she loves being bounced in this. I love that it's low to the ground so she can see whats going on all around her. I also like that it's low because I can bounce her with my foot while pumping, working, or being at the computer.The only negative thing I have to say is that the first bouncer I had was defective. I had it for only 2 weeks and the motor for the vibration stopped working properly. I thought it was the batteries, but when I replaced them it was still a slow sputter rather than a constant vibration. I contacted amazon and they were willing to replace the item for me, and so far, so good. Obviously not amazon's fault, but they were still willing to accept my request. Thank you Amazon!
