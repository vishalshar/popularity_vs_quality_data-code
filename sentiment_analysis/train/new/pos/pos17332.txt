SoundSpa Glow Puppy:  Has 8 sound options.  The heartbeat sounds mechanical to me rather than authentic.  But I like the rest of the puppy:  The on/of switch is inside one foot (pinch the foot to turn on), the sound selector is in the other foot (cycles through the 8 sounds), and the other switches are inside the back of the bear (velcro keeps the back closed):  volume switch (low-med-high), duration switch (15 min - 30 min - 60 minutes).  myBaby SoundSpa Glow PuppyWomb Sounds Bear:  The sound of the heartbeat is excellent.  Wow.  But the bear sheds fibers all over.  I used a lint roller to get them off the crib's mattress after my baby had enjoyed the bear for 10 minutes.  I wonder how many fibers he ate.  The beige volume knob sticks out of the back about 1/2 inch. DEX Products Womb Sounds Bear, Brown
