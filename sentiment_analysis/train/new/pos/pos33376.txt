I absolutely love this baby scrapbook.  The clip art and coloring of the book is beautiful and mostly a delicate rose color.  It contains approximately 40 pages: about mommy and daddy, pregnancy, baby shower info, space to paste invite, delivery info, baby hand and foot prints, space for birth announcements/ certificate, homecoming, space for world happenings when baby was born, doctor visits, growth, memories, holidays, birthdays 1-5, first day of school and my favorite a letter from mommy and a letter from daddy!  Best of all it comes in a clear plastic book cover for safe keeping!!  The cover is very "Cinderella-like" without all the princess pictures, which I personally liked.  The back cover has soft pink dots and swirls.  My only slight complaint was it was going to take 2-3 months to get, however they updated me often and delivered it within 3 weeks!  I love this scrapbook for our baby girl and I would gladly give this as a gift as well.  Very reasonably priced!
