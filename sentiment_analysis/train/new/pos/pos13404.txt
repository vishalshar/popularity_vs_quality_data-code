"Helps keep unpleasant diaper odors from leaving the pail"- Yes, it does.  Our daugther is only 3 months old, so the really stinky diapers are still to come (so I'm told).  I always change the pail outside, and it smells when doing so."Built-in deodorizer compartment"- It doesn't stink around it, so I'll agree with that statement"Locks in a closed position so children won't open the pail"WRONG.  You can easily life the lid up with your fingers.  Our baby is too young to crawl, so that hasn't been an issue yet, but I guarantee she will be able to lift it open when the time comes."Uses standard plastic bags"This was the selling point.  My wife is anti-garbage bags.  She saves all her grocery bags, throws trash in there which then goes to the can outside.  I've learned to deal with it.  It is amazing how many diapers a regular grocery bag can hold, but I suggest using a bag a little larger."Easy one-hand use"It has a foot pedal - no hands needed.Overall, this works well.  No expensive, unit specific pail liner system to purchase.  Those who complain about it stinking when changing the pail - seriously, get over yourself.  Do it outside, breathe out your nose - you will deal with far nastier stuff with a child than a stinky diaper pail.
