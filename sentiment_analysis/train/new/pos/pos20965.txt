I often look to amazon reviews when selecting gifts.  I really appreciate feedback from other people and this play gym had quite a few reviews.  My 10 week old daughter absolutely LOVES this.  The first time we put her in the middle of all the toys and very pleasant music she smiled and still smiles everytime!  The music is very soothing (not too loud, nice tune) the toys are perfect for baby's exploraiton, and the gentle lights are awesome for baby to look at.  I highly recommend this product!!!  I just had to attach a video of our baby girl enjoying her time with her Christmas gift...MOM APPROVED :)
