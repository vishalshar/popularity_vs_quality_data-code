My wife loves purple, and as fate would have it so does my infant daugther. This bedding set is not only well made, but durable, darling to look at, matches the MANY different color schemes my wife painted the baby room (lime, pale yellow, brown, orange...) and is super comfy.  My 6 month old infant daugther sleeps warmly and comfortably every night, ALL THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT on this set!
