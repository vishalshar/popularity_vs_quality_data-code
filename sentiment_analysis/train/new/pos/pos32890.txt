The Pros:The weight - I was pleasantly surprised by the weight of this changing pad cover.  It is plush and thick.The size - This cover accommodates changing pads with two OR four raised sides.  Not all covers can fit pads with four raised sides, this is a nice feature.The price - Compared with other products and what is available in stores like Babies R Us an Buy Buy Baby, the Summer Infant cover through Amazon is a great deal!The Cons:The colors - I originally purchased the light blue and was unpleasantly surprised by the color.  It was a bright unattractive blue, not a traditional baby blue as it appears in the photo.  I exchanged it for the white cover and am much happierCleanliness - All three covers that I purchased arrived dirty.  The package has a small peak hole for customers to feel the softness.  This exposed area gets filthy, likely in the warehouse sorting process.  Don't be surprised if your product arrives dirty.  I washed all covers (which I would have done anyway) and they came clean.Overall, the Pros outweigh the Cons, just calibrate your expectations.
