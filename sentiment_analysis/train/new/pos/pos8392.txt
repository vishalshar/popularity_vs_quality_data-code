I ordered this for my new baby due in 4 weeks. When I received it I noticed the box said it had a bottle, pacifier, and a formula storage cup on it. I opened the box to find these 3 things! I had no idea it even came with these things for free so it was a nice surprise. We won't be using that type of pacifier but the bottles I do use and the formula cups.It says it fits 4 bottles & parts. I did expect it to hold 6 like Avent but I'm not bothered by it. It's a low enough price that it's worth it. I would buy this again.
