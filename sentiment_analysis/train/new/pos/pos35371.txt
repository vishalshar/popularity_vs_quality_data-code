Durable and pretty. I have recently become concerned about feeding my kids on the cheap Ikea plastic ware we have used in the past. It really bothered me and when I saw these dishes available at Target, I decided to start purchasing a couple of pieces each time I was there. We have now converted completely. I have four children and have assigned them each a color which they are always supposed to use. They have 2 of each piece and if it's dirty, they have to wash it. This has really cut down on the amount of cups they go through in a day and thus, the number of times I am running the dishwasher. Green in more ways than one!These are cheaper at Target, especially the divided plates. However, I had to buy the green coloered cups and plates on amazon because they were never available at Target. Cost me a total of $6 more for one package of each. ($5 for the plate and $1 for the cups).And truly, I don't think it's wise to microwave anything plastic, even if it claims that it's okay. Who knows what chemicals are released into the food?
