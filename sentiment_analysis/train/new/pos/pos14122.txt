This was an excellent and necessary purchase, as I have three stairwells, all with banisters on one side.  This was the only clear solution I cold find, and it worked beautifully.  It's very simple to use.  It honestly takes about 30 seconds to put one of these up with zip ties.  No tools required, and no real handyman knowledge needed.  As for the complaint by some that you're overpaying for a piece of wood and some zip ties, well, one of these kits costs about $13, and it comes with hardware.  To do it yourself, you get to drive to your local home improvement store, however far away it may be, go in, pick out the wood, have someone cut it down to size, find and buy the zip ties, find and buy the hardware that also comes with it, if you're mounting it to the bannister with hardware, drive back home, and then get started.  Note, you do still have to buy those things, and you are your own delivery service.  It also takes time.  Time is of some value.  With this kit, you are paying all of $13 to have it all delivered to your door with no hassle.  If you're going to the home improvement store anyway, and you don't mind doing the extra work/time for it, that's fine.  That's certainly an individual prerogative.  For me, I'd rather click a button and have it at my door, ready to go.  Worth the money for me, but it's a personal choice.  It is simple, and no frills, as people say, but it does the trick, and it does it well.
