This one is the only one worth its price. Comes with easy to follow instructions sewn right onto one side.I love this blanket. First of all, it's the right size for swaddling 40" by 40", and the weight is just right, a soft, light flannel that wraps baby up to be toasty and warm, but doesn't overheat, even for summer babies.When I had my first child, I was easily frustrated by how quickly he broke free of his swaddle. For my second child, I found this blanket, and he never broke free. I used it for him and my third, and I give these to all my friends and relatives who are expecting. (I'm a bit of a swaddling zealot...pair this blanket with Harvy Karp's book or DVD "The Happiest Baby on the Block" -- it works!)I always kept two on hand, for when one was in the wash.Once baby outgrows the swaddle, the blanket continues to come in handy. It's nice and large, and makes a great shade over the stroller. Also works as a cover-up when you're nursing.
