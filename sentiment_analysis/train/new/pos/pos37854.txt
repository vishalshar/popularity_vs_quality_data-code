Although with this Burlington Baby Basket You will have to buy or make your own bedding , bumper pads and stuff , it is the best basket purchased so far out of the three brands I have purchased . This one seems to be the best made basket.  The liner was on already when unpacked . The one thing so far that has this basket in the lead is the handles , they are soft and not shredding wicker in any way so far , also the solidity of the basket seems better than all the other brands , I am sending those other baskets back ,  One of the other brand baskets that came  Yesterday was a beautiful bedding set with a poor quality basket that  when picked up out of the package to examine it the handles shred off a bit  leaving pieces of wicker on the area where the baby would lie and the handles stay flopped in toward the baby , with wicker shreds falling off of them , you could see the problem there .  We  also got another brand of basket yesterday  and it is going back today because  the basket  is so flimsy and the hood did not even fit with its velcro attachment .  This Burlington  basket wins thus far in quality of the basket itself.  the handles being the feature that stands out above the other brands so far as well as the solid feel overall . At least the handles  are not shredding over the babys area. It has a nice size so even with bumper pads put in there will still be plenty of room .  This basket has not been used so cannot comment on its durability yet . hope this helps someone looking for a good Moses basket , this brand is so far in my view the best one.
