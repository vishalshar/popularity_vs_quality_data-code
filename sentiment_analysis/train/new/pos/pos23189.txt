This is a very pretty keepsake box, and I ordered 3, for birthday gifts for girls that were having they're party at the same time. Two were shrink wrapped nicely but the third one came in with missing bottom ribbon, and a dent on the side. I wasn't very happy as I needed them right away. I called Amazon and they fixed the problem in a heart beat so it all worked out. Two of the girls are from Switzerland and the mother of the girls loved them. So did the mother that lives here in the states. They said they were very sturdy, very cute and enough drawers and top opening that it would hold alot for them. I'm glad I went with this product after all.
