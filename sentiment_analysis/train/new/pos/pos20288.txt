This mobile is adorable in person! The colors are vibrant, and very close to what is pictured. The material is felt and ribbon. I was a little disappointed with how this product was packaged. It was sent smushed into a folded piece of cardboard, which caused the pink part on top to have lots of denting, and some of the peacocks have some creasing. I believe this will work itself out though, once it's up and aired out more. I am still happy with the purchase because it fits our color scheme perfectly.
