This was probably the best money I spent on my baby so far. It was used literally everyday! My daughter used it mostly as a seat to watch mommy do chores throughout the day. It was so easy to pull from room to room and keep an eye on her while she sat or slept comfortably. She had a crib, but I noticed that she slept longer in this sleeper than in her crib. But after seeing the many reviews about babies getting hooked to sleeping in this sleeper and the hell it made when transitioning to a crib later on, I decided to only let her sleep in this overnight the first few weeks while I could use all the rest I could get. During the day, I would lay her in her crib for naps even though I knew she wouldn't sleep as long just so she can get used to sleeping on a flat surface too. It worked like a charm. I never had a problem getting her to sleep in her crib as well. This was also was the perfect travel accessory. It was soooooo much more convenient than a big, bulky playyard that took up a lot of room in the trunk when traveling out of town, not to mention at relatives house when we would visit. Just fold n go. Sleek and compact and did I mention my daughter LOVED sleeping in this chair?! 5 stars, but caution ....it can leave a flat spot on your baby's head if they lay in this often... and they probably will once you notice how much longer your baby sleeps at a time in this compared to a crib. I noticed one starting to appear on my baby after a few weeks. Once I noticed, I bought a infant head and body support that goes in carseats to add some cushion under my baby's head.
