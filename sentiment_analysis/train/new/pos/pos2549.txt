I like the shape of the balls and the texture.  Baby loves them.  However baby is 6 months old and in total chewing mode (see picture) so I've decided to take them away for a while until she no longer chews on everything.  This is still PVC although phthalate free but I ordered some other balls instead.  These were suggested by another reviewer and are made out of natural rubber.I got them at https://www.atterdagkids.com.  They are Vulli - Sophie the Giraffe So Pure balls.  They look adorable and seem safer for baby to chew on.
