This is the most amazing deal I have found on Amazon. This sheet cost double in the Leading Baby store. So I bought two of them. Let me tell you the picture is not what it looks like at all. Thankfully, it looks just like the rest of the mosaic transport pattern by Kidsline. This picture makes it look like a Noahs Ark pattern.When it arrived I thought for sure I was going to have to return it. I am so happy with my purchase I have been recommending Amazon to several people.
