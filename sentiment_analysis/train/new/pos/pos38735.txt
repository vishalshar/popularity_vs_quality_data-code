I have been using these during the daytime for about a week and love them. They are soft, very absorbent, and I've had no issues with leaking.  The layer that rests against the skin is a soft velour that soaks up every last drop. They do not bunch under my bra. All of my nursing bras are a little thicker so the Bamboobies are invisible underneath. I'm not sure how they would do with a thinner bra though. I also have the overnight Bamboobies as well as two pairs of Medela ones, and these are definitely my favorite for daytime use. I have hand-washed and machine-washed them without incident. The photo shows what each type looks like straight from the dryer. The overnight ones are the top right circular-shaped set, these daytime ones are the lower right heart-shaped set, and the Medela ones are the top and bottom left sets (as-is from the dryer and flattened out). You can see that the daytime ones are the smoothest, even though the edges curl slightly inward (which is not a problem when they're in use). The Medela ones are absorbent but they bunch up quite a bit, even after I tried to flatten them out.  There is no comparison - Bamboobies win.
