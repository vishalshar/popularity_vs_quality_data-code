I need about 14 more of these in every color & pattern! These are the ONLY mitts my baby will wear and not pull off ALL DAY! Her daycare teachers and I have been so surprised. Before, with regular elastic mitts, she would pull them off in 2 seconds. We could never keep her from scratching herself or sucking her thumb. She rubs her eyes when she gets sleepy so she would get little scratches all the time. Once we started putting Goumikids mitts on her= WOW! Just so happy with the quality, softness, and staying power of this product. Will be on the lookout for more soon!
