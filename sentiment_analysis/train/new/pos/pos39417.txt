I purchased this bag as a second diaper bag so that I would have a bag that could also be used as a "cross-body." This bag is made of very high quality materials, and the strap is super easy to adjust, so I can easily throw it over my shoulder or quickly lengthen the strap and sling it across my front. Also, the stroller straps tuck nicely into the sides of the bag, and are not visible when the bag is zipped. The changing pad that is included is super lightweight, but not very big. The wipe box is great and closes very well even when it's packed full of wipes, so the wipes don't dry out. Also, the bottle cooler bag is a huge plus. Genius!In my opinion, the major drawback of this bag is the size. It's not very big and because of it's incredible, durable construction, the sides aren't very flexible, so it's not very easy to cram a bunch of junk in here. That's good and bad, though, because with a bigger bag, you'll probably end up carrying more junk. The other drawback for me, personally, is the rose gold finishes. I wish it was just regular yellow gold, but I can live with it. Overall, this is an excellent bag and is great looking. Would highly recommend!
