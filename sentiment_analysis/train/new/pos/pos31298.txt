This has been an amazingly useful addition to our kitchen. It has very much reduced the instances of my daughter clinging to my legs begging to be held while I try to cook/eat/clean up. We really love it and so does she. However, we did cover three of the openings, since our clumsy girl fell out and bumped her head on the very first day. We bought a window shade, sewed bias tape around the edges to stop fraying and make it stronger,  then screwed it in. It matches our window coverings, and it keeps our girl safe. When she is older we may remove them- but for toddlers it is a must. Only other small complaint is that the little rubber bumper dots that go on the bottom did not adhere very well. One has fallen off already, leaving it slightly wobbly until we fix it.
