I love this! I bought this wrap after weeks of carrying the car seat with hurting arms. It definitely makes the weight of the car seat more comfortable and it is nice to have a soft blanket to place on the floor when we travel (you can ever use it on the bench at a resturant). My only complaint is that it tends to slide on the handle causing it to come slightly unravled and the toy hooks don't work so well when trying to hang toys (I think they hang too low). My husband also says it makes it difficult to carry ( he likes to grab the carrier with his hand- like he is holding a tool box).
