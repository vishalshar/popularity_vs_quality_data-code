This was about what I expected.  I had bought similar item about 35-40 years ago (or someone got it as a gift for us) for our first baby.  We got this for a grandchild and a great-grandchild.  The parents were very pleased.  The coloring was a bit different, I think, but it seems sturdy and it was true to the Beatrix Potter drawings.
