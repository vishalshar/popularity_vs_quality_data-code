I purchased the original 360 and the cool air 360. I liked them both but found the cool air with all the straps to be very stiff and hard to adjust with just a pull. Perhaps they would soften up and become easier to adjust over time. I was afraid the mesh wouldn't hold up as well and didn't like that the mesh surrounded the leg openings because I felt it would irritate and rub on baby's sensitive skin so returned the cool air and kept the original 360. I actually really like the Velcro waist on the original and don't find I need to adjust it once it's on as some reviewers noted. I don't take it off near a sleeping baby so the Velcro noise is also not a problem and its width gives a nice clean look to your backside. Perhaps that's a vanity concern but if you'd rather clean lines on your backside instead of dangling straps get the original 360. Also the cotton fabric is nice and soft. I'm petite and the 360 which is less bulky than the original fits nicely. I also like the seat as it seems more supportive than most other carriers I've seen. Expensive but happy with this carrier as it's the most comfortable I've found.
