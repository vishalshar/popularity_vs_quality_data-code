My daughter cluster feeds from 10pm to 4am every night (started at 3 weeks old)  That's 6 straight hours where she takes a sip, take a break for a couple of minutes, and then goes again.  Pediatrician said there's nothing to be done - she's having tummy issues and she'll outgrow it eventually - maybe about 12 weeks (she's 7 weeks now).I have to pump and bottle feed for the evenings, because I can't have her on my breast for 6 hours straight without getting physically destroyed.This pillow is amazing.  It holds the bottle right there, but she can still pull off and turn her head away.  So it doesn't just shove it down her throat, but it's right there where she can easily latch on and start sucking.For anyone who wants to say something like this is bad parenting ...  I'll tell you what causes bad parenting -- sitting with a bottle (or breast) for 6 hours straight with no chance to go to the bathroom or get up.  This pillow has given me some sanity back.  I don't just put her down with it and come back in 6 hours, but it does mean I can take a 15 minute break - even if I'm sitting right there, at least I can use my hands and maybe read a book or write an email during the 6 hour feeding marathon.  I love my daughter more than anything, and I'd die for her in a heartbeat, and if I had to hold the bottle for 6 hours straight, I would, of course.  But the chance to take a few breaks is just wonderful.Thank you, thank you.  I love you, Hands Free Bottle Holder Multi-Purpose Bib people!
