My wife and I really like this crib. The design is very nice, and it only took my Dad and I maybe an hour or so to put it all together. I wish the mattress base was lever adjustable, but it's nothing the wrench that came with the crib and an extra set of hands won't fix. The highest setting (there are 3 total) is what we'll be using for our baby boy when he comes in September. At that height it seems like it will be quite easy to lean over and pick him up. The wood wasn't chipped or beaten up during the shipping process, so that was a plus (the wood is a little on the soft side, so I was surprised that it wasn't damaged). I wish some bolt covers came with the crib, but again,it's not anything that would keep me from buying this particular crib (they're not expensive grab from any store that carries furniture). Overall the crib has a classy look and finish, and we're very happy with it.
