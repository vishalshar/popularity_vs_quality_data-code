I had bought the kidco sliding door locks that have these dimensions: Product Dimensions: 12 x 10 x 3 inches and used them on the house we lived in prior to the recent move we just had - the problem with it was the wing span was so short that you had to have sliding doors that were tightly together so we had to put a wood chip on the door to lift it higher to work well. We were aware of this because we read the porduct dimensions, but there were no other good options. However, after awhile the plastic became weak from pressing on the edges to open the doors and broke at the bend, since it was just a bend - not hinged.We moved into this new house and the sliding doors were on top railings, not both top and bottom ones. In otherwords our little ones can push on the bottom of the doors and they push inwards of the closet and of course slide them open with out a locking device. I did my research and choose this product and thankfully it works wonderfully! The wings are a lot longer and they are hinged so you can press on them and not worry to much about them breaking (since they are hinged, not just bent) we placed them at the top of the sliding doors and the girls cant slide the closet open. Now the girls stay out - so it works like it should!Installation: easyWorks: yeskid safe: yesWould I buy again if needed: absolutely!Suggestions: make sure the area is smooth, cleaned and free of dirt etc.. before installing. I recommend using rubbing alcohol on the area you plan on placing this on.It can break off if not installed correctly and/or there is a lot of abuse to it, such as: constant hard yanking, jerking and slamming to get the doors open. If you feel that will be the case, maybe look for a more perminate solution.
