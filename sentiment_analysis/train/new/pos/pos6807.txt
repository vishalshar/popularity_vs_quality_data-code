My daughter likes to tote things around and put her toys in boxes, bags, etc.  I decided that she should have a purse since this could combine her two favorite interests.  While it is not her favorite toy, she does play with it quite often and I think it has some staying power.  I very much appreciate the fact that the opening is easy for little hands to reach inside; some of the purses out there create a lot of frustration for small kids because putting their hands in to take something out can be a challenge.  This is designed so that it is easy to see what is inside the purse and easy to take things out/put things in.  The items that come with the purse are adorable - crinkle play money, a mirror, a phone and a key.  The little chime on the bow is an added bonus.  If you are looking for a toy purse for a toddler, I think this is a great product.
