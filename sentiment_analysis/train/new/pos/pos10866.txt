our son loves having the different size and weight balls to chase around. the red ball (and smaller yellow one) is a smoother, heavier plastic while the blue one (and smaller green) is lighter weight with slightly sharper nubs. the size is perfect. we purchased these when our son was 10m and he could only push the bigger balls, used both hands to throw the smaller ones. now at 14m he uses both hands on the big ones and prefers to lob them around. he can use one hand and throw the smaller ones now, he giggles and chants "ba ba ba" as he chucks all four around the room. this 4 ball pack is totally worth every penny in our household.
