My wife and I recently had twins in April.  We ordered two of these and now have the finished product hanging in the nursery above the children's cribs; each has a photo of the day we brought them home from the hospital.The product arrived as advertised, the packaging and the instructions were clear and simple.  The few tips I would note are these:1.  When rolling out the clay, it is best to get it smooth.  The first time I did this the clay was a little on the dry side and when I rolled it out it had a lot of texture to it which took away (a little) from the final product.  I added a little water (as the instructions suggest) after I had rolled out the remaining clay and then smoothed out the surface.  This left a smooth surface for impressions that had a superior look and feel.2.  If you are getting the impressions from an infant - GET HELP!  Have one person hold the baby and the other maneuver the hand or foot into the clay.  You can do this on your own but it is very challenging.  I tried this out by myself and it turned out OK, when I did the second set my wife assisted and the impressions were much better as each of us was concentrating on only one thing.3.  The clay shrinks a little bit when drying so make sure you roll it all the way out.  If you're not comfortable with the amount of movement in the clay, a little Elmers glue goes a long way to create a secure fit.A great keepsake and a wonderful gift.
