This lil Dinky Dragon costume by InCharacter is so adorable! I had high hopes for my 4 yr old, who still wears sz 4T, that this Toddler Size MEDIUM (4T) would fit great. But sadly, it was just too tight all over and a tad short in the length. The head piece was way too small to even velcro & fasten. And its a bummer they don't make this cute costume in kid's sizes, just baby & toddler. The fabric is nice and soft, adorable overall design. The wings do not stand up as they do in the photo though, they just kind of hang there as there is no wire in them. We didn't mind that though, they still looked great. Overall, very cute costume set for kids UNDER size 4T.And the reason I stress the sizing, is that the WORST part of the whole deal is the Return Policy of '7th Avenue Store' who sells this on Amazon. The customer has to pay the return shipping, PLUS they take a 20% restocking fee off your return amount. What a RIP-OFF! Mostly by a costume store.....most others offer free shipping & returns as they understand all costumes fit so differently, except for these guys. So be 100% sure you are purchasing the size you need before ordering.....with kids, this is nearly impossibly to do. How disappointing!
