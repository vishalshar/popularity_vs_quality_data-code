These cameras..... WORK GREAT!!! For everyone that gives these a bad review, they are using them without a base monitor. YOU NEED THE BASE MONITOR in order for this camera to function as a "BABY MONITOR" If not you are just using it as a "spot check" camera. When using through a smart phone or on a computer, the app/site does time out as all expected on a smart phone or computer. I am surprised at the many people who don't understand this. In order to CONTINUOUSLY monitor you must have the summer monitoring base and not just the camera and an iPhone. The camera works great. If is very clear and easy to zoom and scan the room. It is quiet and mine is still going strong 2 years later. I really love this camera and have ordered several for different rooms in my home as toddlers are everywhere!! I highly recommend this product as some one who has used it for two years!
