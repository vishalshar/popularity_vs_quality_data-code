This SET is my favorite for feeding my baby!!!  Here is why:1.  During the "baby cereal" stages it was perfect because when the cereal gets runny the spoon is designed with a little bit of a ladle and can still hold the liquid~ great for soups too! (sorry Munchkin soft tips~ I love these spoons but they are horrible when the cereal gets runny!)2.  The spoon size is perfect for little hands (probably 6 to 18+ months). They are a little smaller than toddler silverware- I have a set of the Nuby spoon and fork set which are significantly more bulky for my 12 month old3.  The bowl has a great design, making it easy to feed from and let little ones get food out of with hand and/or utensils!+++++ Company has terrific customer service!!!  +++++++TERRIFIC NEWS: SPOON AND FORK SETS will be sold soon~ available this SUMMER!!!
