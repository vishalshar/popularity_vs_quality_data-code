These bags are great.  We use them in the nursery and just put the box in a little basket within the changing table.  Quantity of bags is great and the size of each bag is good, not too small and not too big.  We usually put 3 newborn diapers in a bag before we toss it and they fit just fine.  The bags smell good too but not overpowering.  Great product.  Rating 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the price was a little lower - they're worth the cost though.** UPDATE ON 1/11/2013 (ORIGINAL POST WAS FROM 9/20/2012) **So I said in my original review that I wish the price was a little lower.  I don't think I care so much anymore.  I've been using that same box since 9/20 and it's now 1/11.  I still get about 3-4 wet diapers in per bag.  If the diaper is a #2 then I usually just put it in a new bag and toss it.  It's like the never-ending box of bags.  I've just ordered my 2nd box.  I hope this helps anyone out there wondering how long the box will last.
