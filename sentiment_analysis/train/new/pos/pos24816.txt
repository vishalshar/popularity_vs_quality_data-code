We bought two of these shortly after our baby was born having read good reviews on Amazon. She is turning three years old now. We are ordering more as we still use this all the time. I decided to write a review after two years of using this product. I always feel bad for the babies who are crying because they can't breath through their noses.This was the most useful item ever. There is a trick to this. I use a lot of sucking force on it in one breath and always manage to clear out the phlegm completely and the little one recovers from runny noses in just a few days. My husband has trouble clearing the boogies completely because he uses too little force. You also have to level the tube in a way that will not cause it to backflow (aka science lab tube experiments- how water flows from higher to lower level through a tube). I have not tried the other nasal aspirators except the one from the hospital (which does not work at all!).
