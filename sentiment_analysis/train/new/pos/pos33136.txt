This is a good product but I do have a small complaint or two. Normally, on these types of screen protectors there are some extra stick-cling pieces that look like post-it page markers almost. The purpose it so that after you apply the screen protector, you can find the few dust speckles that stayed attached to your device. I had to waste one of these when I could have had an extra for next time, because this doesn't have those stick-cling pieces to grab the dust specks after application of the screen protector. Next time I'll probably go with Mr. Shield, though I don't even know if they make a screen protector for this device. Long story short, I'm displeased to have an imperfection because of the lack of a small, integral piece of the screen protector application process.
