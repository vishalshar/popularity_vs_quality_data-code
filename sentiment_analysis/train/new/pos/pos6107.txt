My baby absolutely loves this little pink chair! The material of the seat is very soft and the pillow is so cushiony and comfortable. It is very well made and really beautiful, such pretty colors and perfectly girly. We've used it since the day we brought her home from the hospital and she's now nearly four months old and it's still her favorite place to be. She naps in it during the day (she won't nap in her crib, only in this chair!) and when she's awake she plays for the longest time in it. She loves the vibration feature too which I wasn't sure about when I first got it, I almost didn't bother putting batteries in but I'm glad I did because she definitely finds it very soothing. This was especially useful in the beginning as she had colic for the first couple of months and this was one of the only things that helped calm her. The toy bar didn't really interest her until a couple weeks ago but now she's taken an interest in it and grabs at the toy bugs and crinkles their wings, she likes the noise it makes. The only slightly negative thing is that the flower that plays music plays the most annoying song ever and naturally my baby for some reason loves this. Also, it only plays for a very short time (less then a minute) so I need to keep pulling it for her since she can't do it yet herself. However, it certainly doesn't detract from how wonderful this chair is. You can bounce it with one foot whilst your doing other things and now that she's bigger she can get herself really bouncing well when she starts kicking like crazy, which delights her! Overall, the best buy I got for my baby. I'd buy this over and over again and I don't know how we'd manage without it. Highly recommend!!
