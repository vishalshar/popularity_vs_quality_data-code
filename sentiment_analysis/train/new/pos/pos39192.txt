We had the Summer Infant Safe Sight in our toddlers room and purchased this extra camera to put in our infants room.We have tried other products and other camera systems from Summer Infant, but expereinced problems.  Most things that we encountered with other products was the monitor's battery would not last more than an hour or two when on scan or displaying multiple cameras.  This has not been a problem with this product.We connected it to the monitor with no problem.  The zoom in and out feature works great.The only difference I have noticed is the night vision is not as clear as it is with the camera that originally came with the monitor.It works great, I just noticed the original camera is a touch clearer during night vision.I would recommend this product to anyone.We use it to watch both children at night.  We entertain alot and most of our friends have toddlers as well.  We use the monitor a lot to monitor all the kids when playing in our toddler's room.
