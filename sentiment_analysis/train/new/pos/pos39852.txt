I use the diva cup and these pads exclusively now for my period.  When used for just catching the slight leaks that occur, or for a short while whilst washing the cup out, these perform beautifully.  I've never had a problem with leakage, even when it got flipped upside down and I only had one layer of fabric over the waterproof blue liner.  I don't generally have a problem with them moving if I am wearing bikini underwear, the day they flipped I was wearing a thong, which isn't the proper choice for these.  My only concern is that they don't seem to stain release well, as they have all gotten a slight brown tinge in spots that took the most damage.  If glistening white cotton is what you want, you need to wash them well IMMEDIATELY after taking them off.  I'm very regular, starting on a Sunday and going until Thursday, so I have six of these (two sets) that I wear Saturday through Friday, putting a clean one on in the morning with my underwear.  Then I wash them on Sunday with my other laundry, and have never had a problem with them staining my clothes.  If for any reason I can't just chuck it into the laundry bin, they have a really nice way to fold up if you fold the non-snap ends in first.  I do that to carry a clean one with me at all times, just in case, and it is much nicer to carry around than tampons or pads.  I've had these for nearly a year now (but just bought the second set) and the first ones are just as good as the second ones are, so they should last for a long time.
