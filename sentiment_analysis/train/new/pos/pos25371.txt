I ordered these to go with a new Cradle Mattress that I bought at the same time for a Jenny Lind Cradle that my Son slept in over 24 years ago so his son my new Grandson could sleep in the same Cradle is Daddy did all those years ago. This set of Luvable Friends Sheets fit perfect for the mattress I ordered.This is for a cradle not a crib and measures Measures 18" x 36". It fits a standard cradle mattress. It is  machine washable. I washed it in hot water and dried it on normal setting with no problems at all.It's made of 100% cotton and is super soft. It also has elastic stretch corners that fit great to keep the sheet secure. The sheet reminds me of at-shirt material. I thin it just gets softer and softer with each wash.I liked these and wanted to buy another one but it is currently unavailable and I am hoping they offer them again soon on Amazon.
