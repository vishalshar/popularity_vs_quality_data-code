I didn't appreciate how good this warmer was until I tried another one recommended by a friend. The other warmer was "The First Years Night&Day Bottle Warmer System" which steams the bottles. I think this warmer is dangerous!! The steam rising out of it was very hot and the bottles and particularly the nipple rings got so hot I burnt my fingers more than once! And then of course I was afraid my baby would grab it. Also, the first couple of times I used it the bottle tops flew off like champagne corks, so I had to remember to take them off first!The Avent warmer heats the bottle immersed in water. It works well if you fill the water to the top of the milk/formula level in the bottle. When the indicator light goes off I take the bottle out, shake it and put it back in. The second time the light goes out it is usually ready - about 4-5 mins. The bottle itself gets warm but not hot so you have no problem holding it. It is a perfect fit for the 5-6oz bottles. I only wish it was a little taller for the 9oz bottles. I would definitely recommend it as a quick and safe way to heat your baby's bottles.
