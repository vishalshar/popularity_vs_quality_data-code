Not sure why but I was expecting this to be the size of a "Barbie" doll. Well, it wasn't. In fact it was larger than a "Barbie" doll. Sheldon is 16 inches tall with a soft cloth body. The head, arms (from the elbow to the hand) and foot (including his crew socks) are plastic. He does look like Sheldon but I've seen other dolls that resemble him more closely (referring more to the facial features and shape of the head).There are velcro fasteners on the back of his shirt as well as a slot on his back so that you can replace the batteries if needed.The head is a one piece unit with the neck extending to a "front/back" plate that attaches to the body. Therefore his head does not swivel. The hands and feel swivel though.  Other than that (the head ) the posable body is very flexible and allows me to position him freely, however I like. This is great as it allows more options in displaying Sheldon.The voice IS Sheldon (well, it sounds just like him, anyway). It would be nice if some of the other characters (especially Amy) were available as well.I think that any Big Bang Theory fan would enjoy this doll as much as I do.
