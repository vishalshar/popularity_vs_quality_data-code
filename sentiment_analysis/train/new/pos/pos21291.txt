We bought this tub for a trip to Hawaii when my daughter was 11 months. It was perfect for our trip- easy to inflate and perfect size for the suitcase. It fit our daughter who is about 20 pounds perfectly.  I recommend for travel, but it might be small for everyday use though.  I also purchased the regular size snug tub for our home use.
