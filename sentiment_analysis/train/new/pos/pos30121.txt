The material these are made out of are very soft, colors are very bright. I waited to write the review until I had a chance to wash them a few times and see how they looked. They stayed nice and bright. I love the dual sided pillow case. I do really wish that this set came with a flat sheet as it is spring and too hot for a blanket but still too cold not to cover up at all!
