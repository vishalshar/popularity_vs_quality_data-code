I am very impressed with the quality of this dresser. We chose this dresser for our 4 year old daughter after searching for a very long time. We wanted a white dresser, with deep enough drawers to hold all of my daughter's clothes, with space below it for a power strip (to power my daughter's fish tank and lamp), and we didn't want it to be so high that she might be tempted to try and "climb" to get items off of the top.This dresser fit the bill perfectly. It was fairly easy to assemble (though my husband and I are a bit nerdy that we enjoy assembling furniture!), and the pieces are all very thick, heavy, high quality wood.One item to note: the knobs that came with this dresser were painted white, however the paint was not even and some of the natural wood showed through - on all SIX of them! This didn't bother me in the least because I had already ordered other knobs to put on the dresser to break up the monotony of the white (Best Quality Dresser Knobs (Girlss Dresserz frame) Knob (Set of 6 frame) By Olive Kids By Olive Kids).All in all, I'm very satisfied with this dresser and I know this will be with us for many years to come!
