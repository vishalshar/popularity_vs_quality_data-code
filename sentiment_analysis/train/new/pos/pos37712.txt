When we bought this bag, we had my husband in mind.  We wanted a bag that he would feel comfortable lugging around - and he does.  But something that we didn't think about was ME!  I love being able to put the backpack on and have BOTH hands to carry my 2-month old baby in her infant carrier and take care of her needs.  I am able to fit 6 diapers (size 1), 2 change of outifts, wipe case, 2-bottle thermal case & third bottle on the outside, diaper rash ointment, extra pacifiers, other medicines, a blanket and STILL have room for more stuff!  The biggest drawback to this bag is that it does not fit easily in the stroller basket.  This really isn't a big deal since I like to use that for my shopping bags anyway - and usually have the backpack on my back.  This is not the perfect bag, but let's face it ... there is nothing in the world that will hold all the baby stuff you need it to hold, and still be compact !  The laws of physics just can't handle that request !!
