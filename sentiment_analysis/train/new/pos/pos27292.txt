I got this for our RV.  We have bunk beds that we use to store camping equipment on in our RV.  But, my stuff is put on the bottom bunk and every time I bent down to get something a bit back on the bunk I would bang my head as I went to stand up. OK aside from the fact I am perhaps clumsy I will say I have a disability so sometimes I am not 100% non clumsy.  Anyway, got tired of hitting my head so researched and came up with this stuff.  It works perfectly !  I put the long strip along the edge of the top bunk (the place I kept hitting my head) and presto I have a buffer and doesn't hurt nearly as much.  I gave this only a 4 star because the corner bits don't seem to have as much flexibility to put where we want. We tried to put them on the corner of the cabinets but they wouldn't stick.  They might have worked better if we were using them on a table corner or something though.
