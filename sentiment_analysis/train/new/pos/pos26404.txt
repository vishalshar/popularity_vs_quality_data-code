We have an ergo, which was much too bulky and hot for carrying the kid in the summer.  This is much lighter with the trade off of less shoulder padding.  I've been using it for morning commutes with the insert in the DC area and I haven't gotten too sweaty even in moderately muggy weather.  I do get a bit sweaty around the lower strap in the back, but I'm also carrying a back pack, so I wouldn't assign much blame to the carrier itself.  The front where the kid (the real heat source) stays fairly cool and dry.  I have not tested it in very hot weather for long though.  It meets my needs and is much easier for me to get on and off by myself than the ergo.  I find that getting it setup with help once and then just undoing the clip that holds the two shoulder straps works well.  I can slide on the shoulder straps and clip the tie and then pull down to tighten the straps without too much effort.  Takes me less than 5 minutes even with the infant insert.  I also looked at the pognae, but this was in stock so I tried it first.  I like it enough I'm not bothering with anything else.So, Pros:1. Light2. Can be done by yourself3. reasonably cool, so less sweat4. not overly girly in appearance5. pocketsMy only real complaints are:1. as a guy I don't have much padding where the kid's head is.  It would have been nice if there was some sort of padding option that attached to something.  I've been using a folded cloth diaper so the kid's head doesn't bruise my sternum and vice versa.2. As lightweight as this is, it would be great if there was someway to get it to fold up or secure to itself.  I can stuff it in a bag, but it does get a bit unwieldy with all the straps and clasps everywhere if you are trying to just carry it by itself.
