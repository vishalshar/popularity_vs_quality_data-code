I purchased 22 of these after researching and handling most of the other major cloth diaper brands on the market (fuzibuns,bum genius, etc.).  I could not be happier with my choice.  The Swaddlebees simplex all-in-one design is an amazing feat of fabric engineering!  Although more expensive than other cloth diapers I truly believe the extra cost is worth it.These fit my daughter from birth  (8lbs, 11 oz) until 14lbs (age 3 months).  During that time I had almost no leaks.  The only time I experienced leaking was when she hit 14lbs and the diapers became a too short (she is a tall baby) and simply wouldn't absorb all of her "output."  The adjustable nature of the diapers allow you to tailor them to your baby.  You can make the waist tighter but leg holes larger or vice versa depending on your baby's shape and size.Washing is fairly easy - I rinse the solids in the toilet or sink and all diapers go into the diaper genie elite (the one that doesn't turn the diapers into "sausage links,"  - just one big bag of diapers).  I then  empty the diaper genie bag into the washing machine every 2-3 days.  We used Funk N Rock ammonia bouncer as a pre-wash with Charlie's Soap for detergent and then about once every other week I use a couple tablespoons of Bac-Out to eliminate stains.  The attached soaker pad agitates out in our washing machine (brand new front loader) about 95% of the time in my experience.My only complaint was that the diapers still rubbed at her umbilical cord stump even with the snap down.  In order to avoid irritation, we used disposables with a notch cut out for about a week until the stump came off (7 days old) and then resumed using the swaddlebees.
