I adore these nursing pads. I bought them because I needed to keep my breasts warm to help produce more milk, not to absorb leakage. I hardly leak at all, so I can't speak to their absorbency, but they are incredibly soft and keep my breasts pleasantly warm. Also, my nipples do not stick to them at all like they do if I put my cotton bra back on too soon after nursing. Also, if I put lanolin on my nipples (which I would usually air dry for at least 10 min afterwards because they get so sticky), they do not stick at all.I also purchased the softline version to try, since I'm not having a problem with leaking and they're a little less expensive, but I think the original style is much better. Counterintuitively, the original (more absorbent) style is much thinner than the (less absorbent) softline style. The original style are also a bit softer. I highly recommend spending the extra few dollars for the original style.Oh, and just to confuse you, like the other reviewer I am also a 34B but I am very glad I purchased the extra-small instead of the small because these fit perfectly.
