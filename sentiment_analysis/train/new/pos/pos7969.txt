The waterproof layer (PUL) in these is completely silent, unlike the crinkly plastic in the Gerber training pants I bought at Target.The fit is great, just like Imagine AIO diapers. But they're pretty thick, making them too hard for my 2.5-year-old to push down or pull up on his own (which made potty training harder on both the toddler and his parents than it needed to be). The thickness of the materials is especially noticeable when we put on the training pants (for a car trip, for example) after many days of wearing just "regular" underwear.We never tried disposable training pants (Pull-Ups, etc.), so can't compare to them.
