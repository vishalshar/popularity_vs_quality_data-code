I wasn't sure wheter to get a formula mixer or not, because all of them are meant for powdered formulas. I wanted to mix my homemade goat milk formula. The recipie ask to put the ingredients in a blender but I was tired of washing my huge blender and making a banch of 18oz+. when in fact I only need a 6 oz. bottle per day. So I divided the ingredients in a way to make it perfect for just 6 oz. I bought small amount spoons ( a hint, dash, etc = 1/8tsp , 1/16 tsp, etc. for the dry ingredients)and droppers (for the oils) and then I would mix it in my glass baby bottle using this awesome product! WORKS GREAT , it blends evenly the oils in it! and my baby can now enjoy fresh milk at night time. (Formula makes babies fuller at night).The CONS I find is that doesn't say if it is BPA FREE! nor says if it is plastic #5 or so.But I trust Prince Lionheart. The insert would of been super perfect if it would of been 1/2 inch longer but it is just great the way it is, becauseis very powerful. When my molasses stick to the bottom of the glass bottle I use a bartender spoon to mix it with the milk, then add the rest of ingredients, then blend. Hope this review helps. If you want the recipie of my formula, let me know!I have also mixed regular commercial formula (I got a free sample at the pediatritian's office)and works great too, I would say that for this purpose deserves a 5 star. Now I bought powdered goat milk to make my formula, I am confident this product will make a great job.
