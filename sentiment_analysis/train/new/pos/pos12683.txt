Maybe you're like me, and you went through 2 or 3 fancy Aden & Anais or whatever bibs every day, and piled up a good 20 bibs that were washed every week.And then you heard about Bumkins.  And you bought some, and you realized your whole bib collection was obsolete, because a single 3-pack is all you need.  These don't need to be laundered.  Just rinse in the sink and squeeze them out after each feeding.Or maybe you're not like me and you got it right the first time.Either way - for feeding, this is the bib you need.  The cloth ones might be better for teething drool, but for messy high chair feedings, nothing beats this.
