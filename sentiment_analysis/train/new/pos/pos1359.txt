So far I've been really happy with the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer.  We'd been looking for a bouncy chair (no-frills) for when my daughter is a little older and just beginning to eat solids but at the suggestion of a friend, decided to take a look at this bouncer.  My daughter usually loves being put into the chair...it vibrates and she likes watching the bubbles and flashing lights.  I have to say I'm not a huge fan of the music (it's sort of cheesy and annoying) but obviously it's not for my benefit, my daughter doesn't seem to mind it, and anyway there are other sound options (e.g., ocean waves, rain drops) that are more calming.  While this chair is not my daughter's favorite contraption (her max toleration time is usually only about 10 minutes), it's nice to be able to put her in it for even just a short while to keep her occupied while I'm trying to take care of other brief tasks in the same room.  When my daughter is ready to start eating solids in a few months, our hope is that we can take the toy portion (with the bubbles) off, seat her in the chair and feed her.  Luckily the fabric can be removed and washed easily in the washing machine.
