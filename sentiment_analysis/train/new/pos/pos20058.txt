My specialty is in Early Childhood Education, I've been in the field for 8+ years. I am also a mother. My reviews are based on products durability, safety, and how it fosters a child developmentally.My little one (1 yr. old) is all about being independent all the time, this includes meal times. Having the right tools during a meal is a big deal, I am so happy I found this set.Pros and Noted Drawbacks:- Fat easy to grab handles, really great for little hands.- Easy to clean. Dishwasher safe.- The fork is sharp enough to stab food, but not sharp enough to cut little one.- Spoon is also well rounded. You can get a lot of food on this spoon.- Well made.- My favorite training forks/spoon set so far. Will by again.- Wish it came with a case for easy traveling.Writing reviews has become a hobby for me, and it is always exciting to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.) Also, if you have any questions, clarifications, or comments please feel free to leave a comment below. I usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 48 hours. .
