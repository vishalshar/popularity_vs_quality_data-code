This is our favorite sippy cup for the diaper bag.  It has only a few parts and cleans easily.  We haven't experienced any leaks and I like that I can see how much liquid is inside. We prefer straw-less cups and this is one of the few ones that has a cover attached over it.  The spout cover isn't super sturdy, but functions well enough to provide enough coverage to satisfy our needs.  Our toddler hasn't destroyed it yet, but your mileage may vary with your own kiddos.For those concerned about trouble sucking liquid, please check your silicone piece.  When you first get this cup, please open the pre-cut slits in both sides.  We have 2 of these cups and it was easier to find the slits in our first one than our second for some reason.  They are kid of hard to see at first.  We used the tip of a steak knife to help open it up.  Don't use the knife to cut.  Only use it to find and open the slits!  I am including a picture of me squeezing this part so you can see what the openings look like.  I hope this helps!
