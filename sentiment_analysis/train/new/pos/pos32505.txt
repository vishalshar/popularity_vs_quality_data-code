Just received it today. For $5.90 these are a steal! I am so excited for my son to start using them. Currently he is two months old and I plan to give these to him for Christmas. By then he will probably start to utilize toys like these. I would say that these aren't really for newborns as newborns sleep, eat, and poop but they are a great starter toy once they develop a little more. Very happy with them so far.
