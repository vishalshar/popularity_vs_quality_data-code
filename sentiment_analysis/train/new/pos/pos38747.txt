These washcloths are absolutely wonderful! I use them to remove makeup off my face while I shower at night and I feel like I don't even need cleanser now. The material gets everything off and is so luxuriously soft on one side and the other side is soft yet exfoliating which is perfect for sensitive face skin (and ears!). I highly recommend for women and babies!
