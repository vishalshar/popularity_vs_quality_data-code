This booster seat is just what I was looking for for my 3 year old. He is independent enough that he can get himself in and out if the seat so I didn't want something that strapped him in. It is also stable and sturdy enough with the strap that goes around the seat. The strap is very easy to tighten and should fit most kitchen or dining chairs. It is has rubber grips over the whole bottom so it shouldn't scratch a chair. I live that there are no grooves on the chairs surface for food crumbs to get caught in. I also love that the chair isn't bright colors with smiling animals all over it. It is subdued and beautifully designed in a way that makes it visually appealing and doesn't detract from decor. The height of the booster is also great. Really, there aren't enough good things I can say about this booster. I was skeptical at first to spend this much money when others are cheaper, but I'm glad I went with this, as I think this will be the only booster we need. (Before using this booster, we put my son in the high chair without the tray at a lowered height and would push it up to the table).
