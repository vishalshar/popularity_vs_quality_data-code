My son and I love this mobile, actually, everyone who sees it loves it! It is perfect.I have to say, when I first took it out of the box I was ready to pack it up and send it back. It looked cheap to me, and for the cost, I was greatly disappointed ... but then I put the batteries in and it came alive! My son was so in awe of this, and still is after five months. It is just beautiful! The sound quality is nice, there are two volume settings and multiple songs/sounds, and the little clicking bugs that move around in the lighted blue water are very soothing when he is sleepy yet seemingly thought provoking to him when he is awake! lol He loves it!I read someone's review saying it was too loud, and if you are the type of parent that will be tip-toeing around when baby falls asleep then this may not be for you, the clicking may bother you! I, however, make sure to maintain livable noise in the house lol I want the baby to be use to noise and he is, sleeps through mostly everything. I do laundry, vacuum, dishes, and have three dogs, You have to continue living, babies adjust/adapt : )Love this!!!
