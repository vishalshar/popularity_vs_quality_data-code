Love the pattern! I have been looking for my little girls bedding for months now I wanted something different not the same as every nursery in town has but didn't want to spend an arm and a leg! This is my 3rd baby and I spent 170 to 200 dollars on my first 2 childrens bedding! The comforter is lighter then my first 2 children's comforters but to be honest they out grow those with in a year and then it takes two blankets to cover them lenth wise! So glad I found this for such a good price! I don't agree with other remarks about it being cheaply made it's just simply a lighter bedding, No different then buying a down comforter and choosing your warmth! You would certain have to use another blanket under it during the winter months but so do my other children with the thicker ones! Love the bumber and the brown color in the bedding is not as dark chocolate as it looks in the picture was happy about that! so over all good set for the price and a beautiful pattern!
