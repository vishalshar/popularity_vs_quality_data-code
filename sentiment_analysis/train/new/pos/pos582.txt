My baby loves anything that lights up. I've been having trouble finding something that lights up and is safe and easy for her to chew on.PROS* My baby really likes this toy.* It's safe for her to chew on.* The light is visible day or night.* It's sturdy and I don't expect it to break under normal wear and tear.* Baby can spin the orbs or chew on the toy or just repetitively hit it on the floor.CONS* I'm not convinced this should cost more than $5, but the market for chewable light up toys is slim.* The light only stays on for 5 seconds, not enough time for my wee babe that's too young to understand cause/effect (hit it to make it light up again).
