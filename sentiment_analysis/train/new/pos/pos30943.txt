This lock is working well for me to keep my child from accidentally opening a basement door. There are some things to keep in mind, though.One, put this high. I just found out today that my two-year-old knows how to open it. I was holding him near the door to see if he could figure it out and he did. It's very easy to unlock this clasp, as you just have to push the plate slightly up while pulling it towards you. If a child can use a chair or something else to reach it, they could beat it. There's nothing he can move in my house that will let him even get close to reaching mine, though.Two, the screws that come with the product are junk, as has been stated. Even with little torque, mine both were eaten by the drill bit. I put two of my own in without a problem, though. Remember to keep the tiny little screw, though, if you ever want to permanently unlock the product. Me, I'll just remove it when it no longer serves a function, but it's good to have the option in case you need to leave it in place but don't want to bother with it all the time.Three, make your install easy. Close the door you're putting it on, hold it in place in the locked position, then open your door, put the lock up and screw it in. You'll want to actually see it in place before attaching it because if the plate can't lock into position, you'll have to take it down and screw it in all over again.So far, I'm glad I've gotten this rather than the plastic "globes" you put over doorknobs. When I first put this on, I forgot about it and tried opening the door and it stopped me. At that point, just to see, I tried opening it with more pressure and it held. Looks like it'll stop my kid even if he really tries to open the door.UPDATE April 12, 2012:I'm buying a second one tonight for my front door. This has worked out well for these past few months and kept the little one from being able to open the door to the basement, but he's now able to open the front door, so one is going there as well.
