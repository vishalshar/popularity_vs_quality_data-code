This is a basic walker and a great deal for the price.  My son loved the toys on the tray and the push behind feature.  In order to raise the seat (for a long legged baby) there's just a strap that tightens similar to those on booster seats.  It would be nice if it would go a bit higher, but my son has longer legs than most babies and I'm sure it would be fine for most.  We didn't have any problem with toes catching under the product like other reviews mentioned.  This folds up nicely for storage.  The seat was a little hard to get snapped in, but I just pushed on the prongs that are on the seat with a butter knife and they snapped in fine.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's just so basic, but that's what you pay for and also because it will not accommodate a tall baby for too long..  We have thoroughly enjoyed it.
