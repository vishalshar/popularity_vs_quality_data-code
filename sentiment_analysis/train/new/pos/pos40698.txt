My kiddo is 8 months old, but is completely off the growth charts. Our older standard-sized Graco was starting to seem cramped. The Joovy is a wonderfully roomy size for Baby to play safely. We leave it set up on our main floor so she can see me in the kitchen. She is crawling and starting to pull herself up on furniture, but she is happy in this playard and since its pretty big I don't feel guilty confining her to it when I'm busy. Occasionally I move it downstairs to the family room. Now that I've got it figured out how to fold and move it, it's fairly easy, just a bit awkward because of it's size and it's weight (I'm 5'8", it might be a greater challenge to shorter mommies.) We've traveled with it quite a bit and it's worked well staying in hotels as well as visiting friends and family, sometimes you just have to get creative finding room for it. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase and would recommend it for bigger babies and daily users.
