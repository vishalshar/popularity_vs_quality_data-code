I finally found a car seat to fit the Porsche 911 (991) back seat. This was the fourth one I purchased and tried and all the others were too wide at the base or too wide at the headrest. This includes the Porsche Booster which does not fit the 991 back seat. You heard correct, I went to the Porsche dealership and everyone was shocked the Porsche booster did not fit in the back seat.Thanks Maxi Cosi for making a seat that is slim and functional.
