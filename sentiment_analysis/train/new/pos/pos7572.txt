I love this bag!  I bought it because this is my 4th child but 1st boy and since my other kids are older and I haven't needed a diaper bag for a few years I wanted something that was functional but didn't look like a diaper bag.  This totally fits the bill, it has enough space for everything, but still looks great.  I love the accessory bags the smallest one holds my cc and id and I can grab just that if I'm going somewhere w/out the baby.  Also, I spilled coffee on it last week and it wiped right off w/out a problem.  Would defintely recommend to the on the go mom who still wants to stay in style!
