This is a great travel system because its VERY light compared to other systems and the car seat goes up to 35 lbs.!  The colors are lime green and brown (a bit brighter in person~and trendy for mom) and the fabric is soft yet easy to wipe clean.  The size of the system is also great for small cars (we have a Honda Civic).  Also, when the stroller is folded up, it is so much smaller than other ones I've seen.  To me, this makes sense over the Graco 32 and 35 Snugrides because it is less money, not nearly as bulky (stroller and carseat are lighter and more narrow), and the fabric can be wiped up right away (plus, its really cute).  The basket under the stroller is plenty big, and the cup holders are always nice.  I also like how the car seat handle is shaped.  It is curved so you can fit it nicely in that nitch by your elbow, and the actual handle isn't so wide making it really easy to get a good, comfortable grip on it.  As far as putting it together, the wheels were a little tricky, but no big deal if you have standard tools. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone.  Its a newer product, but I can't find anything to complain about.  Its awesome!  And I'm a really picky person!
