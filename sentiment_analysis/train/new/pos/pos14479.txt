Just got him in the mail today and my 8 week old is already clutching him! This is a great alternative to the usual hard rattles out there. I think its a much safer way to introduce a rattle for my little girl & feel better knowing that while she is discovering how to shake him it wont clonk her in the head like the plastic ones usually do. The contrasting colors are great and she is already trying to put his little tag tail in her mouth. I love the expression on the zebra's face, it looks like he is about to take off running, very cute! Also the back of the rattle is a pretty purple color so visually stimulating. He also makes a crinkling sound when she grabs him. Not sure why the description says panda when he is clearly a zebra LOL!
