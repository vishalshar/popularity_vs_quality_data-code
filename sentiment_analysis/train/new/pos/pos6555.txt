I didn't think this would be a 'necessity' for our little one, but have quickly found just how useful this basket really is!  It holds quite a bit. The perfect amount of essentials! I use mine for diapers on the left, the wipe box in the middle, and a burp cloth, pacifier, diaper cream and a toy on the right with even a bit of room to spare!  I also love the soft, but sturdy handle and the waffle texture!  So happy I made this purchase!
