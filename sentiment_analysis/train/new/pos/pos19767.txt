My son picked this out for his baby sister. We love that it is easy for babies to start the music/lights; just a bump with your hand will get it going. It's not too loud either which is VERY nice. Sometimes it is started by us just walking thru the room, which is fun now that 'baby sister' can walk. AND IT HAS AN OFF SWITCH, I can't over state how nice that is. We also have tied it to our car headrests for long trips. I wish the music would play a little longer... But otherwise we love it!
