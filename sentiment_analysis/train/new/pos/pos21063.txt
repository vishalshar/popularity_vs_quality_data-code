This is a must have product if you have toddlers! The days of juice soaked clothes, tables and floors is behind our family. As a mom of 3 toddlers ages 4 and under, this product is a staple for our family. Whenever my kids get juice boxes or bags, they get served in the buddy holder. The juice boxes and bags are a simple fit in the holder and my toddlers can grip the holder and easily use it to drink their juice without making a mess and squeezing juice everywhere. The holders easily fit in a diaper bag to take when we are out of the house. I always get compliments and questions from other moms about what a great idea they are. An ewesome juice box and bag holder!
