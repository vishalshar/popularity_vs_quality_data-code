I own 4 packs of these wipes. I had a hard time finding 100% organic cotton wipes & was pleased to find these on Amazon. I think they are very reasonably priced given that they are 100% organic cotton.They are very soft on my baby's bum. I make a homemade wipe solution with: 2 cups of water, 2 tablespoons of Dr. Bronner - Organic Castile Soap Unscented Baby-Mild, 32 fl oz liquid, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, 4 drops of tea tree oil, and 2 drops of lavender oil.I fold the wipes in half and stack them into Prince Lionheart Warmies Wipes WarmerI've been able to use one wipe to fully clean my exclusively breastfed baby. So far the wipes have been holding up well and I think they will last until our daughter is potty trained.
