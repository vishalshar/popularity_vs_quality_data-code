This set is absolutely GORGEOUS!! The blanket is not to silky, the bumper is one piece that wraps in stead of four individual pieces. The diaper bag is doable for twins but I bought two sets so I have two diaper bags :) The pillow is thin and can be easily placed at the foot of bed or easily storable until toddler age. I put the toy bag and stacker at each end of the crib which worked out beautifully. The gold is beautiful on the sheet and the skirt was very easy to put on and doesn't move to much.
