My 15 month old daughter loves her new bed! I love it too. I can choose weather or not I want both "nighttime safety bars" on or not, it is low to the ground so I don't worry about her falling, and I put her playpen around the bed so that she can crawl out in the mornings & play with her toys until I wake up. For the price, it looks lovely after it's put together. Very happy with my purchase.
