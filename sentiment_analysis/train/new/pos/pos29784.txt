This is my first review so hopefully it helps.  I wanted to start by saying the manufactures review above is for the wrong bag.  The bag they are talking about is the smaller Baby Bjorn clamshell bag.  This Dynamic bag does not come with the thermal bottle holder but it does come with a great changing pad. We recieved this bag today and couldn't be happier.  Yes, it is a bigger bag than most diaper bags, but if you like bigger bags like myself it's perfect!  The changing station it comes with is the best i've seen out of all the diaper bags I looked at (and I did my homework).  Its bigger than most changing pads but it has two zip pockets for wipes, lotion or whatever you need.  It also has a small pillow for baby's head.  Its a great thing to carry by itself for short trips if you dont need the whole bag. Or if your going to grandparents or somewhere where you dont need the changing pad the extra space is great for extra outfits for yourself or baby.  Next thing we loved and didn't realize when we bought it was that to turn it into a backpack (which my husband prefers)all you do is pull the tote strap and your done!  No extra straps to lug around!  So you can carry it by the handle, tote style (which I prefer) or backpack.  The parents side of the bag is also great because you can unzip it and it expands just in case you need more room.  I agree that im not sure if some of the small pockets are neccessary, but all and all its very well made, not heavy for its size (which we were afraid it might be) and very stylish specialy if you have the matching Baby Bjorn carrier.  We are very pleased and can't wait till our little girl is here so we can fill it all up!
