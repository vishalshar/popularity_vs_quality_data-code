I was really at a loss as to toddler proofing our 3rd floor windows. The windows are extremely wide. Several adults could fit through the window let alone a curious toddler. Since the windows are so big most of the security options would not work - screens would be too small and block the view. I even considered installing a child gate but that would make her room look like a jail. I also considered just having the wooden dowels but there is nothing to stop her walking away with it.Then I saw the Super Stoppers on Amazon and thought "that's it!". I ordered 2 to start and they worked really well. Once installed I gave it several really hard pushes to force the window. It didn't budge!
