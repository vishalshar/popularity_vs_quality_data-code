I agree with some of the other reviews of this product.First I would like to say this is a great car seat, it's lightweight and the base makes it incredibly easy to install.  The color is neutral which was one of the reasons I chose it and the seat its self appears to be comfortable and is soft to the touch.That being said, the flaws are not deal breakers but they are annoyances.  I have had this product for almost 6 months and I have had a problem with the car seat not unlatching from the base numerous times. Not a huge deal, it just always seems to happen when my baby is sleeping or I am in a hurry.The second problem is the head rest, its not attached so when your child is not in the car seat it falls down. This has only been an issue when my child is fighting me to be strapped in.Other than those two issues I love this car seat and I would buy another if something were to happen to this one.
