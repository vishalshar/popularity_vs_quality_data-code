Adorable with a capital A! I purchased this item to go with a Christening gift and it is simply perfect! Just the right size for a tiny hand and makes a gently sweet rattling sound. The quirkiness in me registered that this rattle is "pun intended" The Lamb of God. =) It has a beautifully embroidered silver cross on it and the Mom of the child it was given to had this rattle blessed by her Priest. It is a lovely Christening item!
