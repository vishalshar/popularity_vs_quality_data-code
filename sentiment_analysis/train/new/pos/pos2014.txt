The person who came up with this is a genius.  With that being said, the design needs a little work.I am a claims adjuster and drive a company van with no adjustable seatbelt.  It's clearly meant for 6 ft men to drive this van and not a 5'7 female.  I bought this clip because the seatbelt was choking me and riding up to where it was so uncomfortable.  I read the reviews and at the price, just thought I would give it a try.I had no problem with the instructions.  It's a simple enough design and I was able to figure it out right away.I installed it and when I was sitting perfectly still it was great.  If I moved at all (like to adjust the radio) it would slide out of position.  I find that I do have to keep putting it back under the loop part a couple of times in one drive.  It's not such a problem that I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, but it does get to be a hassle on a long drive.  Like I said, if you sit still in the seat it's great.The clip itself never popped off the bottom seatbelt like one of the other reviewers said.  It's just that the top strap won't always stay under the loop thing.  It's not such a flaw that I don't use it every day.I give it 4 stars because it's easy to install and the premise is great.I would recommend it to a friend and have done so.  I just told her you have to fiddle with it a lot each time you drive.
