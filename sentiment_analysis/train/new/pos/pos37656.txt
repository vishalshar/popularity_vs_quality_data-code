After reading all the other reviews I was definately nervous about this product. It says that it is good quality but very difficult to put together. I would have to disagree completely. My husband put it together while I handed him all the correct pieces and together we got it done in about 45 minutes. It is made of good wood and is nice and sturdy. It looks beautiful once it is put together. It also arrived to us within 4 days which is amazing. We had no trouble with the instructions but I can see how others did. They are picture instructions, as most things are, and some of the pictures don't explain the parts very well. My suggestion is to look at the parts page and organize all the pieces according to that so when you are ready to build it you know what goes where. I also suggest that you buy this product and try it out for yourself before deciding not to buy just because of the reviews.
