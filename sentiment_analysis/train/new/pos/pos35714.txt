This product is clearly not designed to keep babies in a pack n play, or pets out. However, if you're looking to keep your little one shaded in the hot sun, it really can't be beat. We used it for a week at the beach with our 1 year-old old son. The brackets that attach to the front of your pack-n-play to hold the canopy in place are kind of difficult to install, but they don't interfere with the pnp folding feature, so you only have to attach them once, and then you can forget they're there. The back of the canopy is held in place by little clips that hook onto the back bar of a pnp, and they can come undone if your baby pushes at the back of the canopy, or there's a very strong breeze. However, there are velcro ties in the back (meant to hold the sun flap in a rolled up position) and we looped those through the corners of our pnp while we were at the beach, and neither our aggressive baby nor the wind from the ocean were able to dislodge it after that!I would give the product 5 stars, except that our rod also broke. I think it's a flaw in the design, and Graco should consider using higher quality flexible rods, like those found in tents. I contacted Graco via email about the broken rod, and they sent me a new one right away. No hassles. I'm not sure how long the new rod will last, but in my mind, this product is still worth the money for occasional use. It's great to have a safe, clean spot to contain my little crawler (especially at a sandy beach!), and have the comfort of knowing he's protected from the sun and bugs!
