I was really impressed with the Ecosusi Diaper Bag. I have identical twin girls. So they have a lot of stuff that needs to travel with us on a daily basis . From clothing, to toys, to diaper creams and powders, diapers, wipes, snacks. This bag DOES come with a matching changing pad. There are 2 pockets on the front, two pockets on the side, and one in the back. The side pockets are snap, and the front pockets are Velcro. The handle straps snap together as well. Also on the back part of the bottom of this bag is an insulated section for snacks and such. There are a bunch of neat little pockets in this bag. The back pocket has two little pockets on the inside. The main zippered section of this bag has 2 pockets on the far side (if the bag is facing toward you). One pocket is mesh and the other is zipper. There is also a larger zipper pocket above those. There are also two detachable bags on the inside of the main section of this bag. One is a see through zipper type bag and the other is an insulated snack style bag. So, like I said...a lot of pockets and different sections in this bag. Which I find great for organizing. Also, the print is really pretty. I've had my bag for a few weeks now, and I have gotten one car grease like stain on the bottom of it. But, what is neat about this bag is that the stain blends right in. It isn't noticeable to anyone other than me, because I look at it all of the time. I hope that you found this review helpful. Best of luck to all of the parents out there!
