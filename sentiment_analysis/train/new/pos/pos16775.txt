My son always seemed to have a thing for tags and I had heard about Taggies before, so I search Amazon to find their products.  Lo and behold... the Taggies elephant.  My son and I both love this elephant.  It has tons of tags with various colors and designs.  The elephant has a mouse in its tummy that your baby can pull out and it will vibrate and retract back into the elephant's tummy.  The "bars" (for lack of a better word) that go around the elephant's tummy make it easy for baby to hold.The toy was a bit bigger than I was expecting - if you look at the toy in comparison to the boy in the picture it will give you a good idea, but for some reason I thought it would be smaller.  Not a problem though - it actually made it easier for my son to play with.  He absolutely loved chewing on the tags and playing with the mouse.  The toy kept him happily occupies in the car and on shopping trips.  Sometimes it was the only thing that would calm him down.I rated the "educational value" a 2 because there's no much to learn from this toy except perhaps cause and effect by pulling the mouse and having it retract.I strongly recommend this toy.  I'm actually back looking for a new one because ours has been misplaced.
