I bought this last week specifically b/c i read the poor reviews regarding it being too tall.  my son was 23 inches long at birth, so now at 8 months, is about 34" tall, the size of a small 2 year old.  i don't know why i held off on getting a walker so long, but i know that he is technically too large for all the baby sit-in toys.  but as he is not even close to crawling yet b/c he doesn't seem strong enough, i broke down thinking this will give him some independance.Anyway, at the tallest setting, he is just on his tippy-toes, so he still has room to grow into it!  i was shocked.  he LOVES it, runs around no problem on our HARDWOOD floors... i like the friction strips b/c he can't get into any other rooms b/c it won't let him over the floor bumpers, so it's great, b/c you can put him in the "baby-safe" rooms, without worrying he can sneak into an unsafe area.  i also like that with the toys on the tray (you could take it off if you want snacks or something on there) it makes it very tall so that he is not tempted to lean over and pick stuff up on the floor (at risk of toppling over since he's technically past the reccomended height, that's my biggest concern).  i have tried many ways to see if there is any danger of tipping over and it is just too sturdy.  my sister has a "normal" size walker and when i put my son in it he looks like baby huey and it is clearly not safe for him as he towers over it when standing.So long story short, it's great if you have a tall baby.  i can imagine others with average or small babies might be disappointed, but as babies are getting bigger each year (my son was 11 lbs 14oz, and i know a handful of over 9lb babies born the same time), i would hope this doesn't get discontinued for it's large size, i do think that disney should market it for larger babies though.  the only way i found out was thanks to all the user reviews!
