I am a mom in the Army and am determined to breast feed my daughter until she is at least 1 year old.  However the military lifestyle takes you away from your family often.  I learned that I was going to have to leave home for a 3 week training mission shortly after my daughter turned 3 months and I knew that I needed to find something better than my little hand pump to take with me.  I also wanted something that could run on battery power since I didn't know how much electricity I would have when I was away.This pump was EXACTLY what I was looking for.Positives:1) Discrete, the pump is incased in a nice black bag w/a shoulder strap2) Transportable3) Runs on batteries (4 C) or plugs in. Also, batteries don't run out fast, I was pumping for 30 min 2-4 times a day for 2 weeks and didn't have to replace them.4) Works efficentlyNegitives:1) Somewhat noisy, it's about as loud as a remote controlled car, but if you flip the flap shut it's pretty quiet.2) If you turn the suction up too high it may leave little hickey-like marks on your breasts, turn the suction down though and it won't do that anymore.For those women who have just started to pump, remember it takes time to get your milk supply up!  When I first started I could barely get 1oz from both breasts combined and was very frustrated.  After a month or so I was able to get 4-5 oz from each breast.  Just be patient with it!
