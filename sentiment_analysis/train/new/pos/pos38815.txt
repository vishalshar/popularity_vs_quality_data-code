I'm going to start out by saying I have three kids. A 4 year old, 2.5 year old and 9 month old. They have 9 cousins and between the 12 of them we have purchased just about every baby/child toy product. I have a boon highchair that I love, but I needed something to use for my baby when she is being watched for me at someone elses home. She was just sitting on the floor making a giant mess with her food. I looked at all of the reviewes and decided this would be the best for the price. It came very fast (like always with Amazon) and was very easy to attach to the table. I seriously think a monkey could have done it. I was worried I didn't do it right because it was too simple. After I was satisfied it was on tight I put my niece in it to test it out (my kid wasn't going in it!). She survived the experement and loved it. She was just haning out in air eating her food, all containted not taking up much space. If you live in a small appartment or dont like to collect baby 'junk' this is the chair for you. I haven't had to clean it yet but its a baby chair, its going to get dirty, the fabric seems easy to clean. Also someome in another review mentioned that it wasn't supportive and there was a bar at the back. I'm not one to bubble wrap my kids in miles of foam covered cloth (hence the boon highchair) but I think if your kid cant sit up properly it probably shouldn't be in this chair. I'm happy with the purchase and I know this is going to be shared with all the kids and used regurly. I'm very happy with my purchase!
