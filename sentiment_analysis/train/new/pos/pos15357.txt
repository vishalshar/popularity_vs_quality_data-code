Fall is here and the weather is right for those outdoor walks.  But we don't like all the critters flying around so we wanted something that would block the critters but not the fresh air and light.  We found these that fit the car seat that also attaches to the stroller and problem solved when we move him about in the car seat.  We liked them so well we ordered THESE.  The ones that cover the entire stroller for when he gets out of the car seat and sits in the stroller (like next Spring and Summer).  They are very light, yet tear resistant and the elastic bands let them fit snugly over a variety of strollers.  We bought two since the price is not bad and we wanted to make sure we had a replacement on hand in case the original gets damaged.  So far we have use the one that covers the car seat several times and it has held up great.  Do they have "critters" where you live?  If so, you probably need this!
