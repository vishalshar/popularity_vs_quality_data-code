AWESOME nap mat. We went through several different nap mats a few years back when looking for one for my son. many fell apart, the stitching and materials were lacking in quality. When we finally found him a good one it's lasted for 3 years since. This year it was time to get one for my daughter and we decided on this one. We chose well because it's a SOLID nap mat. Very comfortable soft blanket that's more than big enough. But most importantly it really stands up well to the washing machine. It gets washed weekly when it comes home from pre-school and doesn't show ANY wear at all yet! Would definitely recommend this to ANYONE looking for a good nap mat they won't have to replace every other month.
