I purchased this for my 21 month old son to use on a vacation we recently took.I did not buy this for everyday use in a car.. so  can't vouch for that.. Im not sure I would want to use it for that.My son is still rearfacing at 21 months in his Britax Advocate 70... so we don't really have issues, as his head is still very well supported if he naps while we drive. However, we were going to be flying a long distance and I was unsure if he would be able to be rearfacing on the plane. (He ended up being rearfacing, we flew Southwest, and had no difficulty installing seat on plane RF but I just wasn't sure how that'd play out)I just wanted him to have this to support his head while asleep on plane if we hit turbulance or during takeoff/landing if asleep.It did a great job of supporting his head, was just the right size. It is not a cushy pillow. At all. And the fabric is like windbreaker material almost... so I think it'd wash up well.As far as everyday use, again, I can't really say. But it worked great for the plane.I posted 3 photos of his using it on the plane.
