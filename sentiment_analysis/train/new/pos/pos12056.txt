I have used these with both of my kids. It helps to keep the car seat straps from rubbing on their neck/shoulders and provides extra support for new babies. My newborn son's head would sometimes fall forward because of the way his seat fit into our car. We could not do anything about how the base fit, but these provided enough support to keep his head back in the seat for a few weeks until he got stronger! I recommend car seat straps for kids newborn-2!
