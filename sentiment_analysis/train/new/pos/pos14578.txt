As the item arrived,I was happy to see that it was indeed large enough to fully wrap around my 7 month old baby after a cozy bath! It is a good quality towel, the hood is large enough and the towel feels soft. I would have liked the towel to be a little softer, but overall I think it is one of the best towels out there for babies and toddlers. Your baby won't outgrow it in a couple of months and that is one thing you look for when you buy a luxury towel for your child. I recommend this product.
