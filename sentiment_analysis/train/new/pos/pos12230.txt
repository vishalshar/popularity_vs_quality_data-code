I love that the sleepy wings jacket is not as restrictive as a swaddle wrap (like Swaddleme or Halo) but yet it keeps my son from flailing his arms and waking himself up while sleeping.  He is able to move his arms and touch his face in the wings (very comforting), he'll even suck on the arms sometimes.  We use it so that his arms are swaddled up, although you can use it so that your child's arms are swaddled down as well.  It is what we have been using since we transitioned him out of swaddle wraps. He is 4 1/2 months old and pretty soon we're going to work on transitioning him out of this as well. We don't use the pacifier holders although it's a good idea.  The material is very stretchy and really does grow with your child.  I only bought one so I wash is quickly and dry it on the lowest setting (it says to air dry only) but using the dryer on a low setting hasn't seemed to damage the sleepy wings.  This is an Australian product and it really should be marketed more in the US, I think people would really love it, I certainly do.  Oh and I also bought Merlins Magic Sleep Suit and it didn't work for us, this did!
