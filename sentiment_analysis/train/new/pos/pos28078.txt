Even straight out of the package this mattress cover does not properly fit a Sealy brand baby-posteurpedic type mattress ("properly" being the normal safety recommendation of fully around all sides plus two extra inches underneath). It does fit on our mattress, which is several inches deep, and has never been a concern to come off and pose a hazard.Washing on gentle cycle in cold water has not changed anything--still fits after a year and a half. We have NEVER put it into a dryer, which may be part of the problem for those who claim it fails to fit at all after laundering.I'm strongly considering purchasing a second one--just can't find anything comparable for the price that does not have plastic or vinyl components of some sort...
