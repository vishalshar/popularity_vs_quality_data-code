Okay so first off I originally purchased this bag on another site and I had to wait for 2 months to be told I had to wait another 2 because it was on back order  Boo!! I found this one on here and was jumping for joy when I got it in the mail 2 days later. I have 2 boys 2yrs and 4 months this bag helps me stay organized and has enough space to carry all the essentials this mommy on the go needs bottles, snacks, iPad, diapers, wipes, bib, burp cloth, wallet, makeup and so on. I absolutely love the strap choices from tote, to a adjustable strap to go across my chest or just over my shoulder then also being able to fasten it to my stroller (most favorite). Then my keys.... I always lose my keys in my purses (yes even with the key faster inside) but on this bag I can fasten them from the outside. It really helps when I'm heading out to my car about to load up everything. Then to put the cherry on top.... It's so cute and goes nicely with my outfits! Not your average, boring, or gaudy diaper bag.... just because I'm a mommy doesn't mean I can't look stylish. So get this bag I highly recommend it!
