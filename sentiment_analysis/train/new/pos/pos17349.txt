I absolutely love this high chair! We don't have a formal dining room, so our dinkng area does not have much space. High chairs seemed to be a poor idea with our confined space so we purchased this chair with our daughter. She used it from the time she started trying baby cereal until she was nearly 2. We finally got rid of it because the edge was tearing. Our friends chair had done the same thing and we were talking about it and she said she just called the company, let them know of the year (which hers was in the same spot) and thy replaced it for her. Since she raved about their great customer service we decided to purchase another for our son. It is so convenient and allows them to still be at the table with everyone and it takes up next to no space! Our daughter who is 3.5 is still able to sit in the chair as well and chooses to rather frequently. I believe the weight limit goes up to 37 pounds so you can get quite a bit of use from the chair. I can't say enough good things about this high chair!
