I was very eager to purchase this ever since our now 7 month old started to really jump around in his ExerSaucer.1st of all, the directions are decently written, but I definitely figured it out mostly by just looking at the pictures in the diagrams they provide.There are only a few steps to complete and then assembly is complete and you are ready to hang this and put your little one in. I've read a few reviewsabout this being dangerous, and it's not at all. Anyone who says that just did NOT put this together correctly. Everything holds very well and seems safe.Once you hang it and put your baby in, be sure to hold them more by their butt and not under their arms because I do have a tad bit of trouble to get my littleguys feet through the slots in the bottom.Overall, this is an excellent toy for your little one to start learning how to jump and move around. It's fun watching them get used to this new bouncing sensation!I will definitely buy another one for his grandmothers house where he goes for daycare!
