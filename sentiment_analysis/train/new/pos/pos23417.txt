Drawers are very handy.  My only beef is that the wood is "light" meaning that don't over-tighten as it can crack the wood.  easy to assemble.  I do wish the canvas/material that covers the drawers was a little thicker so the brown panels for the drawers is less visible to the eye (not offensive, but white should be white without a hint of brown backing).  the pad it comes with is very thin, but nice that it came with it, but we substituted with a traditional curved changing pad.  The clothes hamper is nice feature as you can just keep the clothes separated so you can wash separately vs. digging out of our clothes bin.  Stable, not easy to tip over.  We can put a sleeve of the pampers 1 or 2 on one side of a drawer and a standard plastic wipe holder on the other side and both fit so you don't have to open multiple drawers to change.  But overall, baby loves this and has made changing easier.
