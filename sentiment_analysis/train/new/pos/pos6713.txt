First, we had no issues whatsoever with fit on our 'standard' faucet. In fact, this one works where others have not because it has an opening on top to allow for the shower pull.We've had NO issues with faulty or erratically fluctuating temp readouts. It's read accurately and consistently since day 1. We don't burn through batteries all that quickly (as we're sure to turn it off after we're done running the tub, but it does have an automatic shut-off for those times it gets forgotten), but we have replaced them once and it easily went right back on and right back to working well, as it always has.It's proven very useful for us, as we can't always 'set' the faucet to the same spot and get the same temp (seems to vary by when/where in the heating cycle our water heater is). But, we always turn it to about the same spot, let it run just enough to warm up (no need taking a temp reading when we know it's still cold), turn on the spout cover, and then adjust a bit from there. Once we get that green screen, we know we're good to go and can 'set it and forget it' til it's time to shut off the water and put the kids in.We're also finding added benefit as our older child begins to discover more autonomy. She's old enough to understand the basics of hot water safety, but this allows her to get the temp just right w/o a lot of guesswork (and potential burns) on her part.We LOVE it, and can't wait for the shower-head equivalent!Edit to add: 10/27/08 - 2 years in, a battery change (or 2?) and we still ADORE ours!Edit 10/30/09 - 3 years in now, 2-3 battery changes, and we STILL love it. Don't know if they can be found anywhere still, but we'd definitely buy this one again.
