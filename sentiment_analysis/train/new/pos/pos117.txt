We use diaper pins to fasten our socks together for washing - haven't lost a sock since doing this.So far, these Sassy pins look very good.  They have heavier guage wire than some cheaper ass'd color pins I also got from Amazon, and they also open correctly for a right handed person unlike the cheaper ones (I didn't realize there was such a thing as a backward - opening pin until I read some other reviews - I thought my fingers were just becoming uncoordinated!!).Still awaiting results of the 3rd important test - will they survive multiple runs thru the medium heat dryer cycle without the head deforming.  Stay tuned.
