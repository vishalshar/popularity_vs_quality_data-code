I have intense chronic pain and the bad habit of chewing until my fingertips bleed when the pain is bad. Chewing on the corners of this gives me the same comfort and satisfaction without causing bodily harm. And, worn around my neck, have received complements on my lovely jewelry piece! Looks like a chunk of polished oyster shell -- great no matter what I wear.
