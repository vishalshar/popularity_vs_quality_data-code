My son is turning 4 and I originally bought my medela freestyle pump 4 1/2 years ago.After having my daughter 5 months ago, and returning back to work when she was only 6 weeks, with her only being exclusively breastfed - I had to pump, but of course didn't want to use my old part attachments.I bought these and they are just as good as the originals. I use it everyday, and have zero issues. I have not had to supplement her either.Great buy!
