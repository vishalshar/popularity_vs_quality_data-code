The seat does what it needs to and for the price is appropriate.  I don't switch cars with it, and installing it once was a little more cumbersome than the twice as expensive Recaro back-to-front seat we have in the other car.  The belts are thinner than the Recaro's, which actually makes it easier to twist any wrongly aligned latches.  The tightening strap is difficult to pull snugly, but not frustratingly so.As others have mentioned, there isn't much head support for naps while driving, so for longer trips where your child may be napping, have something to use for head support so the nap lasts longer than til the first major turn.The low seat height and fold-able armrests are great for ingress/egress, but for whatever reason, when the seat is empty, they jiggle annoyingly when driving unless you wrap a harness strap around them.So overall, its a decent seat that my son likes to ride in, but has some little quirks that have easy work-arounds that would probably cost way extra for an enhanced feature on another model booster seat.
