We bough this for our six month old son. Like most babies, he has an obsession with tags no matter what they are attached to. It is soft, has held up to several rounds in the washer & dryer already, and is the perfect size to tote around (this is a blankie, not a full size blanket). He loves to pull, chew, lick, and suck on the tags. They are firmly attached and are holding up to his 'abuse'. He also likes to bunch it up in his fists and chew away since he is teething. Overall we are very happy with it and would purchase it as a gift for family or friends with babies.*UPDATE*My son has long outgrown the taggie blanket however, it held up so well to his 'abuse' and countless washings that I was able to give it to a friend for her son to play with.
