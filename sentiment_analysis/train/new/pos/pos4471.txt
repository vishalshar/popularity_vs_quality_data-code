These frames were better than expected.  I used them to give some family members a photo that my dad and I took at a wedding in those photo booths.  Walgreens helped me scale the photo to a "wallet" size and it fit perfectly.  It's quite hard to find small frames this size at the craft/retail stores.  My only disappointment was that a reviewer said they had a glass frame cover, but it's only plastic.  But unless the frame is going to be in an area like the kitchen with "water" around, I suppose it shouldn't be an issue.
