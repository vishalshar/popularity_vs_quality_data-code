I looked everywhere for a baby book that wasn't too cheesy or cutesy. I also wanted a book where I could easily fill in information rather than a blank scrap book where I would have to spend more time arranging and organizing information on my own (what new mommy has time for this?). I finally ordered this book because of all the positive reviews.  The quality of the book is outstanding!  The linen binding is thick and nicely decorated. The illustrations are simple and cute and most of the fill-in pages are great.  The only minor complaint is that some of the pages seem to out of order and also, it would have been nice to include attached envelopes on those pages at the end reserved for keepsakes, clippings and art projects (not a big deal because you can also do this yourself with double sided tape or the 3M mounting squares). I plan to order the photo album as well!
