Originaly I only wanted the pacifier holder becuase my son was using a different type of pacifier. But after recieving and washing this one I kept it on hand. He not only took to it but now won't use the other type I had. The beaded holder is cute and helps prevent anytype of choking becuase it is too big to get around his neck. The only thing I don't love is that the clip is small and the clip cover is large limiting where you can clip it too. Will buy again... would recommend.
