I wish I could give half stars because I really would give this 4.5 stars.  While it is a great fit to the Bumbleride Indie stroller and it came back from my trip unscratched and in perfect condition, it takes a bit to figure out how to place your stroller in it so that it will fit so I wouldn't recommend gate checking this unless you practice at home first.  I ended up checking this as baggage so there was more handling involved.  I was worried but I was happy to see that my investment was well protected in this bag.  I would not take my Indie on a plane without this!  The bag itself came back looking great which says a lot about the durability.  The padding on this is really nice as well.  I look forward to using this on future flights to come!
