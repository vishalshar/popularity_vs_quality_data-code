This ball is entertaining and fun for baby!Pros:+ Bright colors+ Gentle chime noise.  Not annoying like some.+ Fun-to-grip tags+ Helps with fine motor skills and grip+ Soft fabric+ Seems to wipe clean easily with washcloth and little detergent (see cons about machine washing)Cons:- Larger than expected.  Best suited for baby who is crawling and sitting.- Tag says to spot clean only (though others seem to have had success machine washing inside a pillow case on delicate cycle)
