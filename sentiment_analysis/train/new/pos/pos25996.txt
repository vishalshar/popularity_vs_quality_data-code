I own Alva's, Kawaii's, Sunbaby's, Happy Heiny's and 2 Bumkins.All the flippin cloth diapers lie, they all say they start at 8 pounds (okay the kawaii I think specifies 9 pounds) but anyway the first month we used Seventh generation disposable diapers (which are fantastic! They held all her blow outs and never leaked and I Highly recommend them - http://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Generation-Diapers-Chlorine-Newborn/dp/B0088HV24U/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1390941788&sr=8-4&keywords=seventh+generation+diapers) but we used those and then we went to our local market and they didn't have newborn size after our first pack and we bought size one and they worked just as well so don't worry you can do size one for awhile too.Anyway we only planned on doing disposable for the first week but the only diapers that fit her were the Bumkins! And we only had 2 of those and they are too expensive to use as the majority  (although I super recommend if you can afford it to do only bumkins, sunbaby's and happy heiny's. Alva's are more like okay they work as a great foundation and are the best bang for your buck. I own 20 alva's but can tell they really are for like 10+ pound babies)Bumkins fit really well around the legs, and that is the main problem with having tons of alva's, they all are "gap-ey" around the legs and then seem too tight when you cross the snaps all the way over.ALTHOUGH the Bumkins are hardly all-in-one (4 stars instead of 5)....the insert that comes in them is very thin. You can use this diaper as an "all in one"  if you are only planning on having it on your baby for an hour or two, only if you have easy access to your changing table. BUT with another insert they work great for the first "half" of the night or for a few hours in the afternoon.Plus they have super cute styles. Now my daughter is 6 weeks old and over 9 pounds, these still fit the best.
