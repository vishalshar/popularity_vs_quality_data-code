We've tried so many sippy cups at this point I've lost count.  But these are one of those we still have (& use).  I think these are best suited for the younger ones - as first transitional cups - due mainly to the flow.  These have a VERY slow flow - maybe even too slow.  When my son first used this I noticed he barely drank anything, so I tried it myself & realized it was almost impossible to get anything out of it.  Maybe if they've just moved over to sippy cups & are still in that 'suck super hard' phase that would be good, but for an almost 2yo, this wasn't working.  So I took a kitchen knife & put a small slit in between the two existing small slits - that did the job without making it leaky.  It will probably leak if I hang it upside down long enough - but so far it's been good (even when my son gets mad & decides to throw whatever he's holding - which has included this....oh I can't wait till we're past this phase!).
