I love this thing. Unlike many other products of it's kind, this one actually covers the entire area where the child is. there is no exposed metal for the kid to chew on (as is my one year old's favorite pass time). Also, the fact that it creates a little "cloth basket" I don't need to worry about loosing toys, teething biscuits, sippie cups or pacifiers. If he drops something it lands next to him in the basket and i find it when i'm putting him in the car. Also, this model has a seat belt that comes with it so you don't have to use the one attached to the cart. Several other model i've looked at don't have their own seat belts (kinda defeats the purpose if you ask me). Finally, this comes in bright colors (drawing the attention of the child) and toys that attach to little loops in the fabric. Which also aids in not loosing things. If he throws a toy, it won't go far because I attach it to the fabric loops. Rather than spending my grocery shopping days in the never ending gravity game of picking things off the floor, I can just reach a few inches and hand it back. I really like this thing. I will admit though, it can be difficult to put in the cart one handed while you hold your squirming child, but you get good at it with time.
