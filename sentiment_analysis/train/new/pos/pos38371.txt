My daughter has been sleeping with this little security blanket since she was tiny. She just turned a year old. I have several so I can always have one clean. She LOVES it! She holds it up to her face and goes right to sleep. She likes feeling the satin edges. I will say though, makes sure you don't wash these blankets with any Velcro. Velcro will pick the satin edge.
