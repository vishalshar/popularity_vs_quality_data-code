We went with this seat because it has an anti-rebound bar, and seemed to be the best quality of the available choices. I've heard Britax stopped using flame retardants on the fabric in 2013, so that was also a positive feature. For a car seat this expensive, it could have been designed to have a way to hold the straps out of the way while putting the child in the seat. Also, the harness straps don't pull out very far--at their maximum extension they get maybe an inch longer than they'll be when you tighten them. It's very challenging to put even a small baby in because of this. The bonnet doesn't come far enough forward to really block the sun, and it doesn't reliably stay up when you're carrying it. We don't spend a lot of time driving, and we don't use this with any stroller--but we did take it in and out of the car with a sleeping infant in it more than we expected to. It's heavy, but that's not our main use of it, so even with a now-16-pound child it isn't that big of a deal. The materials do seem to be very good quality, and have held up well (though we've only been using it 6 months). It's very long (just barely fits in a our wagon, with two 5'9-10" adults' seats very upright and as far forward as is reasonable/safe), so make sure to have your seat installation inspected before committing to this one. Couldn't fit a Britax marathon next to it, had to put both seats in the outboard positions when transporting a friend's child. As with any seat, it's recommend to have it inspected by an expert once installed in a new vehicle--we read the instructions (and car manual) very carefully and have a lot of experience with other car seats and still screwed it up.  Hospitals, fire and EMS, and healthcare system sometimes offer free inspections with a CPST.
