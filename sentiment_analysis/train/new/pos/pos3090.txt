So this baby nail clipper is AWESOME! We have the pigeon boggie picker PIGEON Baby Nose Cleaning Tweezers Pigeon (Made in Japan) and that thing totally rocks so I figure I would try this nail clipper. Here is the good and the not so good...THE GOOD:1. Super Sharp! This thing clips any nail the first time. When working with our wee little one you have to be able to get the nail cut cleanly the first time since they rarely stay still long enough to get a second try.2. Very Very Well Made. Made in Japan.3. Good design. It is nice and wide where you hold it which helps keep things controlled and most important accurate. And the clipper is just the right size for baby nails.THE NOT SO GOOD:1. Price.... (You get what you pay for so if you want the best then be ready to pay for it.)2. All the extra plastic bits. There is a 'safety' cover and then there is a yellow surround that "catches" the nails. When I am trying to see exactly what I am cutting all this plastic bits seem to just get in the way. The good news is that they can be removed easily and then put back after your done.To sum it up this is THE BEST baby nail clipper I have ever used and most importantly it will get the job done quickly and safely.
