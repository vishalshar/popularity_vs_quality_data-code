Low to the ground like European cribs. Finally a crib that is just that.. No bells and whistles, just a nice safe place for the baby to sleep.By the way,-You do not need a lowering side-rail if the crib is not up on stilts, also those things make so much noise...who uses them??-It does not need to turn into a toddler, teen bed if you did not spend $1700 on it-Nobody uses the multiple choices for mattress height. It starts off up top because the rail is so high, the the kiddo stands up and it goes to the rock  bottom option.Stop the madness Mommy and Daddy! Buy a simple cute crib, put the rest of the $$ in the college fund. (Who am I kidding, get the matching armoire and glider...just not the bonkers crib alright!!?)
