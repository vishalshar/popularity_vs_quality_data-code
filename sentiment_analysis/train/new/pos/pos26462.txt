If I had purchased this with the intention of having it for my toddler I would be giving it five stars. Its awesome quality, rinses easily, hang dries quickly, my toddler loves wearing it, works great. I thought it might be hard to manage keeping it clean because it seemed big to wash in my sink. I prefer kitchen sink wash and reuse bibs over cloth you have to laundry wash.  I had been using the molded silicone tommy tippee bib but hated the was it was hard to not catch some of my girls hairs on the back of her neck in the clasp. This relives that issue and was just as easy to clean with the high chair tray in my sink. The reason for me docking one star is the size. I bought 2 of these to use on my 7 month old twins and they are way to big for them. I've tried rolling the sleeves enough to make them work but that's a pain. If I didn't have an older child still wearing bibs these would be collecting dust. My toddler is between 24 month and 2T size in long sleeve clothing. The bib sleeves are still a little long on her so I am guessing they are about a 3T lenght. I would say that once your child is getting close to outgrowing 18 month size sleeve lenghts you could probably start using these and probably continue using them until they are 4T size. I am loving these for her and keeping one in the diaper bag for when we are out. It cleans easy even with a diaper wipe and takes up less space than even a drool bib. I'm happy they seem like they will last because I use them daily. I just wish they talked about the size in the description and offered a smaller sized for babies.
