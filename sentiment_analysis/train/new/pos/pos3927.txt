I really like this teething toy.  We are trying to avoid teething toys made in China and this is one of only a few we could find on Amazon that fits our requirements (it is made in Italy).  It is all natural rubber (based on what the company says since we really have no way of verifying) with no paint.  To me it has just the right combination of softness and firmness.  Or boy seems to favor it too.  The toy is two identical pieces melted together.  If there were to be an issue it would the the two pieces separating but right now everything is great.
