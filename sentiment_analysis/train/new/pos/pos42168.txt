We were just putting bottles on a drying mat, but they would never fully dry out.  I needed a rack to get some air in there.  I wanted something compact and simple and this looked like the best option.  I like that I can collapse it down if I don't need both sides.  I also like that I can lower some of the pegs if I don't need them all.  Holds smaller 4 oz and larder 8 oz bottles.  I was also able to fit some of my Dr Brown pieces on there.  The only drawback is you need a drying mat underneath, but I already had one ready to go.  The price is right, so pick one up if you need one!
