I  am  using this bag for 1 year and 4 months now. Before I bought it I read the complaints about the zippers. But all this time I didn't have any trouble with them except when they get stuck in the side label. I think if you handle it with care it will last. Furthermore I find it very handy as I just put it on my back and have my 2 hands free. I would recommend this.
