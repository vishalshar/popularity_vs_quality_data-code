I do NOT have a young child at home! I bought these to prevent cold air from coming in through an outlet. I had already installed outlet gaskets, which stopped the air leek around the outlet, but I still had a cold draft coming from the "plug-in" portion. These stopped the draft. They are appropriately 'easy' for an adult to remove; perfect for my needs. I have ordered another package to use on the remainder of my outlets.
