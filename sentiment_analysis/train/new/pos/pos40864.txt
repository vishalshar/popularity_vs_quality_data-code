Despite reading the other reviews, I was still surprised how well made this was! The beads are all wooden with quality decorations. It fits with all of the different types of pacifiers I have for my pipsqueak, including her Soothies which have really small holes, so that's a plus. I was tempted to drop it a star because I wish the attachment was spring-based instead of clip-based but I love this thing so much I'm going to let that slide. I get tons of compliments on it and have completely tossed aside the other pacifier attacher I have.
