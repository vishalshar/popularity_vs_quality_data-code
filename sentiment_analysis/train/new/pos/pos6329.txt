I stumbled across these on AMZ and have they been a hit with my grands.  They have had them for almost 2 years and they have so much fun with them....especially during the winter when they spend more time indoors.  The older child was 2 1/2 when they arrived.  She was so delighted.  I think these could be fun even before their first birthday (while supervised).  The baby started crawling over them and had fun, too.  Now with the older child 3 1/2, they are still favorites at playtime.  We make obstacle courses with them - adding the tunnel, the castle and the "river stones"  (CP Toys 5 Pc. Lightweight Vinyl Soft Play Forms)  The product quality is very good and they will last a very long time.  They are expensive but I think you get much more for your money than spending the same amount on multiple other toys..
