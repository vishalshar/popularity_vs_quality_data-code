I've never purchased a Lamaze cloth book product before, but the photos of the items available are so colorful, and the cloth books looked well constructed.  I'm glad I went ahead and ordered.  The colors in person are amazing and draw baby's attention to them.  The raised reliefs on certain portions of the photos are an interesting addition and the baby just loves to finger them, as if it is soothing to do so as he watches TV and hugs the cloth book.  Yes, very well constructed of a slightly satiny material.  Love it, as does the baby!  I'll be back to get more.
