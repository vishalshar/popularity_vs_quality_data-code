The nipple has a weird smell and taste at first (yes, I tasted it because it smelled funny); even after washing 2 times it didn't go away. But after sterilizing it and washing it a couple more times it was gone and now my baby loves it! I stuck with it despite the initial bad taste because it's the only one I could find with this kind of nipple, handles, and up to 10oz. My baby is only 6mo. but drinks about 7oz every morning, so all the other 5oz training zippy cups are too small for him. Will definitely buy it again despite having to wash it multiple times before it's acceptable for baby's mouth
