I absolutely love these wipes. I thought I'd prefer something smaller, but it turns out these are the perfect size. I seldom need more than one wipe, even those super messy poos that always took me at least half a dozen disposable wipes to clean up. I keep them dry and a I keep a small crockery bowl of water with a squirt of baby wash & a bit of coconut oil on my coffee pot. Why on my coffee pot? The residual heat that rise from the pot I'm already running warms the water just enough to keep the coconut oil melted & the water warm enough to not send baby squirming away.As awesome as these wipes are for their intended task, the reason I'm back to order more is the secondary use I've found for these wipes. I've been using cloth diapers for about a year now, but after a failed early try, I'd still been using disposables for night time. Whatever type of diaper I tried, my little guy still got a rash if I put him in cloth at night for too many nights in a row, until I got these wipes! Now, I lay the wipe in, flannel side facing baby, and he wakes up dry and comfy as can be! I put him in a fitted diaper, sure to hold all the moisture it, but nothing to keep it away from baby's skin. Usually after a night in even the best made fitted, his skin is soaked & a little red. He's usually eager to get his diaper off & needs to run around naked long enough to pee on my floor at least once or twice in order to fully dry out. As you can imagine, I don't love this! When I wrap one of these wipes around the crotch, the fitted can be soaked & yet what touches baby feels almost dry!Cleans well, the perfect size, doubles as a stay dry liner, great wipes!
