It's an analog baby monitor. I got it at an extremely low price buying it "like new - used" from amazon warehouse, so my review is a little biased because I paid so little and got more than I expected.Here's why I like it better than Graco's analog monitor (not their digital ones--i like those):* Stays completely muted until the sound of crying/whatever exceeds a fairly decent threshold. This means we don't hear the ambient sound machine, baby just stirring or shifting, or even the humidifier's occasional gurgles.* The above not only keeps sounds we *don't* care about out, but it saves on battery usage since the speaker is technically only on when the baby cries. In fact, we've been using the monitor (off and on) via battery for *weeks* now. And we're using cheapo walgreen batteries.* Both the parent and base take batteries AND/OR an included AC plug. This means if baby is asleep in his car seat, you can move the base unit from his room to where ever needed at the drop of a hat.* The units can have batteries in them at all times, but they use AC power when plugged in. IE, keep the AC Plugs in the room of most frequent use, but unplug and go whenever needed.* Sound quality is great. We've only had a couple times where some random interference caused the parent unit to pop or turn on abnormally.* No issues with range, even 2nd floor to basement.Bottom line:  I'm guessing a lot of negative reviews are for people with powerline interference issues in their home. Will you have an issue? Maybe. Still, these worked great for us. If you want to play it safe, go with a digital monitor: You won't have interference issues ever. But if these are on sale, they might be worth the risk.
