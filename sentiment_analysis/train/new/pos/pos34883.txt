This bottle is cute and easy to clean.  It's narrow enough for my toddler to hold it comfortable, and is not too heavy for her (though I only fill it up about halfway to make it more manageable, and mostly use it for water).  I love that it comes with a silicone cap because nice bottles seem so useless if I can't throw it in a bag without worrying about getting the nipple/spout dirty.The only drawback is that the nipple collapses after less than a minute of drinking - I doubt they can do anything about that without using plastic but it often made my baby lose interest in drinking, and I haven't used the bottle as often as expected because of this.  I didn't purchase the sleeve for the bottle (it's almost the price of a bottle itself!) yet but that seems pretty necessary since the steel gets hot very easily- and really cold, too.  I used Dr. Brown's medium flow (wide neck only! I made that mistake the first time around) nipples for milk and the original sippy spout for water, although it's on the faster side in terms of flow.
