I was looking for a product to help make tummy time a more positive experience and I wasn't disappointed! It is one of the greatest values I have found. It's a great price for all that comes with it. The pillow is great for supporting my daughter. The mirror, steering wheel, and other toys are engaging and grab her attention. It even has tabs so you can attach any of your child's favorite toys. We use this for tummy time, but I can also see us using it in the future as a playmat. All in all, this is a great value and I recommend it wholeheartedly!
