I have had my mesh baskets for almost a year.  I've no trouble with rusting.  They work great for straws.  They are stretching and they allow the items to clean well (although no food pieces).  The only problem I had was it took a few months of using before I didn't struggle to get it open.  But now it's not problem.  I'm not sure if I got stronger or if it loosened up a bit, but it still closes snuggly.  This is SO much better for straws than those little holders beside the larger baskets.  And it hardly takes up any dishwasher space.  It's a wonderful find!!  I would recommend to anyone needing to wash straws especially.
