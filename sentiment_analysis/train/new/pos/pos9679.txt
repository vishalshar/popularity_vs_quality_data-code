Love these curtains.  Matched the crib bedding set perfectly.  Only reason I did not give 5 stars because if the legnth. I wish they offered a shorter version.  I had to pay an extra $20 bucks to have them hemmed to legnth that would not drag on floor.. overall price was a bit high for just 2 curtains but I was still satisfied with product
