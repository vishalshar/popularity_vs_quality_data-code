This is overall a great stroller.  I researched many double strollers, and am glad I chose this one.  I love the Kiwi color.  It gets many looks and comments, partly because my newborn is propped up for all to see.pros:-folds easy and folds pretty flat-great maneuverability, turns on a dime (way better than my single Peg Perego)-can fit easily through any door-holds both my almost 3 year old and 6 1/2 lb newborn (I did get a Kiddapotumus support for my newborn)-my 3 year old likes to sit next to his brothercons:-doesn't recline much.  Support is definitely needed for a newborn.-accessories are a little pricey.  It could be another $200 with the belly bar, carseat adapter, child trays...-storage under the stroller isn't very big
