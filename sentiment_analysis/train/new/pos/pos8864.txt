I still can't believe I spent so much money on a warmer, but this was worth the money. I wanted one I didn't have to set up, and measure, or worry about burning and this was exactly that, with the added bonus that I can use ANY container! So I can literally take my frozen bags of breastmilk out of the freezer and pop them right into this handy little warmer, and turn it on. I recommend spending the extra money for the added  convenience, ESPECIALLY for breastfeeding Mums who have frozen, stored milk. This was a win for me.
