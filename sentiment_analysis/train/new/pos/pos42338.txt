I needed to replace the membranes on my double medela pump, but didn't want to pay what the store had them marked for! So after some searching around I came across these and for the cost, felt it was worth it to give them a try for how many are in the pack. Turns out that ordering them was a great idea as they work perfectly! They fit like they are the medla brand, and are almost a little thicker/sturdier than the ones that came along with the pump accessories. This package will last a long time if they are used properly! I highly recommend buying them!
