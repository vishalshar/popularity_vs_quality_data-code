It was a life saver on a 9 hour flight to Europe! I was able to give my little one warm cereal, warm milk, and Camilla tea. His stomach was happy, and so was I.Other moms on the plain asked what under that beautiful bottle sock decorated with owls was, and I shared my secret with them. I will never forget their reactions! One mom helping another mom...to be free and happy when on the go...
