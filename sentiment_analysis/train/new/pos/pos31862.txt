We have been using this high chair since our daughter began on solids at 4 months.  At first we used it without the tray and the recline feature was very useful.  We even used it as a seat around the house, it is very convenient and comfortable.  Now that she is 10 months old and we would like to let her feed herself some, we want to use the tray but it is way too high.  It is almost up to her chin, and she is no small baby!  I don't like that this problem is interfering with her learning how to feed herself.  Also, the tray is very difficult to slide on and off, requires both hands.  Lastly, a fabric cushion is proving to be an unwise choice.  While traveling we borrowed a small, simple high chair that worked perfectly and was just the right size.  We spent big $ to get the fancy chair because we lacked experience to know any better, but in retrospect probably should have gone with something a lot simpler.  I'm kicking myself for spending so much money on this chair!
