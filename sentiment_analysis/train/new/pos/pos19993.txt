I bought this product for my 4 year old so that she could sleep in a Queen sized hotel bed.  I was concerned that it wouldn't stay put under cotton sheets, so I bought a jersey sheet set at Target and took the fitted sheet with me.  The rails took about 2 minutes to inflate (I'm not sure why it says 10 minutes per rail on the product manual) -- easy as pie.  Then I put the jersey sheet on the bed and placed the rails on either side under the sheet.  I called it her "nest" and she loved getting in bed every night.  She is a VERY restless sleeper and moves all over the place during the night.  With these rails in place, I got great nights' sleeps every night.  What a sanity-saver!  The flocking on the under side of the rails helped keep them in place and when we returned home, I placed one under her cotton twin size sheet and removed the big white rail that was there before.  So far so good and much less of a huge barrier.  I would recommend this to anyone -- especially those who travel with their babies/toddlers/Preschoolers.
