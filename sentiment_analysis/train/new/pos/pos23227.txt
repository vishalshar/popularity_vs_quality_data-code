Better price-per-liner than the boxed, and the weave of the bamboo fiber runs across the liner, not down it, so I'm able to cut them length-wise, hand-stretch them out, and get TWO liners out of each one liner on this roll. Comes away from the diaper easily, and still catches all the poop. Have had not issues with flushing them, either (we are on city water, not septic). Very pleased with this, and will likely buy it again!
