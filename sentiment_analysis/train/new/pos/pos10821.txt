I appreciate this being an organic material for my soon to be newborn, and it is soft and gender neutral. I have struggled to find sheets for our bassinet (Carter's Bumble Collection) pad - this is the best fit I have found, though not 100% perfect.mat least this one works and seems safe enough for actual use (most with elastic all around no up curling/bunching the mattress pad!). It does seem crazy that you can't just buy more of the same style bassinet sheets that came with the bassinets (mine is a non-elasticized sleeve type sheet), especially since so many bassinets seem to have this same kind of mattress pad. But, at least this one works, which was a welcome find after so many failures.
