I have a baby that didn't appreciate the comfy-ness of her Graco Snugride 35 while out on our daily dog walks so this snugseat insert was a lifesaver!  We used this with our baby when she was about 12 weeks old and she enjoyed it (since she wasn't crying or screaming her head off).  She is now 5 months old and still prefers this to sitting in her carseat.
