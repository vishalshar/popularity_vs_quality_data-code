First time mom and needed some porta-crib dressing for grandma's place and this was the PERFECT pick! It fit the Dream On Me 3 In 1 Portable Convertible Crib, Cherry perfectly, corner to corner!Though having it on the "bassinet-level" the ties in the four corners were tricky since the corner posts are wider than the rest of the posts. I also put in the bumper first then snugly slid the mattress in afterward so the bumper would be even with the top of the railing at this highest level.  I'm sure it won't be an issue which order you put it on at the two lower levels BUT I do like that the bumper is actually between the mattress and the railings so when I do move it down as Baby Boy grows, I just may keep the bumper in first then mattress in!The minky (dimple) fabric is super soft, even softer than the fabric store bought kind (as I handmade some other blankets & bedding). It was durable during washing and no color bleeding when I mixed it in with the rest of baby's stuff...I am very happy with this set and likely going to get the other set for his full-sized crib!
