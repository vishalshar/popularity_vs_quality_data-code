Of my 3 pumps this is by far my favorite! I use it everyday and it works great. I get so many more ounces with this pump opposed to my Medela pumps. It is really nice that the Tommee Tippee bottles hook right up to this pump and I do not have to transfer from the standard bottle and then pour into the bottles we are using. I really wish it was not discontinued and would really like to know where to buy replacement parts.
