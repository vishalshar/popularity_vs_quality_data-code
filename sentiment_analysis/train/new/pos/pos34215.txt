I bought this for my grandson and it is even more adorable on him than on the model pictured with the product. If you don't like the idea of a shark outfit on a baby, I can say that I didn't either, at first. But I bought it because it was the one item my son-in-law had added to the baby register and I wanted to surprise him at their baby shower. Since I haven't actually been present at the baby's bath time, I can't say anything about the absorbant quality of the fabric, etc. (so I felt I couldn't give it 5 stars), but I did have a chance to hold the robe when the gift was opened and it felt soft but substantial.
