This is a great gate.  We have it installed at the top of the stairs.  Not only does it work great but looks wonderful too.  It keeps our 9 month old in and allows our 5 year old to come and go without climbing over anything.  I wanted something that would blend more with our house than plastic or the metal ones.  The quality is wonderful.  There was a little cussing on my husbands part with installation but we have found that just comes with the turf.
