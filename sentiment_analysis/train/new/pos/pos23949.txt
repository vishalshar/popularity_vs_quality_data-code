My daughter had this pillow for over 7 years and it has only gotten softer and more huggable as it aged.  My daughter still hugs her pillow to go to bed.  My son wanted the same pillow for his bed and we found this one again on Amazon.  It is slightly different than the older generation pillow in that it has a casing over the foam for ease of putting on the velour pillow case.  But it emitted an odor for over a week even after going through the air cycle of dryer for 45 minutes.  Finally, it stopped smelling strong and my son is happily sleeping on it.
