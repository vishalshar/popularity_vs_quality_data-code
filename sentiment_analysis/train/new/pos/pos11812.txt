This stroller is great!!! Very light and the handles are higher than the other common umbrellas, which is good since my husband do not need to bend forward to use it. Very easy to manage, especially on the curbs.... The only reason for no getting 5 stars is the buckle, which is very hard to manage and when it is folded it does not have an easy lock on the wheels. Either you carry it around or you lock manually by bending the frame close to the wheels to lock it (your finger easily gets dirty)
