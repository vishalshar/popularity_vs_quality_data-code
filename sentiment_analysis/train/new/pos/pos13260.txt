I LOVE this set!!  The hard plastic case keeps things from being broken/lost if bounced or dropped (I have a 5 yr old who is very inquisitive and likes to see all his sister's stuff).  If the items are in the case properly, each snaps into it's own hole and stays there until you take it out.I love the fingernail clippers with magnifying glass -- it makes cutting those tiny little nails easier -- what a wonderful idea.  Amazing someone didn't think of it sooner.  I don't use the emery boards for her fingernails.  If cut properly, I don't need them, but they are nice to have in a pinch for myself.The tweezers, again with a magnifying glass, are probably the best things I've ever owned!!  I don't use them so much with the baby, but use them quite a bit for my 5 yr old who is forever getting a splinter from something.  We've used them for ourselves, too, to remove bee stingers.  They may not have a use for newborn, but will be EXTREMELY useful later on.The brush and comb are just that, a brush & comb with a very nice rubbery handle that makes them easy to hold -- not cheap plastic like most.I haven't had the opportunity to use the medicine dropper so I don't know how it will work.  Based on my other experiences with Safety First products, I don't imagine it'll be a problem.  One thing I did learn READ THE DIRECTIONS and things truly do work much better!!The thermometer is easy to use & read.  I've (unfortunately) had opportunity to use it more than once and while I HATE using a rectal thermometer, with a newborn, it is the best.  This can be used rectal, underarm, or mouth.  Of course, now that it's been used rectally, it will remain a rectal thermometer.  I think it's wonderful, though, to have the options of how you want to use it without purchasing a type-specific thermometer.This is a great set for children of any ages.  I received it as a shower gift and my best friend has my gratitude!!  I LOVE IT!!
