Great replacement tray! I found a Boon Flair at a garage sale for $20 and was excited to use it. Once I got it home I realized that the tray had lots of knife marks from the previous owner and the scuff marks on the seat wouldn't come off so I decided to order a replacement. This fit beautifully and is super easy to clean. We're just now introducing solids so I'm glad everything is easy to wipe down since baby makes such a huge mess!
