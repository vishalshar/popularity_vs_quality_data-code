This is a great product! My family is rather large and I wanted to have pictures of all my son's Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles, and cousins -- this book did it! There is space for 17 pictures (I have 4x6 pics in, and there is room at the sides -- probably could go up to 4.5x6) and a mirror at the back. Each page is heavy duty clear plastic with a small black and white striped border. The openings for the pictures are at the spine so there is really no way a baby or toddler could get to them. The mirror at the back is pretty good for an unbreakable mirror (they are almost always somewhat distorted). One of the pages had a small imperfection in the border, but other than that, the quality is very good.I printed out my pictures on just regular paper and put them in the pages. My 4 month old son loves it! The pages are very clear (easy to see through) and easy to clean. He loves looking at people in person, and this album mesmerizes him. Also, he is just starting to get into the everything-in-the-mouth stage, and I have no worries about him chewing away on this book.Of all the things I have gotten for my son, this book is one of the best buys I've made!UPDATE: 5 months later and my son still loves this album. He has chewed it, bent it, twisted it, thrown it about, and tried to rip it apart, and has not damaged it yet. The white cover is now more yellow, but I don't really care about that. When I tried to update a few of my paper-printed pictures, they did stick pretty badly, but I just cleaned up the pages with a q-tip and a little alcohol, let them dry, and put new pics in. In spite of what other reviewers have said about its quality at first glance, this album is VERY DURABLE!
