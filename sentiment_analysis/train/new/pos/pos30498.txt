My husband and I purchased this shopping cart cover and it has made shopping and dining so much easier for us. This cart cover is high quality and the perfect size. We have used it on shopping carts, restaurant high chairs, and the baby swing at the park. My son loves it because he feels secure in it and you can attach his toys to it. It does come with a couple of toys already that he likes to chew on as well. The colors are a little different than it shows online. The brown is pretty accurate, it has a hint of purple in it, and the green is, well, very green! I don't think it's ugly at all. Just expect the colors to be a little different. This cover is a great buy and you get the shipping for free. Not much else you can ask for!
