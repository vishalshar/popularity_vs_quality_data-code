I bought this for my daughter when she was born and it was absolutely everything that we needed for her room. The quality was great and these items did not fade in the washer or dryer. I did not put the quilt/blanket in the dryer-I hung it out to air dry. The diaper holder could hold A LOT of diapers and was extremely convenient. We transferred these items to her toddler bed and they will be used there as well since her crib converts. This was a great bargain because we do not have to purchase another set for her to use on a toddler bed.
