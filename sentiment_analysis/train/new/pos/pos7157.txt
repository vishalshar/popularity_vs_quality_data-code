Price is great, doesn't look to be super comfy but it had good crash test reviews and my daughter doesn't complain. Bought this for my husbands car incase he had to pick kids up in it for any reason. They generally aren't in that car so the fact its not quite as comfortable or doesn't have the extras features her other seat has wasn't an issue for us. I would recommend it for anyone buying it for similar reasons, if you're wanting it for daily use i would recommend something like that Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 (we own 2 of them) it looks much more comfy, has pockets for toys, cup/snack holder and lasts through 3 stages. its a little more but still cheap for how long they will use it, we paid $140 i believe. but a ll in all this seat was great for the price and would buy it again.
