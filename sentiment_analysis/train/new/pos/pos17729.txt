These bags are great! I have not had any problem with them leaking that other reviewers have stated. I wonder if there was just a bad batch.... I loved that they fit on my first years pump so that I can pump directly into a bag, have a handle to pour from, and a spout. I have used multiple versions of the Medela bags and feel that these feel thicker and are much easier to pour. The ounce measurements are more true to the amount of milk when poured into a bottle. I feel that the zipper is very strong and that some of the leak problems brought up in other reviews may be from misalignment of the zipper when sealing, because there was one time that I had to separate and realign to get a good seal. I would definitely recommend this product.
