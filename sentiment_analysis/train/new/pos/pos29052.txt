This tray is much better than the one with the mat on it.  I had the bebePOD for my older son and he did really well in it for playing and eating before we switched him to a highchair.  Now, I have another son and he's on the chubby side (18 lbs, 12 oz at 4 months) for it and its hard to get the tray on with him sitting in it.  I still like the bebePOD more than the Bumbo seat.  His legs get stuck in the Bumbo and its hard to get him out at daycare.
