I bought these Stage 2 nipples when I started putting cereal in my baby's bottle at 6 months of age.  I still use the Stage 1 nipples for water bottles or bottles without cereal, otherwise the flow is too fast for my daughter.The Stage 2 nipples work perfectly for the cereal mixed bottles; she's never "dribbled" much while using them and the cereal doesn't get clogged up in the nipple--unless I don't give it enough time to dissolve before feeding baby.  They also don't allow much air in (unless the bottle is empty, of course) so the gas is minimized as well.I completely recommend the Soothie bottles and nipples.  I doubt I'll ever use another brand with my children.
