This was for my son's monkey themed nursery. It attached easily to the crib and never fell off. I liked that the arm was covered with fabric. The monkeys are adorable. I just wish they were hanging so they were facing down more. Laying down and looking up you mostly saw their behinds. After a few months the spinning/music part stopped working. I called Carter's and they sent me a replacement piece for free. Never had any problems with it after that.
