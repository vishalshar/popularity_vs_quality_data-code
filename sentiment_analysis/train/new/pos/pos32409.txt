This is perfect for a trip to the store or for a short trip out.  Carry the few infant/toddler items you need and your own personal items (keys, wallet, etc) without lugging a huge diaper bag.  I won't use it if we are out for a very long time, it probably won't fit everything we need but it is great for short trips to the store.
