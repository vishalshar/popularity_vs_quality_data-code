This drying rack so far is the best one I've ever used and I've tryied a few, because is round I love it has a very good design, you have the option of draining into your sink or using the tray of course is easier just draining into the sink and it works just fine I put the tray away. And again because is round and spins softly, when you are placing the bottles they don't get crampped, they don't even touch each other and I use wide neck bottles, one of the isues I had with the prior drying rack (another brand) I was using. This thing holds a lot of stuff I like that in the center area wich is designed for the brush I can place the spoons since my baby is already 10 months that means He eats solids, This drying rack comes completly appart and you have to put it together, and is very very easy to do it, even a 5 years old can do it. I love the design since it can hold a lot of stuff this is well thought out on top you can place the nipples, has four small hooks and eight big ones, this is good for spoons, bottles and sippy cups, breast pump parts, and other pieces you want to hang dry. I was hesitant at first since there were not reviews about it, cause is a new product. But I'm glad I ordered, this one is a keeper and I'm not buying more drying racks. Also I would like to add the material used for this is not a toasty plastic, is a soft plastic wich even made me happier. You can't go wrong with this one.
