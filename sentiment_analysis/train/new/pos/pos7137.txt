This pump is great! We needed a breast pump as i had to return to work and wanted to continue breast feeding. We were looking at the various brands but most of them did not fit our budget. We decided on this pump after using the manual version and getting pretty good results.Pros: Good Price  Works Well  Durable  Compatible with any evenflo bottle (plastic or glass)  Easy maintenance and use  Battery or A/C operated  Comes with a Carrying Case, Ice packs w/t Bottle pouchCons: Can be loud  Heavy  Suction power reduced while on batteriesThere are a lot of bad reviews here but this pump is 1/2 the price of the bigger brands, so you basically get what you pay for. We are currently using it for our second baby, No malfunctions or problems yet!
