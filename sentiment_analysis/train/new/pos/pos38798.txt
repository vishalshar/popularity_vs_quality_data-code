Motorola Baby Monitor works like new!  I purchased this to replace the battery in our Motorola video baby monitor we purchased about 3 years ago.  It would last no more than about 10 minutes off the charger with the screen on.  Now, I can run the screen for 45 minutes or more.  With the screen off, the audio monitor lasts for hours.I would quickly recommend this to anyone who feels their monitor doesn't seem to hold a charge like it used to.Fit perfectly and changed quickly!
