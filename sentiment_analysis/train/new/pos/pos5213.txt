My daughter (14 months old at the time) was walking pretty good, but not expertly.  She was able to take off running but she would always end up falling/tripping after 10+ steps.  So as most parents do, they secure things around the house so that their baby won't fall into things.  Tables, chairs, furniture, cabinets, etc.  We thought we did a pretty good job in securing our house so that no accidents would happen.  Unfortunately, the unexpected did in a way we didn't think of.As I was playing with her (she likes being chased), my daughter was running from me but ended up tripping.  I was too far enough to try & grab her and she tripped at the corner of a hallway where the edge of two walls made a L shape.  She fell face first into that corner and ended up gashing her forehead.  I felt so bad and terrible, like a failure as a parent.  It took almost an hour to get her to stop crying.  Luckily she didn't need stitches, but she does have a scar to constantly remind me.Who anticipated that the first harmful fall would come from a corner of a wall and not a coffee table??  Shortly after, I ended up buying these table edge guards and putting them on all corners of the house where the walls make an L shape corner.  Never again will my daughter end up gashing her head again.They install quite easily and the amount of foam in these (especially on the corners) are sufficient.  I tested them by punching the corner of the walls where these were installed.  I couldn't feel very much pain, so I'm assuming it's plenty enough cushion for a toddler.
