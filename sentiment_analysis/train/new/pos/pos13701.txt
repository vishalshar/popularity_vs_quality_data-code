Very cute and very useful little things made out of a dense foam. I ordered two sets and am very happy BUT now that I have seen this product first hand I am smacking myself on the head and asking, "Why didn't I think of that?!" I could have made my own by cutting up one of those swimming pool noodles and sticking them on the door edges, BUT it wouldn't have been nearly as cute and you can't go wrong for only $2 per set! Works great on ALL types of doors, even sliding glass doors, but see my warning below.Cons: They really had a nasty stink when I opened the package, but I just threw them in with a load of laundry and they are fine now. Also they don't work on double bi-folding doors. My daughter has one bi-folding door on her closet and it works great protecting her from pinched fingers. However, my son has a bigger closet and two bi-folding doors and it doesn't prevent pinched fingers because one of the two doors will still slam shut.
