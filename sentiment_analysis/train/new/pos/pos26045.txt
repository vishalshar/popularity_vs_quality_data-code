NOT WORTH THE MONEY, AND I ONLY GIVE IT TWO STARS, BUT SINCE I EDITED MY REVIEW, IT WON'T LET ME CHANGE THE NUMBER OF STARS I GAVE IT (I first reviewed it when I was using smaller glass bottles with not as many parts). Yes, it's better for glass bottles than the collapsible ones, but it's NOT at all good for BORN FREE (or any other wide neck bottles) bottles because you can only fit them on every other upright (they're too wide to go right next to each other), and there's no room for all of the other venting pieces that come with Born Free bottles. The two bottom pieces are too small to hold much, and things fall off of them!
