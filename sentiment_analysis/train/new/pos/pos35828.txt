I am happy with this purchase! I'm so glad I bought it, the one that came with my carseat was so flimsy and the material was awful, this one is very soft on the baby's skin and keeps my sons head in place, I feel much safer with this. One thing that I love about it is that it snaps over the straps, but it comes unsnapped too easily. Overall it's very soft and padded.
