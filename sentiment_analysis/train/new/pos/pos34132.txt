Our FP Baby Papasan Seat has now gone through 5 babies and is still like new. We love this chair for the newborn stage (birth to 3-4 months)as it is sturdy, has a gentle incline and most importantly it doesn't bounce.All our newborns have had major reflux issues due to my over supply and over active let down. We can't lay them flat ever for the first few months of life or they bring back the contents of their stomach. This chair has allowed them to sleep in a gentle incline that allows them to keep their feed down AND get some much needed sleep. It also allows me to actually get breaks from wearing the baby constantly while running after the other children.I love that the fabric is easy to remove and machine washable, especially with severe reflux. I also love how easy it is to fold flat for storage once they outgrow the chair and we put it away until the next baby arrives. I know there have been comments about it being too warm, but we live in South Florida and we've never had an issue with any of our babies getting too hot in this chair. They like the snugness, especially when we can almost swaddle them by tucking a cover under the sides of the seat cushions.We do stop using this chair at about 4 months and start using a bouncy seat at that time, but I do really prefer this seat to a bouncy chair for those first couple of months when they do not have much control of their head. You won't get a tilted neck in this chair that you get with a bouncy chair when they don't have good head control. It is perfect for the early months, but may not be what you need once they get a bit older.
