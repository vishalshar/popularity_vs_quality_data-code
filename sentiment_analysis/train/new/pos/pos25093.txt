My daughter loves this very much! Finally, I can leave her sitting and playing there alone for a while. Without the play-table, the seat alone is a good choice for babies to practice sitting. The only concern is that the toys are made of hard plastic materials. Sometimes I worried that she's going to hurt herself because the toys might bounce back onto her face, and the bees might hurt her eyes. It would be perfect if it's made of soft plastic or something.I bought this for my daughter when she was 3 months old, but we tried to put her into the seat and it turned out she's not ready for it. When we came back from Guatemala 2 months later and she was 6 months old, she loves it and would allow me to put her inside the seat whenever I needed to, e.g.. when I needed to take a shower or when I was cooking, etc. Here I uploaded her pictures and you can see that she's really enjoyed.
