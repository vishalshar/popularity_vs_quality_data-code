My daughter has a ton of stuffed animals! The corner hammocks won't work in her room because there isn't a corner without a door or window, so we bought this hoping it would get the animals off the floor.  It works like a charm! We used a hook that we already had instead of the one that came with it, but they were basically the same hook. We did buy another 10 clips to make sure we had enough. It holds 30 animals with no problem and the weight doesn't seem to be a problem.  Perfect solution!
