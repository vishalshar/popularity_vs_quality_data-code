I love this tote bag!  I am a pet sitter and it works GREAT!  I can carry my 3-ring binder with client profiles, my large ring of keys, hook my personal keys on the key tab inside the bag, use one inside pocket for doggie treats, the other inside pocket for pens, aspirin, mints, empty key tags, etc., and the outside pockets are good for holding my water bottle and flashlight.  The ~only~ thing I wish was you had replacement handles.  That is the only thing that wears out after about a year or two.  Other than that your bags are MAGNIFICIANT!
