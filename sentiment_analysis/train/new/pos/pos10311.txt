I bought one to keep our 9-month-old son corralled in the living room.  It was easy to assemble, adjust and place where needed.  Unfortunately, it was broken, not by my son, but by an adult who misjudged the "step-over" height.  I am gladly buying a new one to replace the broken unit.  The only thing I would change on this model is the EVA feet, which are very small and do not successfully prevent sliding.  I would make sure that the feet are non-skid rubber of some sort.
