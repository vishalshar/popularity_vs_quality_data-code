Yeah i was very stupid buying this toy i figured for 13 dollars that it would be a good size. when i opened the box i laughed and was like seriously?!?!? i wouldnt pay more then 5 for this tiny little toy. Really amazon?? i buy from this site all the time and this is the first time i felt like i got ripped off really bad!! i bought it for a baby shower gift just for something different, now i feel like i have to buy something else just to make up for the tininess of this thing..geez i feel stupid i should have read the reviews take that as a learning lesson lol
