I didn't have any of the problems listed by other customers! I am NOT handy whatsoever and I had NO problem putting this together in about 20 minutes! the instructions were perfectly understandable for me (which makes me wonder what the problem was for the rest of you?) also all of my dowels WERE predrilled......I do have one complaint which takes away 1 star b/c it is absolutely annoying but not surprising given the price....there are only cardboard pieces to sit in the bottom of each little cubby to keep it flat...and they DO NOT which makes it impossible put bottles of wash, lotion, powder etc as shown in the pic however clothes towels blankets diapers all stack and STAY nicely which makes it worth it for me!
