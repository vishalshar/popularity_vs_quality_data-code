These bibs are the best I've found yet for my really drooly 6-month-old.  He has very sensitive skin and has been battling a neck/chest rash caused by drooling/wetness for over a month. Before using these, he was going through about 10 bibs a day, soaking through them really quickly.  The Wonder Bibs last much longer and keep his neck and chest drier.  The bandana style does catch more drool than a flat style and helps to keep it away from his body. When the exposed folds get wet, you can tuck them under so that the dry folds touch the skin instead. The "terry" front is super soft and feels like chenille.  The nylon backing has a supple/slippery feel and is breathable.  My baby has a fairly large neck (he weighs ~21 lbs) and fits well into the larger snap setting. I love that these bibs have size adjustability with a low-profile snap closure (not skin irritating velcro!!).  I also love the solid color design and nice, saturated colors.  The quality is excellent.  While these bibs are expensive, they are definitely worth the price.  I will be ordering my second 3-pack.  The only thing I would change is the prominent Mum2Mum tag, but that's really not a huge deal.
