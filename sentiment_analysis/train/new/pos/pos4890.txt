I see a lot of people complain that it came bent or that the latch doesn't fit to the door. Well if you would take the time to read, you would see that it is meant to be that way. So when you returned it and then had the same issue... Well because its made to be like that. You obviously didn't read. It is bright orange and hangs right by what everyone is claiming to be defective!!! Just read people. Here I posted a photo of what you neglected to read!!!I bought three of these gates and they worked perfect for the space I needed them for. Though if the space was getting to big then it didn't seem as strong. But if trying to gate a smaller space this is great!!! Like I said I bought three and they are wonderful! Just try to use for the smaller allowed setting and it will be great. If you go for the larger end of the settings it make be a but flimsy.But again!!!! The door is supposed to be slanted before installation!!! Read the instructions people!!! I mean for come on how did you miss the bright orange paper that hangs from the gate? It says it is not a defect right there!I will get again if I need for other spaces.The gate when open is a bit narrow but nothing that is a problem for me. But if I could recommend anything I would say make the gate open a bit wider. But someone else posted picture with person trying to walk through so have a look.
