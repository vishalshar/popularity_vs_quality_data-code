This is a great bag! I LOVE the neutral color. Not only does it have many pockets for organizing all of baby's essentials for on-the-go, but the color suits a man well. Although he'd help out anyhow, my husband appreciates it not being all pink (like so many of baby's things.) He never hesitates to carry the bag for me. I had this one my registry and the store stopped carrying it. I was so bummed, and began my search on Amazon. I was so excited to find it! I haven't had this bag for long, so I don't know how it will hold up over time, but so far so good. Hope to be able to use it for our next baby. Once I noticed the straps were slippery and kept sliding off my shoulders, but I was in a hurry and carrying my purse and a couple of other things along with it and baby, so that could have something to do with it!  Now I'm using one of the front pockets to carry my wallet, phone, and keys...this is very handy.  One less thing to handle. I would make this purchase again and I highly recommend this bag.
