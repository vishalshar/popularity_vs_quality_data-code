This is a great bag to take when you are the go while using cloth diapers.  My recommendation would to be to buy two if you aren't planning on using a diaper bag always.  I've found it easier over the past three years to put the diapers, wipes, and a change of clothes in the bag, along with a spare bag for the dirty diapers, instead of hauling around a big diaper bag...this can all just be put in my purse.  You can find cheaper totes that work fine, but this one has held up better over the years....still looks new after 3 1/2 years!
