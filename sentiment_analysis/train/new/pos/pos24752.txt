I bought this for my six month old son. He is starting to roll around and play so I needed something to keep him from bumping into things when I walk out of the room. I have three other boys that love to look in on him, sometimes with messy hands. Dirt wipes off easily!I have had other playpens in the past and they were hard to fold up and get back into the original bag. This one is really easy. They actually made the bag big enough to get the playpen in and out of. I would recommend it to anyone.
