As a cover for prefold cloth diapers, this is hands-down our favorite of the five brands we've tried (the other four being Imse Vimse, Thirsties, Flip, and GoGreen). The outer material is super soft, not at all stiff or crinkly, and the inside is simple and wipeable. I like that the hook-and-loop (Velcro) is soft and that it's covered by the front tabs. I was concerned that the Bummis' single-gusset leg wouldn't be as reliable as the double-gusset on the Thirsties, but after two weeks of use, we've had zero leaks. As with any cover, as long as you make sure the cloth is tucked in under the elastic, there's no issue. I only wish the Bummis Super Lite came in more colors and some modern prints!
