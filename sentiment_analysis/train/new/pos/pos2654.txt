I love this lamp, and it's a perfect complement to my daughter's safari-themed nursery. The shade and paint detail are very nice.  A great feature this lamp has I didn't realize I wanted before was the silent switch (very handy for not waking a sleeping babe).My only issue with this lamp is that the bulb sits high in relation to the shade, and unless you put it high in the room (and miss out on the beautiful animals) you'll get an eye-full of blinding light when you walk in for your 4am feedings... Sub-optimal.Easy solution: I constructed a foil "hat" for the top of the lamp. Yes it looks a tad silly, and I recommend against incandescent bulbs if you do this, but no more 4am blindings.
