The colors are nice and bright and the modular nature of the stickers means you can design the cityscape you want.  I have used other wall decals and this was by far the easiest - they are quite literally stickers rather than the kind of decals with the removable paper on the front that you have to use a special scraper to apply.  With these from WallCandy Arts, I just stuck them to the wall and was able to reposition them a few times when needed without any trouble.  I would recommend a level, though, to be sure that your streets are straight.  Also, if you have semi-textured walls like me, I recommend that after you get all the stickers positioned where you want, grab a hair dryer and a small paint roller.  Blow the hair dryer onto a sticker for a few seconds, then while still blowing, roll over it with the paint roller.  This ensures that the sticker goes down into the texture rather than "floating" on top.  Your arms will be tired but it looks much better - less like a sticker and more like a custom mural.
