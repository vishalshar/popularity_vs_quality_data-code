Our stove knobs are particularly easy to knock into and turn on, so we realized pretty soon we needed to do something. Multiple people live in our house so thankfully someone would show up after someone else accidentally knocked into the stove and didn't notice the burners were on but not lit. There were multiple scares like this in the household.These fixed everything. Even when they aren't shut (the top can come off) they still prevent the knobs from moving. These are a life saver, literally. Thank you.
