I received this carrier as a gift. And I loved it! I was using the Moby wrap(long piece of fabric that you tie and wrap around you). I liked that one for around the house, but once we started to venture out of the house more, that one became difficult. So that is when I broke out this one. It was so easy to get my baby in and out. And adjusting it was an ease. I am a plus sized woman so I was nervous about it fitting and being comfortable. And it totally was!! I was able to use it through the airport and on our trip to Florida. My son loved being in it and I loved being able to wear him walking through the sand, rather than carrying him.The only down fall to this carrier, it doesn't go on your back. So I just recently purchased a new Infantino carrier. But for baby no. 2 I still plan on using this on in the beginning, just because how easy it is to put on and get baby in there.
