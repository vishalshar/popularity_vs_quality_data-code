After reading the reviews, I was unsure on whether to purchase this toy. I was looking for a set of musical instruments for my 6 month old baby whose sole motivation right now is to make everything she touches make a noise of some sort. Based on the reviews,I was prepared that it was not going to be as sturdy a toy as i might have liked but it was great for my child. Each instrument makes a jingle of some sort enough to satisfy a six month old but I will wait and see how long it will keep her entertained. She loves the muscial ditty the octopus plays. It is a great toy for a baby and you will be happy with it as long as you do not have unrealistic expectations of it. It is a bunch of quality, brightly colored cloth rattles with a seaside theme that make a rattle or jingle of some sort.
