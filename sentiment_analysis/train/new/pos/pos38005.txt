Our two daughters (4 and 6 years old) absolutely LOVE the KinderGlo Owl. It is very well made, durable, safe and does not become hot. Our girls really enjoy turning on the owl, when they go to bed. It has become part of their bedtime routine and sometimes they even take her to bed with them. A great feature is that the light can turn off automatically after 30min, which is just the right timeframe before falling asleep, although it can also be set to stay on all night. Since the light can be detached from the base, our daughters have also used it as a little "flashlight", to guide them to go to the bathroom in the night. I have recently also given several of these nightlights (there are also two dinosaur designs) as birthday gifts and have had really good feedback from our friends about this original present.Please note that the red light on the charger will stay red, as mentioned by another reviewer, even when fully charged. We have not found this to be any problem.
