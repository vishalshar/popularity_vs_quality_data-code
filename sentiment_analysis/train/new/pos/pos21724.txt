My husband and I were constantly arguing about the temperature of the bath water for our baby's tub.  I always think it's too hot, but my husband always thinks it's just right.  We both test the water in the tub with our elbows, but since our elbows don't agree, I looked to purchase a device that would help us out.  I researched around and looked on Amazon.com and came upon Safety 1st Temp Guard - Frog.  It looked cute, seemed simple, and relatively cheap at $4.99.When I received it in the mail, immediately I thought the frog is super cute!  The material is a durable vinyl and is very soft and flexible.  To test the bathwater with it, you just put the frog in the water, then take it out and turn it upside down.  If the bath water is too hot, it will light up in hot pink letters as "HOT".  Very simple, we didn't have to figure out temperature ranges or deal with calcuating between Fahrenheit/Celsius.The frog floats in the water so it is an extra bath toy for your infant.  Our baby is only 2 months old now, so the frog doesn't appeal to him yet.  Hopefully, when he gets older, he'll splash around with it in the tub!
