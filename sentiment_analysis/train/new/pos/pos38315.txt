This was a great fit for our car seat when our kids were little. The interior is soft and warm. The exterior seemed to be stain resistant. We washed it a few times, but it really never seemed to get dirty. We loved how we could take the kids from the house to the car during the winter and keep them warm. I would highly recommend this product.
