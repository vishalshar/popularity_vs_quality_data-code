I love these stickers.  We moved into a new home in which we needed to put my daughter in the one blue room in the house (of course the boys rooms were all painted a neutral.  Go figure).  We bought these stickers to "girly" up her room.  It worked perfectly.  The stickers are just as pictured.  You do get ALL of the stickers for the tree as well as all of the flowers and birds, bumble bee, and butterfly shown in the photo.  It does take a little while to peel and stick each portion of the stickers to make the final product, but it's adorable when complete.  We put the tree in one corner of her room and then "scattered" the flowers all the way around the room to create kind of a garden feel throughout.  As some of the other reviewers have stated, these stickers don't stick perfectly to textured walls, which we have.  However, I have just gone back over each sticker and scraped it down with my finger nail a few times and fewer stickers are lifting/peeling off the walls each time.  These are a great way to change the look of a room, and will come down very easily when she's a little older and wants something different.  I definitely recommend.
