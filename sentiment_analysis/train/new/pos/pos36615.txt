We're on our second child and our 4th swing. Our fist son wore out 2 swings, and the 3rd worked just ok until our second son came along, then it decided to die also. Having invested a ton of money on 3 swings already that all broke, I was hesitant to buy another one. But this one was so cute and was such a great price I couldn't resist. Our son absolutely loves it! We also have the matching bouncer and tummy time mat. The swing keeps him calm and puts him to sleep, giving us time to take care of other things. The music is cute and the speeds are great, especially for a heavier baby. I highly recommend this swing, and will now buy Fisher Price products instead of Graco (FYI the 3 swings we had that died were all graco!)[...]
