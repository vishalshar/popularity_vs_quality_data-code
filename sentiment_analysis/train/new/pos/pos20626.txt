My baby loves taking bath in this. We had this on our registry and started using this tub when she was a four-day old newborn. We gave her sponge baths in it. She was very comfortable in the sling and now, at four months, she has progressed to the baby level. She sits with a little support in the tub while we bathe her.The tub is so comfortable that I gave my little girl a bath without anyone's help when she was hardly a month old! As a first time mom, this was a pretty scary thing in the beginning but she was very relaxed and at ease.It is very easy to clean the tub and very sturdy to move around. The only grouse I have is about the sling. It tends to get stinky once a week. Nothing a quick wash doesn't cure but it took us a couple of days to figure why the tub suddenly started stinking.I know there are advanced versions of this tub, with soothing noise and all that jazz. But I really see no point in buying those because bath time is generally the most perfect time to bond with your baby. Why would you need any other distraction??
