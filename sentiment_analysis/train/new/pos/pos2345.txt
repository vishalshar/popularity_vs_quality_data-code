I've only had this for about 2 months but I'm really enjoying it.  Most recently, we used it on a trip to Key West and Miami where we did a ton of walking.  This backpack carried everything I needed and more.  I had plenty of room for diapers, wipes, bottled water, snacks, toys, camera, and all my mommy-essentials like sunglasses, sunscreen, wallet, keys, chapstick, etc.  I love all the pockets on the inside too.  I used the changing pad a ton when we were at the Seaquarium and Parrot Jungle.  It really came in handy and its nice that it has its own storage pouch so it doesn't come it contact with anything else.  The insulated pouch on the side is great for carrying drinks and they're easy to access at any time.  This backpack also keeps it shape well if you set it down.  It doesn't fall over either.  Overall, we're extremely happy with it.  Also, the colors are great for my husband who felt it was masculine enough for him to carry all day :)  I only have one child right now so it's not such a great item for everyday use like grocery shopping, etc. but I'll be having baby #2 very shortly and this will be great for keeping my arms free.  I would definitely recommend this product for travel and for those with multiple children.
