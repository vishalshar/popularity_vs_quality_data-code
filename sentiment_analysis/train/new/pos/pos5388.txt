As far as the actual ballerina piggy bank goes, it is as adorable as can be and deserves 5 stars. BUT I am very disappointed in the false advertising that illustrates the bank on top of a wonderful looking gift box which it is SUPPOSED to come in. That was definitely a selling point to me and I can't believe that you would mislead your customers.
