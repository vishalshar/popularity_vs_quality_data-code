This little doohicky helped me successfully breast feed my daughter for months until she was big enough and capable enough to latch on, on her own without my help and guidance.  I have large flat nipples that don't stay out much at all, no matter how much I tried to manipulate them too.  Even a hospital grade Medela Symphony pump could only get them to stay out for about a minute after I stopped pumping.  I made sure to keep a handful of these nipple shields around so I could breastfeed my daughter easily all the time.  I even had a case for them (you can google them and find some) and used them when we were out and about. After about 3 months we were able to stop using them because our daughter was big enough and had the know how to latch on by herself.  Don't let anyone discourage you from using these if you need or want to.  I didn't suffer any low supply nor did I get any clogged ducts while using mine.  They can be somewhat hard to come by.  I found mine at a local resale shop (NOT USED! lol!) that was also the local LLL meeting place and they sold all sorts of Medela products and bras and even rented out pumps.  All of the breastfeeding supplies were new in the package.  They even did nursing bra measurements for you there.  It was really nice.  The were a bit stingy on these nipple shields though.  They kept them behind the counter because they didn't really want them to be used.  It's beyond me as to why some hard core breast feeders are so against these when they can really help women breastfeed their children for longer. I was discouraged from using them with my son and regret it because we didn't successfully form and breastfeeding relationship.  After I ignored the 'experts' the second time around with my daughter and used them long term anyway, we successfully breast fed until 9 months and would have gone longer had I not been back to work and pumping.  DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU!!!
