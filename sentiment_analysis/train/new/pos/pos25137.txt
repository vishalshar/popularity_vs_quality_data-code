I have a Medela pump system for a couple of months but I keep looking for something else that fits my need as a busy working mother.  I wanted something that I can quickly put it on underneath my shirt, hands free while driving or working on the computer.  I came across this one and I have to say that it's the best system, especial the cups.  It's so easy and quick to assemble.  I wish I know about this system earlier so I don't have to buy the Medela system.  I would highly recommend this product to all new moms.
