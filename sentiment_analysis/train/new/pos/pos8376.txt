Very useful product. I have what I think are called designer switches (as opposted to traditional switches). My only complaint is that these extenders are awkward- I must pull it away from the wall and hold it for a second to keep the light on. If I quickly move it (as you would if it were just the lightswtich) the light comes on but then the weight of the extender pushes the switch back down. Sometimes it takes two or three tries to get the light on because of this. It is a minor frustration, not anything that would discourage me from purchasing.I do not believe you would have this problem on traditional switches. It certainly makes my toddler feel like a big girl, and prevents me from having to escort her around the house to turn on lights.
