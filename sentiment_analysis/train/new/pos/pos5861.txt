You HAVE TO GET THIS crinkle book!  I have now bought two because my baby started teething at 3 months and is now 10 months and has totally worn out the knots on this thing!  First of all he loves the crinkle sound and mostly he can't get enough of the knots!  I have to keep washing it so he has it available for those tough days and it's holding up really well except for the knots, those have gone pretty much bald, lol....either way I bought the first one when he was about 3 months and the second one recently so it has lasted a while.  This way he can have one available while the other is in the wash.  I feel completely comfortable letting baby chew away on these knowing they're completely safe for my baby. I will be buying these as gifts for all my new mommy friends!
