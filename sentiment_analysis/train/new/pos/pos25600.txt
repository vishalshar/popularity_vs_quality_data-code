This is a solid buy.  I bought this to replace a caMera monitor system that was a gift three years ago.  I was glad it stopped working because my wife would look at it constantly through all hours of the night.---This has the temperature alert which is awesome because some parents just don't think.  Also,  the temperature display itself is such a convenience.  My son's room needs re insulated, meaning its hot in the summer's and cold during the winters.  This let's me know from the hand held monitor if the room has dipped or risen in temperature.---It plays a few different lullabies clearly, has a handy night light built in that omits a soft yellow glow, and I haven't had any issues with the connectivity, ever.---It has a walkie talkie function to talk to the base in the babies room.  This is some thing I never expected to actually work.  My son stays down for naps longer and sleeps longer because when he let's out a couple cries I quickly grab the handheld,  tell him daddy's right here,  and "shhhhh"  him.  It's worked darn near every time to comfort him before he knew what was going on. I hope this review helps.  Trust in this product.  I suspect mine will last until my current 1 month old doesn't need a monitor any longer.
