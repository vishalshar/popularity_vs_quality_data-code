I was a little skeptical buying this because of some of the reviews about a difficult install or hard to open or cheap product. I think it looks great! It was super easy to install! and to open and close it isnt bad at all. It is great for people with small dogs/pets and babies. I can see where a larger breed dog would probably break through the thin plexiglass if they rammed it hard enough. But for my 3 small dogs it works great and looks great too! I highly reccomend it. We upgraded from a pressure mounted baby gate that destroyed the walls cause it moved all the time (super annoying). This looks better and attaches nicely to the wall. I think some people are just clueless.
