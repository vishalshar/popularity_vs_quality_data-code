GREAT buy. Exactly what I needed for my stupid car that only has ONE cup-holder for the driver.FYI, It fits a VitaminWater bottle (bigger size bottle, in the cup with the open notches, shown on the left). Typical water bottles fit perfect as do a variety of my other coffee travel mugs.The whole thing is a sort of firm foam material... just sturdy enough yet just flexible enough to squeeze in larger bottles.Perfect.
