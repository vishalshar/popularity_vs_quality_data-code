I was having a hard time finding just the right crib sheet for my son's nautical theme nursery that didn't cost an arm and a leg. This crib skirt is exactly what I was looking for at the right price. Despite some negative reviews, I bit the bullet and bought it anyway. I'm so glad I did! The quality of the fabric feels nice - not too thick or thin, and the navy blue is a true navy. I am only commenting on the quality of the fabric at this point because I have not yet put it on the crib. I will come back once it is in place and comment on the fit. So far, I am very pleased. :)*** edit to add that the skirt has now been added to the crib and it is a perfect fit and it looks amazing.  Only needed a light steam to release the few wrinkles.  I'm dumbfounded by the negative reviews.  It is a really nice crib skirt.
