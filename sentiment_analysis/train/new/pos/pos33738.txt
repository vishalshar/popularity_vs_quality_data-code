this necklace is beautiful! sure, it looks like plastic. But its also very pretty and well made. The beads go up a lot farther than it appears in the picture. My nine month old little dude loves to gnaw on this. He has 6 teeth, and doesn't appear to have comprimised the integrity of the silicone yet. Nice packaging, would buy for gifts for expectant moms. Included a photo so you could see the actual necklace.
