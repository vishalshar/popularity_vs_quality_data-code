I have tried a variety of cloth diapers.  I like the flips the best.  They pull the moisture away so that baby stays happy and they can really hold a lot!  I also like how the size is adjustable which eliminates buying several different sized inserts.  I use them as an all-in-two so I don't have to wash the cover every single time the baby pees.
