I purchased this diaper bag for my daughter. Her baby is 3 weeks old, so she hasn't had the opportunity to use it for an extended time period.  It is nicer looking and sturdier than the diaper bags I was finding in stores. Cheaper bags in stores were at least $20 higher in price and in my opinion were inferior to this bag. It has a changing pad, a bag for powders, lotions etc. and a good number of inside pockets for bottles and such. My daughter loves this bag because it is more stylish than other bags. I was also surprised that it arrived so quickly -2-3 days- and that was right before Christmas when shipping times are usually longer. If it's as sturdy as it seems it should last quite awhile. I would totally recommend this bag to/for anyone.
