Talk about over-priced items for a nursery. Do they do this because they know we want it all to match? It is a nice mobile and It goes great withe the Vintage Aviator decor, but I would really only pay $20 for it if I had the option. Maybe look on Ebay for a used one, since the babies don't really touch it anyway.
