My mom has mobility issues so she likes to prop open her door when she knows someone is coming but has a hard time with anything on the floor.  These are perfect.  She keeps a leaf in the corner and then moves it with her foot when she needs it.  It is cute on the floor and practical for her purposes.  I ordered four based on other reviews that higher doors need two but her door only needs one so she can change out colors as she likes.  Could not have ordered a better door stop for her!
