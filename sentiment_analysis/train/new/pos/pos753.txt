I purchased this one and the jungle one as well for my 2 grandsons. They are very cute and I would recommend this to anyone who was looking for a way to secure the pacifier so it doesn't get lost or fall on the floor. We puchased these because we were going to Disney World and certainly would not want to lose the binkies! Worked perfect and even they liked them as they were kinda a toy but yet had a purpose! So we were happy and so were they! These are adorable~ Love these and Haba toys as well.
