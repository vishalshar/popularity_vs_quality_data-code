This bouncer has a seat with the least incline of all the Fisher-Price bouncers, and it is suitable for a very young baby without much head control. Of the three bouncers we've owned, this one is my favorite. The melody of the music moves between the left and right speakers and features a variety of instruments and sounds to stimulate the baby's mind. The toys are within reach of a small baby and the mirror overhead is interesting to our baby (though it might be more interesting if it weren't so convex).Fisher-Price is not a reliable brand and this bouncer is no exception. The baby's right-hand toy mount does not trigger the music when it is pulled as the left-hand toy mount does. The vibration motor in the Sensory bouncer we received had a high-pitched whine as if a ball bearing were going bad. The two other bouncers we've tried include the rainforest bouncer (the volume control periodically changes to "loud" on its own) and the puppy bouncer (though the baby loves the puppy face, the poor connection in the arch often turns off the music, and the toys are out of reach for all but the biggest babies).
