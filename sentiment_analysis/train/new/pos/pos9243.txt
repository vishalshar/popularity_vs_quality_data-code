This is a very good toy for the money.  Both my 4 1/2 daughter and 1 1/2 son like it-- it's nice to have something which doesn't get slimey and nasty after being in the tub.  It hangs from the towel bar in our tub when not in use.  I like that they can play with it creatively, making up names and voices for the cars-- no flashing lights or noises, just simple fun. It is small enough that both kids can fit in the tub with it, but large enough that they can play together.  Personally, I think it would be cooler if the wheels actually turned, but neither of my kids seem to mind.
