As a new mom buying a booster seat, I swore I wouldn't be that mom who gives my child snacks or drinks in the car that make massive messes. Well, guess what. This more tried and true mom threw that out the window during a 20 minute drive to a friends house and hearing my child howling like death would be upon her if I didn't give her water or food. I would like to mention I fed and gave her a drink before we went, but toddlers love to be dramatic. We call my daughter dram-Maddie. Now that food and drinks in the car is a staple of our car ride I needed a cup holder, this worked perfect. I even attach it to my jogger for my water. Extremely versatile and my daughter can have a place for her after daycare drive home drink.
