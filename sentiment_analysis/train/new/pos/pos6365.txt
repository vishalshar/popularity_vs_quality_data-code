We have twins and, while one had an aptitude for lifting a regular sippy-cup to get to its contents, the other took longer to grasp the concept.  We decided to try cups with straws.  This worked for her but got messy whenever she would drop it (i.e. throw it).  Ergo, we needed something as spill-proof as a regular sippy-cup.  This cupsicle worked wonderfully!  She preferred using this because of the handles.  We preferred it because the straw disappears.  Since she started using these, she even took great pleasure in achieving the goal of closing it herself (opening it still takes adult assistance).  We love that the contents stay cooler longer.  We originally purchased these at Target but then couldn't find them anymore.  Our friends have been on the hunt, too, after seeing our girl with one.  They've checked Walmart and Babies R' Us with no luck.  They're a bit pricier than regular sippy-cups but well worth the investment.They're sturdy when dropped but we did have one split at the lid.  Occasionally, when opening-up the straw, some fluid left in the straw reserve may splatter a bit.  There are several components to the assembly that make cleaning time a bit longer.  Must have a pipe-cleaner-type of brush for cleaning the straw.  Otherwise, I highly recommend for transitioning from bottles to cups - especially if you don't like messes.
