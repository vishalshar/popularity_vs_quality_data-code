I have five (5) sets of these for making homemade baby food. I had 2 but purchased additional after seeing how useful they were.Pros:-6 pack helps portion meals or make additional flavors/food varieties-2oz is a nice serving size for infants when learning to eat solid foods-Freezer friendly. I've never had freezer burn on any of my baby's meals. The seal is very good and the food was always fresh-Dishwasher friendly - I would disassemble the tops and put all pieces into dishwasher baskets to make sure they stayed on the top rack-Easy to disassemble and disassemble. I've never had issues properly putting the lid on, or taking it apart. I've never had an o-ring separate-Clear plastic allows to easily see the contents-Included tray: Makes it incredibly easy to stack in the freezer and keep organized-Never had a leakCons:-I think $10 per set is a little steep, but I paid it.Overall: I think these are great if you're making your baby homemade baby food. I'm a full time working mom and these were really easy to use, fill and reuse. I would make a giant batch of different fruit and vegetable mixes over the weekend and grab one or two each day to pack my son for daycare. We can continue to use these for other small portions of food or even salad dressing. OXO makes great stuff, and I recommend these.
