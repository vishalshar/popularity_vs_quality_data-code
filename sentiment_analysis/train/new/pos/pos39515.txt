The bottles are smaller than the Medela bottles, but 1/10th the price, so I say go for it!  They fit my PIS Advanced perfectly!The only problems with them are:1. The lids come in two pieces, which means they are not airtight.  I think they do this so the ring can be a lid or you can put a nipple in, but I don't feel comfortable storing my milk in bottles that can let other fridge air in, so I just bought more Medela lids - still cheaper than buying Medela bottles and they fit perfectly.2. They get cloudy from sanitizing with boiling water, but I don't use them for looks so it doesn't bother me.3. I find them REALLY HARD to hold on to.  If they are empty, they constantly slip out of my hands.  It's almost like the plastic is waxy.  I don't have the problem when they are full though.
