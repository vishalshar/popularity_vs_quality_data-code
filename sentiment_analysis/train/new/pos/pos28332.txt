I needed to buy my older son a new car seat because his little brother was going to inherit his old one.  He is still small enough to require the 5 point harness, but soon will not need it so wanted one that would become a booster.  I did a lot of looking and research, and this seat is just what I expected.  I love it, and most importantly my son loves it!  It is really easy to set up and install.  My only complaint is the weight.  With the base that doesn't detach (has a cup holder if you are into that), it is a lot of weight.  We don't move car seats around at all so this should be no big deal for me.  If you are someone always moving seats around it installs easily and quickly, but just be warned it's a bit heavy.  Once I installed this seat I realized how unsafe the old seat was.  I didn't realize how tight the seat could fit into the car, and I even had the old seat safety inspected!  So I bought a second one for my younger son, and I feel confident that the two boys are safe and secure! By the way, my other weight concern is that we are going to have to lug two of these with us when we travel by plane. Even with that being said, I would definitely recommend purchasing this seat!
