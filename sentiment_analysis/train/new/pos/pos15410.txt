No bulb syringe is ever as effective as I want it to be, but you can't beat these for the price. They get the job done as well as any other and best of all, you can take them apart and clean them. No nast mystery muck gets stuck inside these little guys. A tip: when you squeeze the syringe, do it by placing your thumb on the back end and pushing in toward the front. Because of the removable tip, this works better than squeezing the sides toward the middle. Otherwise you lose the vacuum.
