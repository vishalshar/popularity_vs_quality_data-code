I picked up the Sprout diaper for my 18-month-old son. We've used prefolds since birth and they were great until about 15 months old. Since then my son is zooming around and the prefolds are way too bulky. Plus, trying to lay him down for a diaper change at the park causes a big fuss every time. So we ordered three different diaper brands to give them a try. The Sprout diaper is perfect for us. We didn't have to adjust the elastic at all (my son is about 25 pounds and it fits him just right). We were impressed by how soft and absorbent the liner is, and how smooth the cover feels (no sticky PUL against his skin). Today was the real test - a trip to the park. When he needed a change, we did the whole thing standing up. Just pull down his pants a bit, unsnap one side of the Sprout cover, switch out the insert, snap it back together and pull up his pants. He was off and running again in record time, with no whining. Hooray! I'm back at Amazon now to order a second set.
