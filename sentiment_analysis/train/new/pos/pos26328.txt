See my review for our fancy Glenna Jean changing pad cover, which was horrible! (It shrunk and faded after one wash in cold water and laying flat to dry!).  This was our "back-up" plain and non-fancy-shmancy cover.  We actually like it way better.  It's organic cotton, it fits our changing pad perfectly, and most importantly, still retains its same size and shape after being washed according to the manufacturer's instructions.  I highly recommend this changing pad cover.  It's simple, gets the job done, is made in the USA, and will match nearly every baby's room.  Two thumbs up!
