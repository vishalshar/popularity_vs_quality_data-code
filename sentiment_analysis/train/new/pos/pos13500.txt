Basically, I don't like my baby crawling on dirty surfaces, not even our own carpet inside of our home. This all-purpose blanket is great, I use it my bedroom on the floor so my baby can crawl around and play with her toys and I take it with me everywhere. Whether I am visiting a relative or going outdoors, I love that I can use this blanket everywhere. My only concern with it is that it's very flat because it's waterproof (which makes it easy to dry when wet), on the downside, I used it at a relative's house where there is no carpet, my baby rolled over and hit her face somewhat hard so since then I use a quilted blanket underneath or above this item if using indoors on hard wood floors, tile or concrete surfaces to prevent injury if child just learning to crawl and rollover. Only other thing that concerned me was that I was outdoors during baby's nap time and she fell asleep, since the material on top of the blanket isn't cotton it doesn't breathe well and she was sweating a lot because of the material. I gave this item 5 stars because it definitely serves it's purpose and can be used everywhere, just need to take some extra precautions if your child is still an infant: like place a quilted blanket along top/bottom for extra support and either don't let your baby nap outdoors on this blanket or bring a cotton blanket to layer on top of this item if your baby going to nap on it.
