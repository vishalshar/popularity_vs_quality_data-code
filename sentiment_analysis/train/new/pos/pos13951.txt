I never write reviews, but this thing right here! This is the best piece of plastic I own. We have a claw foot rub and shower with nowhere for storage. We were using one of those metal caddy's that have a spot for your book, wine glass, etc. to keep shampoos and stuff. It started rusting and getting all over the soap. This thing is the perfect solution. Slide it to the front during a bath. Slide it to the back to shower. Amazing.
