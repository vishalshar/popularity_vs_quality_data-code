I have a small apartment and was hesitant to buy a full size high chair, but ended up with this one after reading a ton of reviews.  It is a great product. No assembly and very easy to use. Chair pad and tray wipe up clean, easier than my baby does!! Folds easily and quickly, fits in the small space on the side of my dryer. My only complaint is I wished it came with a Graco "mix and move" toy which attaches to the under-tray (optional)... Only because they are hard to find, but handy. happy shopping!
