I have tried several diapers... AIO, prefolds with thirsties cover, bummis, etc. I was so excited when I saw the gro baby diaper and was hoping it would be as good as I thought.  This diaper is so well made and the snap in soaker is so soft!  The fit is perfect!  My dauhter is almost 6 months and I have it on the second snap and there is still plenty of room to grow before I will have to adjust to the bigger size.  The soakers do take about 5 to 7 washes before they reach their maximum absorbency.  I have had no leaks and am really happy with my gro baby diapers. The colors are so fun and the covers wash up great!  Perfect 10!!
