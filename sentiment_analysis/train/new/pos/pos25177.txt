This is an inexpensive solution to the problem we have of contaminating or even misplacing our infant's toys.I use this to tie his Oball and other favorite toys to both his car seat and Baby Bjorn, which keep them close-at-hand. It also prevents them from falling to the floor, which is important since he's our first child and we all know that there's no "5 second rule" for your first-born!The only nitpick I have is that I would've loved a few more buttons along the strip of fabric. This would give us a few more options on attaching his toys. For example, we could shorten the length that the toy extends on this 'leash' so that it doesn't get caught in his car seat base. It would also allow for our child to retrieve the toy since we could ensure it does not extend beyond his reach (even by using the closest buttons possible, the toys are still a bit out of reach).I still give this 5 stars since it does what it promises and it's reasonably priced. Many baby products like this cater to a niche market, so they're priced higher than they should be (like stroller hooks!). But not this one - it's a great value!
