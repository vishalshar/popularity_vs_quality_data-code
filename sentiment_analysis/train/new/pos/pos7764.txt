This is in my top 5 baby purchases. I wish I had it with my first child. I have a Graco Snug Ride 35 and it fits perfectly. This shower cap style cover is better than the large drapey ones, in my opinion. It does a great job protecting the baby from wind and rain which is fantastic when they have fallen asleep but you still have to get out of the car and go to the grocery store. An especially good buy if you have a fall/winter baby. It's not too heavy to create an overheating situation.
