I love this mobile because it matches the rest of the bedding and gives my little guy a cute groups of "friends" to watch. The characters hang a bit unevenly so I wedged a few quarters on one corner to even it out. The song is great, but doesn't last very long. Overall, I would recommend and think it is very sweet.
