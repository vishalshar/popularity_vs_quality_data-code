I haven't used any other pacifier clips so I don't know how this compares to others but I can say we love this one. It stays clipped to her bib, clothes or the car seat belt and it doesnt leave any indents on them. My little one can't undo it- she is 8 months now and it prevents her pacifier from falling to the ground or somewhere under her. The only gripe I have is that you have to undo the clip in order to get the pacifier off the string, but I dont know how else that would work. We use it with the Sootheis, Avent and Nuk pacifiers and they all work well with it. The string is long eough that you can attach it to the bottom of the bib or even the pocket part of my Baby K'tan carrier and she can still suck on it. I like the color options and we have been using ours (we have 2) for about 6 months now and they still  hold up and do not look at all worn.
