Nipple is very large which my 6 week old baby much prefers. Plus added bonus, the router. Part is shaped so that it never blocks the baby's nostrils at all!After trying literally every pacifier at target, I pulled out an old binky my older son used and sterilized it, (this paci was called "binky" and had a rather large nipple) lo and behold he kept it in his mouth the whole nap (others he would spit out after about 30 Seconds)Of course they don't make that kind anymore, so the search began for a comparable one which is how I stumbled upon these. They arrives yesterday and my son has used them all night and today. So any old school "binky" fans will appreciate that this is a solid alternative!
