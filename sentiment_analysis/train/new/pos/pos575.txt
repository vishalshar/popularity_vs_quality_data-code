this adaptor comes with a bunch of different pieces to fit most car seats but we chose the Maxi-Cosi Mico Infant Car Seat seats specifically because they are the only car seats that will "snap" right in (these are the car seats baby jogger uses in all their marketing material). other seats require use of bars and straps and seemed much less convenient. the car seats were not our first choice and they're a little pricier than i would have liked but we figured being able to just pop them in and out quickly was going to make enough of a difference that we would compromise.if you're using the maxi-cosi seats, installing the adaptor takes ten seconds. it just clicks into place and then the car seats snap into it. it's a little more complicated if you're using another type of seat. you can download the pdf instruction manual from the baby jogger website to see what it would entail.
