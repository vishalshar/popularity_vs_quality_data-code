I bought this set for my son when he was about 5 months old and I have been thrilled at how he has enjoyed it as he has passed from stage to stage.At first, with limited mobility, he liked holding it or looking at the bright colors. Once he was crawling, he started batting it across the room with his hand, then chasing it excitedly. Now that he is starting to throw things, I am glad that this soft, plush ball is a favorite toy, because it can safely be thrown without hurting anything (or anyone).The ball is soft and light, making it easy to grab and lift with one hand. It has a quiet bell inside which is fun for him but not annoying to me.Admittedly, he has largely ignored the cube, but this set was well worth the very affordable price for the ball alone. It has given our son hours upon hours of enjoyment. When he comes into his playroom, it's often the first thing he looks for. It's nice knowing that anytime he's getting cranky, I can just pull out the ball and he'll be smiling and playing.Sometimes the simple toys are the ones they love best. That's certainly been the case for our boy!
