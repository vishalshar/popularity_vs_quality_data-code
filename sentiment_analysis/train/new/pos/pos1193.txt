I fell in love with this tumbler when I saw it.  It's very light, dishwasher safe and it's Hello Kitty, what can I say.  The only issue I've had with this is, when I hand wash it, it does scratch pretty easily.  Always use a soft sponge and never a scouring pad or the rough side of a sponge.  It WILL leave unsightly scratch marks, so treat this with care.I took off one star because I thought it was a little bit more scratch resistant.
