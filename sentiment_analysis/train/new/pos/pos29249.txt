I was making a diaper cake. I needed a duck for the top. I originally wanted one of those wooden ducks kids pull, but my husband said something soft was better. So I started searching and when we saw this it was perfect. A mamma duck with a baby duck. It's so perfect for the diaper cake. I know that he will love cuddling with it too when he's old enough. My 5 month old loved it before I put it on the cake.
