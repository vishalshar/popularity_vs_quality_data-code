I did take into consideration other peoples reviews of this product. I am trying to get my 3rd kid at the kitchen table. I have tried the regular high seat (really loved but too small kitchen), the plastic one that "straps to the chair" not very well and wont slide under my table and I have decided I wish they had come out with this 9 years ago for my oldest. It is exactly what I was looking for. I have wooden wide chairs that is does strap to very tightly without wiggling. My kid is on the smaller side so he does fit in it perfectly. Some of the other ones I found let him move around to much not good for safety. But I can push in my chair fully and love the fact that it inflats. He is short and now he can sit at the table like the big kids without any restictions. Love the fact it is portable too. Now a days we do find ourselves going out more so it is awesome and takes up no space when on the move. A huge fact when you have 3 kids and have to bring everything but the kitchen sink. So I really love this product! It does work perfect for me and my family.
