I am a woman who's always been obsessed with finding the right purse, so you can imagine that obsession only escalated when my daughter came along and forced me to carry even more crap around requiring even more organization. I've been using the Spark by Skip Hop for about 6 months now, which was okay, until the stroller strap jammed and I had to slice the strap with a pocket knife in a crying-baby-moment-of-desperation. The bag had a lot of issues making it less than ideal, but it was decent.I shopped every store and website you could think of to find my replacement. I was willing to spend a good amount of money IF and only if I could find a bag that had every single thing I wanted -- and lo and behold, the Ava from Bumble Bags is IT. Here is what makes this bag priceless to me:-Awesome, unique, edgy design (I have the midnight garden print).-Light green interior makes finding things possible (versus my old bag's black interior that was constantly mistaken for a black hole).-Organization! It has 2 small open outer side pockets, 2 large outer zipper pockets, 2 inner bottle holders, 1 inner zipper pocket, 1 inner open pocket and the included little mini-bag that serves as my wallet/cell phone holder so I can take that on a quick store run without needing the whole bag.-Despite all the pockets, this bag is not enormous! It just looks like a large purse, yet holds the same amount that my old enormous bag held.-4 metal feet allow it to keep shape and stand up when set on the floor.-Very lightweight but sturdy, stain/water-resistant material.-Excellent stroller straps that allow the diaper bag's weight to be adjusted on the handle, meaning if you adjust it right, the weight won't tip your stroller backwards when you take your baby out.-Adjustable handle that allows you to use the bag on your shoulder or across your body.-Amazon is offering it at a crazy-low price, with free shipping! And it arrived at my house within 2 business days!-It will make the perfect purse once it's fulfilled its duty as a diaper bag.
