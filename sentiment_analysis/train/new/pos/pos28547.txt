We needed more pantry space and this was a cheap option to get it.  The first one came damaged and missing parts, but they replaced it so that is not a problem.  The bottom of the drawers is weak, and the drawer facces come off too easily, but I can add an angle to strengthen that joint and use the drawers for lighter foods so I am happy with the product.  The color is wonderfull.
