These have become our favorite bottle (and after 3 kids, we've used many). As far as stainless steel bottles, they beat Pura Kiki and Think Baby when it comes to leaks (both of those brands will occasionally leak on us randomly after some use, organicKidz never have). I only wish you could see the measurement inside the bottle like ThinkBaby instead of just printed on the outside. That is the ONLY thing I don't like about these. They work great with many different wide nipples (Nuk, Avent classic, Pura, Born Free, Dr. Brown) but my absolute favorite nipple to use with these bottles are the Lansinoh mOmma nipples. They're the only nipples one of my babies would take, and the only wide nipple one of my other babies COULD take with his cleft lip. The organicKidz wide bottle with the mOmma nipple together make the perfect bottle IMO.Please note that there is a little silicone ring inside the bottle that, for whatever reason, tends to come out. I never found a way to put it back in. Once it comes out, you cannot tighten the plastic ring to the point of resistance. Is hasn't mattered though, the plastic ring still stays securely on without leaking (at least it has for us!) If you really want that nice tight feel, that might be one negative for you, but it doesn't bother me or my baby at all.
