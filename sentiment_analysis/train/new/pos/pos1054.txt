Hands down my favorite bag. I have this same bag with a different pattern on it and love it. It's handled a lot of milk, formula and juice being spilled and forgotten in it and being thrown in the washing machine countless times. I use it every single day. I used my last one for about 18 months and began praying something would happen to it to force me to have to buy a new one. The price is a little high so I kept telling myself I wouldn't buy a new one until I absolutely had to. To my surprise my surprise my husband bought this one for me for Christmas. I like this one a tiny bit more than my last one because the fabric has a plastic sort of coating to it so I bet it's gonna last even better and longer than my last one.  The only thing I'm kind of bummed out is that outside side, bottle pockets one of them is like a stitch smaller than the other side making it's a super tight squeeze  to put the bottles we use for one side. One side is perfect! We use the "munchkin" weighted straw silly cups so they're rather fat bottomed so I can't imagine many bottles running into this problem of not quiet fitting. And we don't often do much that makes me have to bring more than one bottle along with me. I only wear it as a backpack I feel naked without it. I get complements on it from everyone mom's, to men who don't realize it's also a diaper bag! It's going to be hard to ever transistion to anything other than this bag even when I don't need a big bag to carry my kids crap in. I'm planning to use it as my school backpack too. This is a bag that is worth the price because it does everything you need it to do and holds up really really well!
