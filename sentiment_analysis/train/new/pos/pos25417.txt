We bought this device because we were sick of sitting at the top of our stairs listening for our toddlers to stop messing around and get to bed.The features of this device looked perfect for our needs. You have a camera with night vision to see what's going on, you have the option for the receiver to stay silent until a loud noise is made, you have included rechargeable batteries so you can take the receiver and put it in a convenient place, plus you have the ability to talk to the kids with an intercom!Using it, we were able to see when our kids were getting up and playing when they were supposed to be going to sleep. The device worked like a charm! You just press a button and say "Get to bed" and they know they're busted and quickly scamper under the covers (sometimes grumpily crying, but they go). It's also benefitted us more than once in other important ways like seeing when our child got their leg caught in their bed frame so we knew they needed help and weren't just throwing a bedtime tantrum.Unfortunately, the device isn't quite perfect. The receiver often loses connection with the camera which you have to turn off then back on to get working again (which is bad news if you're trying to get kids to sleep). The night vision is also very flaky, turning on and off every few seconds throughout the night.The origin of the device is also a bit of a mystery. You get a box with product pictures, but literally no branding on it. No manufacturer claims to make the unit thus there's no manufacturer to stand behind it if something breaks. I tried Googling the model number and discovered this monitor comes from a factory in China, but it weirds me out that no one officially claims to make it.That said, there's no other baby monitor out there I know of that has both video and intercom capability and this unit gets the job done, so I recommend it despite its shortcomings.
