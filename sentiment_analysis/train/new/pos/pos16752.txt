I discovered these when my grand daughter was born.  They worked so well.  She was always kicking her socks off.  These kept the socks on.  When I got them for her I bought them in a department store in the mall.  Now 4 years later my other son had a baby due and I looked for them again but couldn't find them.  Ordering them from Amazon they come from a store in England.  It took a little longer to get here but they arrived in great shape.  I ordered another set for a friend.  They are just terrific for infants and older babies.
