Purchased this for our daugther over 18 months ago and we are still using the play-yard ... it is like new and is used on a daily basis! The colors are ADORABLE! It is easy to set up. The one issue I have is the wheels don't ROLL the way I would like them. Still easy to move. The wheels are not enough of an issue to knock this down a star so I still give the product 5 stars!Love the changing table on top with the wipes storage and diaper storage areas. This was a MUST in picking out a new play yard. We never used the canopy "toys" so I can't comment on those. The bassinet feature is fabulous and very easy to use.I would DEFINITELY recommend to others ... great price and excellent value and quality!
