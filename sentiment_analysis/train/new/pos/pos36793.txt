After using another brand sterilizer I got fed up with drying the bottles. Looked into a sterilizer and dryer and found the Wabi.I love it! It sterilize and completely dried the items within 1 hour. It fits 8 bottles and caps and nipples on the very top. I didn't stack it neatly next to one another in a row. I just layered it where it can still have the hot air hit it. Best purchase ever!
