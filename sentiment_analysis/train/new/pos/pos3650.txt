I searched High and Low for this product and kept finding the soft sided trays that are sold in stores like Buy Buy Baby etc. Most people purchase these soft side trays out of fear of their children being injured in a car accident, but they can rest assured this tray really is safe and once using this tray they will realize that it really truly is a safe option. Not to mention the soft sided trays are not practical or as useful as this tray.  After we found out we were moving across the country and knew we would be traveling for 4 full days on the road, our 2 year old needed something to be able to color, play, eat etc on.  I have been in my friends car and saw the use of the soft sided tray and I feel as though I can honestly review this as a better product.Here are the following reasons I like this product:-Strap goes behind car seat and can stay in place when tray is not attached making for easy attachment at a later time.-Tray sits on elevated edges of carseat and provides plenty of space away from their belly and legs so their movement does not affect it's use.-Has elevated lip on the edges to prevent crayons, puzzle pieces etc from sliding or rolling off.-Has a cup holder for a drink when they are having a snack on the road.-If in an accident the clips holding the tray in place can break away.-No sharp edges.-Strap is adjustable.-Tray is actually hard and sturdy decreasing the frustration of your child.-perfect for any activity for your childHere are a few of my tips to make use of this product the easiest and to decrease the frustration when you are traveling:-Install the strap to go through the area where the seat belt runs through for installation of the seat in the car (in the lumbar region) so the strap exits on the exterior portions of the seat so it can wrap around the outside of the seat and doesn't actually wrap around your child. Doing this is the safest installation of this product and keeps the tray able to be strapped in tightly and with the most stability during use.  (placing the straps here make it very easy to detach and reattach tray while traveling.-Keep one side of the tray attached to the strap when not in use so it's even more easily put back in place when needed.-Do a trial run of the product before your trip so you get a feel for putting it on and taking it off while on the road-this will minimize your frustration, and also you will be reassured of it's safety.-make sure you get a sippy cup that can fit in the cup holderI will be purchasing a second one for our second child once he moves into a convertible seat.
