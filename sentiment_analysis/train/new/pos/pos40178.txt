Pros: This crib seems to be sturdy, and well-constructed.  I don't get the feeling that it will fail or come apart accidentally.  I like the color.  According to the packaging this weighs 97 lbs in the box.  I was able to carry it upstairs on my own, with some difficulty.  It does include an allen wrench that you can use to assemble the crib, and it worked for me.  The wrench was a fairly soft metal but I finished the crib before it rounded out.Unfortunately, I had two issues with this crib that still really irritate me.  They label all of the small pieces, but the legs are all generally the same shape and completely unlabeled.  This led to an issue where I had to take the crib apart partially to switch one of the legs out.  The manual refers to these parts as "left rear leg" or "right front leg" but if I'm in the middle of assembly, I'm not always really sure which that really is.  Naming parts (but not labeling them!) based on their final destination is not helpful, particularly if some of the parts that look identical in the manual are intended to be left over initially.Second, the styrofoam used to take up empty space in the packaging will explode, leaving you with little tiny styrofoam balls statically attracted to everything in your house.  Expect to see them for perhaps the rest of your life.I'd probably buy this again but not bother cleaning the entire room before assembling because, why bother?  I'll just have to clean and clean and clean again to get the debris out.
