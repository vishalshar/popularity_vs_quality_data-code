I got one in plum, and I am crazy about it!first of all, it's an eye-catching stroller, it's elegant! Could I say a stroller elegant? I could put it in my living room as a decoration!Secondly, my daughter began to smile at those beautiful print on the sun shade when she was 2 month old, and now she touch those prints every time I put her in, I don't need to give her other toys to entertain.Thirdly,it's easy to assemble (only 10 minutes), easy to push,the material on the seat is thick and comfortable.It doesn't have cup holder, which is a little inconvenient, but keep in mind cup holder will ruin its beautiful design, practical and beautiful, I couldn't get both. And it does heavier than my Graco stroller, but that's not a big deal.Yes, $400 is costly, but if you shop around looking for a luxurious stroller, this one is really a great buy! Definitely 5 stars!
