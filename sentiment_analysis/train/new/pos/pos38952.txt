When I ordered this product, best seller stated delivery would take about a month.  It took about that long too, came 3 days before the expected date.  I ordered 2 of these and sent the other as a gift to my godson.  They got theirs and it worked good.  When the other one shipped to me for my 5 y.o. grandson, I placed brand new batteries in the compartment and it didn't light up.  Took them out and replaced them and it still didn't light up.  Thankfully my father is a handyman, he took a look and noticed the metal strip in the battery compartment where the springs attach that make the connection from the battery, was not all the way connected.  So he pushed the metal strip out a bit more and it made the connection.  I was thankful I didn't have to send it back because of having to wait another month to get a new one.  I contaced Best Seller right away and they were ready to replace, but did state they inspect everything before shipping out and they were both working before sending.  So I'm not sure how the metal strip would've been pushed back during shipment since this is in the batter compartment and the box was wrapped very good.  But with knowing it was working before they shipped it, that is why I had my father take another look at it before sending it back.  Plus the smile on my grandsons face when it lit up was all worth it. :)
