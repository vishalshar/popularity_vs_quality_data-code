I have used a Medela pump for a combined 15 months so far.  I exclusively pumped for my first child, so we used many bottles everyday.  The new lids on these bottles are so much easier to put on and off!  I would occasionally get a leaky lid with the old lids because I didn't tighten it correctly.  These never leak.I also love these bottles because Medela makes a nipple that goes right on the bottle.  I wish I had known about that with my first!  Our daughter likes the Medela nipple better than some of the more expensive bottles we have tried, and I love that I don't have to transfer milk to another bottle!
