Easily installed and easily the man reason we went with the Baby Jogger City Select - with our two kids we can comfortably get them in and walk through the neighborhood or two the park.  However there are a few downsides:- You cannot collapse the stroller with the additional child seat installed.- Since you most likely will have your 2nd child in front, the heaviness - as they grow - may cause some difficulty getting up and over sidewalks.- Once the second one is installed you can not have the Original (or top) Seat turned around to face you.All in all, it works and considering my wife and I walk almost everyday and that we have never had any major issues with it (besides those I listed - which can be resolved), we think that it is a must have; you know you bought the stroller for the possibility for a 2nd seat so you don't even need a review... just get it!
