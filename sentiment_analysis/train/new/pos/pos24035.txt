I ended up buying this activity table after much research because of the low reviews. (I always read low reviews when researching a purchase to see what complaints were. In this case they actually convinced me to buy the product!) My baby (10 month old at the time) is very busy and some of the tables only had one activity per side. The low reviews of this one said it has too much going on and that sold me! So glad I did because it does keep her occupied more than friends' ones she's used. I keep it in the kitchen and can get most of dinner made before she gets bored. It's funny to watch her put a ball in the middle and then squat down to see which leg it comes out through. She just circles it from one activity to the next and particularly like opening and closing the alligator mouth (and hiding things inside it). Another bad review said it is freaky and never shuts up. Well, there is an off switch right on top... Most songs are common kid ones and catchy. I like how you can flip between learning and just music to mix the sounds up. I am very glad I bought this table and definitely recommend for the busy child.
