The Toy fits Securely on the large Strollers, the umbrella stroller, and the infant car seat.  It fits everything just fine.  The 2 Velcro Straps are long, they stretch, wrap around the frame of the large stroller, slip through the plastic buckle and securely attach the toy to the stroller. The Play Pad attaches in front of the Stroller Tray and actually helps keep the baby from leaning too far forward.  The baby is 6 months old and she enjoys the toys.  The toys are colorful, they make noises, twist & turn, and keep baby interested while walking & shopping. The best toy is the Bee Rattle that is tethered to the pad and it "Buzzes" after it is pulled out and released.
