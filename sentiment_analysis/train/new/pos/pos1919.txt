I just started feeding my daughter foods other than breastfeeding. She won't eat anything out of a jar and she has no teeth so she can't chew. I've tried making her baby food and she won't eat that. Pureed foods out of a pouch have been a success for about three weeks now. I started giving her the food directly from the pouch and then a friend told me about spoons that connect to the pouch. I went out on a limb and did some research on a few different spoons and this is the one I liked most. It does fit very good on several different brands of pouch food and cleaning has been a breeze. The only issue I have with this spoon is the length of the actual spoon itself. Once you attach this spoon to the pouch and you squeeze the food onto the spoon, it takes a lot until my daughter can eat it. The entire spoon fills up before her mouth touches it and by then she's already grabbed the spoon to spill it all over the place. I think i'll keep looking for a smaller spoon. This spoon is not silicone as I hoped it would be but it is still very smooth. Despite the four stars the spoon does what it's supposed to do but I don't feel like it's targeted at new eaters.
