Even if you don't use the storage for anything, it sure protects the back of your seat from muddy little kid shoeprints - especially when they are up high in their car seat. I've had this since he started sitting forward in the carseat and now he's 4 and a half and I've never done anything except wipe juice off of it with a baby wipe. For the people complaining about the bottom compartment not staying closed - it's actually great for storing a wet umbrella since the top flap never really stays closed it dries nicely. I'm not sure what kind of excursions people are doing, expecting this to hold things while rock crawling, because it won't do that. (And seriously, if you're mudding - this would be kind of girly to have in your rig anyway).Perfect for vehicles that drive on roads to hold your kids sunglasses and firetrucks but most importantly keep their damn feet off the back of your seat!
