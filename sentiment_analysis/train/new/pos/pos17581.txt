This review is for Bright Starts Bloom and Rattle, Pretty in Pink. My baby loved this rattle! When  her first one went missing, we turned to Amazon to find a suitable replacement. We were pleased to see that Amazon had the exact kind that went missing.What I like about this product is:{1} The petals make crinkling sounds, like crumpling a piece of paper. Any baby that loves trying to reach elusive pieces of paper that moms/dads takes away, will love this sound.{2} The rattle also makes the sound of little beads being shook (rattling sound), when shaken from side to side. Good for babies that like to shake things.{3} It is made of soft material versus hard plastic. Easy for babies to hold and squeeze or even put in their mouth.{4} The petals have a silk-like feel on the back, adding a different type of texture the baby can feel.{5} I also read that the pretty in pink product would give some proceeds to support breast cancer research. It supports a good cause.{6} The price isn't too bad, considering some toys cost more than $5 dollars for just one toy.
