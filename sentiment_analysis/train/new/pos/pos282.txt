My baby loves all 3 pieces!RATTLEShe loved the sound of the rattle from birth, and since then she learned to grasp the handle or rings and manipulate the rattle. She has put it in her mouth many times and there are no loose pieces or rough surfaces to be found.RINGShe learned to appreciate the ring a few months later, holding it with two hands and instantly putting it in her mouth. After several months the hemp has shown no wear and tear and she enjoys it more and more as she is getting ready for her teething phase.CUP & EGGSome time after starting the ring, she started with the cup. It took her a while to be able to hold the cup - for weeks shy watched me hold it and play the "in/out" game as described in the package. She eventually was able to hold it at the rim, and after more weeks she could hold it at the base. After additional weeks she can grasp the egg.I list these timeline-like details to illustrate how this set endures over at least 6 months, and the baby enjoys them and manipulates them in new ways over time. Now I place them in her jumper for her to find and play with independently. A worthy investment.Please note, after rinsing the cup with water, it is ever so slightly rough but still without splinters or hazards of any kind.
