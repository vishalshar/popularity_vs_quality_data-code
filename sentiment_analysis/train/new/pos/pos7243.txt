My "babies" are now 6 and 7 and I will say this is hands down the best bum balm made! My oldest had terrible sensitivities to formula and unfortunately due to being so little at birth had to be supplemented with a bottle. He would literally sigh in relief when I put this on his tush when he had bad diaper relief-- which cracked me up. We had tried everything and all the typical recommended balms and ointments to no avail. That's when I remembered this balm, given to me by a caring but overly "natural" friend. Not gonna lie, I was skeptical. Hahaha. This was all I ever used, even as they became toddlers, it worked the few times they got sick and had sensitivity from diarrhea (TMI but true) I ended up sending this to every new mom I knew over the years and every single one has asked where to find it to buy more.Like another reviewer mentioned it's a great little balm to use after each diaper change, not just when there is an issue. Either way, we loved it!
