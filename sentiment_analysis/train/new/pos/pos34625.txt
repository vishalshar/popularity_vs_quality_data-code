We were originally drawn to this cup because of the environmental aspect and the fact that children my family knows love theirs'.  My daughter has been using traditional plastic cups for years, but my son was having trouble making the transition from bottles.  We thought we'd try these for him and get the added benefit of less chemicals.It was obvious as soon as I opened the package that it was going to leak.  The opening in the spout was too large not to.  Sure enough, some milk came out when I held the bottle upside down.  To my surprise, the flow stopped after only a couple of drops.  I realized that they would be no good for my son, but I gave it to my daughter to use and she LOVED it.Because I was confused that people would make the claim that these bottles do not leak, I did some more research (which I should have done in the first place.)  It turns out that BornFree makes Drinking Cups AND Training Cups.  What distinguishes the two is the volume of the bottle and the spouts, hard spout for the drinking and soft for the training.  I bought a Training Cup.  The soft spout has a much smaller opening.  When I held a full bottle upside down it did not leak.  I gave it to my son and he LOVED it.  It is by far his favorite sippy cup.  His bottles are going in the recycling bin this weekend.If you child can be relied on to keep his/her cup upright, the drinking cup is great.  If she/he cannot, try to the training cup or get the drinking cup, a package of the soft spout and save the hard ones for when he/she is bigger.
