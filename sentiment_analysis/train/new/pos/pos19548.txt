I was very nervous when I ordered this, as all of the pregnancy pillows I looked at had very mixed reviews. I have to say that I am SO HAPPY I ordered this one. It is HUGE so be prepared (but fits comfortable on King bed with two people). A few of the reviews said that it felt cheap and that the stuffing would clump up or separate over time, but this is no more than any normal body pillow and I have had zero problems and just shake it out like you would with any pillow to get it to fluff up again (and I have only had to do that once or twice). Reviews also said that it is impossible to get the cover back on after you wash it, but just DO NOT dry it and hang it to dry instead. I didn't dry mine and I was able to get the cover back on with minor difficulty. It does not feel cheap to me at all, is very soft/fluffy, and is a huge help with keeping you comfortable sleeping on your side during pregnancy. I actually flipped it around (opposite from the picture) and rest my feet where the head usually rests, as this is more comfortable to me. After using this every night for months I really don't know how I could sleep without it now. GREAT PRODUCT!
