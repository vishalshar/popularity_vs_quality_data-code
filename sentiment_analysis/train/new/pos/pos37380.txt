I bought this stroller for a trip where we needed a compact umbrella stroller but wanted all the bells and whistles of a larger stroller. Our daughter is 16 months, and weighs about 20lbs.  After doing a lot of searching I settled on this one. It worked well for our trip.Pros: small and lightweight (important for plane, train, and streetcar travel), handles well (no trouble steering with one hand), large stroller basket which was essential, tray for baby to eat on (key when traveling unless you want to hold food for your child every time he/she wants to eat a snack on the run), tray for parent belongings and small personal items (key for holding the Starbucks cup when you're staggering around the airport at o'dark thirty!), includes sun canopy, seat reclines so baby can sleep comfortably.Cons: No window in canopy so can't see how baby is doing, does not ride smoothly on rough or bumpy terrain (we were in Norway and I literally had to tilt the stroller up to get over even small bumps in the sidewalks and streets.  I failed to do this once and my poor daughter almost got pitched out of the stroller. However, streets in Norway nearly require 4-wheel drive strollers, so this may not be an issue for many people), difficult to collapse and latch for holding stroller when collapsed does not function well, 3-point harness (I would've preferred 5-point), buckles on harness are tight and gave me a pinch a couple of times, overall quality is not robust.Bottom line: I think this stroller was well worth the $50 I paid for it a BRU. A Maclaren stroller with comparable features probably would've cost 4-5 times as much - not an option for me. It did the trick and had all the features we wanted/needed. I wouldn't recommend it for long term use but think it is a great option for traveling and other situations where you need the convenience of the larger stroller but don't want the size or hassle of a bigger one.
