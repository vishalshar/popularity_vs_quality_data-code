I was recently in a serious collision where my son and I were tboned by a semi truck that ran a red light going about 45mph.  After being cut out of our SUV, the firefighters and medics were amazed that my son was not more seriously injured and attributed it to this excellent car seat - from what I hear they highly praised it (I was being airlifted to the hospital so didn't actually hear their comments myself)  and they felt that it saved his life.  It is extremely well built, large, solid and worth every penny. Yes, these are expensive car seats but isn't your child's life worth it?  It fit well in my mid sized SUV and my son never complained about getting into it.  Nice, plush fabric. A bit of a pain to clean, but that was a very minor annoyance in my book.I will never buy another brand of car seat - I am buying a new one now to replace the one that was in the crash.
