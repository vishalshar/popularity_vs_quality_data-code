Bought this for a trip to grandmas in the mainland for my 17 month old son I ordered it and had it shipped there so when we arrived it was already there waiting to be set up...at first I was a little hesitant due to I'm always choosing Graco brand items for my children but this playpen was a little better then my 2 Graco ones at home the size was standard, the design and color was beautiful, the board that goes on the bottom was way more heavy weight then my Graco ones which is awesome because my son loves to lift it up and play with it but this one could be strapped down with Velcro although he still took it out and lifted it up I liked that feature. The only problem I had was folding it up or putting up and down the rails it kind of gets stuck a little so it takes a few more minutes then you normally would. My son is about 30 lbs. and he is literally a big boy but it holds very well I wanted to bring it back home with us but I ended up just leaving it for next time you never know when you'll need it!I would surely recommend this to parents with infants and or toddlers especially when traveling on a vacation, to grandmas, in hotels, it was great...
