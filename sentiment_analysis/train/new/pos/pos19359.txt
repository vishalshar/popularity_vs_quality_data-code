We recieved Fascination Staion as a baby shower gift and have put it to good use  in one capacity or another since my sons birth.  The Station has a varity of exciting colors, textures, and sounds.  Due to these  characteristics the toy can be used to encourage your child in developing  the early skill such as tracking, reaching, and eventually playing  independently with a toy.  All of these steps in development can easily be  observed using the Station.  The suction cup at the base allows you to  place it on most flat surfaces or it can be detached from the suction cup  so that the child can hold it and play.  So far it has proven to be a  very durable toy. My son has thrown it from his high chair on several  occations. The only complaint of the toy is that it detaches from the  suction cup if it is banged  hard enough. This allows for a very strong  child to remove it from where a parent has  placed it (highchair) and throw  it.  Thus, as in my case, proving its durability.  This is a toy that I  highly recommend.  It can be used at various times of your childs'  development.  My little one loves it!!!!
