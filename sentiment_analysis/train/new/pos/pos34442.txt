These were a favorite for both of my children as babies!! They move so easily when the car is in motion which attracts the attention of your baby and keeps it there. My babies would stare at them forever! My favorite part are the different sounds each one has. The black and white one has a jingle bell, the yellow one has a rattle, and the black and red one crinkles when they play with it. That's the next best thing!! When your baby is old enough and can reach, the bugs easily pull off so your baby can play with them. Enjoy these toys, they are terrific!
