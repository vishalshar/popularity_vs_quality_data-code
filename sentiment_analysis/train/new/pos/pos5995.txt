So I have 2 kids- a 4 yr old and 7 month old. I bought this after researching several makers.I will start by saying this does a great job making baby food. It is easy to use- put the water in as instructed (they DEF NEED to make the water line easier to read though!!), put in your chopped fruits/veg and push the button. When it's done it beeps and you need to grab a measuring cup or mug to reserve the "steaming" water so you can add some back to the food you are then going to puree. Pretty easy to clean. The thing is this does not make much at once. I used I apple and 1 pear together and that was about all I could steam and it made two 4oz serving. It took 17 min to steam the food. So, do the math- In one hour I could make 8 cont. of food. Maybe if I didn't work and have an older child as well I could see making the food this like this but for me it's just not that practical. I can just as easily steam a whole bunch of stuff (or bake) at once then throw it in a blender and have more. The unit itself is also a pretty good size- yet another appliance on the counter.... But if you can commit yourself to making food every other day then this may be perfect! Also it says you can reheat and defrost but I didn't see how that would work as the basket has a piece in the middle that doesn't remove so I don't understand that part and it didn't say anything about it in the directions.
