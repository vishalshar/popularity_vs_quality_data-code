I've been using my diaper bag for 8 months now, and I still love it just as much as I did the first time I used it. It comes with a light changing pad, a zipper pouch, and a bottle-holding pouch. I decided to switch out the light changing pad for a heavier one I got for my baby shower, and use the lighter one for use at home. The zippered pouch has been invaluable! I've used it numerous times when my son has pooped/puked all over his clothes, and it has been SO nice to have somewhere to keep those dirty clothes that won't get everything else in the diaper bag messy. I stopped using the bottle-holding pouch because the zipper broke, and Enfamil sent me a better one for free. The 2 magnetic snap closures on the bottom of the bag are really secure, and have stayed closed in the car and when they've been shuffled around in multiple airplanes. Overall, I absolutely love this diaper bag. I get complements on it all the time, it's beautiful and stylish, and it's comfortable. It was more expensive than some other diaper bags I looked at, but I feel like it was more than worth the extra cost and I'd choose it again in a heartbeat!
