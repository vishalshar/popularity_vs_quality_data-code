My husband and I had what we thought was a great monitor made by Safety First.  It was only 900mhz, though, and we did not realize until the first night that we used it with the baby that we would have so much interference.  That monitor had so much static and squealing feedback that we could not hear our baby at all!  We realized that we live in a planned community where the houses are all close together and near a water tower that has many signals broadcasting from it.I looked on Amazon/Babies R Us and ordered this Clear and Near monitor and had it shipped next day -- I ordered it at 10 pm or so one night and we had it the next afternoon.  It has so much resolution that we can hear every noise our baby makes!  And no interference.  We are completely happy with it.I suspect, from reading the reviews of others and from working with the monitor, that those who complain of the loud beeping pager noise going off in the middle of the night may have the parent unit on a different channel from the baby unit -- just a thought.  The pager noise may go off as a safety precaution to let you know that you have it on two different channels.
