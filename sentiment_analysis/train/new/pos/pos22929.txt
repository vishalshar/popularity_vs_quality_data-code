I love this product and the final outcome made me really happy. My husband and I were able to do it with just the two of us. I helped as well. If you're not able to help your partner see if you can get an extra person to do it with the both of you. I suggest wearing a bra if you don't want your nipples to be obvious or you want a more "perfect" shape. The plaster does not ruin clothing and it washes off easily.Vasoline does work well if you don't have enough salve. I did two casts because there was enough plaster to do two, I also have one roll left. One thing that really helps is if you do a quick "exo-skeleton" of the your belly then let that dry for 24 hours. Then go back, and add more plaster to make it smoother and stronger. I couldn't sit down when we did the cast because it hurt my back too much so I stood up the whole time. I got too tired so we stopped. It didn't come out too smooth so that's why I did the shell of it then added more later. By adding another coat of plaster when it was not on me I was able to smooth it out more and fix up the edges without having to cut it later.I recommend this product to everyone. It's a great project to work on with your partner and it's a real bonding moment with your child. I especially love decorating it because it eases my anxiety about finally meeting my child. I am able to use this as a distraction from the anxiety of nesting and I love working on something that reminds me of my impending meeting with my child.
