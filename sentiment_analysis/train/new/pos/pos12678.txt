This was my first time trying Best Bottom brand diapers and inserts and I have to say I'm a convert now! I have been using pocket diapers for the last few months with my son and I dread having to sit down every night and spend 45 minutes or more stuffing diapers for the next day. I bought one Best Bottom diaper and this 3-pack of inserts and it is SO easy to use! You just snap in the insert and go! I got the Stay Dry Large because I wasn't sure how absorbent these inserts were and my son is a heavy wetter. These hold so much pee! I can finally make long car trips and not worry about him peeing through his diaper.
