My all-time favorite bottle nipples. I'm a breastfeeding mother of six (I only breastfeed the baby. Hah!) and I've used a bottle to supplement when necessary for each child. These didn't exist when I had my first three kids, sadly. I had dreamed of inventing bottle nipples just like these. I found them when my 4th was newborn and I've used these bottles only since then. My last three kids have gone seamlessly from breast to bottle and back with these. They facilitate a breastfeeding suckle as opposed to a bottle gulp feeding. My one complaint is that the nipple tears eat opening easily. I've several times accidentally popped a finger through the tip when cleaning it but for me it's worth it to have a soft, mailable nipple for baby's drinking pleasure. I just order extras and have them on hand.
