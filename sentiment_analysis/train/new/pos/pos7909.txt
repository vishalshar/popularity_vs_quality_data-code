These wipes are soothing on slightly sore nips.  I stuck to creams mostly for the first 10wks when my nips were ridiculously sore and hurting.  I usually used these if I felt that I needed to clean-up before feedings.  They weren't that great when I was SUPER sore.  When my nips were only slightly sore, these were very nice to use before I put on a bra withOUT any nursing pads.  I still use them before or after feedings when it hurts every once in a while or when I need to clean-up.  I think a description I read somewhere said that they're not sticky, so you don't need to wash hands after.  I disagree with that part, because it leaves my fingers a little slimy.
