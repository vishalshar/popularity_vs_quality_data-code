My son with autism loves textures and manipulatives.  It can be hard to find ones that are durable enough without being too hard, but this one is just perfect.  It's a great fidget and helps keep his hands busy and relaxed.  I'll be buying more but wish they were a little cheaper since it's so easy to lose things on the bus, at vocational, out in the car, etc.  This is a great product!!
