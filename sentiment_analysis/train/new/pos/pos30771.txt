I am a first time mom and when I took on teh task of nursing my son, I was not aware of all that it entailed.  I knew from other mommies that I would need nursing pads but no one told me which were the best kind to use.  So many people are willing to give you advice on how to raise your child, but they never tell you the little secrets behind it such as nursing pads.I have a fast flow and produce more than my fair share of milk.  I needed something that would handle my issues.  I tried several kinds of pads and found that many were too thin, not absorbant enough for a fast flow/let-down, and some were just itchy and uncomfortable.  The Playtex nursing pads were wonderful!  They stay in place and can hold a substantial amount of milk if you are unable to pump or feed at that time.  I know there are many options out there but these were the most comfortable to me.  They are soft enough not to hurt aching nipples at the beginning and when your milk comes in, they can handle the leaks.I have not had any leak issues with these pads.  My only complaint is that when they are full... they are FULL.  I learned the hard way about forgetting to change them out.
