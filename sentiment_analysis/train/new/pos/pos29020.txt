I bought one of these almost four years ago with my first child. This thing was a literal life saver, my oldest wouldnt hardly settle down without it. Fast forward to a couple months ago. I order another one through amazon and can hardly wait for my second to be under the spell of the lullavibe and to get some freakin' sleep. On the old model if you pressed once the lullavibe turned on and if you pressed and held the button down it would change from low to high. The new one doesnt have a low and high setting, or if it does I havent figured it out, it only has a high setting. The high setting is too much for my second, she doesnt care for it at all.  I've muffles it some with towels to where she likes it but it makes her mattress uneven. :/ Wish it just had the low setting, it would make life easier.Still a wonderful product and great if your kid likes vibration. I still highly recommend the product, it just comes with a 'but' now.
