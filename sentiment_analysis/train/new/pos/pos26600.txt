I prefer this in almost all ways to the KidCo food mill of similar shape and function.  (This is not to say the KidCo is a bad product.  I simply prefer the Green Sprouts one.  The one reason I can see for the KidCo might be if your baby is just starting solid foods, and this is because the KidCo has smaller holes in the grinding surface and hence makes food slightly less textured.  The KidCo also came with an extra gasket, and some versions come with a carrying case.  Also, the KidCo is a little less prone to leaking liquid out the base.)Pros of the Green Sprouts:--Bigger overall, meaning more room in the base to fill with food and more room in the bowl for milled food.  It also has a 'pour' spout on the bowl.--Easier to understand.  The Green Sprouts directions were longer and clearer.--Easier to use.  The KidCo is stiffer and harder to push down and harder to turn.--Easier to disassemble.  The KidCo is a pain in the rear to get apart.  I often have to jam a toothpick in one of the holes in the grate to get the top to unscrew.  By comparison, I just tighten the easy-turn knob on the Green Sprouts' central post and then unscrew the top.--Easier to clean.  I frequently have to painstakingly use a toothpick to poke food out of the tiny holes in the grate on the KidCo.  With the Green Sprouts the holes are bigger and food rinses right out.--Stainless steel both on the turning part that crushes the food and on the grate that the food squishes through.(As for the reviewer who had this 'explode'... it must either be a fluke or she was grinding counterclockwise instead of clockwise.  I have never had that problem with this mill, nor do I see how it would even be possible.)Keep in mind that this isn't a blender and food will end up a bit textured.  But for what it claims to do, the Green Sprouts carries through 100%.
