Stinky from package. Had to air out. Daughter wonders how flammable these things are. Put on edge of bunk bed where kids kept banging heads. Kids tested it, with their heads, and said it works to soften the impact.  About six feet long.  If you were doing a coffee table, you might need two. Didn't use the corner pieces, which seem small. Strip was easy to apply using included double-sided tape. Bought two. Nice magnet included with one from seller Kilofly (kill-a-fly????), other from different seller had non-3m tape and weird wooden ladybug with a very weak magnet. By the way, did you know some species of lady bugs bite and cause allergic reactions?  The orange, yellow Asian kind. Don't let them crawl on you. Nasty things.
