I love it... it takes a while to figure out how to wrap it and to wrap it by yourself. But the handy little booklet helped with clear pictures, and eventually I got it. Taking him to the grocery store or doing things around the house with my newborn (10 weeks old) has never been easier. He loves sleeping in the kangaroo hold. It's not as bad on my back and arms as holding him normal.I'm a plus size woman, and this wrap is long enough and fits well. It's super soft and since it's March and still kinda cold, it helps keep him warm but I can tell it's breathable so I can still use it when it gets a bit warmer. It's worth the money. :)
