We purchased this in January 2010 for our almost 7-month-old daughter.  It only took her a few times using it and she was racing through the house in it.  She follows her older sister around - she literally goes everywhere, she can move it on carpet as well as hard surfaces.  She can maneuver it through doorways and back herself out of corners; the maneuverability is great.  We bought a $50 walker at Wal-Mart 2 1/2 years ago for our older daughter.  It didn't move well and seemed very 'cheap' - we sold it at a yard sale.  Well we decided to try another one this time, and I am glad we found this one.  It is solid, little assembly is required, and just looks a whole lot nicer than the one we had before - all for a better price.  Safety 1st seems to be a very good 'value' brand as we own a few of their other baby items and they are all great quality.One disclaimer: this product will probably not be great for a younger baby.  It does only have the two height settings and the lowest one is not *that* low.  But it worked fine for our 6 1/2 month old, she probably wasn't ready for a walker at a younger age anyway.Great product overall - I am very happy with it, and my daughter is too!
