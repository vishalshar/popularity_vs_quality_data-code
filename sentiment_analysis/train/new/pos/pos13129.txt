We received an excersaucer as a Baby Shower gift and just before our son turned 4 months old we put it together thinking he would be able to use it... unfortunately he was way too small to use it - not tall enough and definitely not heavy enough.  He would wobble all around, even with blankets stuffed around him.  A friend suggested we try the Hugga-Bebe as it worked well for her family.  I cautiously ordered it and am SO thankful I did!  This product is amazing.  The velcro straps wrap around him, allowing the cushions to provide a snuggly fit to his body.  With the Hugga-Bebe on he fits just right into the seat of the exersaucer!  The Hugga-Bebe keeps him upright and positioned properly.  He is able to reach all of the toys and can spin himself around (his feet touch the bottom now).  He now LOVES spending time in his exersaucer and we love it too!  The Hugga-Bebe enables our son to have fun SAFELY.  It is worth every penny.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a "little peanut" like we do.
