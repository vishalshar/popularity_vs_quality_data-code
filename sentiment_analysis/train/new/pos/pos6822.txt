I went through dozens of highchairs before choosing this one. I read reviews that expressed concerns about the basket but that's one of my fave features. I love that the chair is adjustable in height. My husband is quite taller than me so it makes it easier for us to adjust that chair accordingly. The different trays are a nice feature also. I use the regular tray mainly as its smaller & allows me to get closer to the baby. The larger tray comes in handy when my 7 month old is having her snacks. It gives her a lot of space to work  on her snacks. This chair has been great. I assembled it alone in 15 minutes and we served her in it right away. She loves it. The reclining seat is lovely as well. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. Amazon delivered it quickly and we've had a great deal of use with it.
