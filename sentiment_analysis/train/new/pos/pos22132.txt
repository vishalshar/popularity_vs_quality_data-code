Positives:Great nursing cover! I like that it covers the shoulders for more coverage. The pattern is nice and not too bold. It's long enough to cover my 1 month old sitting and standing. Most people don't even know I'm nursing when I use the nursing cover which I like because I consider myself to be modest. I wash and dry this and don't have any problems with the ring around the neck bending out of control. The visibility ring type thing is pretty cool, I can see what my baby is doing and get him reattached if need be.Negatives:I didn't expect the cover to be so light weight. I probably could have sewed something like this together myself. The front pocket is only useful for folding the cover into it self for storage not for holding anything heavy, if I put a burp rag in the pocket it gets top heavy and just falls out. The contraption for tightening and loosening the visibility collar in the front never stays where you put it. The fabris is to light and the ring is too heavy. May be a snap or velcro would have worked better. I wish they made a nursing cover that wrapped around your back some how because sometimes I wear shirts that have to be pulled up instead of down and my entire back is exposed.
