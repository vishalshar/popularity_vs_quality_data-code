I have purchased numerous Plan Toys, so when I found the Hape brand products I was less impressed with their quality.  The wood is lightweight, seems less durable, and just not as high quality.  However, the price is terrific.  Some Hape products I passed up on because they seemed too cheap and flimsy.However, I'm happily surprised with this product.  It's one of their better ones and does just what I need it to.  Simple, clean looking, and sturdy enough.  The babies enjoy it and I enjoy having a simpler product than the battery operated insanity.
