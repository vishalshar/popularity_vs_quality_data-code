Before I bought this car seat, I researched safety ratings, ease of installation, etc for days. This car seat seemed to have the best of all the worlds. We bought this car seat when my son was under a year old and used it till just a few months ago (got in a car accident and had to replace the seat- bought the same car seat but in a different color since this one was no longer available). My son has always been tall for his age and this seat was so easy to adjust and worked great for extended rear facing (we rear faced till about 2 1/2). It is very easy to install, easy to adjust the straps, and easy to adjust the height. I'm very particular about making sure my son is properly restrained and this seat makes it very simple to adjust things so that he is as safe as possible!
