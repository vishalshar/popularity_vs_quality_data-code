These breast pad are awesome! They hold liquid in and keep my breast dry without making my bra look lumpy. BUT YOU MUST HAVE THE PURPLE SIDE TOWARD THE BREAST. Otherwise the paper falls apart. The purple part has the lanolin so it keeps my nipples from getting sore. The person who reviewed this product and said the paper fell apart put them in backwards. I highly recommend these pads.
