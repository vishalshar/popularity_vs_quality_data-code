I've been using this blueberry diaper for only a month now. I can't say how it will hold up, but I can tell you that is works wonderfully. Holds all my little one can put out lol.. Very easy to clean. Still look brand new and the print is so cute.I've only used one other brand cloth diapers. I can't say which brand I prefer, however, I've been fortunate that none leak! My husband plays favorites and likes these the best over all of the others!They are quite expensive in comparison to others, but you do get what you pay for. You can tell the quality that went into making them.Picture shows different sizes :)
