This was just the right color for us. We had seen it in stores so we knew it was a quality product. I was 5 months pregnant and had no trouble putting it together with the help of my husband. The instructions were easy to follow and it arrived before the projected ship date! A beautiful and sturdy design. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.
