This stroller stands out for 2 reasons:1) it reclines!!! And I mean almost flat! The ability to recline means that your child will SLEEP from a fairly young age in this stroller and you will get long service from this stroller. The back reclines almost flat and there is a foot rest. Together these features create a virtually horizontal surface for your baby. Plus, the five-point restraint keeps the baby safe and snug at any angle.2) it is well built and tall enough for people of normal height. Yes, you can buy an umbrella stroller atBabies R Us for 10 bucks. If you do that, you will find yourself stooping and hunching over a questionable contraption that seems to threaten to collapse at any moment. The Mia Moda is very sturdy and works for me at 5'9" and my wonderful spouse at 5'3". The frame is strong, the wheels are decent and there is a brake on both back wheels. Use your brakes!! A great safety feature.Our girl is a tiny peanut and when she hit 6 months and a whopping 8 pounds, the harness adjusted to secure her and she has slept her way through many a pleasant adult dinners completely comfy and safely secured.It is a little heavy, but there is no danger of collapse and it is quiet and solid to roll along all sorts of surfaces. The one drawback is the teeny, tiny canopy. In truth, no stroller comes with an adequate canopy--especially umbrella strollers. You can buy fabulous adjustable canopies for under 10 bucks, that fit any stroller, so shop around for one.
