This might be the worlds best thing ever! This is perfect for those going to the beach and looking for a place to put their little one while they nap, play, or eat. The zipper on the front net helps keep the sand out and the over all temperature down! I don't know what we would have done with out this! This item is also allowed on beached that have a tent restriction. We used it during restricted  tent times and had no issue with the life guards. The unit is very easy to clean and dries out fast. It also collapses very quickly (the first time was confusing!) for storage reasons. Great product with an great design and I have recommended this several of my friend and they have loved it as well! Thank you!
