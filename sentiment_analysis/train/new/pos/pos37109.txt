This booster seat is sturdy enough for our very active grandson.  The color blends in with the kitchen table, so it's not too obvious that it's in the chair.  The only thing is the sides are a little too high for the chair to scoot under our table.  Our table has a wide apron around the it, and the seat hits it.  This maybe more of a problem with our table than the booster seat.
