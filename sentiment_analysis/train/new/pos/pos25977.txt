I received this as a gift for my baby shower. It is adorable. I love the lightweight material it is made of, easy to move around, and I don't have to worry about the lid smashing little fingers. The only issue is the box's sturdiness. There is not much reinforcement, so after several uses by slightly older cousins, it started to lose shape and buldge. I resolved this by buying three sheets of foam board from Hobby Lobby (it comes in a variety of colors). I cut the front and back pieces to 14.5"×23.5", and the sides to 14.5"×13.5". They fit very snugly and keeps the box at its proper dimensions and shape. My baby can even pull up on it now. Overall, I am very happy with this product.
