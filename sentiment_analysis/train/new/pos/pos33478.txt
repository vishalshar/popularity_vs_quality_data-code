I love these bags! I work full-time and have a lot of milk. I used to buy Lansinoh bags but that got too expensive. i switched to the Target brand but find that the "ziploc" part was difficult to open without forcing your fingers into the storage part of the bag. (I try not to touch that part.) I tried the Medela ones since that's what my sister used but they weren't any better than the Lansinoh and more expensive. I found these on Amazon and have been very happy with it. The zipper part is easy to open and the wide side slats at the neck make it easy to pour the milk into the bag without the milk having to touch the part outside the zipper. (I work in healthcare and am a little obsessive about aseptic technique.) I have torn the bag on the sides once, making it useless for storage, but I think it's because of how much force I use to open  them (trying not to touch the insides as much as possible). I've never had a problem with leaks, although once I grabbed a 4 oz. bag from the freezer and found it empty. I found the bag intact by filling it with water, so I can only assume I didn't zip the bags properly. Both events happened once, separately, after about 120 bags.Unlike Lansinoh or Target brands, I also like how you can stand up the bag and approximate how much milk is stored, because although it try to remember how much milk is in the pump bottle before I pour it, sometimes it flies out of my head in the 5 seconds it takes to pour the milk (sleep deprivation, mommy brain).  I initially bought 100 to try them out, then bought 300 to last me until I stop breastfeeding/pumping when my baby is a year old. The more you buy, the more you save. I just wish I knew about these before I spent my money on the other bags!
