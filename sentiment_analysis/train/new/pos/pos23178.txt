We have had our son in Halo sleepsacks ever since we stopped swaddling him. They are great! We've had cotton, fleece, and this velboa one. The velboa is definitely the softest and possibly the thickest. It's difficult to tell whether the fleece or the velboa is thicker/warmer. I wish the velboa sleepsacks were more widely available in the larger sizes. We're going to keep my son in them as long as we can. He moves around too much in his sleep to use an actual blanket. Seriously, he's rolling all over the place all night.The one thing I think these sleepsacks are missing is a snap tab that would cover the zipper. We've actually talked about sewing one on because our son has become very interested in unzipping his sleepsack to the point where it has kept him awake trying to unzip. Our nephew went through a similar stage when he was obsessed with the sleepsack zipper so I'm thinking it might be a common thing. I understand that you wouldn't need the snap for really young babies, but it might be good for toddler sizes.Overall, we love these and will continue to put our son in them until he'll no longer fit!
