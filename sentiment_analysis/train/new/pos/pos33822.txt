My five-month old son gets so excited when we attach this to his stroller! The music is kinda loud, but my it makes my son happy, so I'm happy. I saw a lot of people complaining that it only plays one song (Pop Goes the Weasel) but so far, my son's is working just fine. It plays Pop Goes the Weasel every time you turn it on, but then the rest of playtime, it plays the other songs. The songs are bounce activated (like when the baby kicks or hits it), not squeeze activated (that turns the music on and off. Yes the music is able to be turned off, you are even able to remove the music box.).Also, so far it is super sturdy. My son is really strong for his age (we've had to remove the toy bar from his play pen because he kept pulling it down on top of himself) and so far has not been able to remove this toy bar from his stroller. The joints are actually pretty tough to move and I don't find the plastic to be cheaply made at all. As for the toys, yeah they aren't all blinky and flashy, but babies don't need blinky and flashy. I mean, my kid is amused just watching my fingers type out this review. Anyway, I've seen some people raise concern about the fan and little baby fingers getting caught or hurt, but my son took the spinning fan to his face and giggled and did it again so...I guess it depends on the toughness of your baby. HahaMy only complaint is that the grippies don't fit his car seat. We have a permanent rear-facing car seat, so it is super bulky. I won't take a star off for this because we knew going into the purchase that it wouldn't fit the car seat and bought it for his stroller. Just letting everyone know that this will not fit a bulky, cushiony car seat. It would definitely fit an infant carseat, however!
