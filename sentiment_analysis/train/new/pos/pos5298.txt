Before my daughter was born I bought a couple of Oh Katy diapers based on a recommendation from a family member.  I wasn't sure whether I would like cloth diapering enough to stick with it long term.  Now my daughter is 9 weeks old.  We have been using cloth diapers since she was one month and I love them.  We still use disposables for nighttime and when we are away from home, but using cloth while I'm at home during the day has already noticeably decreased the cost of purchasing disposables.  We have mostly Oh Katy diapers and one BumGenius and I am ALWAYS reaching for the Oh Katy's first.  They are so soft on her skin, wash up great every time, and are better at containing leaks than disposables.  They are noticeably bulkier than disposables on my 11 pound little girl, but I love knowing that we will be able to use these diapers up until she potty trains.  I just purchased two more Oh Katy diapers to add to our collection.  I can honestly say that I'm hooked on Oh Katys and plan on using them daily with my daughter and with future kiddos to come.
