First, watch the price. I purchased mine from Amazon itself for $60 (free shipping) and today this seller is asking for more than 4 times that!In answer to the legitimate criticisms of the seat sliding laterally--I've found that to occur depending on the back seat type and the placement of the seat belts as well as how well you affix the metal locking mechanism to the car's seat belt. As we use it, we place the seat in the middle seat position between the two of us when we travel by cab, so lateral motion really does not become an issue.To enhance head and neck support without adding much weight or losing the car seat's portability, we add two neck wings to the shoulder straps, which also makes it more comfortable for the child to sleep in the seat.Keep in mind also that not every car seat will fit well into every vehicle, so bringing your regular car seat with you when you travel rather rather than this portable unit does not necessarily guarantee you a good safe fit (eg, the evenflo convertible seat I have takes me a set of forceps and my putting my weight in the seat in order to achieve a tight fit in my vehicle).Lastly, keep in mind that since the seat does not lock open (unlike a Radian80 car seat) it is not FAA approved for air travel and some flight attendants may or may not let you use it. I find that FAA regulation a little odd since the airplane seats themselves do lock, but that's the situation
