This is working well for the high-traffic area we installed it in. I was able to install it myself even though I'm notoriously terrible at putting things like this together. It has a wide gate opening and opens easily. Very satisfied with my purchase.The most frustrating parts of shopping for this gate:-Finding one which HAS a wide door, not just for a wide doorway-Figuring out whether the gate would fit my doorway, and whether extensions were requiredI haven't seen the Extension Guide from the box posted (posted below) anywhere on the product postings from the manufacturers. Maybe I missed it, but it would have saved me a ton of time and anguish.*Some overlap is intended for variations in wall construction29.5" - 31.5" - No extensions31.5" - 34.5" - Included with gate34.5" - 37" - Included with gate37" - 40" - 1-G410040" - 42.5" - 1-G410042.5" - 45"- 2-G410045" - 47.5" - 2-G410047.5" - 49.5" - 1-G411049/5" - 52" - 1-G4100 + 1-G411052" - 55" - 1-G4100 + 1-G411055" - 57" - 2-G411057" - 60" - 2-G411060" - 62" - 2-G411062" - 65" - 1-G4100 + 2-G411065" - 68" - 1-G4100 + 2-G411068" - 70" - 2-G4100 + 2-G411070" - 73.5" - 2-G4100 + 2-G4110
