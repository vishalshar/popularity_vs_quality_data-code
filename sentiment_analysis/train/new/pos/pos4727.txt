I was searching and found an umbrella stroller for my toddler son that was lightweight and required less storage space and found it!  This is not the typical cheaply made unfold and go stroller.  This stroller is super lightweight, rides smoothly for zoo trips, neighborhood walks, parks, and malls but not for rough terrain..it can be a bit bumpy for that.  No complaints from my son as he loves it.  I love that the umbrella actually keeps the sun out of his face.  The zipped storage compartment is just what I need for handy snacks, keys, phone, and even has a cup holder beside it.  The under seat storage has the right amount of space for what I need.  It's durable and one can tell that it's made well.  I love the five point harness strap because my busy boy cannot get out of the seat belt straps.  Very easy to put together, all that was required was popping the wheels on because it came all assembled and undamaged.  All in all, a great stroller, stylish, and receives many compliments/stares wherever we go!  I use this for days out when I don't feel like taking my wagon to the zoo and it's extremely comfortable for my boy!  Would highly recommend as I was pleasantly surprised with this nice stroller.  The height is perfect and does not require any awkward bending for taller/average height people.  The stroller is pretty much the same as the First Years Ignite Stroller but looks much cooler with the John Deere touch.  My boy loves John Deere tractors too and now he has a cool stroller with the same quality as any John Deere product.
