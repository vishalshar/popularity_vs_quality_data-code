The generic rain covers left gaps where my baby could stick hands, arms, or legs out, and it used to billow out with strong gusts of wind.  This one fits perfectly and doesn't blow out or in with strong wind. The baby can't poke body parts out which is great in wet weather.  The cover wraps around the footrest which helps keep dirt off feet after rain or in mud.  The mesh sides are great ventilation in the summer, but with no option to cover them more in the winter this won't be much help when walking in very cold weather.
