I am so glad that I was not persuaded by the cons of other reviews!  I was in search of a double that I could easily get in and out of the back of my suburban without the need of a forklift - let's face it, double strollers are bulky and heavy!  This one: not. at. all.  As long as your perspective is "double, umbrella-type stroller for shopping and smooth terrain, then you've found your stroller!  If you frequent trails, gravel roads, and rocky mountains, then not so much. You will also need a double jogger.  I am perfectly content with the idea of having a different stroller for different circumstances. As for the complaints about not being big enough for older children....I do not get this.  My 3 year old son fits with plenty of room to grow.  I'm tempted to climb in there myself and take a picture because really, I think my bottom would fit too (and I've had 4 kids).  Do these gigantic kids not fit in umbrella strollers?  Do they need two airplane seats?Pros:- Light, compact- Easy to push, guide, and steer (even through narrow doors)- Easy to open/close (very intuitive)Cons:- If you need a basket....yeah don't depend on this one- I also do not care for the canopy but plan on attaching if I need to.  It seems like my child's head would touch it in the back seat.
