These are perfect for dining out for our little one who is still too young to have a plate or bowl in out in front of him without it ending up on the ground. I worked in restaurants for many years and it always bothered me when I saw parents let their babies eat directly off of the table because you have no idea how clean it is. I love that they come in individual packs of four so I can easily carry a few at a time in my diaper bag or purse and always have them available when I may need them. You just pull the strips from the edges to expose the sticky part and stick it right to the table in front of your child and when they are done it's an easy clean up to just peel off and throw away. We tend to dine out at least a couple times a week and I hate being without these. We often have people stop and ask us where we got them from. The product is exactly as described and is one of the best values I have been able to find for this type of product.
