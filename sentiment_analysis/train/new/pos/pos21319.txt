We used Avent bottles for my first daughter, and had pulled them out again for use with our new baby (now almost 4 mos old).  After hearing the reports about BPA in the news, I decided to switch to a BPA-free bottle.  I looked online and in Babies R US for alternatives.  I decided against glass because of how heavy they are and with having an older child I was concerned about safety with our newborn.  Finding a good plastic BPA-free bottle was more challenging.  At Babies R US when I visited about 2 weeks ago, there was only two types of plastic BPA-free bottles.  An Evenflow variety, which I purchased and tried with our baby.  It was inexpensive and seemed to us to be cheaply made, particularly the nipples.  They also had Born Free bottles, but I had read some negative reviews on it and moved on.  I purchased a Green to Grow bottle from a local organic baby store, tried it for a day, and then went back and bought 3 more.  I have been using them exclusively for over a week and here are my pros & cons:ProsBPA-free and Phthalate-FreeAll parts appear to be extremely well made and durableSocially responsible companyAttractive designConsCost--they are $10 locally, and I found that if I were to purchase one online it would have cost me around $20 for a single bottle to be shippedNipple that comes with the bottle is super fast sometimes and even squirts our little one in the eye!  It's supposed to be the slow variety, but when turned upside down it can come out in a single stream.They do say on their website that the Gerber NUK nipples fit their bottles well and can help with infants transitioning from Avent.  I am going to purchase these today to see if they help.  All-in-all, we do love these bottles and are so happy to have made the switch to BPA-free.
