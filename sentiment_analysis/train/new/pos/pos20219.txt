I bought the table top four years ago. We have a simple wooden table and our table tops stays nicely in place. Yes, you can pull it in parallel, but when my kid was little she couldn't pull it away, it was too difficult to pull. And even I have to pull hard (in parallel) to get it off the table. It does scratch, but it's plastic, plastic scratches. I have never put it in a dishwasher, but never put plastic in a dishwasher anyway because I doubt the high temperatures are good for any plastic. Simply wiping it and occassionally pulling it off the table for a deeper clean. It's big, so any messes are easier to contain. Kid is a kid, and spill won't be prevented with any size placemat. But the worse is prevented. We still use it since our kid loves to accidentally knock over her glasses. So, we are happy with it. It is expensive, though.
