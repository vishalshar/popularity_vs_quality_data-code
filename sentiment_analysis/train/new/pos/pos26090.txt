I saw this crib set when pregnant with my first child (girl) but now we are expecting a boy. I was so happy to find it once again, when It arrived and I took everything out of it's packaging I was so thrilled by it. So beautiful, i was afraid that the brown would be to dark but it's not! I washed everything in dreft afraid the dyes would run but found out they did not. So amazing!Super soft and great quality, I would recommend the product and company brand to everyone!
