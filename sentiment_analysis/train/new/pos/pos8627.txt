After hearing about these from a friend, I bought them for my grandson. He loves them. They are the perfect size for a growing baby whose coordination is still kind of hit-or-miss. He can grasp the animal and chew on the soft part even if he can't get the pacifier to his mouth. They are easy to locate, too, no matter where you are...much easier than finding a small pacifier. Definitely worth the extra cost!
