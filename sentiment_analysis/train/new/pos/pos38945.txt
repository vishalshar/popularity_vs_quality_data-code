I highly recommend this product, especially for anyone travelling somewhere with large crowds! I bought one of these for each of my 3 children right before we took a family trip to Disney World. At first I was a little bit concerned with whether people would think I had my children on "leashes", but I quickly put my concerns to the side when I began thinking about losing my toddler in the large crowds at Disney. Within the first 2 minutes (litterally!) at the airport I was so pleased that I thought to buy these. It made manuvering luggage and 3 children SOOO much easier--even with my husband helping! They were great at Disney too--especially for my 2 year old who doesn't realize that she could so easily get lost in such big crowds. I gave my 5 year old the choice of wearing his after day one; he, of course, stayed with us much better. All 3 of my kids think they're really cute though and thinking nothing of wearing something that is attached to me:)
