If you are interested in making your own baby food, you must have this item! I am the type of person that I have good intentions but if the process is difficult it won't get done. The baby brezza makes it impossible to make excuses to not make your baby's food. Sometimes I make just enough for one or two feedings and sometimes I make several batches of many different foods (basically whatever fruits and vegetables I have on hand) at one time. I have had no issues with my machine. It is easy to operate and easy to clean. I have not had any "black flecks" appear out of the water reservoir as has been reported by some other users. I read an in-depth review of this item before I purchased it and they said that was an issue in older models (2011 and older). Hands down, I LOVE this product and I would highly recommend it.
