Even with my 4 kids prior, I never thought a swaddleme me was necessary - I just used a blanket! But after using one in the hospital with my 5th child, I thought 'why have I never used one before?' It's so convenient, especially for my husband who isn't the greatest at swaddling in blankets! I absolutely love this swaddleme. They are soft, comfortable and easy to use. Mine came in a size small, which is a perfect size for my 8 lb newborn. I also believe we will stay in the small for awhile as it has growing room for her legs.
