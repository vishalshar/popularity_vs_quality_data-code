This rack is awesome! Whoever designed it, definitely put some thought into it. When I first got this, I was little skeptical. I took all of the Medela bottles, Tommy Tippees, pacifiers, etc and boiled them, put them to dry on this rack, without having to do any jenga style moves to fit them. I would highly recommend this over almost all of the racks out there. Plus, the price is perfect for what you are getting.This is nice as it's not too big and not very conspicuous. (Didn't really want the faux grass and twig looking thing on my counter top. Have seen those up close and in person. I would classify them as perfect for Ikea budgeted/minded folks. I think they're ugly as sin and not practical!)I definitely don't work for this company and it was not sent to me to review. I came up with this review all by myself!!
