I am surprised to read all of the negative reviews. But when I look deeper - I see the 1 (4 now) we received is different.I have a pair of nylon straps at the top and bottom each with a simple buckle attachment that makes putting it in easy. The grade of plastic is a little low - but what do you expect for $8.95?All in all - we love ours. I have two on the front seats of my Yukon and another two on the front seats of my Silverado. I have a 4yr old and 5yr old and my leather seats are very safe from their routine kicking and stretching.As long as you get the buckles - I would say this is a no brainer and worth every penny!!
