This is a good, sturdy small diaper bag good for quick trips or for older babies when you don't need to carry so much stuff. It is pretty basic, a big interior with two wide pockets inside. Two wide pockets outside too. There is no pocket for a bottle though which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Because the shape of the bag is wider at the base this bag has never tipped over on me yet (my large one tips all the time).I've been using this bag for outings a couple times a week for 8 months and it still looks good and is as strong as ever. To give you an idea of what it will hold inside, I usually carry:Three size 4 diapers,wipes in a travel case,folded-up water-proof lap pad (for diaper changes),one each size 12mos-18mos shirt and pants,one pair of socks,one bib,one receiving blanket/small fleece blanket,pocket notebook and pen,spare pacifier,one 8oz Avent (wide-style) bottle,one sippy cup (ours are more tall and thin then short and wide like some brands),small-med sized snack container (like for dry cereal or powdered formula),small snack and a spoon (like a small yogurt or jar of baby food),and usually there are also a couple small toys (like a little book and a small musical toy) when my son was younger I could fit 3-4 rattles and teethers.I do pack it full, but you see it holds a lot for a small bag!Two things that others might consider cons are that there is no changing pad (though a waterproof lap pad is a good, compact, washable substitute) and like I said earlier, there is no pocket (inside or out) for a bottle to snug into.
