This product worked well for where I needed it. It seems reliable and was fairly easy to assemble. I am concerned with a few of the hinges that still slightly rotate even though their locking mechanism is in place. However, it doesn't move enough to be a danger to my child. I just think that over time it may cause fractures in the plastic. The only thing that really bothers me is the flimsiness of the door lock. It just seems cheap and the lower part of the door has no lock so it's only being held closed by the top. Still, this has prevented my curious son from getting up the stairs so it's worked well so far. Will update if anything changes.
