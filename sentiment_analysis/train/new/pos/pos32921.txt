Very easy to get on. I love that these snap since my baby would startle at the sound of velcro. The material is really breathable and it will be good for all seasons I think. I had thought microfleece was a must in the winter but it was really much too warm. These allow her just enough movement and to get to her hands. She hates any style of swaddle that restrain her arms or zip them up.
