I was researching straw cups for my 21 month old son and after searching and searching, scrolling all the way down I found this one. I read a review or two and said well seems like a good cup - took the risk and bought it without much thought.I LOVE it! I expected the straw to be a regular straw as it's not shown well in the picture - turns out it's like a wide straw, but its great my son liked it which is what really matters, its cute and easy to clean. Its nice to try something new rather than the same typical straw every straw cup has.
