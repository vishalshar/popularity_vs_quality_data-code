I bought these to serve 1main purpose for my then baby boy. To keep him warm and cuddly.POSITIVE!1. These blankets are "Oh Soo Soft!" wayyyyy more than expected.2. Very durable. They have been subjected to many wash cycles and rough play and are still as soft and presentable as the first day i got them. My son is now 4yrs 6mths and I have passed on a few blankets to my niece and still have a few left for my next baby.3. The size is good. Will definitely be of good use from newborn to over 1yr plus.4. I absolutely love the fact that they all have individual patterns. Makes identifying the dirty lot from the clean ones easier.All needs were met.NEGATIVE!1. No adult sizes available.MY ADVICE.1. Beware of vomit and leaking diapers. So i say buy 1 six pack if you intend to wash every 3days. If not 2packs would be perfect for the newborn.
