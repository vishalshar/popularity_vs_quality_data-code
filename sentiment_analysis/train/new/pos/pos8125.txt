I'm so glad to have found this product! This adapter is lightweight, which is nice. I mostly bought it for the voltage capabilities. The Army has us stationed overseas so all I need is an adapter to plug my pump up to the 220V outlet. This is a lifesaver since I no longer have to use my battery pack anymore!
