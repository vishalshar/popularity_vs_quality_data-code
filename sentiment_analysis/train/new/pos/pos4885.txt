We have had this necklace for 3 years and 2 children have used it. We have 3...the first one we did what every person does--teething drops and mild pain meds for the teething days of our infant.  The other two wore this and while they still needed to have a little extra help from teething drops, it doesn't get as bad with the runny noses, mild fevers, and drooling.I am actually surprised how much this helps.  I wish it was a little smoother so it could stay on them when they sleep, but it does help out a lot.  I recommend them to everyone who asks what it is.  Most have never heard of it!
