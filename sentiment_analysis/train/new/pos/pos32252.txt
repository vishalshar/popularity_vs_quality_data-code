I bought these to take with to my daughter's swim lessons.  We needed something to throw our wet suits into after class.  (She's a toddler, so I still have to be in the water with her.  I bought two bags, one for each of us, but our two suits could have easily fit in one bag.  They worked out perfect and I think I'll throw one in her diaper bag for dirty clothes!
