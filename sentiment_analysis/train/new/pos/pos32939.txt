This was a fabulous purchase. It allowed me to take showers!I don't have any point of comparison, so I can't say whether this is better or worse than any other play mat out there. But here are the things I like about it:1. The dangly beaver and frog. Baby loves them. Their legs are perfect for grabbing, and the cords have just enough give so that she can pull them toward her. She's loved Beaver and Frog since she was three months old.2. The lighted, musical caterpillar. Baby was never too into the caterpillar, but I love that SHE can trigger the lights and music by pulling on or kicking it. So I like the way this toy can teach cause and effect. Also, the music is not too annoying.3. Tummy time option. For awhile, before she really had the hang of pushing herself up on her elbows, I didn't like the mat for tummy time because it was too slippery. Now that she's got more control, the slippery-ness isn't really an issue, and she loves to play with the crinkly, colorful tags on the mat while on her tummy.4. She rolled over, back to front, in this thing for the first time. I think the poles helped give her some leverage with her legs.5. You can really hang anything from the poles. (Although she has always preferred Beaver and Frog.)
