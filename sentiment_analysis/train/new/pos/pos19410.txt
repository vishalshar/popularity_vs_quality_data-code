I bought the Chewbeads necklace with the hopes that it would help with teething, and also be a piece of jewelry that my 10 month old couldn't break. So far, it has delivered! I've received numerous compliments on the necklace--everyone is always shocked when I tell them that it is actually a teether, and I think I'd probably even consider wearing it even if my daughter wasn't with me!I've also been pleasantly surprised that my daughter likes to play with it while she's nursing, which is nice for me because she is a VERY active nurser, and my chest and arms were absolutely covered with marks where she had pinched me. But, if I happen to be wearing the Chewbeads necklace, that seems to distract her and save my skin. Woo hoo!The only downside was that the necklace did have a very plastic-y smell when it first arrived, much like I remember a certain silicone giraffe smelling like. It was really a pretty big deterrent from wearing the necklace. But after a day or two, the smell seemed to dissipate, and now is just fine.
