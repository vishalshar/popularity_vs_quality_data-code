These bags are great. I have been using these and the lanisoh bags for approximately 2 weeks. I prefer these bags. Here's a couple of really important reasons why:- The First Years' bags are made of stiff plastic, which means that you can pour them one-handed, which is essential when holding a screaming baby in the middle of the night (or really any time). The Lanisoh bags are made of floppy plastic, which makes them unstable when I am using them one-handed. It also makes the "pour spout" awkward and potentially messy. Note: The pour spout requires you to squeeze the lanisoh bag from the sides. I much preferred the natural action of pouring the bag from the seam.- the ziplock zipper on the First Years' bags is very easy to use and clear. So far, I have not had a leak. The Lanisoh bags have two ziplock zippers, one which is clear and the other, about half an inch above it, is colored and thicker. In theory, this seems like a good idea, but I missed the more substantial zipper lock for the first few bags that I used. I did not experience a leak, but I wondered if this might be the source of leaks for others. (Given some people's reports of leakage for both bags, I check the seal on them many times before putting them in the freezer, regardless of bag type.)Both bags are the same price. The measurements on the sides of both are grossly incorrect, so make sure that you are using the measures from your bottles instead. We could not find First Years' bags at Target, so we rely on amazon for them. Lanisoh are available at Target.
