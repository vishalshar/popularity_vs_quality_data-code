WIFE REVIEW: We've had our Explorer for almost 2 years now and are about to start using the doubles kit. We have traveled a fair bit with it (overseas etc) and I would recommend a cover bag for air travel as ours has been damaged during flights. That said, its been super easy to purchase replacement parts and customer service has been excellent. It worked well with our Maxi Cosi car seat, to toddler and beyond. We also have the rain and sun shields which are very helpful - and block wind/protect during long, cold winters. Great for jogging, maneuvers well. A number of our friends own them and are very happy as well.HUSBAND REVIEW: It's built like a tank and weighs as much. You can put 5 bags of groceries in the bottom of it, plus a six-pack, but if it were my call (it's not), I'd have a second travel stroller.
