I ordered both the Bumkins liners and the Bummis Bio-Soft in order to compare the two and see which I preferred.Bummis pros:Smaller footprint on the changing space (a consideration for us because we have limited space there)Large enough to possibly split into 2 liners per sheet (so effectively 200 per roll instead of 100) for a smaller baby, but not for a larger oneThe differences I noticed most with the Bumkins were:Larger (could easily split into 2 liners per sheet for even a larger baby)Noticeably softerPop-up style, like a tissue box, seems easier for one-handed use than the Bummis tear-off sheets. In practice, however, I found that it made little difference, because I still needed 2 hands to get the liner properly folded and positioned on the diaper! For this reason, I generally find it easiest to get the liner out and position it in the new diaper before I take the old diaper off of the baby.Both brands seem to flush equally well, and both do an excellent job of staying in place. I cloth diapered without liners for my previous baby and with this baby until he started solids, but I definitely prefer the ease the flushable liners add and wouldn't go back to not using them at this point unless we had a septic system that couldn't handle the flushable liners. I do recommend letting the soiled liners sit in the toilet for a couple of minutes or more before flushing -- it supposedly helps them break down more easily and reduce the likelihood of clogging the toilet, though in practice I've never had either brand's usage result in a toilet clog.All in all, I do slightly prefer the softer feel of the Bumkins, but the differences are minor, and I like the smaller footprint for the Bummis. For personal preference the Bumkins win out by a hair, but both brands are similar enough that I wouldn't hesitate to buy either.
