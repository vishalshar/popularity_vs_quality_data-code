LOL on me!  I have one of these already and really like it.  I use mine 90% for cleaning tea pots and cups.  The bristles were stained and I could not bleach them clean. So, I bought a new one and relegated the old one to cleaning supplies.  After washing it, I decided to sterilize it in the microwave.  WRONG!  It was arcing and smelled.  Obviously, there is metal under the plastic.  I caught it before the new brush was damaged.  I also realized the stains on the old one are rust, not tea.  An overnight soak in a CLR solution solved that.  Now I have two nice looking brushes.These are great brushes that I highly recommend.  Just remember to sterilize them with boiling water and not in the microwave.  If I were using them for baby/tot consumption, I doubt I would use CLR to clean them.  Perhaps not washing them in the dishwasher would prevent rust stains.
