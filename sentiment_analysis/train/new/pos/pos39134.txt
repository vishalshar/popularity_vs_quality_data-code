I love the leopard print on this hamper, plus the accent color is really pretty and rich in person! The frame is a little more lightweight than I was expecting - but I wanted this style of hamper. I wanted it to be able to fold up and move easily, and also be able to hang a small mesh bag on it for my little one's socks (the tiny socks always get lost in the laundry somehow!) This looks great in her room - only time will tell how sturdy it is!
