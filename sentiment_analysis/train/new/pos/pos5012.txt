Have you ever cloth diapered and had to be out with 2 sick kids ALL day? Poop in every diaper. Every. Single. Diaper. For 8 hours.Not a single waft of that rank sick-kid-poop escaped this bag! Nor a drop of pee! And the front zipper was great for keeping the dirty clothes separate from the poopy diapers :)It held 5 diaper covers, 8 microfiber inserts, and 2 toddler osocozy prefolds fyi. A little squishing was needed by the end of the day, but it still zipped shut :)
