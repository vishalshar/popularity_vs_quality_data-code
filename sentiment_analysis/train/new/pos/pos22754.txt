I have installed some of the original Mommy's Helper Safe-Lok and the new ones with the disable feature. Neither of them was particularly straightforward to install, but once you do one the others are a lot easier. I found both kinds of Safe-Lok to be much more effective than any of the four kinds of Safety First cabinet locks I tried (the Safety First ones broke if you pulled the cabinet too hard, as you might do if you forgot the lock was on). While the disable feature sounds great, they changed the design slightly and it's not as good as the original. The mounting bracket on the new ones are much harder to install than the original, but more importantly, the reclosing protection feature doesn't work on the new ones (it works great on the original without the disable feature). The new ones offer the option of not using the disable feature and mounting the locking arm directly onto the cabinet without the outer mounting bracket, but the design of the locking arm was changed in a few subtle ways that still render the reclosing feature ineffective. I'd highly recommend getting the original Safe-Lok without the disable feature.
