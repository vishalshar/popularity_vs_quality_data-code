I bought these to try with my son's bumgenius elementals because if I didn't change him every hour he would leak. We tried the microfiber inserts by bumgenius and those work fine during the day, but TWO of those in his diaper at night and he would still leak everywhere!! I was ready to throw in the towel with cloth diapering because I was so sick of washing our sheets every single day and he was going through 3 outfits a day on top of that. I stripped his diapers several times, tried several different inserts and even tried a wool diaper cover for nighttime use and nothing worked very well. When the package came I washed and dried them right away which increases the absorbency of the hemp. We got through a few days of diapering with not a single leak. I was skeptical about trying them at night because nothing else I tried ever worked. We eventually started using disposables at night because I was so frustrated. The first night we used this hemp insert with the microfiber and had no leaking whatsoever. The next night I got brave and used just the hemp...changed him for bed at 9pm and he woke up at 8am totally dry!! We've only had them for a week and I am already so thrilled with this product. An absolute must have for cloth diapering families!! My only disappointment is that it took me 16 months to discover them!
