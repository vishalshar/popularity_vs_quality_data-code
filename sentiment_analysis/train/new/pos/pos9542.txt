My 3 month old son is bored easily but this mobile holds his attention for up to 30 minutes at a time! That's a big thing for a young baby. It definitely helps that you can clip this thing on to practically anything. I would certainly recommend this product to any parent with a baby or one on the way. It's one of the few purchases that I've made prior to our son's birth that I don't regret.
