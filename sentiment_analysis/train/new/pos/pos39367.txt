Received my chair today. Arrived two days earlier than expected which was nice. Easy to assemble. However, I watched as it was delivered, it is clearly marked FRAGILE, TEAM LIFT, THIS SIDE UP. I hear a large slam, in which i cringe, because I know it is the sound of my package slamming onto the groud. One of the two small women delivering it starts moving it quickly towards me end over end, jostling and slamming as she goes. Wgy didnt thr other lady help her ehen thr package clearly states "team lift" ? Drops it in front of me on its side. (Where the "this side up" is clearly sideways) I can see how terribly damaged the box is, I asked if there was something I needed to sign, hoping there would be somewhere I could notate the damaged box. She said no and left. I was quite upset and concerned that my chair would have broken pieces, from just the few minutes I observed of the transport, I can just imagine how it was treated the rest of its trip. I took it out of the box, inspected for damages, no cracks or broken pieces, but there are a few indents, scrapes etc. That I know are from poor delivery handling. The chair itself is decent quality, cushions are a bit stiff, but I guess that's ok because will break in and hopefully last longer. Recline feature is a bit rough, it requires quite a bit of effort to push it back and forward if you a small person like myself, not something I would be able to do with baby in arms. Armrests have big flaps will no purpose, they could easily be pockets, I plan to make that a small project to convert them myself eventually. Everything glides smoothly. This is my first day with it, no complaints as of yet. Will update once I have more time in it, and if I encounter any issues.
