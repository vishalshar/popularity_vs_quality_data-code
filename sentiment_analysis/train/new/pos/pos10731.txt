Actually, I bought this to listen to my kids while they're napping (I have childcare).  This works perfectly.  I haven't tried the voice-activation feature, but the monitor picks up the kids' movements and even whispers (I have it on almost full volume).  I also love the sounds and lights feature to be able to see things across the room.  There is absolutely no static or problems with our set.  I only paid twelve ninety-nine for our set and would do it all over again.However, if you're gonna pay more for a monitor, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Angelcare Bebe Sounds Sound and Movement Monitor.  I just bought our second set to use for the playpen.  Worth every penny...sound sleep and peace of mind is priceless!
