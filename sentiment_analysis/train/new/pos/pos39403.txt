When used with flats, this cover is as trim as a disposable. Also, the sizes run big. My son is 7 months, 18 lbs & small fits best. We have some medium bummis brite & super whispers based on the standard sizing & they are too big for him. They fit & don't leak but too much wiggle room & too fluffy. The small is awesome on him. Really enjoy how lightweight the material is. I don't feel like he's suffocating in plastic & very easy to hand wash quickly in bathroom sink with hand soap. Dries in a flash. Wish we had tried these first. The super whispers are great with prefolds used for overnights. The original is just fine with a flat origami style for naps. Standard prefolds (chinese or indian cotton) are too bulky for this cover.
