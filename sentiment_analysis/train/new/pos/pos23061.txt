I was given a Bright Starts bouncy chair as a gift and my baby really liked it. I needed a second bouncer and purchased this one based on the good reviews. However, my baby doesn't particularly care for this chair. It leans a little further back, which seems to me would be more comfy, but she prefers to be more upright to look around. The toy bar is not within reach and she actively reaches for, grabs and bats at the toys on the bright start toy bar. This chair has a wider base and needs a bit more clear space, but the cover is so much easier to remove than the bright starts. The bottom of the chair frame folds upward slightly to allow the cover to be removed and very easy access to the battery compartment. Also, I thought the cover was plush from the pictures. It's not...but it is cushioned and not tightly drawn from one bar to the other like the bright starts chair.
