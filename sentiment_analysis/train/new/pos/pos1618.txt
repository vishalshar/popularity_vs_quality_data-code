So far this product isn't bad. Just got it and yes like all the other review the instructions are bad. The numbering system on the pieces and the book were off from one another. That being said the pictures in the book were pretty good so I was able to see what went were. Me and my wife put it together in about a hour and a half. When putting this together the one tip that I have is you will need to drill pilot holes into the wood when installing the back piece. Mine didn't line up that well and the first time I busted the wood up pretty good and ended up drilling my own holes where they should have gone. The changing table looks and feels sturdy and I'm hoping that we get a lot of good use out of it. The cherry color that we got matches all of our other baby furniture very well.
