We converted our son's crib to a toddler bed a couple of months ago (during summer.) At the time the fitted sheet and single blanket worked well but now that we are in fall and the nights are colder we wanted actual bedding for our child. This set is adorable, has held up 2 washes so far with no color bleeding and we have not experienced the fuzzies as another person commented. My son even stays sleeping in "normal" positions now (as opposed to waking up with his legs hanging off of the bed or his head at the foot of the bed.) The elephant ear is a little "flap" that was an added surprise and my son loves it. The color is a little more lime than I was expecting (I would prefer it to be a little more olive which is appeared in the photo) but it isn't a deal breaker. My only real con is the price. It was hard to put this much money into bedding that he will only be able to use until he grows into a bigger bed or we need the crib mattress for future children. I love that the bottom of the "flat" sheet is fitted. I think that this set will endure the washer - I just hope it endures the adventures of potty training... And that's really out of this product's control...
