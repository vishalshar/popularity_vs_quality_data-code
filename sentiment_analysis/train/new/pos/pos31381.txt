I would encourage every new Mom and Dad to register for one of these or pick one up. I wasn't sure because of mixed reviews, but I am so happy with how well it has held up. When it arrived, the color was a little different than we saw online, but as far as use has gone, we have used, abused and it is still performing well. It stores so well, the attachments pop on and off so well and are easily stored when you are done. Our brute of a son really likes having his temp taken under his arm, so when he is sick and crabby we've even let him 'play' with this for hours (hey, anything to keep a crabby guy happy...) and it even took his use. I really am pleased with it, especially considering how well priced it is compaired to others.I should mention that we got a couple of other thermometers as gifts that simply read the wrong temps, just never worked, or didn't last even through the first half-year.
