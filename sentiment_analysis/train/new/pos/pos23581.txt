We have used these for swimming around in the back yard and never had an issue. If you're looking for something for your kid to wear running around in the yard or something you might want something more durable, this is lined swimsuit material so it could snag in the grass or on pavement. I like them a lot though. The fit is excellent and the prints are great and they are comfortable for a long time. You only need 2 as long as your kid won't 'go' more than once lol. They seem to contain pee as well and can just be rinsed. The way they unsnap is convenient and I think they are great for under a wetsuit / sun suit type thing because there isn't any bulk... So kids hardly know they're there.
