Buying another one for our sitters house! My daughter is obssed with Dora and this potty is perfect.  She sits on the potty and points to Dora on the seat.  She gets excited about sitting on the potty.  One nagative that other reviews said about it sliding is true.  Quick easy fix - Roll/fold up an old towel and put it under the back side of the Dora potty between the two toilet seats and it prevents it from sliding.  The stool is great and doesn't slide like some people have said.  Not sure if this is a new model and they fixed that problem.Great product!
