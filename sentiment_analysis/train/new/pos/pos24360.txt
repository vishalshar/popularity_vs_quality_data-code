This is for you! All of the Skip Hop Pronto Changing Stations are great - we keep a plain black one in my husband's car, and I got this one to carry/keep in my car. I'm not a diaper bag person, and we all know that those changing stations everywhere never have the table liners, so the attached, padded changing pad is perfect. I love being able to detach it and stick it in another bag if I have one as well. My daughter is 8 months old and in Size 3 diapers - this holds 3 easily, I could probably stuff more in it if I wanted to expand the clasp. The wipes case holds the standard size travel wipes you can find anywhere. I've put a Pampers 18 count in it without a problem, and it's easy to open, stays closed, and is good quality.Some people complained about the quality of the fabric on the outside, so I was initially a bit apprehensive....I think it's just fine quality/wear-wise, and the Jonathan Adler print is really fun and different. This changer is totally one of my favorite baby "gadgets!"
