really like this high chair.  we used to have a combi 3-in-1 hero and needed to find something better after one of the plastic arms broke among several other things we didnt like about it.  we also found that we didnt need the capability to use our chair as a booster (ie, strap it to a regular chair).  the graco was very compact in every way we wanted.  the seat wasnt overly deep, the back allows our baby to sit more upright, small footprint when expanded (compared to the combi) and extremely compact when folded for storage.  light weight and easy to unfold and fold.  much more stable feel than the combi, too.  love the two table types available where the smaller one allows us easy access when feeding our baby in the early stages.  the larger one clips right over top of the smaller for when she's able to try and feed herself.  the seat padding is really nice but so far we havent had to try and clean it.  the 5-point harness works just like our graco stroller so we easily got her in and out of the chair from day one.  when we received the chair, no assembly was required.  word of caution if you have wood floors where you use the chair:  when loaded with the baby, it made grooves in the flooring when moving the chair around.  this was easily solved by removing the feet and replacing them with tennis balls (kinda like you see people doing with their walkers).  worked great but when folded up, the chair requires something to lean against.  since this would most likely occur with whatever chair we bought, i didnt count this against the rating.  in a nutshell, we're very happy with the purchase considering what we've already experienced and did not check this out in the store before buying.  thanks to all the other reviewers for the detailed information to help us in our decision.
