We purchased these night lights so that we are able to see in the bathroom late at night and these worked great!  The best part about the night light is that the sensor detects when it is dark enough and they turn on.  We don't have to worry about plugging in a night light each night or forgetting to turn a night light off each morning.  The sensors on this night light do that for you so you can leave it plugged in all the time.  The night light produces enough light to be able to see even in a larger sized bathroom.  And the look of the night light is more "adultish" than others we have seen.  The picture shows how it looks when it gets dark enough at night.  The picture does not to it justice for how much it really lights up a room.
