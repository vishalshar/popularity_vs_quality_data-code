My son loves Elmo - and this is a cute Elmo toy. It doesn't seem to be a very satisfying teether though - Elmo could be a little softer or chewier - I think he would have liked it better. The actual 'chewy' parts are rather small so he was never very interested in it for that purpose. It does make a satisfying/distracting noise when shaken but doesn't hold his attention long, sadly.
