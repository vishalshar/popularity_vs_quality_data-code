This Munchkin Deluxe Care Cart is absolutely awesome!  I purchased one for myself when my daughter was a baby--she's now almost 8--and more recently purchased another as a gift for a friend who is a new mom.  This cart is a must have for any parent who  likes to keep things organized.  It's very well made and is surprisingly sturdy...I thought for sure it would wobble a lot, but found that that was not the case.  It was also very easy to assemble.  It's a great addition to any baby nursery; works perfectly to keep baby items in one place and organized!
