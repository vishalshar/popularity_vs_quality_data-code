Great dresser for the little one. We purchased this with the Munire Medford crib for our newborn. This item is the same (identical) to the Munire Brunswick set at Buy Buy Baby. The main difference is that they mandate shipping fees and Amazon offers free shipping if you are Prime.Shipping was about a week out and you got to choose your day and time slot. The delivery drivers left it in my garage. There is no inside delivery or packaging removal. I say this because there is a TON of packaging. Cardboard, styrofoam and wrapping. You have to deal with it. I spent about an hour breaking down and bagging everything so my trash man would take it. A little bit of a pain but free shipping!The item is very heavy, its solid wood. The dimensions on Amazon are INCORRECT. That is for the box it comes in. Please reference the Munire website fore accurate measurements, but I measured and its 34'' tall, 56'' long and 18.5'' deep. I say this because we plan to use it with a topper to change the baby on. 41'' is too tall for that purpose. 34'' is better.Drawers (dove tailed) glide smoothly but do not have the soft close feature. There are instructions on how to remove them for a more easy move but we couldn't get them out. Just tape the drawers closed and get two strong people to move it. One more note, the drawers dont open all the way, I have noticed this with more and more furniture lately. You will have some items in the way back that you will have to hunch down to see/get.We are very happy with it, just know its smaller than what this description says. VERY well built.
