I purchased this bag a few months ago because I need a larger diaper bag for travel and overnight stays. I also own the Ju Ju Be Be Tween Diaper Bag, Black/Silver which is my everyday diaper bag. I love the quality of Ju Ju Be's bags; great material and nice fabrics. The Be Spicy has lots of pockets, inside and out to hold everything you need for an overnight/weekend trip. I love the insulated bottle pockets on the outside (there are 2 on this bag). The inside of this bag will hold a lot; I was able to fit 8-10 diapers, a big pack of wipes, burp clothes, extra clothes, several toys, 2 blankets, and more with some room to spare. There are 2 large magazine pockets on the outside along with a large mommy pocket for your keys, phone, etc (although I like the mommy pocket on the Be Tween more). I love the extra long key fob on the bags, no more searching for keys with one hand while holding the baby. The changing pad that comes with this bag is big and cushy, love the memory foam! The bag can be used as a messenger or as a tote. The material does not stain easily and the bag is easy to clean. The bag can be quite heavy when stuffed but any bag will become heavy when stuffed to the brim. This is a great bag, a little to big for me to use on a everyday basis but perfect for overnights and weekend trips.
