I bought these barrels for my son when he was 2 years old.  They quickly became a favorite because you can play with them so many ways!  Hide surprises in them, roll them, shake them, play with them in the bath tub or pool.  Stack them, sort them in sizes and color, take them apart and let your child find the other half. Great classic toy!!  My first grand daughter loved them and I was pleased to find them online for my new granddaughter.  Now that I have written this I realize I need to buy myself a couple of sets for future gifts.
