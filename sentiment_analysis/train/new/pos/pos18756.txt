These blankets are awesome for swaddling.  I used them in the summer without fear of overheating.  My daughter slept through the night at 6 weeks because I was able to swaddle her so well (my older children-not so much).The only thing they should put in the description is that these are the 42" x 42" size.  The 47" x 47" works much better when your child gets older.  We also bought the "Princess Posie" set and they are the 47" square ones.
