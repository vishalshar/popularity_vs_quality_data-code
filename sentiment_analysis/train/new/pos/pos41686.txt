My son loves this.  It is his most cherished object ever.  The paci broke off after more than a year of abuse and tough love.  He looked at both ends and started carrying both around for a while, but eventually forgot about the paci part and just carried the duck.  He weaned himself of his paci!We bought one with a monkey for our new baby and he loves it.  At first it's a struggle keeping it in a newborn's mouth because the animal's weight will pull it out if it slips, but as the baby gets older, it gives him/her something to hold while sucking (which is super cute), and they learn to put the paci back in by themselves(or at least a foot of the animal which works too).When they get gross and start to stink, just throw it in the washing machine (don't even need to dry it, just wrap in a towel and squeeze water out) or hand wash real fast in the sink with some soap.
