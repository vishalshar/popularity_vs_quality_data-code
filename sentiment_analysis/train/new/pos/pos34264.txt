Contrary to other reviews, we've found that our 8 month old is at a good height when placed in the totseat in any normal chair. He cannot sit unassisted on the floor, but he is stuck in place in this harness. I do not worry that he will fall, though I was hesitant looking at the design. I believe you will be very happy with this, I plan on giving them as baby gifts -- really awesome!!!LIKE:*low price*keeps baby in place (our baby can't sit unassisted yet but this held him in place)*folds up small (fits into my purse inside included storage bag)*machine washable/dryable*fits every chairDISLIKE:*wish they made an organic/eco-friendly version
