I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of these plates. They are great quality and should hold up to many years of washing and eating. The size surprised me too as they were larger than I thought they would be. They are not dinky toddler plates but a real dinner size plate that should last your child to whatever point they are ready for a real, breakable plate. The price was steep so I was hesitant to buy but now I realize that the quality justifies the cost and am happy I took the risk.The best part is that the plates are BPA, PVC, and phthalate free which are the most common and toxic chemicals found in plastic. I don't microwave our food for long periods, but I feel safe warming up a plate of food on this product without fear of toxins leaking into my kids' food. As a bonus, the plates are made of recycled materials and the Green Eats company uses manufacturing methods that help reduce emissions and save energy. All in all a good buy!
