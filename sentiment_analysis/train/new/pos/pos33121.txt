Here is the advantage to using this clutch over the others, the size of the changing pad! Have a baby blowout! You're covered! In a store without a diaper changing station! Definitely has you covered. With the shorter changing pads their arms, heads or legs will still be touching that gross floor. Yes, there is virtually no padding to this thing. Where the head pillow is? That's basically nonexistent. I had to feel around to find it, it was so flat. But, I bought it for the size of the pad and it does exactly what I need it to. I can throw this in my purse and it doesn't take up too much space. If you want comfort ( how many times do we change them on the floor at home. They really don't care) then this is not the one for you. If you want space, for when you're out and about and really worried about germy areas, then this is awesome!
