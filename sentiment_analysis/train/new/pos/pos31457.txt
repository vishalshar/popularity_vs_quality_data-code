I love this car seat pouch.  It has pockets on both sides.  It will work on the left or the right of the seat and it tucks under the frame just a little so that it doesn't protrude into other passengers.  Also, our carrier is currently rear facing and we have no trouble with it getting in the way.  It is small with little pouches but that's just fine for us.  I'm not looking to store stuffed animals in it. It is perfect for pacifiers, small bottles and cups, squeeze pouches and the like.  It's in a position that is a bit difficult for the child to reach but I think that is a good thing.  This way I can store several things for a sibling to hand to baby without baby pulling everything out and throwing stuff all over the car!
