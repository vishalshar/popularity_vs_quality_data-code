Smooth ride, great shading, great weight capacity, and fabulous maneuverability.  It has plenty of storage that I don't even need a diaper bag.  The underbasket could be bigger, but it's just fine once I organize and put stuff in the various pockets it has.  I love the vent at the top so that my twins can get a nice airflow while they're seated, and the seat belts are padded so that the twins don't have hard plastic near their faces.  The straps don't get twisted up because of the swivel at the top.We use it so frequently that we've even preferred this stroller to our carseat stroller (you know, the one where you simply click the carseat in) and will simply take our twins out of their carseats to sit in this stroller, even for shorter trips.  I would love it if they could make it so that it could hold 2 carseats, but that would make the stroller too wide for your ordinary door.The only real criticism I have is that it is a heavier stroller.  But that's the trade-off for the incredible durability.
