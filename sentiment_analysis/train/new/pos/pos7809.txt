I purchased this crib after reading the reviews on it (thank you, fellow reviewers!) and was surprised at how ridiculously sturdy this crib is once you get it together.  The only downside is that you really need to be an octopus in order to do it on your lonesome.  My husband works late hours and so I have been doing the nursery on my own.  I can handle Ikea products, I thought to myself, so I can do this!Hopeless laughter ensued.The box itself is super heavy (beware, pregnant ladies everywhere!) but each individual piece is manageable.  Unfortunately, you HAVE to put it together on its back, and once you have the rectangle built and tightened up, you have to get it on its feet - at around the same weight at the box weighed originally, of course.  I had to wait for the hubs to get home to help me heft it, but I was very happy with the height of the highest setting, the sturdiness of the wooden structure, and the slim gaps between the rails (always a major concern for having babies around).The one thing I was absolutely flabberghasted about, though, was that they put a GIANT OMG STICKER right on the facing panel of the crib.  Seriously, stock up on some Goo-B-Gone to get rid of this sucker, because it's as sticky as a bumper sticker and twice as thick.  Normally, I'd just score it, douse it in alcohol, and scrape it away, but being that this is obviously a laminate crib, sharp blades into the paint could cause problems.  But, of course, the sticker is there to WARN YOU that OMG the thing should ONLY ever hold babies.  One baby.  At a time.  Ever.  Period.  Because common sense apparently isn't something parents need in order to raise a child.Wait, what am I saying? 'MURICA!Anyway, yes, I'd totally recommend this crib :) It's adorable, very sturdy, and I have no qualms with sticking my newborn in it to sleep :) Just buy some Goo-B-Gone and a decent, non-gouging wallpaper scraper.
