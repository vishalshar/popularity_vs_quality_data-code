I have had this stroller for over 2 years now and I love it. It held my son from the time he was 6 weeks old (that is when we purchased it). My nephew who is 6 can still easily ride in this stoller, so it will last you a long time. It's one of the only umbrella strollers on the market that has 2 storage compartments, a canopy, and it RECLINES. It also has a leg extender on it so when they are little their legs don't dangle off the end, and then it folds down for when their older. It does not have a cup holder, but it has a storage pocket on the back that you can put a drink in and it holds it great, or if you have a diaper bag or blanket in the bottom you can easily support a drink in the bottom.  I have taken this stroller everywhere, up in the mountains hiking, through grass, even in snow (I walk over 5 miles daily with it). It also fits easily into any trunk and takes up little space. Look no further this is the best stroller out there.
