I bought these specifically to wrangle my dog out of areas in my house and they are wonderful.I bough two a year ago for my first floor and they've endured beautifully and still look great in my house.  I loved the convenience of the gate so much that I replaced two low expandable discount store baby gates that were on my second floor with two more of these.The gates I received last week have had some subtle but very functional improvements since last year's version.... bravo to the designer/manufacturer!After the first week of having these installed upstairs (to help keep the dog out of restricted areas) and not having to step over those low wood/plastic web baby gates is just pure heaven, I actually feel like a normal human moving though these doorways now.. these gates will very likely save me from tripping myself over and down the stairs LOL
