With twin boys coming I wanted something reasonably priced that looked nice and didn't take up too much space like the Lifetime cribs we've seen at the baby stores.  This crib is not only so beautiful in person but it was a breeze to put together.  I did it with my stepdaughter while I was 7 months pregnant with twins.  And we did two of them!  The color matches the Leksvik "Antique" furniture I bought from Ikea perfectly!  We have two guest rooms with furniture and full size solid wood beds so we didn't want to spend alot on furniture that we wouldn't need when they get bigger.  I love that this crib converts so they can continue to share a room until they are out of the toddler stage (mainly for the ease of us parents who have to respond to the needs of two babies/toddlers at once).  I can't recommend it enough and NO ONE should be disappointed with this crib.  It does sit lower than alot of other cribs, but my husband is 6'2 and he has no problem with it.  It only takes 2 seconds to bend over and pick up a baby or put a pacifier back in their mouth.  I highly recommend this beautiful practical crib!
