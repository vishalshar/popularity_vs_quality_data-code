I have a 9 month old and of course I have the standard push in outlet covers that you can buy about 100 for less than $1. But those things are hard to get out (which they should be). And you can forget my husband even trying to pull that thing out with his short fingernails. So I bought this for an outlet I use frequently (where I plug in the vacuum). This works awesome. Now I can stop ripping up my fingernails trying to get the others out. I bought a second one for another frequently used plug. Sure these are more expensive than the cheapos and they do the same job - but this helps out my sanity... and my nails.
