This is an amazing Stroller. In conjunction with the SIP 30/30 baby carriers I had so much flexibility for my twins. This stroller has so many creature comforts for the kids. Leg covers and top covers that can completely block the wind and cold, to lap belts that have 3 different setting depending on the age of your child as well as a steering wheel! I have had this stroller for 3 years and it's just now getting to small for my kids who are 3 1/2. I only have a few complains but it is not on stability or durability because it never broke on us. The complains are more about the comfort for the parents. It is bulky. If we didn't have a minivan I am not sure how people would tote this thing around. It not as heavy as another commenter complained about but it does take up a lot of room. I was able to stuff it into my wife Nissan Sentra's trunk but it took a bit of engineering magic and great puzzle work but there was no room left for anything else like groceries. Next don't even think about flying with this thing. Tried it once! Never did it again. I would have liked to have seen a snap on drink holder but the basket underneath was an awesome place to store jackets, diaper bags, purse, and snacks. This thing was great at parks or the zoo.
