We have a Bob stroller for most outings, but wanted something lighter and easier so that my mother (70 yrs old) could get it in and out of the car when she's with the baby.  We took it out for it's first major outing yesterday - a couple hours at an outdoor shopping mall.  It was super easy and our 3 month old fell fast asleep.  The back adjusts to lay almost all the way flat which is great for infants.  Getting it in and out of the car was a cinch.  It didn't hold our large baby bag too well, though.  However, most of our larger outings will be with the Bob stroller (which by the way is an awesome stroller, too).  If you need something easy for quick trips or lightweight for grandma to handle, this one is great.
