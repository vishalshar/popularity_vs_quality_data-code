This Tummy time mat was one I just had to have. The colors are gorgeous and it is bright and comfortable for my little one. The best part is that besides using it for tummy time, I use the baby boppy in all sorts of other ways. It helps prop up my son when he wants to look around and I can use it alone on my bed when he is gassy and wants to lay on his stomach or be propped on his side and I want him near me, (without a worry of suffocating on blankets etc.). I've also used it in his crib as I waited to get a wedge when his reflux was bad...it is a cool feeling, slippery material so I just cover it with a blanket and it acts like a little "propper upper". :) Easy to clean, mat folds up small, so nice!
