With some of the reviews on here I was a little skeptical about purchasing this, but I don't regret it one bit. Very easy to put together. As some of the others said it was wobly, I have no idea what they were talking about mine was very sturdy. Others so said it was very short and they had to bend over to change the baby. I'm 5'8 and my husband is 6'1 and he have no problem with that. The table comes past my belly button and is good height. It's a lot bigger than I expected but definitely worth the money
