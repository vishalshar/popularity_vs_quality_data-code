I spontaneously ordered this because I was ordering something for my son and of course had to get something for my daughter, too. I chose this because of the price and the prime eligibility. I am so glad I did!!! It looks cute and little in the pic, so I imagined something hand-sized. But I was wrong!! The doll is really big!! I don't have it with me, but the width has to be 6-8 inches maybe and the height is maybe a foot. I may be a little off, but it is a big doll! My daughter is 2.5 and the doll is about half of her height. :D It makes a good companion for her to loop her arm around its neck. The blanket is a standard sized blanket, about the size of our throws we use on the couch and my children's other blankets. I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase and recommend it!
