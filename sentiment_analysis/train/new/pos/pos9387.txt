I bought this so I could go on long trips using my Babies R Us Zobo lightweight umbrella stroller. The stroller has a mesh compartment at the bottom, but it's very inconvenient to get to. This organizer has more compartments than I realized which is a huge plus. The cup holder compartments are best for water bottles, but I wouldn't put coffee cups in them. Also, it was a little difficult to place my babies milk bottles in them, but I can work around that. Two of the compartments would be great for holding snacks and sunglasses. The best part of this whole thing and the reason why I bought it was the big mesh compartment. I definitely want to pack just the essentials without have to lugging around a big diaper bag around. We are planning a trip to Disney and I was worried about where to keep my baby's snacks and water cool from the hot Florida sun. I recently bought an igloo insulated lunch bag from my local super market. I put the lunch bag in the mesh compartment of the stroller organizer and Voila! I can pretty much carry everything for a day at Disney without weighing me down. Plus I bought two of the J.L. Childress side sling cargo net. I would give it 5 stars but I still want to test it at Disney first. Sorry all the pictures came out sideways.
