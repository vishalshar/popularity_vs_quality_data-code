These blocks are soft and beautiful, but at first I thought that only two of my three blocks produced a sound. I even sent my set back and got a new set. It turned out that block number two has a squeak but I had to push it really hard to hear the squeak, and it only works if squeezed in a certain spot.Also, one of the blocks does not stack great.Overall I am happy with these blocks because I want my child to play with organic toys and the blocks are pretty and cute.
