My daughter sweats something terrible! We live in Texas so it's expected a little bit. Unfortantly she swears so much through the day and night it all builds up on her head. She is 9 months old and had horrible cradle cap! Like terrible it came out of no where's too! Well I did a lot of research and tried everything! From oil to mayonnaise and nothing seemed to work or help in the slightest! Her cradle cap had gotten so bad that it was a little embarrassing. Finally I found Mustela baby shampoo!! Oh my gosh amazing!!! It was bath night as soon as I opened the package. I applied it to her hair let it set for 30 seconds and used a baby brush and scrub lightly. After another minute setting I rinsed. Once my baby's hair was dry I could immediately tell the difference! After two washes it was nearly gone and now we use it once a week! Sometimes twice.The smell is so nice! It's subtly but still babyish. I was worried it was going to smell soapy or awful. At first smelling it it smells weird but once my baby's hair was dry it smelled so nice! I would recommend this product to anyone with or without cradle cap!
