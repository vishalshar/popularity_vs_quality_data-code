Perfect for holding keepsakes for baby.  We bought this for a memorial box for our deceased daughter.The foam stuff for the footprints did not take and hold the imprint, but we used inked footprints and that worked just as well.  It's a special and beautiful holding place for special things - the outfit she wore in the hospital, an unused preemie sized diaper, tiny booties, cards and letters from friends and family, and pictures and letters from our other children for their baby sister.  This was the perfect size to hold what we wanted to put in it, and is a special place for our family to help through the grieving process of our beloved daughter and sister...
