My wife is currently pregnant, and has a pregnancy pillow that she used when pregnant with our first child. The pillow itself is fine, but the cover that came with the pillow has gotten old, stained, and putting it in the laundry doesn't seem to get it as clean as we would like.My wife text me one morning at work and asked me to order this item for her before she left on a business trip (She was driving) . I ordered it, and thanks to Prime shipping, I received it the day prior to her departure.One thing I immediately noticed is how soft the cover is. It felt like it had a higher thread count than the original cover that came with the pillow. The pattern was also much nicer.The BEST part of the cover though is how well it fit. The cover was actually very easy to put the pillow into. With the old one I had to fight it and fight it for 10+ minutes trying to shove the pillow into the case, almost like it was too small for the pillow. This cover however was very slightly stretchy and big enough for the pillow. The case still fits snug on the pillow and there are no unused pockets of space.If you sleep with one of these pillows, you really can't go wrong with this cover. Everything about it has made my wife happy, and when you are pregnant (I'm told), if there is anything you can do to be more comfortable in bed, you do it!
