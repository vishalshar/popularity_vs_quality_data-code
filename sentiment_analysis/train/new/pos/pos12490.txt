My DD went through a period around 2-4 months that I thought would never end of nearly non stop screaming in the car if she was tired. She didn't know how to put herself to sleep, so she would scream. I tried this hoping it might help a little and in fact it helped ALOT. She loved the lights and music and often would calm and sometimes even fall asleep. She's a bit older now (8mos) and doesn't mind riding the car like she used to, but still really likes this toy. When I put her in her carseat, she cranes her neck around me while I strap her in looking for the lights to turn on. The remote is quirky. A few things: if the batteries in the base unit are dying, the remote doesn't work. Obviously if the batteries in the remote are dying, you'll also have issues. Lastly, the unit plays through a whole playlist of colors/ language/ etc. then eventually (maybe 10 mins?) plays an ending song, then turns off. Once that happens, the remote will no longer work-- you have to turn it back on at the base (stop light, car in park, strain around into the back seat, reaching allllll the way back and hit it), then it starts over and the remote works again. They key is noticing that it's ending before it ends and start it back up with the remote, but I inevitably miss my opportunity and have to do the stoplight dance. I bet when she's a little older she'll be able to kick it and restart it herself. Bottom line: the baby loves it and it helped her not be so upset in the car, so overall I'd say I love it. After seeing how well it worked for her we immediately bought one for our 2nd car.
