We got these bottles at our Baby Shower.  I wasn't planning on bottle feeding our son, but had great difficulty breastfeeding.  Our son loves the bottle, it's easy for him to suck, and he does not have a lot of gas or spitting up.  Also, when I was breast feeding, I was afraid he'd get nipple confusion and reject me, but that was not the case.  He went back and forth between me and the bottle very readily.  The only complaint we have, is that these bottles are not compatible with any other bottle. Most bottles are relatively the same size and shape so you can interchange the nipples.  Not this one!  The bottles of formula we got from the hospital were very convenient, especially for the 3am feedings.  All we needed to do was add a nipple, but the Avent nipples don't fit onto the formula bottles.  We had to go out and buy any other bottle just so the nipple would fit.  Otherwise, this was a great bottle.  If you are planing on using the Avent system exculsively, then this is the system for you.
