Quality:  This particular brand (Charlie Banana) is professionally sewn, the materials are superb, and the snaps are high quality.  After my initial purchase, I bought two more sets.  Everything is perfect with each one, so quality control is awesome with this brand.Wearing:  I test out products very well before I write my reviews.  After mowing my bumpy one acre lawn on my riding mower the pad was still in place -no shifting, no bunching, and absolutely no sticky sweaty feeling.  And no leaks.  They absorb quite well, so I didn't get that yucky pad feeling.  When you take a dirty one off, you can fold it back into a tiny square, so the yucky part isn't exposed.Washing:  I didn't have high expectations of getting these pads stain free, but I was shocked when after washing they were good as new.  They magically came clean.  The type of soap/detergent used might make a difference, though.  I use vegan bar soap and then I use soap nuts in the washing machine.  They didn't bunch up, shrink, or do anything (other than get clean) in the washing machine.  They look brand new.What You Get:  Three pads and a handy dandy little black case.
