We got this for our 3rd and it's perfect for both boy and girl.  There are a few bows on it that make it a tad more fem, but not bad.  It is cozy and the mobile is great!  We did not have this for our other kiddos.  It vibrates, moves bears in circles, sings, nature noises, music (no voice) and even has lights when you get baby in the middle of the night.  You don't have to turn on a lamp or overhead light and wake your spouse.  Also is very easy to move from room to room.  You can even take off the top bassinet part to use if you want to just lay on the floor (I did this when we had company and wanted to move baby's bed to a quieter area).  Great product!
