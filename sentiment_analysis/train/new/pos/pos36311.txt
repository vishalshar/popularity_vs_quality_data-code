The 6 oz size cup is a redesigned version of the original 7 oz size, and is vastly superior. For one, the straw reaches the bottom of the cup, so no more unreachable drink left in the bottom. Second, the cup now has a valve covered hole that allows the pressure to equalize when the liquid warms leading to no more overflow of the straw. The straw sits more securely in the lid and protection against liquid spilling if turned upside down. In short, all my major complaints about the original have been fixed. The cup can still be squeezed to encourage your little one to suck for drink.  Sure it is a bit tough to squeeze, but that keeps the child from squeezing it themselves (think about those messy juice boxes).I only had to squeeze the cup once and my 7 month old had it figured out. Nothing unnatural about the drinking technique required either - same sucking action used for any straw, Once they grasp the concept of a straw, you will always be able to get them a drink at any restaurant, even if you forget or loose the sippy cup.
