They are wise to call it spill resistant and not spill proof, but you need realistic expectations when you're handing this to a toddler.  It was funny to me that as soon as I handed it to my 18 month old, he carried it around like a briefcase.  It didn't even dawn on him to hold it with two hands like a bowl.  Immediate success.  His snacks stayed in just fine as he ran around and crawled up onto the couch.  He loves it and I spend FAR less time picking his cereal up off of the floor.  Granted, when he chucks it across the room, there's gonna be some spilling going on.  Not that THAT has ever happened.  ;-)
