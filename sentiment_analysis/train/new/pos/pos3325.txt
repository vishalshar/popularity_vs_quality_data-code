We recently flew with our 6 month old and bought this toy to cover the tray table and keep her entertained. It certainly worked. She played with it for a good 45 minutes in the air. When she was bored, I just flipped it over. I pull it out at home and she loves it just as much sitting on the floor. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone flying with a baby.
