The bumper looks good and serves its purpose.  The only negative is that the double sided adhesive tape for each bumper comes in 4 separate strips.  They are cut to the right size but it takes a good amount of time to peel each and stick it to the bumper.  If they were already attached to the bumper it would be a much simpler process.  Overall they are good for the price and I would purchase again.
