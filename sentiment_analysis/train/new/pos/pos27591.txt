This is absolutely one of our favorite teethers. My oldest and middle child had one and wore the batteries out! I recently tried everything with the new baby, cold, frozen/wet wash cloths, the mesh food teethers (we used grapes which she loved) the plastic water filled rings and much more. I had totally forgotten about this vibrating teether. It was by accident I remembered and started searching to thankfully find the exact same one again. She LOVED it, the only thing she will chew on besides my/her fingers. I do have to hold it and make it vibrate for her as she is still too small, but I imagine we will be killing the batteries on this one as well. It is perfect size for their little hands to hold and each point has a different feel/bumps to it. highly recommend this to anyone with a teething baby, and I hope you love it as much as we do!I don’t know about you, but I depend very heavily on reviews that are posted on Amazon, even if I am purchasing an item elsewhere, I read what the reviewers here have to say.
