We love this exersaucer and so does our 5month old daughter.  It's very compact so can easily be moved from room to room.  There's enough things on there to keep her busy for awhile while I make supper or do chores.  She has fun bouncing her legs up and down on the jump pad and playing with all the different toys.  I also like that the seat spins in a circle, although she hasn't mastered how to do that yet.  :)  The light up keyboard is also great and so are all the different places to hang her other toys she likes to chew on and pull on.  And all for $40!  Great deal.
