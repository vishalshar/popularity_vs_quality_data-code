Yes, this spoon is ridiculously expensive and that part sucks. However, my son opens his mouth like a little birdie- tall with a very narrow opening. This is the only spoon we can get in his mouth without a huge mess on his cheeks. The straight edged silicone tip is firm enough to efficiently wipe the messes that do get around his mouth. It far surpasses our other baby spoons for scraping.What I don't like about this spoon (other than price)? -  Because the spoon is so narrow, it's difficult to get much food on it- especially runnier foods like pure fruit purees. By adding some oatmeal or cereal we can thicken it up enough to work (although we do that anyway to avoid prune or mango induced explosions!). However, this means than for anything but the thickest purees it takes much longer to feed than the standard wide spoons.What I'm ambivalent about: - The double ended spoon. I don't feel like its really necessary- especially with one silicone, one metal. I typically use metal end to scoop in cereal/oatmeal, and feed with the silicone end. I wish it were one solid surface for cleaning purposes- you can lift up the silicone edge slightly which means food can squeeze in there too.Our son is almost a year old and has been using these spoons since about 8.5 months. We also have the hard plastic Munchkin spoons (hate them- very long with overly deep spoon bowls and way too wide) and the silicone "love" spoons by Munchkin (like these, but they're a little too wide... At some point I expect to transition to these from the narrow Boon spoons since they hold more food and hopefully my son's mouth will eventually get a little wider").Overall I highly recommend these spoons for narrow birdie mouths, but I would choose the 2 pack Muchkin silicone "love" spoons for wider mouths in order to feed more efficiently.
