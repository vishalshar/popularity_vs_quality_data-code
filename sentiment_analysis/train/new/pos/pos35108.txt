This organizer is a must for any stroller. We have really liked the Skip Hop brand baby gear since they hold up well and look good too. We've been using ours on our BOB stroller for about 3 years and I can't imagine not having it. It has lasted really well, without any broken zipper or seams coming apart. The BOB has a large pocket in the back and a stow away area in the bottom, but for things like my phone and keys this organizer makes them way easier to get at. The drink holders are super helpful although we have had a few minor spills in them. The little detachable zipper pocket has been handy and we often use the headphone port to keep a roll of doggie pick-up bags for messes and of course for walking the dog. I liked this so much I purchased one for a shower gift as well for a family member. I'd highly recommend it.
