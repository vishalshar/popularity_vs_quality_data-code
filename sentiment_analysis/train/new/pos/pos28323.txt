The insert is great and seems like it will hold up well. My 6 month old is able to sit at the table with the family now! My only complaint is with the design itself. Food/crumbs get down into the holes where the safety straps come up through, and it's really difficult to get it out. The only way I've found is to shove the angled tool for the vacuum in there, and hope it gets everything. Otherwise, you have to basically disassemble the high chair to get under the insert to clean. Not a deal breaker, but a bit of a pain...I'm just glad that I got such a great deal on the high chair and the infant insert, or I'd probably be a little more frustrated.
