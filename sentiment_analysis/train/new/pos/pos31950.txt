This baby monitor is easy to set up and use. The two monitors allow you to monitor the child from multiple locations without having to pull the monitors out of their handy charging cradles. The monitors also allow you to check the room temperature and/or talk to the child. The base station can also act as a very soft night light (amber color).The parent monitors incorporate a light bar and variable volumes to indicate a child that is crying. Thus, you can monitor your child with settings ranging from mute (good on conference calls) to extra loud. The base station should be installed within 3 feet of the cradle/crib/bed for optimum audio performance.The DECT technology that underlies the monitor system works flawlessly and on a relatively unused portion of the frequency spectrum (1.9GHz). Thus, it will not interfere with wireless networks and older cordless phones. Even better, DECT-based phones and the baby monitor also seem to co-exist nicely. The range of the monitors is about 100 feet indoors and about 150' outdoors.The base station runs off 4 AA batteries and the monitors run off 2AAA batteries each. The batteries for the monitors are included, but not for the base station. Do not use regular batteries in the base station or monitors (which work as a backup for power outages or while out and about), use NiMH-based AAA batteries instead. Otherwise, the charging cradles may attempt to recharge the batteries inside (with messy results). I subsequently replaced the OEM AAA batteries with higher-capacity after-market models to increase runtime.All in all, a great system, the only downside is cost. However, if you live in a urban environment with a lot of baby monitors/phones/etc. interfering with each other, this is the system to get IMO. IIRC, the only difference of this system to the -950 is that the 590 has two parent units and cannot play lullabies to the kid.
