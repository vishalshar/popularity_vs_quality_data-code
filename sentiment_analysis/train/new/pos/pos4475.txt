I love these diapers, especially as part of a medium-large stash for an infant (my son is 5 months old, with chunky thighs and a thin waist).  I have tried a ton of pocket, hybrid, and AIO CDs at various price points, and this is one of the few I went back to buy more of. These and the GroVia hybrids are the two I have never had leaks with. I love the ability to fold the absorbent flaps into different arrangements. With a boy, I fold over the front for extra absorbency and it means I don't need to add a doubler.They do take longer to dry (I hang dry inside, and find that it's 24 hours before I know these are ready for use again), so I would hesitate to use them as my only diaper. Though, to be fair, they dry faster than the Thirsties AIO, so the delay is only relative to my pocket diapers, which is a bit 'apples to oranges'.  I always reach for them first when available, but make sure to have some pockets and/or hybrids for the day that they're on the drying rack.  Plus, mixing in some pockets keeps the total cost of building a stash down.I have the Freetimes in both snap and hook and loop. For now, I slightly prefer the fit with the hook and loop to the snaps.  It is definitely easier for my husband and babysitter.  However, I have heard that toddlers learn to pull the tabs open and that it eventually wears out.  My plan is just to have the hook and loop replaced with snaps by a WAHM when either of those things becomes too much of an issue.All told, I would definitely recommend these to any friend just getting into CDing.
