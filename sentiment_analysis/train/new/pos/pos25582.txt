We have used these in the past got them as a gift from a friend for our twins.  We had a 3rd child so we bought another.  We haven't used it yet but expect it will go just as well.  They don't dry perfect, and its a bit tricky to use depending on your kid.  Although you can try a few times before getting it right.  Its really good but not perfect!
