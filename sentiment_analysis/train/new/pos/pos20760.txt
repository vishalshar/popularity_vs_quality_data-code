I love Halo sleepsacks. But this time whole experience was awful. I got wrong size, wrong color and I cannot reach the seller( babyhaven) via phone or email. On those sleepsacks feet openings are sort of loose and not really snugly. My baby stretched  foot openings at the very first night wearing it.
