I bought the Green Toys Twist Teether Toy for my three month old baby whom I suspect is starting to teeth. I am very wary of any product my baby puts in his mouth because, to be honest, I don't really trust the Chinese-made toys and chemicals, such as lead, they use to treat them (plus the things we don't know about). Call me crazy, but I want to make sure the things my baby puts in his mouth are safe, or at least the safest available.I was very pleased to find the Green Toys brand. They claim their products are BPA-free, PVC-free, phthalate-free and contain no external coatings. They use 100% FDA-approved food safe plastic. Okay, so that all sounds impressive. For the price, I thought it might be pretty poor quality, but given such few products for babies are not made in China (this brand is made in USA), I was willing to give it a go.When it arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised. Apart from bring really easy to open the packaging (it's in simple but sturdy cardboard, no tape, no plastic to cut with scissors and hurt yourself opening); the teether is really sturdy! It's thick and durable. Seems almost unbreakable. Yet, it's lightweight and not burdensome for my baby to hold.It's got bright colours and my baby is really interested in it (much more than some of his other toys). I know as he gets older he'll be more interested in the different shape and various tactile attachments. It's also going to serve well as a teether and withstand a thrashing and a really good munch!I am really impressed with the quality and the style of the toy. I will definitely be buying more from this brand! Thank you!
