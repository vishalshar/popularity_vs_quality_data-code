I adored the way my daughter's Mustela 2-In-1 hair & body shampoo left her smelling fresh and clean. It's become an endearing scent to me and I was hoping to find something that replicates that smell for myself. I ordered a bottle of Musti in the hopes that it'd be just like the Mustela wash; unfortunately, it isn't. That was initially a letdown but I've grown to love the scent of Musti as well. I'd think of Musti as a more classic sister scent to the Mustela wash.Musti is more light and less soapy smelling. It's not an extremely strong scent, which is to be expected since it's traditionally a child's cologne. I use it on myself but I like how it doesn't irritate my daughter's skin as she is extremely sensitive to scents (eczema and the whole shebang). Furthermore, I like spritzing a little bit of Dolce & Gabbana's Light Blue in combination with Musti. I read in another review about someone doing this and was intrigued. Turns out I liked it too!
