We were having problems with my son taking formula and breast milk, he was a preemie by 6 weeks.  The nice thing about these Dr. Brown bottles is that you can get preemie size nipples.  He was constantly spitting up with other bottles, choking on the flow and just having an over all hard time.  I purchased these and the problems all but stopped immediately.  I don't quite understand how they work but they do.  What was really funny was I put another bottle in my diaper bag one day when we went to visit his grandma.  He refused to use the other bottle, he just wouldn't take it no matter how much we tried.  He finally relented after a half hour of trying and sure enough, he had all of his original problems.  We have 9 4oz size bottles and 12 8oz size bottles, most glass, but I won't go to another brand.  The plastic ones are great for travel, they are light weight and easy to hold.  I gave one of these bottles to a friend, her baby girl was also having problems feeding.  She is now a true believer too.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
