Love these mittens. I bought these for my daughter for the winter. I like that these are waterproof. Plus they have a soft felt-like liner on the inside. I bought the large so she can grow into them. She is 2 1/2 years old and she should be able to wear these for a couple of winters. My favorite feature of these mittens is the string that they are attached to. It's so hard to find waterproof mittens with the strings attached. I can thread these through the sleeves of her coat and she'll never lose her mittens. Great buy!
