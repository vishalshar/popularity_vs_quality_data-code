Hi, we got this Prince Lionheart car seat protector. However, we find that the car seat (Britax Pioneer 90) shifts easily, 2-3 inches either side, no matter how tight my husband installs the car seat. (He pulls as tight as he can, to the point of frustration, and it still shifts.) I'm wondering if anyone else has the same problem, and how you might have solved it? While we love how it protects the seat and catches spills and crumbs, it just doesn't seem safe. We'd like to hear if others are also experiencing this same loose installation problem. Thanks!
