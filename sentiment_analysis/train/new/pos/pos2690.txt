I gave this set 4 star instead of 5 because I haven't used the fork yet. I only use the spoon. Not sure if my son will use the fork anytime soon as he's still eating very soft foods and mostly he needs a spoon to eat them with.The handle is very easy to grip. The width of the spoon is perfect for my 8 month old's mouth. He enjoys trying to hold to spoon himself and has been successful at getting most of the food into his mouth.Something I really enjoy is that the spoon reacts if the food is too hot. It turns white. So if I've heated something up I stir it with the spoon to check it it's too hot.I am going to order another set of these as I think they are very handy.  The spoon right now and the fork later when my son starts to feed himself.
