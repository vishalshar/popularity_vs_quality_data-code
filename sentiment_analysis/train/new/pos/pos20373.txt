Little G is incredibly soft and huggable! The size is great for travelling in the car (and the stroller, grocery cart, and everywhere else that ours gets taken). My daughter particularly loves his little tail - she holds on to it, works it in her fingers, even chews it (to my dismay). She selected him from among her other stuffed animals when she was about 16 months, and he's been absolutely her main squeeze ever since (now 22 months).Since Little G is white and does get taken just about everywhere, he does need to be washed often. The reason for four out of five stars is that he starts to get a little bit floppy (just not so plush) and loses softness after repeated washings. We do only use cold water,  very gentle detergent, and the hand wash cycle. We have purchased several backups of Little G to keep at home and grandparents' house so we've been able to compare the new and used versions and the difference is significant. This is probably the case with any well-loved plush toy, but it doesn't help that little G is white and any dirt is visible (what we don't see doesn't bother us as much!) so he gets washed all the more often.Little G is still an excellent product and a great source of comfort to our daughter. We're glad he's around!!
