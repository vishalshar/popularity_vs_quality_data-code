I loved this Bassinet. When we ordered, did not think I could use it for so many purposes. I used it as as diaper changing table, after bath dresser , bed for baby to sleep when you watch the baby and play box till the baby sits. I made full use of this in 11 months and still going great. You can store diapers in the basket below and also toys in case. Wonderful bassinet.
