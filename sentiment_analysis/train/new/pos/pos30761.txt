This is humongous, big enough to hold a deep sea fishing pole.  Although made of heavy plastic, it it really sturdy.  I attached this to a rollator (a walker cart for the infirm) and mounted the baby umbrella (which is really an extra large golf umbrella) in it.  This works well, even in 60 MPH winds, and the adjustability of this mount, combined with the size and length of the umbrella, keeps both the person and the cart dry, regardless of wind direction.  You could also mount this on a deck.  Expensive, but worth it.  Not just for babies.
