As a newborn, our son HATED being put down in his crib, carseat, bassinet, changing table, etc.  As a consequence, I tried a few different baby carriers just trying to find one that would allow me to go to the grocery store, or do something other than sit on the couch.  Of the four different carriers I tried, this was by far one of my favorites.Pros: - works well for a short person (I am 5'3", and was about 150 lbs when I first bought this).  Some carriers (like the Ergo) were a little too big and bulky for me.  This fit my body a lot better even with the contoured waistband, which allows me to sit with it on and walk without feeling pregnant again. - Comfortable - provides good back support.  I can still carry our son (now 17 lbs) while we walk around for an hour or two without my back hurting.  Plus, the material seems to breath a little, he has never felt overly warm or sweaty after being in it for a long period of time. - Easy to get on.  I only had to practice once to feel comfortable getting my son in it out in public. - Can be used in the front with baby facing in or out, as a side carrier or as a backpack. - Our son loves it.  There were times as a newborn when putting him in the carrier was the only way he would fall asleep.  The Head support was great for him when he was napping.Cons: - The security feature on the buckles can make it difficult to get off.  Good for security, bad when you are in a rush. - No pockets - The thing I loved with the Ergo and Maya Wrap was a pocket to hold my keys and credit card.  There are no storage compartments on the beco.
