It was the first time I have flown in 40 years that I haven't had extreme ear pain. They are fantastic. The biggest problem is to get aflight attendant to fill them with hot water. They are busy with lots of other people and this request seems out of the ordinary.They worked great, however it takes about an hour from the first sign of discomfort to landing. They do not stay hot that long. The manufacturer needs to use material with metal in it to make them retain heat longer. Also, I needed to use them for both ears, and my arms got tired, they need a holder so you can wear them without using your hands.I would never fly without them, but might have to fly first class to get the flight attendant to listen and take the time to fill them.
