I hung this up using the adhesive strips on the back although I also had the option of using the screws and anchors that were included. I followed the directions exactly except I only let the adhesive strip stick to the wall 23.5 hours instead of the recommended 24 (I had company coming) but it seems to be holding up perfectly. Last night, after bath time, it was SO much easier scooping the toys out using the handled tail 'bucket' than picking them up individually. After they were all picked up, I hung it back up and the water just drained off the tail and worked like a dream letting the toys dry. For the record, we have it filled up to the top with toys (the full alphabet of foam letters, measuring spoons, and about 8-10 little  2in. tall animal figurines) and trust me, it holds A LOT. We also take full advantage of the soap holding compartment up top and it easily fits two of the big size Johnson&Johnson baby shampoo bottles and one more smaller one with no crowding issues.We are super impressed so far and will post back in a few months with updates on how well it continues to stick to the wall- although I don't anticipate any problems! Wonderful buy!!**UPDATED 2/5/13**I've had this up almost a month now and it hasn't budged. Still just as great as when I first reviewed. I figure if it's stayed up this long, it isn't going anywhere! Still strongly recommend this product!!
