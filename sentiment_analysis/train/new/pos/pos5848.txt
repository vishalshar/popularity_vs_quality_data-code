I'm not crazy about rattles or noise making toys in general, but this abacus is nice. It doesn't really make any noise. Looking forward to seeing the baby play with it more when he gets a little older. The colored circles are nice & bright & the overall size of the object is just perfect for baby to wrap his little fingers around. Awesome toy.
