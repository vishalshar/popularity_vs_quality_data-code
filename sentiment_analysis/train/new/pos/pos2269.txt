I bought this bouncy seat when my son was nearly two months old, and we have found that it fills the bill in every way.  The price is reasonable. The seat is soft and shaped just right, and the headrest pad adjusts as he grows. The toys are cute and interesting but not overwhelming-- there are no lights or moving things, but the snail and turtle have friendly smiles and the frog in the middle plays music when his handle is pulled.  We have the Rainforest Gym, and my son was totally overwhelmed by all the colors and moving lights, so as cool as they look to me and my older kids, I chose not to get the Rainforest or Waterfall bouncy seats.  This seat is light and compact, and the toy bar is not bulky, so it is easy for me to move around the house with one hand.  The pattern is cute and colorful (and unisex) without being that loud/primary eyesore that I wanted to avoid.  My son loves the vibrations, they make him happy when nothing else will, but I can imagine that a sensitive or very tiny baby might need to grow into them, as the other reviewer was saying.  I am entirely happy with this seat and would recommend it to anyone with an infant.
