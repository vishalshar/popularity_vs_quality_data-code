Prior to having this, I had a single Chicco stroller, which I loved. I was so scared to get a double stroller because I assumed it would be twice the weight and size. I was pleasantly surprised with this one! It, of course, is slightly heavier, but nothing I can't handle by myself to get up into my van. It folds up to be almost the same size as my single stroller. It is perhaps a little thicker. I can still fit it side to side in the van though. It was wonderful when my son was born. I chose to put the carseat closest to me and it was very secure. I could watch him and put the shade over him if it was too sunny. My then 17 month old daughter enjoyed the front seat. I kind of wished there was a tray option, but we've survived. You can choose between cup holders or a bar in front. We use the cup holders. The basket underneath has lots of space, but I usually have a hard time getting my diaper bag-for-two stuffed in there since it isn't very tall. Sometimes I just set it down on the floor of the back seat instead. My now 1 year old son doesn't mind! The handle is comfortable for me and has enough space for my drink, keys, wallet, and phone - the bare essentials for a walk. Anything more can be stored beneath. I am happy with this product and very much recommend it!
