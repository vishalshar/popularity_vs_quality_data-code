This is an amazing crib!! Since I have a reduce space and I have to move sometimes the crib from one room to another one! It works perfect, it Is made with really good quality materials. The ensemble is very easy and I did it myself in 40 min with no help. I bought the 3inch mattress also, and together they match perfect and make the crib look even better! I also bought  the three pieces set for portable crib and it's so adorable! My baby is 8 months old and is a tall baby, but the crib is roomy enough for many many more months ahead. I highly recommend this crib. I attached some pictures for you to see how it looks.
