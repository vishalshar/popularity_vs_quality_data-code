We're currently using these for both my 3 year old and my 1 year old.  They are far superior to the Crocodile Creek placements we'd had previously.First, they don't slide easily.  Second, the surface paint doesn't come off when you wash them.  Third, they're pretty easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher.Lastly, simple is better.For new parents, something I wish someone had told me:  Do not buy different version of the same thing, even if your kid likes both trucks and animals.  Don't buy one placement with animals and one placement with trucks.  Now every dinner is a decision, or a potential fit or argument.  "But I wanted the placemat with the trucks! I don't want the animals!"  Buy multiples of the same thing if you need more than one of something.  Ever since we bought these placemats we had one less preference to deal with.Now if only my kids would stop yelling/screaming their respective preferences for Mommy over Daddy...
