I bought this plate in hopes that my VERY picky boy learns how to eat a variety of different things and has food with his food. The plate is very light and is dishwasher safe (which is what I was looking for). The design and coloring is durable and does not come off or scratch off. I run this plate though my nightly dishwasher cycle (on top shelf) and have no problems whatsoever with the color fading or plastic cracking or melting. I really enjoy feeding my son from this plate and I think it is also fun for him. I am now looking to get different colorings of the same plate so we could take it with us when we go visit my parents
