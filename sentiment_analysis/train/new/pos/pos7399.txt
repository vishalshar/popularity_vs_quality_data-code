Contemporary looking. Love that the full sides (vs slats all the way around) give it a more substaintial look. Some parents may prefer slats on all four sides, but I was not worried about viewing the babies (using it for twins) and our video monitor will be posted above the crib height anyway, so no blockage concerns there.We have not used the crib yet so I can not attest to wear and tear hold-up. I can tell you it appears and feels sturdy and looks great.Only complaint being that the drawer fastened underneath the crib is not made as sturdy as I would like it. The bottom of the drawer is a flimsy thin piece of particle board (?), but I guess with light baby items in there it might not be a problem for now.Assembly was straighforward! Did not have any issues and the directions worked for me.One other thing, the mattress sits on wood vs. a spring-board metal type thing. I really have no idea whether this matters, it just seems to me it could be a bit less comfortable than somewhat flexible springs since wood has no give and personally I like my mattresses soft. But that might not be an issue at all while baby is lightweight and doesn't put much pressure on the mattress anyway.For the price, so far, this is a good buy.Also, (free) shipping was super fast!
