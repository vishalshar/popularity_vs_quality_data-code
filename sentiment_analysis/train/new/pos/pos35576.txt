these were bought as a gift for nurse's week and the girls loved them!  the items took a bit longer than I had expected to ship (not 2 day prime as they were shipping from overseas) but that was my mistake for not seeing where they were shipping from, but they were exactly as described. there is no missin color or missing pieces, every one was in perfect condition so I was pleased with that and quite happy that they were avaialble at bulk price.  I would definitely get them again as a gift
