I have no idea why an own is more expensive than other characters, but my daughter loves it (gonna try and order another character and see if there will be any difference).I know that some daycares banned these for safety reasons, but there is no reason to be concerned about your child safety if you are there practically all the time and if you don't have another 5 or 6 babies to look after like a daycare nanny would.My baby is 2 months old and she is just now beginning to "get" this specific paci. She likes pacifiers but the one with a toy she could care less about until just about couple of days ago. She still can't put a paci back in her mouth when it falls off but the advantage of this toy is that it doesn't fall off as easily as the ones with no toy attached. Plus she begun to try to put it back in and its cute to watch her open her mouth and sucking on an owl instead because a part of the owl is on the way and not the paci. I think that as my baby grows we will own more than one of these toys (specially when she learns to hold things in her hands)
