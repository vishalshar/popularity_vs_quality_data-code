I really loved the vibrant colors of this bag, but was really disappointed in the size.  I had read the reviews that said it was smaller, but perfect for a nursing mama who wouldn't need to carry bottles/formula/ect.  As a mom who is solely nursing, however, I still found the bag to be too small so I ended up returning it.The return process was very simple and I was very impressed that I was actually credited my money back as soon as the bag was scanned at the UPS drop off and the seller knew it was on it's way back.Although the bag wasn't the right size for me, I would still very much recommend it - it is even more gorgeous in person, would be very easy to clean, and is super cute and stylish!
