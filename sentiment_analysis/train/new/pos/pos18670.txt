I'd like to start by saying how easy it is to use and clean. I don't use the lids in between because I have a 2 year old tot. I've added cheerios, yogurt drops, Gerber's lil' crunchies, etc. I let her hold one compartment to snack on while seating down. I read other reviews about the small size of each compartment but I like that she isn't getting full on snacks and/or that she can snack on two small varieties. I purchased mine about two months ago and it's been great. I would have loved to have it when she was a baby and I had to carry formula. On the side it has measurements to see how much formula to add. For my tot, I carry only 3 compartments with snacks and Plum's baby food in my bag. It's more than enough for a day out with my girl. Someone mentioned Zoli's sumo snack stack. I purchased both but find myself using this smaller one in my bag because of the size of my bag. The other one fits more and what I like is you can actually carry fruit! Great for tots and kids. I'll add photos to compare both. I'm glad I did get them both.
