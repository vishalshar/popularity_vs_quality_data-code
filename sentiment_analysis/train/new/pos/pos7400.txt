This bedding set is worth the money. It comes with a fitted sheet, flat sheet and comforter and pillow case. The pillow case is made of satin that is very nice. Has a different pictures on each side. One of Tinkerbell alone and one with 3 fairies. The comforter also has one side made of satin and the other of cotton. It is reversible which is nice. Has a beautiful picture of the fairies on one side and flowers on the back. My 3 1/2 year old LOVES this set!! The colors are pretty and vibrant. I picked up a Tinkerbell toddler pillow at Dollar General for $7 to match. It goes great with the set. I have washed it twice already and it does well in the wash and the dryer. The set dries very fast and keeps its shape. I happened to go to a baby store (I wont mention which one) and the price on this set was considerably higher. So it's worth the price to buy it here. If you have any questions let me know!
