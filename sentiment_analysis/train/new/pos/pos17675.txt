We had an open layout tub with a sling on a wire rack prior to purchase. The sling got looser and the baby got wetter. That was the reason for purchase.The built in seat is a perfect angle, although a little rough on the bum. The sling is perfect after a few uses as it sits very high so keep in mind you have to fill the tub higher to use the sling.It fits in my doubles kitchen sink perfect!
