This soap dispenser has been a life saver for me!  I have three boys between 2-6 and I always bathe them at the same time.  This has made our shower time so much easier because I can now hold the hand shower sprayer in one hand and easily dispense soap with my other hand.  Before I had to try to either put the hand shower back in the bracket when I needed to open the shampoo bottle (which then my kids would all be getting sprayed in the face) or I would try to wedge it between my elbow or something (which I usually ended up getting sprayed in the face or spraying all over the bathroom).  Also my 6 year old occassionaly showers by himself and now he can easily dispense soap by himself whereas before all the bottles were up too high and he had a hard time opening the shampoo.I also really like that you can use any kind of soap in there and it comes out like a foaming soap.  My kids have really sensitive skin so we only use Aveeno and it's not made in a foam, so by putting it in this dispenser and adding water we now have Aveeno foaming soap!I have not had any trouble with it falling down.  I put up the bracket with the sticky tabs and let it sit overnight and then I filled it up the next day.  I also have a Boon Frog Pod hanging in our shower with sticky tabs and I usually have to replace the sticky tabs about every 1.5 years so I'm assuming I may have to do that with this as well.I like this so much I'm going to order another one for our downstairs bath to put on the wall next to the sink for my kids to use for their hand soap, because it's so easy to use and it dispenses just the right amount of soap for little hands.
