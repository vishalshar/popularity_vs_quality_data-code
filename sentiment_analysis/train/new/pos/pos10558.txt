We bought this dresser to match the Childcraft Logan crib and we love both!  This dresser is very sturdy and my husband was impressed with how much detail went into making it so solid.  All of the pieces plus extras were included and the instruction manual was easy to follow.  I feel this dresser will last for a long time.FYI - Sometimes furniture can be delivered damaged, not just Child Craft.  This isn't the manufacturer or Amazon's fault, it just happens.  The headboard on our crib had a gash on the front panel.  THIS INFO WILL SAVE YOU A MAJOR HEADACHE:  Call the manufacturer's phone number on your instruction booklet.  They will ask for your order date, the model number and the piece that is damaged and send you a replacement piece via UPS within 1-3 days.  You do NOT need to send the entire dresser, crib, or whatever you ordered back to Amazon.  You don't even have to send the broken piece back to the manufacturer.  You do not pay shipping or any fees at all.  No questions asked.  Amazon can't deal with broken pieces like the manufacturer can so don't even bother trying.  There's nothing worse than trying to repack all the heavy pieces and send it back, so just don't. There you go!  Hope this helps, no matter which dresser you end up choosing.
