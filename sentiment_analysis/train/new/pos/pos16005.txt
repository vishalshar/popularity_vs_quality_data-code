I bought this when I was pregnant with my daughter because it was organic. It's hard to find toys that are suitable for infants and aren't made with plastics that are toxic. The construction of this doll is phenomenal. It holds up well to being gnawed and slobbered on, and pulled in every direction. I've washed her multiple times and the colors hold true. The material is really nice and soft. The rattle is also a big hit. Definitely recommend. I've purchased multiple other items from Dandelion following this because I was so pleased.
