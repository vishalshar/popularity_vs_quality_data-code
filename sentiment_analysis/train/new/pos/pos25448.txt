We bought this as a backup because my electric pump was acting up and now I use this as my main pump. I am a first time mom who has returned to work. I am able to get more milk in a shorter amount of time. I wish we had just bought this first. I would not feel comfortable pumping at work with my electric pump because of the sound, but the manual pump is quiet and I would use it at work if needed.Yes, it is a workout for your hand at first, but I can get 5+ oz in about 10 minutes, so it's not too bad. And my hand adjusted to the extra workout quickly.I would definitely recommend giving this a try before spending the extra money on an electric pump.
