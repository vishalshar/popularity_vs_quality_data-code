Although the title of the product is 3 in 1 crib, the package says 4 in 1!! The package is bit heavy for me weighing 110lbs. I guess I wont be a good fit for Olymppics.. ðŸ˜ƒThe package came in good shape. Good job UPS!Now, the crib took approximately 2 hours to assemble. Once you go through instructions carefully, it's pretty easy to follow and finish it quickly. I like the wavy sides of the crib. That's one of the reasons why I chose this crib due to its shape. I just received it two days ago.. So far it looks good, feels good and sturdy.Only one drawback is the color of the crib. I received the product with a brushed off color.. See the attached pics. That's why I am giving this product 4 stars only.I will update the review after few months to determine the if I continue to be satisfied with this Crib.
