Love these dishes. They stick to table so they wont slide off and they have a lip on them to help catch drips.  I purchased a pink set and a blue set of silverware, plate, bowl, and cup for my granddaughter and grandson who are 3. Love them all except the cup is small like a little juice cup which would be good for a child just learning to use a cup. It is a very good cup. These dishes are very sturdy and have a nice weight to them. They are machine washable and I was able to cut up their food on plate with out it leaving marks. It also did not stain with pasta sauce.  Highly recommend these  dishes and silverware
