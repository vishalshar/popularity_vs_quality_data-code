I know manufacturer states this is safe to use for a gate mounted at the top of a flight of stairs. But think about it, it doesn't magically make the bottom of the gate disappear and flush with the floor. You're still required to lift your feet, and who lifts his/her feet while walking DOWNstairs? While stumbling a little in a hallway is not a big problem, stumbling on top of a flight of stairs is. If you want to make your gate safer on top of a flight of stairs, I suggest you mount your gate just below the first step so it's flush with the first step.Having said that, this product is very useful for certain applications. I fenced out a portion of my living room with the North States metal Superyard, but to my disappointment my "fence" moves quite a bit. That's where this gate ramp comes in handy. I can secure this ramp to my hardwood floor by thick double sized tape and then run the metal Superyard through the slot on top. I'm using several of these for this purpose and that holds my fence solidly in place. If you're fencing over hardwood or tile floor and your fence moves a bit, taping this product to the floor and running your fence over it might be sufficient to hold your fence in place.
