I bought these as a Christmas gift for my friend's 7 month old. I was so happy to see he took to them right away! At 7 months he is mainly grasping them, banging them together or on the floor, mouthing them, or knocking them over when mom stacks them into a tower. After a couple months this is still a highly engaging toy for him, whereas he lost interest in the plastic/noise-making/light-up toys he got as Christmas presents after a few weeks. I know the price seems high for what it is, but given that this is the kind of toy that can span many developmental levels and will (hopefully) not be cast aside after just a few weeks of play, I feel the price is well worth it. As he gets older he will learn how to put items into the bowls, dump them, stack them, roll them, and nest them. When the pretend play comes he may use them for play cooking, serving, and mixing and they may help him learn to identify colors, match, and sequence sizes. This is easily a toy that could be saved for a future sibling or even as an heirloom toy since the quality is so nice. I got them as a birthday gift for a one year old and am looking forward to seeing how she responds to them. I would highly recommend buying these - even if the little one doesn't seem engaged at first they could be put away and reintroduced at another developmental level.
