I don't know how to categorize this item. Is it a wallet? Is it a purse? Is it a bag? Well it's all of the above.You have 2 zippered pockets for money: one on the outside for easy access and one on the inside. There is an ID card slot and another little slot for a few cards. On the left side, you have a little mesh pocket for a cell phone. There is a little elastic loop in the middle for a lip gloss and you have a mini mirror to check if you have something in your teeth. It also comes with a retractable pen. This bag comes with a wristlet but you also have a an extra longer strap. I love this item so much, I bought a second one in a different print.
