My daughter is two and we want to travel more with her. This was perfect for hotel room with two beds. Don't have to lug the pack and play anymore! Stayed well inflated for two nights a d two days. My daughter rolls around a lot and this worked great on the second queen bed in our hotel room. I'm so excited we found these! We push them all the way to the head board... And use the extra pillows to close the bottom. [see pics]Pros:- stays in place when tucked under fitted sheets- tall enough to keep "sleep rollers" safe- comes with a manual pump- comes with bag that hold both rails and pump- comes with patchesCons- none so far.. Only had them for a two night Disney trip. Will update if anything happens.
