I LOVE it!Provides excellent coverage, folds very compactly. Discreet and stylish. I originally bought another nursing wrap that was a scarf and nursing wrap. The fit was awkward, and it continually fell forward. I was always afraid I would be exposed. This nursing wrap was perfect. It is not bulky at all. I keep it in the pocket of my ergo. Excellent product.
