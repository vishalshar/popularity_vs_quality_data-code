We had gotten some of these bibs as hand-me-downs from a neighbor and I loved them so much I went searching for them to purchase more!  The pocket at the bottom is great for catching liquids and finger foods and they're so easy to clean!  After mealtime, I just wash it with handsoap, wring it out and hang to dry... it's dry in about an hour and ready for the next meal!  They're light and easy to stuff in a pocket for travel as well!
