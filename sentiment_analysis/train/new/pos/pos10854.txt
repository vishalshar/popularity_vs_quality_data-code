This is the ONLY bottle that my 3 month old breastfed baby will take. He only uses MAM pacifiers, and after trying 6 (yes, six) other brands of bottles, and my return to work a month away, I ordered these (boo for not being carried in stores!).Part of his resistance was probably stubbornness, as I think we gave him too long of a break before reintroducing the bottle (about a month of no bottle), but I also think that other bottle nipples just weren't cutting it for him. These have a natural shape, in my opinion, and the texture is soft, like the pacifier.The multiple parts don't bother my husband and I at all - I think it makes them easy to clean out. We haven't had any leaks - always make sure the bottom rubber valve is placed properly and the nipple is fully in the collar.I'm keeping all of the other bottles we purchased in our arsenal in case anything changes in a few months, but I'll be ordering more MAMs in the meantime!
