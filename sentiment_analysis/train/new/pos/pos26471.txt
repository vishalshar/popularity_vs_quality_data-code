I bought this because I couldn't find a mirror that works with my Nissan Rogue. Thankfully it works great! I'm able to watch my infant daughter while driving. That being said, it's not the most perfect design. It takes two people to set it up: I sat in the drivers seat while my husband sat in the back to adjust the mirror into the correct place. And since the mirror is only propped up from tension, it's pretty easy to inadvertently knock it down. It's actually fallen on my daughter already! I had just locked the carseat into its base, shut the door, and went to the trunk to put away the stroller. The stroller handle bar jabbed into the backseat area and hit the mirror, which fell right onto the carseat (with my daughter in it). She was fine, but it reminded me to be more careful when it comes to the mirror.
