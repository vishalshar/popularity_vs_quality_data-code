I did a lot of research on carriers before my son was born and i registered for the Ergo Baby with the insert. I received the Ergo as a gift, but bought the insert on my own. Well, thank goodness I did so - my 3 month old LOVES IT and has loved it since he was 2 weeks old!!! I have gotten so much use out of it - it is a must for getting anything done around the house. And a few minutes in this carrier, and my son falls right to sleep. The infant insert can only be used in the front position, so I can't speak to the other positions just yet, but he just loves being close to me and hearing my heartbeat while I work around the house. I've also used it for breastfeeding - it does require a little adjusting to get the positioning down, but it is possible. All in all, I LOVE THIS THING and it is worth the cost. The quality is excellent.
