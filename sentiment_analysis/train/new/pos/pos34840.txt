I used this pump with my first child 2 years ago.  I tried to avoid paying the $300+ for the electric pump, and this worked great!  I pumped when I returned to work, and pumped for 3 months.  I loved not having to lug around the big electric pump to and from work every day.  It's much easier to clean than other manual pumps (e.g. gerber) because there are few parts to remove so your chance of losing or breaking parts is much lower.  The pump has a strong suction, so I've had no problem expressing milk (e.g. up to 8 ounces or more each time).  I just had my 2nd child a month ago, and already I'm able to express 5+ ounces of milk at once.  I highly recommend this, especially for occasional users, no need to spend lots of money on fancy pumps with lots of removable, breakable parts.  Also, I am small chested, so no, you don't have to be well endowed for this to work.
