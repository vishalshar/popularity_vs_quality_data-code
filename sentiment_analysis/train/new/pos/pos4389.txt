Bought for my sons first birthday and he loves it.Balls are a good size diameter for his hands and he is able to run it by himself (which for a 1 y/o) is nice.The balls seem to be suspended on the sides of the track more than on the bottom so it has the effect of slowing the rolling speed and acceleration  down quite a bit (If you put a small marble on the same track it races right through). The slower action speed makes it much better for younger kids.I think it was done to prevent young kids from leaning on it and breaking the parts, but it does not snap together in every spot instead leaving some connections that are very easy to come apart (again, by design). I think this is probably good design from a durability perspective, but it does make moving it around the room / house kind of annoying.
