We received our package last week, and the carrier beat it up pretty bad.  I was concerned that the pieces would be damaged, but they were pretty well packed in and all survived unscathed.  I would say it probably took two people about 2 hours to assemble. It has a LOT of parts, but the instructions were fairly straightforward.  It's important to really match up your pieces with the diagrams as someone else said, I put some things together backwards and had to undo them.  I wish that the sheets for the drawer bottoms and the back of the dresser were not so think - the dresser isn't as stable as it should be, and I would be weary of placing much weight in these drawers.  It should serve our purposes of holding clothing just fine.  It's bigger than I expected, so check your measurements if you're working with a small space or you're worried about things looking crowded, because in a smaller room I think this would be a little overpowering!That said, I love the look of it, and yes, it may be on par with an IKEA piece quality-wise, but I'd say much more stylish!
