This is the cutest tooth keepsake box.  I used to put my daughter's teeth in little ziplock bags which I kept in my jewelry drawer.  She lost a tooth at school and came home with a little cheap plastic treasure tooth box (nice gesture) but this made me want to get a classy little keepsake box.  I plan on putting all of my daughter's baby teeth in it.  It looks just like the picture.  It is made out of ceramic and looks so adorable.  I definitely would recommend this to anyone who has a little princess.
