I absolutely LOVE this adorable pillow!!!!!!!!!!!! The thing has a nice texture and the quality I was actually VERY impressed with! I though the fabric would be very thin and prone to rips, but it is actually pretty thick material and a good quality item. The embroidery is very cute! I am looking for a book to go with it where I can make it a traditional habit with my children. They were excited to see a pillow for the next tooth fairy visit, that only they would get to use, so that was pretty exciting. I am 100% satisfied with this purchase and no complaints! I plan on purchasing another or maybe a few more as a cute gift kit idea that will include a book, toothbrush, floss, toothpaste, and mouthwash. I would tell anyone to get this pillow, I highly recommend it!!!****Disclaimer, I did receive this product at a discounted promotional price for my honest feedback and the opinions stated are solely my own and I have not been offered any other incentive for an opinion else wise.
