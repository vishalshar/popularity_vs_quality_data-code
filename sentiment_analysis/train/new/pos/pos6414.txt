This is such a great stroller.  My 3-year old never gets tired of riding in it.  He can sit, stand, walk or sit in the seat.  It's super easy to maneuver and fold up, too.  The only negative I have is that the front seat doesn't recline as much as I would like.  Other than that, it's great.  The back seat/jump seat take a little time to assemble and take off when not needed, but as long as you don't try to rush, it's absolutely fine and just takes a couple of minutes.  Would recommend to everyone with two kids!
