I am so surprised to read so many negative comments about these sheets. I absolutely love them, and just went out and replaced all of our old crib sheets with the Koala Knit Crib sheets. The colors are beautiful and the fabric is so soft, not the crunchy crinkly fabric you find with most crib sheets. They fit a standard crib mattress beautifully waterproof mattress pad and all, which I have had problems with other crib sheets doing so. I have had absolutely no problems with shrinking at all, and have had my sheets for 6+ months. I wash on cold, and regular tumble dry. My daughter also seems to appreciate these sheets as they are just sooo soft! Buy them, you won't be disappointed.
