Love this plate and our 2 year old son does too.  We don't put it in the dishwaher, as recommended.  Nice grippy stips on the bottom, but that's the reason I gave it four stars.  You are always making sure you haven't lost a strip. And on vacation, we did just that!  Would but again.  Might glue the other 2 down and contact the company to see if I could get another strip, instead of just ordering another one.  I dont want to be waistful and spend money I don't need to.  Enjoy, you'll be happy you bought it. Our lil guy is a nice, rough kid from Vermont, but the little animals on the plate always put a cute little smile on his face.
