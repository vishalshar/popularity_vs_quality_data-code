Our son just turned 4. He is about 42" tall and had been using a regular car seat with the dual shoulder straps. Well, even though he wasn't complaining it was becoming troublesome to get him strapped in the car seat, especially with a heavy coat on, because he had just outgrown it. I had adjusted the shoulder straps to their maximum height.I purchased this seat after reviewing multiple booster seats. There are several things I like about it. - Still has seat back for younger kids, but the back is removable so it converts to stand-alone booster seat when they get older. - The price is unbeatable. - Colors are simple and not gaudy. - Has two pop-out cup holders with space for other items (such as hot-wheels cars.) - MUCH easier to move in and out of car as you no longer have to deal with the LATCH system. Just thread the seat belt through the hole and you are set.I did deduct a star for one reason. During a hard turn, the booster seat will slide around on the car seat due to the hard plastic bottom. Remember, there is no LATCH system on this to hold it in place. We solved this by purchasing a car seat mat to put under it. Still, seems like the manufacturer could have put some rubber on the bottom to prevent this. I don't think it's a safety issue because the seat belt fits him nicely in the booster. But be prepared to purchase or rig something up to prevent sliding if you have leather seats.
