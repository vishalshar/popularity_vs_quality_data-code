I purchased these when we transferred baby from the infant car seat to her convertible car seat.  In the new car seat, her feet now extended out beyond the car seat to touch the seat she was facing (we still have her rear facing, as recommended). While these mats were made to fit over the back of a front row seat, I didn't see why they couldn't be turned around to cover the front while baby was still rear facing. I currently have them covering the front of my back seat to protect from shoe marks while Little One is rear-facing.The mats themselves are made out of a material akin to reusable shopping bags (and if I had the time, I might have repurposed a couple of my old ones for just this purpose), so they aren't the thickest things in the world, but for what I use them for, its plenty. I'd like them a little wider, but they aren't much narrower than any others I found out there, so that's just a general complaint, not one specific to this product.  I did have to shorten the top strap a little bit more than the velcro allowed (as I needed the mat to sit higher on the seat), but a safety pin did the trick just fine.  I had a difficult time pulling the elastic band over the seat (ended up not using it), but the strap was designed for a front bucket seat, not a 2nd row captain's chair, so I suspect its a result of my slightly unconventional use of the product.  Overall, I think these were an excellent value and have performed excellently in our car (a Highlander).
