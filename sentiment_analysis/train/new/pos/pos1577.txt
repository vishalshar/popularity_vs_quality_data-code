My little man is teething and it's a rough go. He constantly needs different teethers to ease his discomfort, and often wants different textures (probably feels good to massage the gums in different ways). He LOVES this toy! I don't know if it's the dense cotton or the color or something else altogether that appeals to him but he uses it often and seems to take his mind off the pain. As a mom, I love that this is safe and organic for him to use - bonus!
