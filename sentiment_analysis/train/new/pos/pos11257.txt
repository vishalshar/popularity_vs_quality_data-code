I know this is a toddler pillow, but I'm a 5'1'' petite 54-year-old and I bought it for myself.  I've had neck problems for years and tried all sorts of pillows.  I sleep on my back and I realized that anything that angles my neck up was making the problem worse.  This pillow lets my neck relax at a natural angle while still providing support.  If you sleep on your side, it probably won't work for you, but if you're a back or stomach sleeper, then it just might.I love it.  I don't find it too hard or too soft, but just goldilocks right!  I'm considering purchasing another one just to have a back up if I ever leave this one somewhere accidentally.  Also, it packs in a suitcase and doesn't take up a lot of room because it's so thin.As for pillowcases, I take a standard case, turn it inside out, lay the pillow on top and mark the dimensions of the pillow.  Then I sew two lines, one length and one width, then cut off the excess fabric, turn rightside out, and ouila!  I just turned an existing pillow case into a custom-made one.
