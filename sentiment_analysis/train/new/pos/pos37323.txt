I purchased the MobiCam DXR with 2 cameras back in July-August of 2011...around the time my wife and I had our twins. We have the twins set up in 1 bedroom with 2 separate cribs so we purchased the Mobicam with a base and 2 cameras. We set up one camera each by screwing them in to the wall and facing them downward at the babies cribs.The units have worked very well for us. We bought these cameras for the primary idea of being able to watch the twins at night and/or during nap time. We use the cameras a TON at night and the night vision has been great. While we haven't had to use the two way radio option very much (just back and forth dialogue with my wife), it has worked each and every time I have tried it.I have never used another baby monitor/camera system so I have nothing to compare the MobiCam with. I do know that a lot of other brands got piss poor reviews and so I opted with the MobiCam because, while it didn't have spectacular reviews, it didn't have terrible ones (at the time).I would recommend the MobiCam. It has worked near perfect with the only issue being the occasional freeze up of the monitor (monitor won't turn off upon pushing of the power button). When this happens, I simply hit the reset button on the back of the monitor and voila...works great. I have had to do this roughly 2-3 times in 6 months of ownership.And just for reference sake (for those wondering about reception b/t the base and the cameras), my wife and I own a 1700 square foot, one story home and the babies room is on the opposite end of the house from where our master is. We have had no reception issues, even when their door and ours are closed. Reception has been good.
