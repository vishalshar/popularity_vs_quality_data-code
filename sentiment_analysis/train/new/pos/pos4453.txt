seems comfy for our baby.  it floats, so plan on keeping a hand on it.  we use it in the tub, and it's fine for that.  don't think it would fit in most sinks.  it's a decent sized bather - our 10 lb baby will be able to use it for awhile without any issues.may take too long to dry for some climates...our hot & dry area allows it to dry out OK if left out overnight.  it's the only bather we've used so far, so I can't give much of a comparison to other products.
