I didn't give five stars because they do leak occasionally (although it is difficult to tell whether it is due to user error) and the system with the provided #2 nipples provided a slow/difficult nursing experience for my three month old.  I tried sucking and had a hard time getting much out as well.The good news is that Avent nipples fit with this bottle, and given the outrageous prices for replacement nipples for the Mam system, this is a godsend.  The Avent #3 nipples are easily found in stores and provide the perfect draw for my baby.  These bottles are not perfect, but I think that they are the best of the BPA free options.  I tried and researched the other BPA free bottles on the market and the others were either too expensive or inferior products.
