My 8 1/2 month old son just started playing with his new Sassy Pop N Push Car.  It makes a great first car!  I am glad I read the reviews because the picture does make it look bigger so this video will help you see the actual size.  He is just rolling it back and forth, but if you roll it back it rolls forward on it's own.
