We bought these before we had our son, and it was a good thing too, because we needed them right away when he arrived. We love that they are washer safe (and I put them in the dryer anyway). They hold up well over time and really do the trick. Got these as a gift to a friend who is having a baby boy. I also recommend a set with the drawstring bag so you can wash them without losing them in the wash/laundromat.
