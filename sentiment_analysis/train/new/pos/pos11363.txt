I'm glad to say that both kids love this. I've concluded that it has some cocaine based magic in it. DS (4months) was chewing furiously; his tiny gums squeaking against the natural rubber, which has a really light and addictive rubber smell. DD (almost 2.5) likes to treat it like a baby doll. It's creepy cute dead eyes and rosy cheeks are interesting and the colors are soft and pleasant. You can definitely tell it's a good quality product. FanFan is just like Sophie, but is a smidgen cheaper and had a squeaker in the head and the body. I think it's legs might be shorter than Sophie's too, and the tail is different.I feel like a filthy hipster for having this expensive, trendy type chew toy, but I honestly like the toy. DS loves it as well... which is friggin weird because he's practically a newborn. He smiles at it! He never smiled at a non-human or inanimate object before FanFan.Good developmental timing on introducing this toy or is it the cocaine-based magic??? Idk, but I've definitely spent $18 on worse and less useful things.
