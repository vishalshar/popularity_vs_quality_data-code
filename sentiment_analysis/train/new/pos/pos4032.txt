I like that it is made with one piece of material so I have zero worries of my son breaking anything. He really gnaws at this pacifier and it's easy to located within a pile of toys. My son stared to use this when he wast teething with his front two lower teeth, and now that 5 teeth have popped up, he continues to use it.
