I was looking for a small diaper bag as my son is now potty-trained and we are done with diapers.  I wanted a bag just to put a few things like wipes and snacks, a sippy cup and including all my personal things like wallet, keys, tissues, lipstick and face powder.  I would use it primarily when I take my son to the library or to the grocery store.  I researched and came across this brand and thought I'll buy it as from the pictures it looks like the ideal bag.  When I first saw the bag I fell in love with the bag.  The purple color and the aqua flowery design on the bag makes the bag very cute.  The bag is of excellent quality.  However, I think this bag is too small for me.  I was surprised that after trying to put the stuff listed above in my bag, I have almost no place to put the sippy cup and snacks.  I never leave the house without my son's sippy cup and snacks. When I did stuff them in, the bag is too bulky and the front flap of the bag where the velcro is, won't meet and so I can't secure the bag.  I will still keep the bag but only for a very short trip like to the grocery store to pick up a few things and use it mainly like a purse.  No snacks or sippy cup but just wipes.  I give 4 stars only because I think it should be a little bigger.
