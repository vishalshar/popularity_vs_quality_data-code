We purchased the Ergo Baby carrier and Heart to Heart infant insert for use with our two-month-old son.  Overall, my baby and I are very happy with the product.Pros:1.  I love that this insert holds the baby upright -- my son definitely prefers being carried this way.  (The older style infant insert carries the baby in a reclining position, "sling-style.")2. The insert positions the baby EXACTLY the way I hold him when I'm cuddling him close to my chest.  The little padded seat holds him up the way I hold him with my hands, and his legs are positioned exactly the same way.  This tells me that the Heart to Heart insert really does mimic the most natural way of carrying a child.3.  It doesn't put all his weight on his crotch, unlike other front carriers.Cons:1.  It's very fluffy and padded.  This is great for winter time, as you don't need coats or blankets for the baby.  But if you were to carry a summer-born infant in this carrier, you and he might become uncomfortably warm.2.  It's a little tricky to position the baby in comfortably, and the directions aren't entirely clear.  (At one point, the directions say it's important to put your hands under the baby's bottom and rotate the baby forward, which I'm still not quite sure I'm doing correctly.)  But after a couple times, it's much easier.3.  The baby's feet are still inside the carrier and always feel a bit squished.  My son seems perfectly comfortable, so I'm sure it doesn't bother him, but they do look rather squished.Overall, I would highly recommend this product for a fall- or winter-born baby.  If you live in a place with very hot weather and your baby will be a newborn during the warm months, you might need something a little more light weight.
