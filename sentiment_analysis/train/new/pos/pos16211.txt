Love these diapers! The inserts are absorbent and easy to use. That being said, get the diapers with snaps! The Velcro on these diapers don't last. They're nice when the baby is little but once they are moving around, forget it. My son pulls the tabs off, even with pants on, because he can lol. They've lost their cohesiveness and are starting to look dingy.
