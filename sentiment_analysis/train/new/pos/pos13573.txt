I bought this "treasure chest" for my son's bedroom toys. It's a really great size for the end of the bed, holds lots of stuff. The wood is actually pretty solid, top is very nice and overall it looks great. However, I have a few concerns that prevent me from loving it. Anytime I am not 100% happy with a purchase but consider keeping it anyway, I base the decision to keep on one thing, Does the price of the product compared to competetors make the issues I have not a big deal. In this case I will keep it based on what I paid, if it was over $100 I would be returning it.1) The bottom piece is not solid and rather thin. This really could have been done better for the price, although not cardboard it is very thin and can imagine a kid trying to sitting in the chest and damaging the bottom.2) The biggest issue I have is the hardware, bottom line the hindges that secure the top are not great. This toy box will be opened and closed 1000's of times, I suspect this might not last me through all of his childhood.3) The easy close hinge that protects it from slamming shut does it's job, but If I open the top too quickly it does not stay open all the way, sometimes if you just swing it open the weight pushes it closed half way. Not a huge deal but again if the hardware was stronger this would be a great purchase.
