My daughter is 2 years old. Before her, I had 2 sons that are both teens now. So it's been a while since I've shopped for baby items. I couldn't remember which cups I used for the boys so I had to start all over again & try new products. I bought a lot of Playtex cups which were huge disappointments! I finally came across these & really liked them, hence the reason I bought some on Amazon. They're super easy to clean! By hand or in top rack of dishwasher. No fussing with complicated valves & parts. Very durable! So even if you're in the hospital or camping and have limited resources to clean them, you're good as long as you have water & soap. I've never had a mold problem with them, like I've had with other cups of different brands. I love them so much that I'm probably going to buy another set.
