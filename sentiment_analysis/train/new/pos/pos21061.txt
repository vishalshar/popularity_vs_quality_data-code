I bought this play yard to take camping to confine my 2 10 pound dogs. It will work for that. It's okay, but I probably wouldn't have picked it if I saw it in person before I bought it.  This one was priced a bit high for the quality. If you are looking for a play yard for your kids I would get something better. This one is very light weight and flimsy.  It's a bit too light weight. When my daughter was small I had a different play yard - a super play yard - with taller panels and a much heavier weight plastic. I liked that one much better.
