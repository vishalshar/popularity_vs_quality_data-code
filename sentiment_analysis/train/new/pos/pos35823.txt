So glad I got this. When our bath fixtures were installed the sticker that tells you which sides are hot and cold were misplaced. That was ten years ago. Its worse now because they are faded. We have a daughter who is learning to run her own bath and we've used sharpies to mark it but on metal it still fades or rubs off.I got it for our infant who is not quite ready for her first bath. When I heard the alarm, after testing it out in our kindergartner's bath, I knew I made the right choice for BOTH girls. This may just put an end to her filling the tub up with water too hot for her to sit in. I placed it at the opposite end of the faucet so as not to get water in it. I heard the alarm from the adjacent room right when the water reached the device. Nothing too loud and annoying, just enough to notice the bath needed adjusting. Brilliant idea, Aquatopia.
