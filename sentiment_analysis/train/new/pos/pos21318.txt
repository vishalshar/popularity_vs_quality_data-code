I said I would change my review if I could get it to open (if I liked it).Positive points:1- The required disclaimer to not use it in a moving vehicle is given in the pre-talk, so you don't hear it over and over again ad nauseum each time you listen.2- Though it is seems like a takeoff of Hypnobabies 速, he doesn't drag out going under as long as Hypnobabies速 does. I really like this. Hypnobabies 速 is tedious to me because I've had enough experience with hypnosis that I can go under very quickly. I get bored.3- Whereas, I feel like Hypnobabies 速 focuses so much on anesthesia and "easier" birth that my subconscious raises red flags, wondering why there is so very much emphases on this if there is going to be no pain, this CD doesn't focus on that - at least not enough to rouse my subconscious suspicions.4- I like the explanations given in the audio and video (they are the same talk) about hypnosis, etc. There are also some things said in Birthing Session 1 (that's as far as I have gotten thus far) that I found to be helpful explanations.5- There is autonomy. I was given the impression that I was totally in charge of what I accepted, of putting myself under, of coming out of it.Several times, I said aloud, "I *like* this," while I was listening. That hasn't happened with many self-hypnosis programs I've tried over the years (I've used them for a whole lot more than birthing).Not so positive points:1 - The man speaking seems a little rushed or out of breath much of the time. That is distracting to me.2 - The recording, at times, seems a little "fuzzy" like when a car radio is turned up so loud that one hears vibrations from the radio itself that interferes with hearing a clear and crisp sound. This is when the volume is not loud at all.In any case, I have changed my rating as I promised. I would say it is worth trying. Just remember, it needs to be played on a computer as it is a computer disc.
