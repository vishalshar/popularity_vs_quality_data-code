This is very nice quality. It has serger stitched edges with two layers. A soft cotton patterned fabric over a very flexible plastic layer. There is hook and loop closures on it. The shape makes it easy to fold over food. It's easy to clean and I just leave it overnight (if you get the fabric wet) to dry in my dish dry rack.My almost 3 yr old loves the pattern and has figured out how to fold and close it.I make my toddler a lunch when I make her big sister's school lunch, that way my toddler can have fun getting out her lunch at home. It's helping prepare her for preschool.
