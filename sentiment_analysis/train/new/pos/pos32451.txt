Very cute and simple without the baby bumpers, which are potentially dangerous anyway. I do not find the blanket to be stiff at all. However, it is a bit thick for a baby to sleep with and I know that is how they all come. So, we decided to hang the blanket on our son's wall above his crib as room decor instead of a blanket for him to sleep with.
