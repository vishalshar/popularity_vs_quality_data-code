We were torn between this seat and the Britax Marathon. We chose this seat because it has excellent safety ratings and is much less expensive than the comparable Britax seat. So far, we like it quite well. Our son is 8 months old and 20 lbs. We started in a Graco SnugRide 35 and switched because he seemed uncomfortable, plus he was too heavy to use it as a carrier anymore.The Evenflo Triumph 65 (rear facing) actually fits better in our car than the SnugRide and allows the front seat to slide back further. We have a Scion xB, so it's not a large vehicle. We will switch to front facing when his legs grow too long to be rear facing, which looks like it will be quite a while.Our son likes this seat MUCH better than the infant seat. He is up higher and can see out. He never liked the car before, but is much much happier now and seems to be quite comfortable.The only reason I docked it a star is because of the placement of the strap tightening knob and loosening lever. It is difficult, though not impossible, to access in rear-facing mode. I do not think it will be a problem when front facing. However, it is possible to get him in and out of the seat without loosening the straps, so this is not usually an issue.
