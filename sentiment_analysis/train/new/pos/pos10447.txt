My daughter loves this toy. It floats really well in the bath, and although it has a hole in the bottom, it doesn't seem to suck up any water. So no rotting bath toys, yay! I think her favorite part is the mallet though. It's the perfect size and shape for little hands to hold onto, and because it is plastic and hollow, it does not to any harm to anything she hits with it. If I lost the mallet, I would probably buy the toy again just for that because the price is very good. She does love the turtle in the bath though, and the noise quality is fine considering its a floaty toy.
