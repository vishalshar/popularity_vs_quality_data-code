I bought this product looking for something to protect my babies from 1)people trying to touch them (germs!), to 2) protect them from the sun, as well as 3) the rain. I used it with my Chicco KeyFit carseats, and it installed simply and easily. I could keep the bubble on while it was snapped into the base in the car, as well as when it was snapped into my Chicco Cortina Together stroller. As far as protecting baby from everyone and their grandma who wants to reach out and touch him/her it does great, as people can see the babies but not reach inside to touch them with their unsanitized hands. In regard to protecting baby from the sun, it performs adequately, as the mesh is darkly colored and provides some, but not alot, of sun protection. As far as the rain goes. it is better than nothing, but I wouldn't say it provides really good rain protection. The small shade that folds out will protect baby from a few drops as you rush him to the car, but definately doesn't substitute for a good shade on a stroller. Another bummer was the difficulty accessing baby while the carseat is snapped into its base in the car- you have to reach around the bubble and inside, which is difficult, and it also makes taking baby out of the carseat more work than when the shade isn't on. On the plus side, it was easy to install, and seems better than the few other options out there. Overall, I gave it 4 stars, as its a good but imperfect solution.
