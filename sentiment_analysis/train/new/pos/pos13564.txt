Reading others' reviews, I was a little leery of purchasing this, for my little girl. I wanted to be able to separate them & many reviewers stated they can not be separated. Also, some complaints about the quality. I think they both look great!!! And good quality... As well as being very easy to separate! :) (only attached by those little plastic things, that attach tags to most plushes) ~ yay! I'm betting things have changed, with them, since some have commented. (Improvements made).My little girl and I LOVE them! Great price, for both! Binoo is very small, but I think it's a really cute size! They both look just like on the cartoon! :)Hope the photos help :)
