I have purchased an embarrassing amount of step stools for my kids in an attempt to find the perfect one. Let me tell you, this one is it. Don't hesistate, just buy it. Not only is it the best deal price wise, it is excellent quality, the perfect height, totally stable and really nice looking. I paid $7.59 for this and it was a steal. I have literally purchased a total of ~ 7 step stools, 5 different varieties)1. Really nice and expensive wooden step stool (nice, but too heavy to be moved easily by a kid).2. Plastic Bumbo step stool (okay, but poor quality - the rubber grip at the bottom started falling off the stool after light use and the standing area was too narrow).3. This Fisher Price Thomas the Train Trackmaster step stool (perfect in every way - price, quality, height, size, stability, and overall design. I foolishly sold it when my son asked for a Cars step stool).4. Two Disney Cars and Minnie Mouse Step & Glow step stools (again okay, but too short and bulky. I regretted getting rid of the Thomas one).5. Two Ginsey Disney Mickey & Minnie Mouse Step Stools (good quality, style, size and price but simply too short for both my almost 3 year old and my small 5 year old).I sold/got rid of all of the previous ones and re-purchased the Fisher Price Thomas the Train Trackmaster step stool and I'm once again thrilled with it. It's staying for good this time, and I will not buy another step stool besides this one if I ever need another. My son loves the train track design that is on the rubber grips at the top of the stool, and immediately started playing with his trains on there. My ultra girly-girl daughter also liked it and uses it without complaining that it's not Minnie Mouse.I've tried a good cross-section of what's available on the market, and this one was by far my favorite AND it was the cheapest of all the ones I've ever purchased. I cannot recommend it enough.
