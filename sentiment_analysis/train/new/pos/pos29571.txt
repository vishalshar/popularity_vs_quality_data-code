Fabric print matches what was purchased online (leaf). The fit is great and the buckle is good quality. Took off a star for cheap fabric itself - very thin and pills - but I had low expectations anyway. Wish there was a waterproof backing but I sort of made my own by putting a Munchkin changing table liner under the cover to protect the pillow foam. Not a perfect fit but good enough. Overall it gives me something prettier to look at than my old Brest Friend pillow cover (Fireworks), which looks worse for wear after only five months and two trips through the wash. The pillow itself is holding up very well. I wash the covers on cold and air dry to prevent shrinking.
