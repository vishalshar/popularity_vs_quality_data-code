We had a Houdini preemie - she'd weasel her way out of her swaddle and wake herself up... until the Swaddlepod. This helped to calm her down to sleep and while the neck still allowed her to occasionally pop a hand out, she stayed asleep. We also loved the double zipper for middle of the night diaper changes! A few tips for parents that we wished we had known about:1) When the baby is tiny (under 7 pounds), the Swaddlepod works more effectively if you put it on over a sleeper. Just putting your pumpkin in a onesie and a Swaddlepod will allow hands to escape. Once your baby chunks up a bit, you'll find it's easier to keep him/her snuggled up in a Swaddlepod.2) Buy two. Or three. It's inevitable that baby will puke (oh, not my baby!), and you'll want to swap out your Swaddlepod. We found that the Swaddlepod stayed wet around the neck and was uncomfortable for her until we replaced her Swaddlepod for a fresh one. (And truly, as they are relatively inexpensive compared to the Woombie, it behooves you to buy at least two.)3) Start investigating what you'll do after you've reached the weight limit for this nifty item. She is reaching the weight limit for this product and while she's now fitting into a Swaddleme, we wish that the company would make these in a larger size. (In fact, we've had several friends and relatives joke that they wish the company made these in adult sizes...)
