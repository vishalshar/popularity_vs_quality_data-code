This product is exactly as stated... I bought this for my first son who was 3yrs at the time. It fit like a glove. It has lasted for years even when used as playing dress up. Now my 2yr old son loves this costume. He too fits snug, but he is slightly wider in the hips and torso than my eldest. My eldest is super slim with small bone structure, and my 2 yr old is slim, bigger boned and really tall for his age.
