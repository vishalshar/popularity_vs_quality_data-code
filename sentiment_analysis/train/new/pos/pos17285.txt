I researched baby monitors for a good while before picking this one. I didn't want the one with the motion pad, as that is useless once they start moving and honestly, I've read that once the pad goes off it's too late anyways. I didn't want one of the walmart/target specials because they were in a frequency that was too common or low. We live in a town home with close proximity to a lot of other families and didn't want to pick up interference.The MHz on this monitor make it realy clear and easy to hear on. The monitor for the bedroom is small and unobstrusive, and the receiver is small easy to carry around and the battery lasts FOREVER. We have had it for almost 20 months now and with daily use off the charger for naps and at bedtime it has never completely died. We accidently left it off the charger one night on and it was still working the next morning. The temperature indicator has been really helpful since our home is two stories, the upstairs tends to get hotter than the downstairs so we can try to keep it cool in her room in the summer.The screen is a little weird, where at certain angles it looks like all the lights on the inside are on, but I bought it to hear stuff not look at the screen constantly. If you pick it up and look right at it, it's clear what settings are on, what the indicator says, and what the volume level is. Our daughter tends to pick up the receiver and play with it if we leave it out between naps and bedtime, and has chewed on it, dropped it on the floor, and anything else a toddler can do to something she treats as a toy. For a little while after she had played with it once the screen indicators were a little off, but they seemed to have fixed themselves after a couple weeks.Would highly recommend this.
