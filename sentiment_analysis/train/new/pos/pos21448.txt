I love our city mini double stroller!  I purchased this stroller when I had my second baby.  My girls are only 11 months apart so we had to have a good double stroller because my oldest was still a baby when my second was born.  I researched strollers for a long time before deciding on this and I am thrilled with this stroller.  I've had it for three years now and have 3 children now and I am still getting lots of use.  I love that it is side by side.  The front/back strollers bother me because one child is facing the back of the other child.  Not a great view in my opinion.  This stroller is no wider than a wheelchair so I've never had a hard time fitting through any doors.One thing I would like is for the seats to sit up a little straighter but I haven't found any strollers that do that.  I also think its crazy that every accessory for this stroller is sold separately and they are not cheap.  I have bought almost all of them (belly bar, 2 trays, glider for third child to stand on, cup holder for me). The only thing I've gotten a lot of use out of is the cup holder for me.  The other things at pretty useless for us.Even though I have these complaints, I am still giving this stroller 5 stars because I love it.  It's light and folds up easily.  Fit in my Rav4 easily and now my van.
