I searched in vain for "adult size" padded seatbelt shoulder strap covers that would be covered in smooth cloth. Most of the covers I found appeared to be scratchy/rough or be made of faux lambswool, which I find uncomfortable. Then I found these "infant size" JJ Cole Strap Covers, which are reversible with a smooth quilted fabric on one side and "faux shearling" on the other. They were only half the size of most adult size covers, but I thought I could make them work for me, if I used them both...as a "team".What I did was open up both covers flat, place them end-to-end, and whip-stitch the m together in area just between the 2 "folds". As you can see by the photos, I now have one perfect seatbelt shoulder strap cover.
