If you have one of those shower stall/bath tubs with the painful door slider grooves, this little guy is a MUST have. It's extremely cute and super comfortable as well. I rest my elbow on it, and even my chin sometimes while giving our little man a bath. I honestly am not sure what I would do with the small zipper pouch, but I suppose it's a nice addition. The little hook is great to hang the pad when you're done with the bath so it can drip dry. A little discoloration after a year of use, but overall the value is great. Discoloration is the only reason for 4 stars. Also plan to use it when my son is able to get in and out of the tub as he gets older - to prevent him bashing himself should he slip on the way out.
