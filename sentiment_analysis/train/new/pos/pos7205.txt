My daughter is a very active toddler and not always to keep up with. Especially with my cane, taking her places can be difficult. I didn't know if I'd like the idea of a harness, so I bought Dora's backpack in case she didn't take to it. She loves Dora more than anything so when I showed her Backpack and Map her eyes lit up and she started to sing the backpack song with me.She has spent time playing with it off and on and when we go somewhere she has no problem wearing her backpack. There isn't much space inside, but enough to put some of her tiny getaway toys in. I think she appreciates it too. The harness allows me to let her have a little more exploring room, but not enough that I can't bring her back to me.This was a life saver. I'm so glad I found Dora the Explorer Tether Buddy!
