Firstly, I did not buy this for a kid. I'm 33 and work in a corporate office building constantly lugging netbooks, tablets, etc...and a lunch bag. Now I lug NOTHING. It all simply rides conveniently on my back. Not too big like thise giant laptop bookbags for my 5'6 frame and not too small to fit everything. The earth tone camo print keeps it adult-friendly, so it's cool but not childish.
