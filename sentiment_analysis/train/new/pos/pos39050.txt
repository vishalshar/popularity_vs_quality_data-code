We just received our teething rings. So far my son, who is 6 months old tomorrow, loves them. I just rinsed them off with water and I "tasted" them first. They had a natural taste to them of course, the are wood! I just like to know what's going into my son's mouth. So taste and materials passed the mommy test, next was the baby test... they passed!! My son loves them! He can easily hold them any which way he grabs them. He is kinda rough, so I have to watch him when he starts swinging his arms, but he loves this teether so far! I don't have to worry about then getting fuzzy, we have 3 labs and finding a teether that hair doesn't stick to is a plus! They hit the floor and mommy just hands it right back! I highly recommend this product. Organic, natural and made in the USA!
