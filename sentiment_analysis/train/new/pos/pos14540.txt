Haven't used these yet but wanted to share the thickness of the muslin as this was something I was very curious about. Looks to be about the thickness of two layers but woven as one. I have the matching changing pad cover and it's similar quality. Not as thick as the changing pad cover but more breathable so I like that. These should wear well and be nice cool sheets for her crib. I have several of their products from the main brand and the maudlin washes very well. They were also $10 cheaper than the other patterns, best deal you can find as I needed to get two for myself and two for daycare.
