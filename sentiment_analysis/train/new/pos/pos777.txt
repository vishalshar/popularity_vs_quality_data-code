After trying out Gerber diaper covers with padding and having horrible results, these did an amazing job.  They contain the accidents at night for my son who is still potty training while keeping the sheets dry.  They also make him feel wet so it is a good training pant.  They feel more like real underwear (no plastic feel) and so my son doesn't mind wearing them.  They wash well and can be reused over and over. Overall, we are 100% satisfied and would definitely recommend this product.
