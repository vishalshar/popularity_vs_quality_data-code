May 08 - The amazon reviews were the reason that I decided on this product, so I didn't want to neglect to write one myself.  This product is everything I want in a booster.  My daughter (age 3 - 32 pounds) loves it.  She is able to get in and out by herself and she feels safe.  It's so easy to clean - just a quick wet wipe.  My daughter immediately commented about how soft it was when she sat for the first time.  I like that I can slide the chair under the table and the cooshie disappears!  Not a huge deal, but it is a space saver in the kitchen.  The previous booster set-up required that we have the towel clipped to the chair to protect it, and the booster strapped in 2 places - several parts and pieces and it was difficult to clean.  What an upgrade. I would liked to have spent less on it, but I still love it and would recommend it to everyone.  My husband insists that I include that he is afraid it will eventually damage the hardwood chair that it is sitting on and that he wishes the sides were slightly higher.  If you have a particulary squirmy child, beware. He also adds that the cooshie tends to feel "stuck" to the chair - he's not entirely comfortable with that.  We will amend our positive comments if this ruins our chair.  So far so good - 4 weeks and counting.  I will say that I would not feel safe putting this on a painted surface.  Our chair is solid wood finished.  Great purchase.June 09 - The seat is still in perfect shape.  We did decide to begin placing a towel under the chair 'just because' and it works just fine.  My daughter is now 4 and 43 pounds - she still loves it and fits in it just fine.  We take it with us when we eat out all of the time.  My husband STILL cringes when my 10 year old and I laugh about how much we paid for it, but I will always say it was well worth it.  We will probably pass it on to someone else in the family when we're done with it.
