We have been through SO many sippy cups in this house!! At almost 17 months, it's the one thing that my daughter has been picky about.  We tried every kind of sippy cup imaginable when we first switched from the bottle at 12 months.  We ended up with a soft cup nipple sippy...pretty similar to a bottle nipple actually.  So now I wanted to start the process of getting her into a "big girl" cup, and with a reccomendation from our ped to NOT go into a straw cup, and just to skip right to the next stage...we went out and bought some hard nipple cups. We tried a TON of different kinds, and we even tried other kinds of "open-style" sippy cups (avent 360 and others).  She literally would just look at the cup--she hated all of them. THey were either too big and heavy, too heavy of a flow, etc....we finally saw these in Buy Buy Baby and thought that because it has a softer nipple but is in the Stage 4 form, more similar to a "big kid" cup that it might work. She is finally drinking milk again!! The cup is durable, no leaking (even with being thrown off of the highchair!) and comes in cute colors.  As other reviewers mentioned, there a few droplets of milk may get stuck in the top of the cup and drip out if cup is tipped, but it's very minimal.  I bought my first from Buy Buy to test it out, but just ordered two more from Amazon for a great price.  I was able to choose colors, so I am hoping that I get what I selected. :)
