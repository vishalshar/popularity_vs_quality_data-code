I didn't need these liners while my daughter was exclusively breastfed since that poo just dissolves, but once we started her on formula and solids these were a must to help protect the investment we made in our cloth diapers PLUS I have never wanted to mess with a diaper sprayer. With two older kiddos having a sprayer in their bathroom just seemed like an invitation for some wort of water disaster in the future. But I digress.These liners have been wonderful, if she has only peed on them then i toss them in the wash with our diapers and they go through the washer with no problem- in fact, they come out still strong but SUPER soft! So for anyone that stresses about the fact that they aren't soft to begin with- just tear a bunch of them apart and run them through the washer with your diapers. I've never bothered since my daughter does just fine with them a lil on the stiff side but you could if you want. DO NOT run them through your dryer though! They are not usable after that- I learned that the hard way!We've never had any problem flushing them and they have pretty much stayed put and been where they needed to be to catch the majority of the poo. Sometimes they wiggle a bit and some poo stays on the diaper- but really, they're in a diaper with a wriggly little 9 month old- some movement is to be expected.Overall these have been a great. They protect the diapers a little, catch the poo, don't irritate my daughter's skin, are flushable, are reusable if only peed on, and are a great price. We will continue to re-order.
