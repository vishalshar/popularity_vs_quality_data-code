This is the third car seat that we've gotten for my son and I wish we'd had this one from the start. It's much softer and cushioned that his two previous seats (Graco SnugRide Classic Connect 30 LX Infant Car Seat, Metropolis and Safety 1st All-in-One Convertible Car Seat, Scribbles) and seems much safer. I don't like how other reviewers are saying that you "get what you pay for" and complaining that this seat doesn't fit their car. This seat is expensive for a lot of people, not everyone can afford to buy a $300 or more car seat. And if the seat doesn't fit in your car, that doesn't make it a bad seat, so that shouldn't affect the review. We have a 4-door Pontiac G6, and this seat does fit rear-facing in the center of the back seat, and it also fits behind the passenger seat. Yes, the passenger seat had to be pushed forward, but in my opinion it wasn't so far forward that it was unusable. We're having baby #2 in a few months and we plan on getting another Safety 1st Complete Air Protect seat. My son will have to be scooted over from the middle to the side, and so will the new baby, so the "wings" next to their heads and the over-all safety rating of the seat make me feel much better about them being right next to the car door. This seat is lightweight, safe, soft, and allows baby/toddler to remain rear-facing longer than a lot of other seats. I have no complaints and I'm pretty picky! I'm so relieved to feel like we've finally found a great car seat.My only suggestion, not really a complaint, but something you may want to purchase with the seat, is strap covers (We had Brica Cushies Button Up Strap Covers, Gray/Blue/Green that we purchased with his first seat) because this seat doesn't come with any. And an insert, like Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Terry, if you're going to have a newborn in the seat, or else you'll have to roll up receiving blankets around the baby.
