I always used these bottles for all my kids The amount of air that is swallowed is CONSIDERABLY less therefore causing alot less discomfort during and after a feeding. Be forwarned however that the Stage 2 nipples that come with the bottles are FAST for a little one! I purchased some Stage 1 nipples (0-6 months) for the bottles and they are really hard to get any liquid out of (I tried it myself) so I'm using the Stage 2 nipples. After using these bottles for about two weeks, he has adjusted just fine to the fast-flow nipples. I also like how both ends of the bottle come off for better cleaning! The box warns that the "Bubble Free Vent" may become clogged. I have not had a problem with that. The only problem I'm having is finding extra Stage 2 nipples in the stores- all the extra nipples for sale are Stage 1.I use these bottels with disposable enFamil nipples and works very good. No issues.I was so happy to be able to find these on Amazon! I purchased the 3 pack of the smaller once since my son still only eats 5 oz at a time and these were way cheaper than the 9 oz ones. I did end up purchasing the bigger ones as well. These are the only bottles that work with our son. We do have the new vent aire wide ones but it seems like it takes forever for him to drink out of them because of the wider nipple so we use those ones at night to slow him down and get him "bored" and to sleep :) So happy Amazon has these discontinued items! These did the trick to stop the spit up and colic with our son. We started him on Dr. Browns but those didn't do the trick for us, these did!!
