My daughter's favorite teether! It's been a hit since she could hold things. Fits comfortably in her hand and she just goes to town on it. It's our car toy and she's thrilled to see it every time she gets in the car.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it came with a very thick, oily film on it when it arrived. It smelled horribly. I washed it thoroughly (and then again). I'm a little concerned about that and would love to know what it is. I figured since she only chews on it in the car, we'd keep it.
