I bought this for my step-daughters new baby boy and she seems to be very pleased with it. She said that it was easier to carry then her old one and she even found the stroller that matches and purchased that. I looked for a couple of days in town and nobody seemed to have anything that was even close in price to this one or that was even in stock. This worked out really well as I feel I  got a great price, free shipping and they sent it right to her door. So much easier then shopping in town.
