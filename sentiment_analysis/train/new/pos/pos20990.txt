I bought this on a whim over a year ago for my daughter. At the time I was just using those disposable plastic sheets that you stick to the table....which are not only a pain to stick on as your HANGRY BABY grasps at it, but is slowly killing mother earth because it's plastic that (let's be real moms) you just throw away and don't recycle. I was actually reordering a pack (with much disdain because they're REDIC as far as price goes) and came across this one. THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST BABY ITEM I'VE EVER PURCHASED!!!! It sticks to the table and my daughter has never tried to lift it up. I love the sections for her food. I love that it comes in a carrying case/container. It's nice because it keeps it sanitary before she uses it to eat AND saves my bag after she's done eating on it. I've been stopped by countless strangers asking me about this when I'm out eating with her. It's easy to wash and you can put it safely in the dishwasher. Any mom friend of mine, both new and experienced, I have purchased this for because it's seriously on my top 10 favorite list of baby item necessities!!!! Seriously, why are you still reading my review...PUT THIS IN YOUR CART AND BUY IT!!!!!
