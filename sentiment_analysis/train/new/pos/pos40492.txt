I agree with the positive reviews here saying that the cover causes little ones to be uninterested in playing with it, that it can help prevent injuries in the bathtub, and that if you keep it dry it should last a long time. However, please note that it may not be suitable for all tub spouts.  See Customer Image.If the end of your spout extends downward only a little (like 1/2"), all is well: the cover will keep your child protected. But if the end of the spout goes down 1" or more, there will be an exposed sharp edge that could produce an owie.If your spout's shower diverter knob is positioned toward the front of the spout, all is well: the knob will poke through the hole at top and can be hidden or exposed using the long top flap with Velcro. Also, the knob will help prevent the child from removing the cover. But if the shower diverter is in the middle of the spout, you have to remove the entire cover to take a shower, so for each bath for your child you'll need to put on and take off the cover (a minor inconvenience); furthermore, it's easy for the child to slip the cover off.Buy this from Amazon.com!
