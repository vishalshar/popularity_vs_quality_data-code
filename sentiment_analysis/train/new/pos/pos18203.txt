I switched to Avent from Playtex drop ins. I had 1 Avent bottle and i noticed my son took to the nipple, so i bought a few more and after a few weeks i noticed he NEVER spit up anymore. So i made the complete switch and i even bought an Avent ISIS iq double pump too. Best decision i have ever made.Now the thing i noticed, is the Avent bottles that have the 1 piece and even the ones with the 2 piece anti-colic valves tend to sometimes leak... even when done correctly! My son would get halfway through a bottle and all of a sudden it would just leak! drives me crazy!I dont know if its just luck or not, but these have not leaked at all!!!!!!!!! I make sure i use these instead of the regular 4ox or 9oz bottles. these in my opinion are waaaay better!!!UPDATE 12/27/2010: Recently had a few minor leaks, minor because i caught them at the beginning of the leak. I dont know what it is with avent... its not at the beginning of the feeding, but more towards halfway through! The ring is not too tight, but tight enough... its leaked with new AND used nipples, and yes, they ARE snapped in correctly, and i read a trick to make sure the vents are where the rings are on the collar, and it still does not help. But my son loves the bottles.I recently started to use the born free bottles... and the avent nipple fits in the collars! These are still perfect for storage, but if i am going out i transfer to born free.
