These are very thick burpy cloths that can also be used as bibs.  They are big - on my baby they were gigantic (we didn't start really using them as burp clothes until he was about 1, since he didn't each much food before that).  They really poof up after washing, which is really nice.  They have little metal snaps on them so they can snap in a circle around the neck.  The quality was very nice - classic A&A, made of the same material as the muslin swaddles they sell.  Though we found them a bit big when the baby was younger, as he got older and messier, my husband loved these because they covered so much. When we used it as a burp cloth, I loved the curve, because it rested on my shoulders better.
