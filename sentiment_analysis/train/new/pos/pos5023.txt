Why is it so hard to find a Bottle Caddy? This one is so cute! My 8-month old nephew loves his Medela bottles, so I really only needed the caddy. It's a little tight but it does the trick. I can pack all of his bottles for daycare/babysitter/long trip. It's so compact and fits neatly in the fridge or a cooler. Highly recommended!
