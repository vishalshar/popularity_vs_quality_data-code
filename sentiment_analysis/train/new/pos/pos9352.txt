You got everything arranged in the nursery. The babies are safe. Then you realize that it took you so long the baby is now a toddler and is grabbing on to everything. What are you to do? How do you keep the pint size from pulling down the bookshelf on their adorable heads? Buy the anti-tip anchor.Pros: Good strap. It works.Cons: The crumby screws. Save them for another project.Verdict: Find a stud or mount a stud to the wall and the underside of the bookcase if it is made from cheap pressboard/particleboard. Afterwards attach it with some real heavier duty screws and not the ones that came with the strap.
