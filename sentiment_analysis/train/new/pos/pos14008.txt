I own two double strollers for my nearly 4 month old and 16 month old sons. Likewise, since the Traveler is more expenisive than the other one I own, I registered for it (recieved it in April though, came out after the baby was born), and purchased my other one (Jeep twin Wrangler) myself.I did choose the Traveler over 4 other doubles that I researched, (1) Twin Savvy (2) Combi Twin (3) Graco DuoGlider (tandem) and (4) Graco DuoRider (side-by-side) and after checking out the Combi (was gonna pick it, but seemed much less sturdy, and too plasticy), so I chose it.PROs- Easy to manuver, I can steer with one hand, yet turning requires two- Very well put together- At 24 lbs its right in the middle of the lightweights and the heavy weights- The seats have 5 recline possitions with two hands (not strap system though). The seats also have headrests for my infant, and boots for the cold weather- There are five point harnesses and they are actually well padded.- The stroller folds flatly, leaving plenty of room in the trunk of my minivan.- Its great on concrete, and indoor surfaces, but I can also use it on a bit of rocky surfaces.- It can indeed fit through a doorway easily (29 inches), but it is troublesome when you hit the restroom- Storage is fine. There are two baskets underneath the seats, and I can store my light diaperbag and my small purse in one, with the boots and maybe a few toys or small packages in the other. I wind up hanging any shopping on the handle bars.- The handles have a nice rubber grip- The canopies cover their heads, but yet I wish they extended more, and theres an added rain cover!- Each seat holds up to FORTY POUNDS, thats EIGHTY POUNDS IN TOTAL!CONs- The stroller isnt ideal for shopping through crowded ailes, but I rarely go to the mall for very long alone!)- The cupholder is very flimsy and cannot hold too much.- The pockets on the canopies are annoying, they are circular and only hold little- There are no snack trays, so we attached link-a-doos in a chain for both children to cliip things to- Its VERY expensive- The seats are difficult to clean, I have to wet a paper towel for it to work (preferably a rag!)All in all I highly reccomend this stroller, I havent had ANY problems with the canopies, and I just think with a few imporvements the Traveler could be the best on the market. But theres always room for improvements!
