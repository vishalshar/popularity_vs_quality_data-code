i am breastfeeding, but purchased this warmer so that if my mother or mother-in-law had to heat a bottle it would be easy for them to do so.I am not sure why so many people had problems figuring out how to use this warmer. If you follow the directions, it is easy to use. Also, make sure that you try it out a few times before the middle of the night feeding so that you are sure you are comfortable with it. Doing this would probably ease much of the frustration of people who said that they could not get it to work. I did find that the lid has to be down in order for you to select any of the options.I showed both my mother and mother-in-law how to use it and they both got the hang of it very easily.It does tend to need at least 1 oz. more warming time than your bottle. For instance, if you have a 4 oz. bottle, it is best to select the 5 oz. It warms the bottles quickly and to just the right temperature.It would be better if it came with something to measure the water, I use a liquid measuring glass and keep it next to the warmer.Overall, a very good product and I plan on using it to defrost my homemade baby food as well.
