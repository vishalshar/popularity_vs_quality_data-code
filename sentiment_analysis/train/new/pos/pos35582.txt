I purchased this product when my baby was 2 months old so he would have something to look at wherever I placed him.  His bassinet has a mobile built in so I wanted this mostly for the stroller and car seat.  I have a Graco Snugride car seat and I used the Velcro attachment to secure the mobile to the handle.  However, I found that since the mechanism is under the Velcro strap, the mobile hangs very low and is practically in my baby's face.  I wish they had made this product so the mechanism would rest above the car seat handle so the mobile wouldn't be as low as it is.  It doesn't really work well in the car seat, which was primarily why I purchased this mobile.  I have not tested the clip for a stroller hood yet since I still use my car seat in the snap and go as a stroller but I would imagine this will work well in a stroller when my baby outgrows the snap and go.  Again, my bassinet came with a mobile so I didn't need this for my bassinet but I did test the attachment and it seems to work well.It is pretty easy to take off and put back on the pieces to convert from bassinet to stroller to car seat so I would imagine that if you wanted to use this in several places it would be very easy to move around.  The mobile itself is colorful and attractive and the music is nice.  It's not so repetitive like other baby toys that can drive you crazy after a while!  The music plays for a half hour before turning off automatically.It turns out that I mainly use this product attached to my baby's activity gym so he can look at the mobile as well as the other hanging toys.  He really likes it and can sometimes lie there looking at it for the full half hour.  I like this mobile since my baby seems to like it but if I were buying again I'd look for something that worked well on the car seat as well.
