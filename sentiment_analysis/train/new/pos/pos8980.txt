I've been using this for a couple months now, and it's great. It has held up to multiple washings, looks nice, fits well. I have no complaints.I use this liner (and another from an unknown brand that I was given) with a garbage can like this one: Sterilite 10439004  4-Pack Touch-Top Wastebasket, 7.5-Gallon, Black. I purchased the garbage can in a store locally, so it's brown... but the brand and size is the same. It contains the smell well, the liners fit well, and it was a great option for a diaper pail for me.Update: After about a year of washing this liner 2-4 times a week, it's held up BEAUTIFULLY. It's still waterproof and the elastic is still tight. I'm very glad I bought this option rather than a more expensive one.
