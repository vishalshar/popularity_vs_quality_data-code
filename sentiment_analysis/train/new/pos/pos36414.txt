at the right age, baby took to these. the right size for a small baby to use for teething. lots of others were too big, too heavy, too hard to hold, etc. Our baby (very small), loves these. We got extras so when one falls on the floor we always have fresh clean ones. These are definitely the best teething device for our baby (and I tried at least 5-10 different kinds).
