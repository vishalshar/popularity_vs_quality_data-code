Although almost 3x the price of Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon, Colors May Vary by quantity, this spoon is SO much better than Munchkin's.The standard expectations of a baby spoon are met:+ Comfortable for baby (soft silicon) and feeder (nicely weighted and shaped handle).+ Non-toxic materials (BPA/phthalate/PVC-free).+ Easy to clean (easy to handwash and dishwasher-safe).Some Oxo spoon characteristics realized after also using Munchkin's:+ Its curvature enables entire scoop to be fed, while Munchkin's leaves some in the spoon.+ Its silicon spoon is soft on the lips, while Munchkin's is rigid (not rough, but just not as pleasant).+ It lays stable on bowl rims, inside bowl, on its neck (e.g., resting on upside-down jar lid), etc.  Munchkin's spoon, on the other hand, is balanced so poorly that it flings food as if an invisible, evil Munchkin is trying to foodfight with you.After a few tries, I haven't touched the Munchkin spoons since, and instead purchased another set of Oxo spoons.Note that the aqua color Oxo spoon is actually more of a putrid dark blue that looks like "used" toilet bowl cleaner fluid;  the color is not anything like other Oxo products' aqua.  I promptly returned it and got another set in green, which nicely matches the OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2-Ounce, Set 6, Clear.Btw, I use and love the Munchkin Feeding Set, 15 Pack, so it's just their spoon I don't like, not the Munchkin brand.
