Very nice quality.  Great that it turns into a little chair.  Only drawback is it is not easy to clean.  Although do you know of one that is "easy" to clean.  Someone has to do it.  Again, excellent quality.  The tray is very nice and comes out smoothly.  4 stars only because it's hard to get under seat cushion and clean.  I took it outside and hosed it off, but if you live in cold weather region, that's not likely.
