I purchased this to make the seat for a 4-Wheeler diaper cake. It worked perfectly. I love that it was white and the size was ideal. I was able to actually fill the inside with useful items for mom and baby as well as use the slots to secure it to the frame of my design. It is the perfect shape for my use, plus for the use of putting the baby's bottle parts, small toys, or pacifiers into the dishwasher to disinfect. The lid securely fastens tightly closed. My daughter has found multiple uses for this handy basket. I would purchase this again for any small item that needs to be secured in a dishwasher, too. This dishwasher basket is made of high quality plastic, and is very sturdy.
