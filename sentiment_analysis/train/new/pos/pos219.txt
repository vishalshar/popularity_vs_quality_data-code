I am a first time mom of a 3 month old, and my son would not let me put him down without crying after only a few minutes.  I could not bare to hear him crying when all he wanted was to be held by his Mommy.  My sister suggested getting a carrier to put him in and still be able to get things done around the house.  I was very concerned about purchasing a carrier because I am a full sized Mommy (even after losing my baby weight and then some).  I saw the Infantino and of course I liked the price.  I was still concerned that the carrier would not fit properly so I emailed Infantino with my concerns and one of their representatives called me back the very next day.  She told me she was also a full sized mom and she said she was wearing her carrier as we spoke.  I ordered the carrier and once it arrived, I immediately tried it out.  My son hated it at first.  I think it was too overwhelming for him as he was some what of a little guy (he was 2 months and just under 9 lbs at the time). Now he is a week away from 4 months and he loves it.  He used to cry when he saw me put it on, now he patiently waits for me to put him in it and it fits me perfectly!!!!!  He enjoys going for walks and even likes being on the swings in the park with me.  I certainly recommend this carrier.  It's comfortable, affordable and most importantly adjustable for the not so small parents.
