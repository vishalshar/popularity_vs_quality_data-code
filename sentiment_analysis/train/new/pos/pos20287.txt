Love how the baby is photoshopped on in the first photo! These are much smaller than the picture would suggest, but work great nonetheless. We took the advice to use them on top of the changing table and it really saved us money! We'd have had to buy so many changing pad covers if it weren't for these which catch any mess and can be changed in and out quickly. I place them right under our baby's bottom at a diamond angle. A MUST!suggestion - if poo gets on the pad, pre-wash it in the sink. Like with other items, it won't come off in the wash if it dries on.
