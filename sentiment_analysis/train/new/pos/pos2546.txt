I love how these cups stack and nest, but of the four characters that the cups make, only one set snugly interlocks. The others sit so loosely that it's very difficult for my daughter to stack or nest them because they just fall apart. There are little holes in the top character cups, maybe to shake water out of....but we can't use them for this either because they don't snugly interlock. Oh well....my daughter still loves them.
