I ordered this product despite some reviews of people complaining about a cheap product.  This was well worth the $230 I paid.  True that all the parts aren't labeled but they were very easy to match to the pictures.  The directions were mostly in pics too, but I felt it was pretty clear.  I put this together myself at 7 1/2 months pregnant in about 2 hours.  It is also true that the drawers don't pull out extremely far but this is more a safety feature so that kids can't pull them out and dump the dresser on themselves.  This dresser looks very nice in my nursery and I was able to get all my baby girls clothes into it nicely.  I also had a smaller space for it in the nursery so it works perfect.  If you want a nice heirloom piece, you'll have to spend the money for it, but for the nursery, this was perfect!!!!!!It also arrived timely and was very securely packaged.
