This pattern is dark brown and light blue.We bought one in another pattern about three years ago, and have loved it.  After having thrown it into the wash too many times (many dozens), the clear rubber back has started to separate in small spots from the fabric.The mat is very thin, which I love.  It's waterproof, tear-proof (at least, MY kids have had no luck with tearing any edges), and is so inexpensive that it's easy to replace.It's not really comparable to a vinyl tablecloth; there is no fuzzy stuff on the back.  It's not really comparable to a shower curtain; there is a fabric layer sealed to a thin film of rubbery backing (non-skid, from what I can see on my hard floors).  The fabric is pretty silky, so I wouldn't suggest running through the room over it, or you might slip if in socks or something.It's easy to clean with a cloth, and I've washed mine in the washer many times.  Just hang to dry, and it's dry very quickly.I was so happy to see that they are still selling them years later, so I bought a second one that matches my kitchen so that I didn't have to keep the one that had matched my playroom and had gotten so much use already.I also LOVE that when the kids are done with their 'picnics' in the living room, I can pick it up and shake it off, and then fold it up into a tiny little roll that I keep under my sink (my roll ends up being about the same size as an empty toilet paper roll, but a little longer from the way I've folded mine).You could buy one for your play areas (for things like play-doh), highchairs, crafting spaces (no more paint spills to clean!), or even the car!  I love these!  When someone has a baby shower, they're getting one!So much less expensive than waterproof fabric, prettier than a shower curtain, and much smaller folded than other mats that are out there (and easy to store!!!).
