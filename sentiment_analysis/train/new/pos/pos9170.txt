This is the only pacifier either of my sosn would ever take. They are a necessity in my house! The best is the sanitizing cap for a quick run through the microwave to sanitize. They can be santized that way daily and boiled 1-2x per week.  Highly recommended for moms who are breastfeeding as they seem to mimic the natural nipple more so than other pacifiers I've tried
