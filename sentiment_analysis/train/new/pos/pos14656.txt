It's so hard being a new parent, isn't it?  How many hours have you already researched cribs?  Losing sleep yet?  Well, stop.This is a great crib for around $150.00.  I am an ICU RN, my husband is a safety engineer.  We spent a LOT of time researching cribs.  Please note most negative reviews for this product are for the drop side crib.  That is not this crib.  If you are looking for a safe, cheap baby crib, you have found it.  That's why this crib is a baby bargins winner. What I care about is safety, safety, SAFETY! Who loses sleep over a knick in the wood?  I could careless.  I'm not rich; I need something that will last through 2 babies without breaking the bank.  I've had this crib for 7 months and it still looks great.  My husband assembled it with no problems.  I purchased the Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress to go with it and it fits perfect (best mattress ever if you're struggling with that decision too BTW).  I am very happy with this purchase for the price.  I will use it for baby #2 as well.  Save your money for their college and buy this crib.
