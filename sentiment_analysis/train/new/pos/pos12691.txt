These bibs are very roomy, which I like, and have ample coverage for a toddler.  I really wanted a plain pullover cloth bib without characters on it.  Pullover bibs are not easy to find, and although my 16 month old can pull them off, he doesn't seem to mind having them on as much as the plastic bibs with the velcro fasteners.  Those he pulls off every time.  The neck holes are fairly large on these and they have a good amount of stretch.  They are very soft and wash well.We also have Sesame StreetSesame Street Pullover Bib Set, Boy, 2-Count and Luvable Friends Pullover Feeder Bib, Little Blue Monster and of the three, these are the largest and provide the best coverage.  These are my favorite.
