This item was great.  We have Britax Marathon and it fit well enough for us to cram in a Jumbo size bag of Pampers.  My husband and I (as usual) overpacked, and between lugging the luggage and our squirming toddler, we used both the backpack straps and the wheels.  My husband was able to adjust the straps to fit his large frame and I was able to adjust them to fit my much shorter, petite size.  On the return flight, we checked it and except for a few scratches, it weathered very well.I would definitely recommend this to any parent who will have his/her hands full before, during and after an adventure with a child and the airlines!
