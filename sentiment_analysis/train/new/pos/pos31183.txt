Best nipple ever. I have used Medela Calma & Adiri "breast" mimicking bottles, and a bunch of regular ones, but nothing makes a baby work as hard as this one. (For those of you who don't know why that's a good thing you can do a little research on bottle vs breast and jaw and teeth development etc.) the infant nipples cut down our baby's gas (and consequent fussing) and spit-ups are gone.I didn't buy this bottle for that feature, but that turned out to be such a huge standout I couldn't pass up mentioning it on this review.What I like:The stainless compared to glass or plastic:It doesn't scratch, doesn't get dingey, doesn't retain odor, doesn't break, draws "oohs and aahs", does great in the dishwasher, and lasts and lasts.The bottle size and shape: we have the 11oz bottle: it's more tall and narrow than typical which makes it comfortable for my son to hold while he is in my arms-that way he controls it & takes a break when he wants (again, more closely mimicking a breastfeeding pattern.)The infant nipple: it's silicone, it vents wonderfully, it is very vey slow flow, it does not leak at all, it's fairly soft.Do not like:The inner rim of the cap has a sharpish edge. Not a big deal if you are paying attention, but why not fix it?The bottle needs to be double walled. That's just my preference because if I'm going out I still want warm water for my son's formula.The price of the accessories. Seriously, you want that much for the sleeve?The cap: I'm 50-50. Love the color. Like that I can shake up a bottle and keep my finger on the nipple holes through the cap so there aren't drips. But, I also wish it wasn't so easy to lose and didn't take 2 hands to shimmy onto the bottle cap. If you put a strip of silicone onto the bottle cap that was also attached to the lid so it was "hinged" and wouldn't fall far that would probably create all kinds of warm fuzzies for me.
