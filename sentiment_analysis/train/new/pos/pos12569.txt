We purchased this item a couple of years ago and still use it on occasion. Interestingly enough, it has been in the back of my truck for a year for those 'just in case' moments. I like the fact it is easy to fold up and shove in the car. Unlike the huge strollers, this unit is not bulky or heavy. However, with both kids in the seat, it tends to get a little challenging to push around. the front wheels don't like to cooperate all the time. Also, the width of the handles makes it a little odd for grasping. You will find yourself switching handles often. It is harder to maneuver when holding the middle handle. Problem is, it feels like the right place to grasp. Its a catch 22. Even with these little concerns, buy it. You won't be disappointed. Make sure you buckle your kids in with the harness. We were at an event in town and a car started to back up. I jerked the stroller backward and my kid came flying out. I got behind the car and beat a dent in his trunk getting him to stop. Luckily everyone was ok. Baby just got a scratch on her face. However, daddy learned to buckle them in not matter how short the trip!!! Hope this helps.
