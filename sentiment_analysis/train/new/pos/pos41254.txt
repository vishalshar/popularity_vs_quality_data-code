Best. Idea. Ever. My son LOVES stuffed animals. And they were everywhere. I mean everywhere! What an amazing way to store them and give my son a great little reading spot, too. This is still one of my favorite Amazon purchases ever. I totally want to buy another one for my girls, but they are more into dolls then stuffed animals, so I don't think they'd be nearly as comfortable to sit on! :)
