I bought these Evenflo bottles and later the 8-ounce bottles for my own daughters 22 years ago.  At the time, I had no dishwasher, and liked the glass bottles because I could boil them in a pan on the stove to sterilize them.  I always felt assured that my girls were drinking from clean bottles.  Since then the concern about bpa in plastics has made me wonder what other chemicals will come to light in the future as a health concern.  Over recent years, I have cut down on my use of plastic and gone back to glass for food items whenever possible.  My daughter is taking no chances with the health of her baby either so we both feel good about these Evenflo bottles.  I actually later found them for less money in Walmart, but these came quickly with free shipping so I didn't mind the price, especially as they are cheaper than other "plastic bottle systems" that I have seen.By the way, one of the other reviewers said that these bottles did not come with rings.  i believe that if she were to first screw the cap onto the bottle, then pull straight up on the cap (with no twisting motion) that she  would find the ring had been inside the cap and now will be screwed onto the bottle.
