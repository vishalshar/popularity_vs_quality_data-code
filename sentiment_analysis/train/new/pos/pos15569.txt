I didn't want to spend a fortune on a breast pump since I only used it 3-5 times per week.  I nursed but needed to pump occasionally while I worked part-time or for babysitting.  This fit the bill.  I liked that it had a battery option for when I was traveling/camping.  The padding was comfortable on the breast.  It is easy to hold.  I preferred pumping manually though b/c I could do it faster/with more umph.  My hand would only get tired if let-down didn't start right away, but otherwise it was fine; the manual handle/lever is comfortable.  It is so handy to pump right into a bottle that I can screw on a lid or nipple and use w/o pouring into another container.  I tried to put a freezer bag on it, but that didn't work (no fault of the pump) so I just poured into the bag if I needed to.  The parts were fairly easy to clean and reassemble.  No tubing to deal with.  I used it in my car a lot under a nursing shawl and stored it with the milk in an insulated lunch bag with blue ice until I got home.
