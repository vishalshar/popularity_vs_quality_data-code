These door guards are great for what they are. I have a three year old who loves to slam doors in her one year old sister's face. The guards are easy to put in place, and they hold the door firmly and absolutely stay on despite regular and repeated slamming attempts.The big challenges for us: we find that we have to take them off pretty regularly (for example, to close the bathroom door or the door to the baby's room when she goes to sleep). After they are removed from the door, they are pretty easily swiped by little ones as toys or otherwise misplaced. The colors are a little less bright than the picture would suggest, but the foam guards are otherwise exactly as pictured and so overall a very good product.
