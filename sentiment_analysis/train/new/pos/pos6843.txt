It was easy to install in the car. Very easy to adjust the height of the seat and the belts. The belts don't twist. It has three position recline. I had a older car seat of the same brand, used to recline even more. But this one doesn't recline that much. It looks great, my baby is very comfortable in it. It's a good car seat for the price.
