I really try to find as many products for my baby son that are made in the USA as possible and I was really happy to find these.  You never know what chemicals are in products made in China, especially plastics.They are a great size for feeding a baby.  I saw some reviews complaining about size and I was a little worried, but they must have ordered these spoons thinking they were for an adult or older child instead of for feeding a baby.We ordered a second pack as we were sometimes running out before we had to run dishes normally (pretty much daily since we had our baby).  Our son loves stealing spoons while we are feeding him, playing with them, and then dropping them on the floor.
