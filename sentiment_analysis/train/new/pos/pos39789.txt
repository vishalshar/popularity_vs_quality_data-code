My daughter in law had a very well known baby carrier before but after using it with her first child had some issues, so she tried out her friends Infantino for a few days and really liked it. She found that the Infantino Balance was actually more popular with moms and dads who have had a baby before and have had used the well known carrier the first time around. She and my son both recommend the Infantino over the others they've either tried or had heard about. Apparently it supports the baby better and is more comfortable for both baby and parents.
