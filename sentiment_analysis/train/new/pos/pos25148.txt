I bought this for my second baby. My first I had Itzbeen, which I loved, but when I was searching to buy another Itzbeen, I stumbled across the Onaroo, and I'm SO glad I did. This tracks everything from feedings and diaper changes to medicines and growth. Then not only that, you can transfer all the data onto the computer and print out reports of it all. I find it very interesting to track my babies habits. You just have to remember to change the batteries when it starts giving you warnings to, I learnt that the hard way and lost my initial entries. Other than that, I love it, and seriously, I have it with me where ever I go. One other unexpected bonus, it comes with amazing customer support! I really strongly recommend this product to anyone with a newborn/s (it can track more than one baby!) - even my husband thinks its pretty cool! I just wish I'd had it for my first so I could of compared my two boys.
