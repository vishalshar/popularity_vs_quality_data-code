Very cute print and easy to put on the mattress. Some of the cribsheets I've tried have been so tight that I've actually ripped them trying to get them on the crib mattress. This one is big enough to easily get on the mattress, but tight enough that you don't have to worry about the excess fabric suffocating your child.
