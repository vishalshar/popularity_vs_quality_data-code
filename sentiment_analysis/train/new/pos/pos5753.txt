We used this monitor daily for nearly two years before it suddenly gave up the ghost. During its two years of life, we really liked it. When it came time to move my baby to his own room at six months, I really panicked. I'm a worrier, and to not be able to check on him throughout the night was a little unnerving for me (our floors are VERY creaky and our baby doesn't sleep super soundly, so going into his room to check on him is not an option). This monitor saved the day!The camera was easy to mount on my baby's wall, and having it just above the crib gave us the perfect angle. With the large screen, I can see him breathing at all times. Yes, the monitor is big and boxy. But for me, it was worth it to have such a large screen (versus the monitors that only give you a couple inches of viewing space). Despite its size, we had no problem moving it to different spots around the house depending on where we'd be while he's sleeping. We also took it on many trips with us.At the time we purchased the monitor, it was almost the least expensive option on Amazon. It appears the price has gone up significantly, however. When ours broke, we didn't purchase this one again. Summer sells another monitor with a screen that's almost as big, and it costs less. The other model is also flat, easy to carry around, and doesn't need to be plugged in to work (which is one flaw with the Day & Night model).
