My daughter is breastfed and has rejected every bottle on the planet.  Going back to work has been incredibly stressful.  She would go all day without eating and feedings were a huge struggle.Someone recommended this as an option. She latched and took 2 ounces the first try.I almost cried I was so relieved.
