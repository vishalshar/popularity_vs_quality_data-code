I has ASD- Autism Spectrum Disorder and am high functioning. I use these to chew on to use as an alternative to other more destructive things i could be chewing on. It especially helps when I'm having a meltdown and when I suffer from self harm when I'm out of control. Very well made as the material is thick enough where I can seriously chew on it very hard with no damage done... I wanted to review this to show the Razbaby has other uses other than just for teething babies.
