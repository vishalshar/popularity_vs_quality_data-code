This product is so adorable and well made. I love the champagne design. It looks classy and doesn't cost a fortune. I put my little baby in it at my kids' baseball games and she is so happy. I get to watch and have my hands free to take video, clap, etc. I would highly recommend this item and plan to buy one for my friend who is expecting.
