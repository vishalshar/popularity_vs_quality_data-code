Awesome product!!! We switched to the Comotomo bottle and haven't looked back since -  a lifesaver for our 3 month old daughter that is breastfed in the evenings and on weekends and receives 3-4 bottle feedings during the day while I am at work.She has been able to switch back and forth between breast and bottle with zero frustration or confusion.We were using the Playtex nurser bottles, but she developed some confusion and would get frustrated during nursing.We ordered the 5oz with slow flow nipple to start with and have since ordered 2 more of the larger size with the faster flow nipples.The bottle is incredibly soft and closely mimics breastfeeding as the wide base design helps her maintain a proper latch everytime.Just be mindful of where you set the bottle down, as it tends to be knocked over easily.We also purchased the Kinde Kozi bottle warmer and the Comotomo fits perfectly!
