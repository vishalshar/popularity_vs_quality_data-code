BOUNCES BY ITESLF.  In the world of baby gadgets, this features alone makes it a 10!  Before I bought this, I had developed the automatic foot that bounced the bouncy seat.  No need for that!  Baby loves this bouncy seat.WORKS BETTER FOR OLDER BABIES, NOT NEWBORNS.  This is simply because the way the seat is designed I was constantly worried about her head tilting down.  I ended up putting a little blanket behind her back and that seemed to work, but then I always worry about adding anything to a manufacturer's design because of safety reasons.  Since about 2 months this has been my go-to bouncy seat with no blankets needed.SOFT FABRIC.  I mean SO SOFT I wish I could jump in myself and take a nap.  It looks and feels like the lap of luxury.  Compared to other baby gadgets, the material is of a far superior quality.
