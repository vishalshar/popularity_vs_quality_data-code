If I had known about these when starting to cloth diaper they would have made up the majority of my stash. They are great and here's why:*SUPER soft and gentle inside and out.*About as trim as a disposable, in fact the trimmest cloth diaper I've seen.*Do not require laborious prepping.*Easy to wash, and dry as fast as a pocket diaper. Not too many AIO's can make that claim.*Great vibrant color choices.*Absorbant, and you can get an additional snap-in booster if you need it.I also like that this is a sized diaper- my baby is so petite (5th percentile) that she doesn't need a diaper to go up into big weight ranges, it's just unnecessary bulk (but the Itti Bitti Tutto is a one size option for those who want it).I STRONGLY suggest watching the Itti Bitti videos on YouTube because they explain how to put on the diaper. I think people wrongly assume the diaper is too small because they don't know how to put it on for the best fit. It's meant to be snug and ride higher on the hips.I love this diaper, I only wish I'd heard of it sooner.
