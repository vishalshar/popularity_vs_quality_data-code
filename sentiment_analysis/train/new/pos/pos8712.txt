My three-month-old adores looking at herself in this mirror attached to her crib. When I need a few minutes to get things done, I put her in her bed and she occupies herself "talking" to her image for a good 5-10 minutes. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because it came with a ripped seam in back but that does not affect its functionality.
