So I bought this dresser not to use in a baby room but in a guest room. I totally love! It's pretty tall the draws are okay and the quality is pretty good for the price. The delivery was great no problem or scratches. The only thing is the parts weren't labeled and there is a ton of screws. I had to invest in a drill because my hand hurt and couldn't finish. Great and simple dresser.
