I've been using this shield for 8 months now due to latch problems.  This is the absolute only shield my baby will use!  After the dog got a hold of the one the hospital gave me when my daughter was about 2 months old, I had to scramble to find another to get her to eat. After trying the Medela, Tommee Tippee, and Philips AVENT shields with absolutely no success, I ordered several of these on rush.  I now have 4 on hand and have note had any more problems related to breastfeeding.I'm not entirely convinced that the reason she wouldn't use the others was just because that's what she's used to.  The Medela and AVENT shields were almost identical, with a more rounded tip and the plastic was much thicker and less pliable.  The Tommee Tippee has these weird little holes in the side that are supposed to be "better for airflow" but I just found them to be uncomfortable for both me and my daughter.  Unfortunately that was the one that was closest to the Ameda and what we ended up using while we waited for our shipment, but my daughter ended up with a red/sore tongue and I ended up with red/sore nipples because of those helpful little holes.
