Ok, so I know there is a TON of controversy surrounding a person's decision to use or not to use the bed bumpers in baby sets. Personally, I have decided to add this beautiful bumper to our son's bed simply because it seemed so cold/sterile without it.  I didn't like the idea of the bars being what he saw when he woke up each morning.  Far better for him to rise to his forest friends!  AND...what a friendly bunch these characters turned out to be.  Their faces are all so adorably inviting and the neutral calm colors are perfect for a boy OR a girl.  After speaking with numerous moms (including my own who I trust wholeheartedly) and following the installation instructions PERFECTLY, I feel my personal decision was the right one for my family.  Again, I totally respect other people's choice to leave off the bumper.  The best thing about this life is all the differences of opinions out there.  I celebrate these differences daily!
