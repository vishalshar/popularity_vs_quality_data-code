I used to be a professional babyproofer, so I just purchaed these for a friend's baby shower. If these are the same latches that used to be manufactured by Tot Lok by Rev a Shelf,then they are the best, most effective latch you can buy. Be fair warned, they are not for the average weekend warrior to install because they must be very precise and require special skills. I found that even cabinet guys and contractors hated to install these, but they are definitely worth hiring a professional to install them. A trick i used to tell my clients is to put the magnetic key high up on the corner of a wall because most drywall will have a metal strip on the corners. You can also keep the one in the kitchen high up on your refridgerator. If these sre the same product I used in the 90's , when I safety tested them, the cabinet broke before the safetly latch! Another convenient feature these have is a red plastic piece that lets you deactivate them. I would definetly advise having a few extra magnetic keys because these are so strong, a regular magnet will not open them. Best wishes with your new bundle of inquisitive joyðŸ˜ŠT
