I bought 30 of these batteries 5 years ago for use in window candles which we use for 5 months in the fall and winter seasons.  10 candles - each candle takes 3 “C” batteries.  NONE of these batteries has failed after 5 years of use.  Operating the LED candles every day for 6 hours a day, the charge lasts about 2 weeks.  (Alkalines last about 3 weeks, but I have saved hundreds of dollars by recharging these batteries.)  I use a Maha MH-C808M charging station which has a “Conditioning” setting.  I always use the conditioning setting which completely discharges the battery and then fully charges them.  The Maha "Conditioning" cycle takes about 16 hours.  The Maha standard charging cycle is shorter, but I think it is worth the extra time to recondition the batteries each time as they seem to last longer.
