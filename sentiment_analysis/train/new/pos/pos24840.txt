Great bottles and I had no idea how time consuming other bottles were. Babies are exhausting. So why not simply things when you can? I regret not getting these bottles sooner. The drop-in liners are so nice.  I exclusively breastfed for my babies first year and my baby had no trouble transitioning fromBottle to breast and vice versa. I found peace in knowing that even though I wasn't always there for each feeding that my baby was still able to eat without any problems.  I feel like the design of this bottle also helped reduced the possibility of him swallowing air. I can't say enough good things about these bottles. They are wonderful.
