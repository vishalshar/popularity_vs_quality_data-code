Very sturdy and well made diaper bag.  Plenty of space and pockets.  I love that the diapering section is completely separate from the rest of the bag, though I don't fully understand the purpose for the velcro on the changing mat.  This is my 3rd diaper bag.  My first JJ Cole fell to pieces in under 2 years of use.  My second is too big, and doesn't have enough pockets.  This one is the perfect size and I love the backpack option.  Some say the backpack straps fall off your shoulders easily, but I haven't had that problem at all.  My only complaint would be that the zippers seem to go the wrong direction for a right handed person, but I can deal with that.  Overall, fabulous bag.  I am very pleased!
