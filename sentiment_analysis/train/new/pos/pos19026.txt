I bought this pump because I wasn't sure if I was going to breast feed. I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a pump and end up not using it. So the price was what made me choose this pump. This pump works great for occasional pumping. The motor is very loud! That is my biggest complaint about it. And sometimes I have to take all the pieces apart because the air flow gets clogged. It happens every other use, can become annoying. You have all your parts put together then start to pump and its not enough air. So that can be a pain. All the attachments are great, there are pieces for every type of bottle.Its a good buy for the price but if I knew I was going to pumping this much probably would have gone with something more quiet.
