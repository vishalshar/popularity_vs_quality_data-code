We really only needed a crib, but couldn't pass up this value. The entire set of 3 items was about the same price as a single crib, so we went with this. The cherry looks beautiful. We have only used the crib (other items still in the box), but it has held up great for 2+ years. We have a few scratches and dings on from normal wear and tear, but purchased flannel rail guards during the teething stage so we have no bite marks anywhere on it.  Much higher quality than you would expect for the price and very very sturdy and solid. Our 2 year old likes to jump and bounce around in the crib in the morning and it has held up great. The fact that it comes with the toddler rail is another good bonus because those are often sold separately at an additional cost. Also love that it is made from sustainable wood and without harsh chemicals!
