Love these for what we call 'Irish showers' for baby girl - when you don't have time for a bath but need some freshening up. Not heavily scented but are great to wipe down the face and neck if baby has been spitting up or sweaty. Only four stars because they sometimes come out of package in multiples as they are golden in thirds then in half inside pouch. No issues with them drying out or causing irritation on baby skin.
