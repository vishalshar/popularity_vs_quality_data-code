When I first started cloth diapering, it was all just a little overwhelming; the sprayer, the wetbag, the dry bucket, the deodorizer and the list went on and on. None of these were necessities, mind you, but they do make the life of a cloth diapering mama (and dad) run a lot more smoothly. It wasn't until I had been doing it for awhile that I stopped to realize that there was no reason to be using disposable wipes when I didn't have a disposable diaper in which I could easily throw them away. I had been putting them in a disposable Fresh Sack but then it hit me that I'd ignored the most simple accessory; cloth wipes!When we had H, the hospital used cloth wipes and it was a lot easier to get that sticky meconium off with a real cloth that had warm water on it, than with a disposable wipe.There are a ton of 'recipes' for home-made wipes solution, you can buy ready-made solution like bumGenius Bottom Cleaner 4oz or California Baby Non-Burning & Calming Diaper Area Wash (6.5 oz), or you can turn on your tap and use plain old water. The possibilities will fit any budget and it's just one more way that you can streamline your process.The wipes I picked first are the Imse Vimse Unbleached Flannel Cloth Wipes (12 count), they are an unbleached organic flannel and are so so soft. While they are a little smaller than standard wipes, they get the job done and wash and dry well.I still pack disposable wipes in the diaper bag (throw them away with a biodegradable bag) and use them to clean hands and faces after lunch at the park or other outings, but I'm hoping that through this cloth diapering journey, I'll continue to streamline the process so that it's all ready to go for baby #3 (after C is potty trained, of course!)
