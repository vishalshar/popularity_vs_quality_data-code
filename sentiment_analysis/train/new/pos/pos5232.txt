I like the bra, it serves the purpose - it really helps me be hands free while I pump, and this is huge to have an extra 15 minutes for a new mom. I was able to read a book and even activate my credit card over the phone while pumping at home. However, I give this product only 4 stars because it has two large holes but nothing to cover them with. Since I had to pump at work, I just put two nursing reusable pads under. However, it was not comfortable as I was always concerned about pads not slipping off. It would be nice to have some product that would allow to use it like regular bra. Also I am petite and have size A, for larger size women it may not be as comfortable (no support underneath either).
