Love this bag! Just wish the inside had zippers instead of a single button.Has one insulated bottle pocket and one non insulated bottle pocket.  And it also comes with a detachable insulated bottle bag.  The large back side pocket is perfect for those foldable diaper changing pads that carry diapers and whipes.  The inside has two small pockets where I can fit 6 disposable diapers in one and a breast feeding cover and toys in another. On the opposite wall is a big pocket that spans the whole length and I keep a change of clothes.  I love the small detachable pocket where I keep smaller items like socks, beanie, teether etc.  the two front pockets are perfect mommy pockets.  Also comes with clips that hang on to the stroller and differ t components for different stroller handle types.  These hooks weren't the best and kept falling not off.  Lost one completely so I'm going to by differ t ones.  But the cool thing is that the bag comes with two hoops made for these type of hooks. The strap doesn't come with a cushion and I almost bought one but it ended up not bothering me.  I had tried on the backpack style diaper bag but this messenger style diaper bag ended up working out better for me.  One swoop and it's on my shoulder. Sounds silly but it makes a difference.
