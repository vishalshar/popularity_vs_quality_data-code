These are the cups that we recommend to absolutely everyone.  We decided not to use a sippy cup with our toddler, and went straight to a straw at 7 months.  At first, we used a more expensive cup with a silicone straw, which he took to well, but it was impossible to clean and, after being thrown on the floor a million times (duh, toddler), it started to leak.Take n toss cups go in the dishwasher, don't leak if they're upright, and are so cheap that I don't mind when daycare destroys them or we lose them on a flight.  You do have to make sure to add the straw after putting on the lid, or you'll get a surprise fountain of liquid shooting out.  If only my kid hadn't figured out how to pull out the straw and shake it like a salt shaker, we'd be golden.
