I ordered this chest for my 3-year-old's bedroom. As expected, the pieces are made of particle board and has plastic dowels and gliders, but this seems like a well-made, sturdy piece of furniture. It looks great in her bedroom. It came with a simple anti-tip bracket which I would recommend using, as without it the piece seems a bit unsteady. It did take several hours to assemble on my own, but instructions were simple, easy to follow, and included illustrations.I would've given five stars, however on all four of the drawers, the holes did not line up properly with the adjacent hardware, making it quite tedious to get the screws through. If not for that, assembly would've taken much less time.Overall, a beautiful, sturdy piece of furniture which I would purchase again.
