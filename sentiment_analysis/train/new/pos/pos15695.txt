So glad I found these! Even the nipples are great. My last baby used Tommee Tippee and I like these bottles so much better. They clean up quick. No yellow milk stains or left over smell from forgotten milk. They are heavy but so far that is not a problem. I have stained concrete floors and I do not use a cover on these. In the 5 months I have used glass bottles I have not broken one.Just a word of caution if you use a bottle warmer and normally use plastic bottles. The milk warms up FAST in glass, and if you are not careful the milk will continue to heat after you remove the bottle. This comes from the glass staying so hot. I have burned my fingers on the glass when I was heating a large bottle.Overall this is a great option if you want to use the bottle for siblings.
