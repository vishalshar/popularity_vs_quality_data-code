Our baby loved this mobile.  The "wave" mechanism was a little noisy, but not unreasonably so.  The baby would often pull at the dangling animals, but they were attached in a way that they would release easily - great for baby safety!The choice of three songs and nature sounds is great, and the remote control to stop or restart the music comes in handy while nursing or rocking the baby to sleep.The best feature of this mobile is that you can detach the mobile arms and keep the music box on the crib even after the baby outgrows the mobile.  When our little guy wakes up, he lets us know by pushing the buttons and playing some music!The reason I'm giving this mobile 4 stars instead of 5 is that this mobile is difficult to mount.  It has a lip at the top of the back that is meant to "hook" over the edge of the crib, but it doesn't fit the edge of our crib.  It is mounted with a plastic nut that screws onto a large plastic bolt that sticks from the back of the battery cover.  It was hard to tighten and often slips down, which can be a safety concern once the baby starts pulling up.
