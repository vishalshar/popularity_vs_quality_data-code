My husband put this together for me the day it arrived (and he felt it was very easy to put together).  I have a daughter that just turned 3, and it was kind of a birthday present for her, but also for me!  She tends to, as many children do, pull most of the books off of her shelf looking for that one book she wants.  So, I wanted to do what we do at the preschools and display a few and then put the rest away to rotate in and out of the displayed books.  This is working wonderfully!  She does not pull all of the books off, and is able to replace the books she does take out.  It looks great(I really like the color of the 'wood'), and it holds and displays her books well.  She has about 20 books (think: picture books) at a time in it!I wasn't sure I was going to like the canvas shelves, but: (1) I do!  They are very versatile, and easy to pull out and put back in, great for kids younger than 5 or 6! (2) you can leave the shelves off and use the cubbies without them.The structure of this is also sturdy and heavier than I would have thought.  The unit itself isn't "heavy" at about 40 pounds, but it is heavy enough I'm not worried about it getting wobbly or falling over or anything.  Note: Some of the dowel rods that hold up the canvas "pouches" for the books are slightly small for the space.  This makes sense, as they can't be too large, and they don't need to be super tight.  Just be careful not to tighten the smaller ones too tightly so that your wood doesn't bend funky. (Tip from my husband.)  They are probably 1/16 to 1/8" smaller, so not significant.  Does not bother us at all.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would purchase again, and would suggest to another mom (or preschool teacher)!
