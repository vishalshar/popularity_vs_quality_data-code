The cup holder was bigger than I expected and it is a substantial addition to the pram. Following another reviewers instructions we easily managed to attach it to the pram handle though. We have a large pram with foam covered handle bar and the fittings were sufficiently big to go around it. The design allows that the cup holder part can be rotated 360degrees by the press of a button once attached - this allows you to attach it on horizontal or vertical handles and still have the holder facing the right way up. The position of the holder remains locked in place until manually rotated through the use of the button - i.e it does not swing to upright with the movement of pram. Thew size is ideal for very tall drinks containers and does not work so well with shorter cups of coffee in paper cups. Insulated tumblers with leak free lids and soda bottles fit best. The container for the drink needs to be somewhat sturdy because the 'prongs' of plastic in the base of the holder are fairly stiff and some pressure needs to be applied to fit the drink in. The pressing of the drink into the holder can also cause the attachment to slip around the handle a little - but using two hands can prevent this. Overall a good buy, biggest limitation is size of drink needed - Irish drink sizes are not as large as US drink sizes!
