We just received the Natural Mat Coco Mat in the mail and could not be happier so far. I was a little nervous because other reviewers had complained of the size being smaller than the specified 28x52 inches. We plopped the mattress into our Oeuf Sparrow Crib, which called for a 28x52 inch mattress and it fit perfectly!I spent a lot of time researching the best mattress for quality, health (materials, chemicals that could be of concern, and types of flame retardants), and company integrity. I was torn between mattresses from the following companies: the Moonlight Slumber (Little Dreamer), Naturepedic, and Colgate. My reasons for ruling out mattresses from the aforementioned companies were:Moonlight Slumber: Although the have stellar reviews the mattress is foam, which is made from polyurethane (petroleum-based) foam. They use chemicals of concern (boric acid as a flame retardant, which can cause eye and lung irritation) and use antibacterial chemicals.Naturepedic: Looks to provide a great natural/organic mattress, however a few of the reviews reported the mattress sagging in the middle.Colgate: Their mattresses look great at first glance and have good reviews; however, their mattresses contain polyurethane  and vinyl (which is made with toxic chemicals at every stage that have been know to cause cancer, trigger allergies and asthma, along with a whole litany of other health issues).The Natural Mat Coco Mat mattress was perfect because it is made from a natural coir (fiber made from coconut husks), lambswool (a nature flame retardant without all the chemicals, and organic cotton. The only downside would be if you or your baby have an allergen to wool or the natural latex, which is used to bind the coir fiber. The other con is that it is not waterproof, but I am planning to get a mattress cover, which you would for the other mattresses as well.Yes, this mattress is a little more expensive then a lot of options, but when I took into account that the baby would be spending the majority of their time on it, I want to give my baby the healthiest environment possible and this mattress was/is worth the investment.
