We have used it for our baby for 6 months now, and it still works great. I wished he enjoyed it now as much as before, but hell take a bite once in a while.Please note that we do not place it in the freezer. We keep it in the fridge. then, when chilled, we give it to him. no leaks, bursting, and no problems so far. I am a bit shocked to see the reviews, as it seems bursting has been an issue with some people here. -Not in our case, and our son is quite an active, and strong little creature.
