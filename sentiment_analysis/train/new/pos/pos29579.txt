I bought my first Safety first car seat about 3 years ago, my little girl finally grew out of it but it still looks new, so i knew what kind of seat to buy already had to be a safety first one. We looked at a million of them it seemed like every shape and color known to man, we finally decided on the Safety 1st Summit Car Seat Victorian Lace and my little girl loves it plenty of room cup holders work good and all and all just a good product. I would suggest anyone to buy this product.
