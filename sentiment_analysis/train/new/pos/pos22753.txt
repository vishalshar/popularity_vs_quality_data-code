We use this in multiple places and multiple things. I also love the fact that the horn is separate so when my Lil guy no longer needs it we can deflate it. It fits perfectly in our single sink so my back gets a rest. Not to mention how easy it is to deflate and blow up makes it great for travel. Will be buying this for baby shower gifts.
