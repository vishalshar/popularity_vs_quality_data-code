I got these to use as toppers for my daughter's birthday cake. They were really adorable, although we only used two because you can't have three Dora figures on the cake. (I wish they would have done four different characters...) They work well as bathtub toys, but it is a little difficult to get all of the water out of them. This basically means that they have a limited lifespan because if you can't get all of the water out, you will eventually end up with a slimy mold on the inside. But, this is a problem with most squirt toys since the majority of them can't be opened to clean the inside. Overall, still very cute.
