My baby girl loves this toy! She loves to chew the crinkly wings. She got this toy when she was about 4 months old and really didn't take to it until she was a little older (she's 6 months now and still likes it). It isn't anything special and I kind of don't like that it can get caught around her wrist, it's loose enough that it doesn't hurt her, just frustrates her because she doesn't know how to get it off. For the price it's a good diaper bag toy, washes well and has enough to it to keep her entertained for a bit.
