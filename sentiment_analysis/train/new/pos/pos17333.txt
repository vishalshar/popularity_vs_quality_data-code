My son absolutely loved his backpack I rate this item 5 stars because its just a perfect size backpack that my son can take to sleepover his grandparents house or take with him when we go out to the stores he usually fills his bag with toys, snacks, and his video game not only did my 5 year old son loved it but also my 2 year old son every time he sees it he yells out Batman Batman with such excitement.
