Watching my 14 month old play I came to the realization that he seems to enjoy simpler toys as opposed to the complicated, battery operated, noisy electronic ones.  I think he enjoys making things happen himself instead of pushing a button and having lights and music go off.  Thus I began my search for more battery and button free toys to spark his imagination.  I thought little musical instruments would be perfect.  I didn't want to spend too much money on something since I'm never really sure what he's going to love.That leads me to this little set.  After reading the reviews, I was very intrigued.  Upon receiving this set it seems to be very well made.  The shape is easy to hold and play for a small child.  I also don't seen any pieces that could easily break off, a plus with a kid who puts everything in his mouth.  I also noticed on the box that it is made in Israel; for once something that's not from China.  The noise makers are pleasant sounding, not too loud.  Besides, I'd rather hear the tinkling of bells or jingling of a tambourine over the repetitive tunes that come out of half of the other toys he has.Glad I bought these little guys!  The toddler is enjoying them and even my four year old niece seemed to like them too.
