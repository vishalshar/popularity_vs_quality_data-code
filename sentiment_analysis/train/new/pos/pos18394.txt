We just got this stroller a couple of days ago and with a couple of trial runs, it seems great overall.  Very light and seemingly strong and well-built.  It is very easy to push on most surfaces; as good as or slightly better than our regular stroller on smooth surfaces and much much better on uneven ones such as woodland trails.  It is also easy to jog with. It was very easy/quick to put together, although some of the steps in the instructions were unnecessary because they were already done, which may confuse some people.  It folds up easily and fits in the trunk if the front wheel is taken off, which is not as easy as 'regular' strollers, but then again, this is no regular stroller.A couple of complaints: While the seat is sort of like a hammock in some respects, it would be nice if it would go just a little more upright and be more of a molded and padded seat to hold the child in place better and pad them for bumps on trails.  (There is a hand-washable fleece seat-cover type of thing that can be purchased for about $50, but whomever thought that a hand-washable-only seat was a good idea for something for a child oughtta have their head examined.  Also, fleece might be fine for more northern climes, but for Florida it is not a viable option.)  Also, this stroller is a little 'tippy', both sideways and backwards.  The easy backwards tipping makes for easy turning, but takes a little bit to get used to.  The sideways tippyness is not any sort of a safety hazard on smooth surfaces, but I had to be careful maneuvering over some large roots on a trail not to tip it sideways.Overall this is a very good product and I would highly recommend it to others as long as their child is old enough and big enough for the seat; I'm thinking about 18 months and 30+ lbs.
