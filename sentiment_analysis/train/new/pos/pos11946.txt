I bought these for my (at the time) 2 month old daughter who was just starting to focus on things, though mainly I got them because they are adorable and I'm a sucker for Dragons.  From the first day I put them up at about adult eye level (or "walk into level" as my husband likes to point out), they have been her favorite.  At 3 months old now, she LOVES to watch them from her crib and changing table and her dad and I blow on them to make them dance for her.  At night, when we are getting her ready for bed, we will hold her up to them and she "talks" to them as part of her good night ritual, and I expect that she will enjoy them for many years to come.  I am super pleased with my purchase, even if I have to share!Update at 6 months: watching chubby hands reach for these is adorable.  Still a big hit.Very easy to assemble, though one of mine had a small chip in it.  Highly recommend them!Update per question: I have these looped over the ceiling lamp's light pull, though a plant hook off the ceiling or a standard crib mobile holder (several available here on Amazon) would work fine.
