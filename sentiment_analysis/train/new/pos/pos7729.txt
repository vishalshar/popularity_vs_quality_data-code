Bought this when my baby was three months old. She'd had a screaming fit in the car as I was running errands. Some googling made me realize that I needed shades for the back car windows and a soft toy for her to play with in her car seat. I like that I can arrange the spiral of toys in a number of dangling configurations ( especially with the side of a toy- saver strap to keep it attached). There are many textures and colors to keep the baby occupied. My kid loves the cellophane crinkle in the lion's mane and the wriggly spiral of a tail on the cat. Now that she's teething at 6 months she especially likes the plastic rings. I sometimes dangle the toy in her playpen too. You can throw the whole thing in the washing machine and put it out to air dry overnight. The construction is high quality. My only complaint is that after a few months the toy has faded a little in the wash.
