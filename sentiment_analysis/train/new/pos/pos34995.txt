This is perfect for a toddler that has just moved from a highchair to a booster at a table.  We put the smooth part touching the table and the bumpy part on top. It keeps bowls and plates from sliding around, but doesn't suction to the place mat like others do. I like this better because then she can tip the bowl to get cereal out, etc. The place mat also doesn't slide around (we have a wood table). Very easy to clean; just throw it in the top rack of the dishwasher. Definitely worth what we paid.
