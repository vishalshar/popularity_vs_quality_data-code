These are wonderful! Perfect size for my 7 m/o, easy to hold and easy placement specifically where she wants to bite down. I'm super impressed and definitely recommend over teething "rings". Need to supervise as she has tried to put the handle part in her mouth which is longer and the guard won't stop that end from gagging.
