I got 3 of these based on the product pictures and the price. They look much more expensive than they actually are and the recipients loved them!This is not a solid silver bank like Tiffany's or the more crazy expensive ones, it is a ceramic bank (meaning if you drop it, it will break), with silver paint coating on it.The circular box is 7.5 D x 7 H, and the bear fills it up, it seems bigger than the product description.The packaging is really cute and adds a nice touch - just put it in a gift bag and add a card and you are set!Definitely a great value and at the price easy to stock up on if you have birthdays, baby showers, christenings, etc. throughout the year!
