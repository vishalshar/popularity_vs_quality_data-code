Thank God for these nipples.  Let me tell you, we had a heck of a time trying to get our breastfed baby to take the bottle. The medela "slow" flow nipple was like trying to feed the baby with a super soaker water gun and most of my hard-pumped milk would end up on his outfit. Not to mention, I felt like it was an aspiration risk. We tried the Playtex slow nipple but he would get frustrated and cry. The Playtex fast nipple is appropriately named and was also too fast for my 12 week old. Maybe in a couple more months. The medium nipple was just right. Now he will take a bottle and I don't have to worry about him starving when i am at work. Additionally he goes right back to the breast no problem when i get home. Life is good thanks to this product.
