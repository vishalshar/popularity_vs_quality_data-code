After reading the mixed reviews here, I wasn't sure about buying this (or any) car seat travel bag, but I eventually decided to take my chances. I'm so glad I did! This bag stood up beautifully to a recent cross-country plane trip (a two-way trip with a transfer each way--so basically 4 opportunities for it to get beaten up by baggage handlers). The bag made it home unscathed, and so did our car seat.We have the Britax Frontier Clicktight Combination Harness-2-Booster Car Seat - Vibe, and it fit perfectly in this bag. It wheeled very easily through the airport (my 4-year-old was able to pull it from baggage claim to the rental car), and it's nice to also have the option of carrying it as a backpack.
