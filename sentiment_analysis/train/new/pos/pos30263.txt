What a neat idea! I got this for my grandson who is 15 months old. While out and about to places such as the park, the zoo, picnics, family pool parties, etc we needed to get him to drink more water. But he always wants mom's drink. What an awesome solution! Now I screw this sippy top onto a water bottle and he has his own to drink from! When he's done, unscrew and toss the bottle. One tip though, I do not recommend this for inside the house or in the car. It does leak out when tipped sideways. Much more appropriate for toddlers and up than infants.
