I ordered this for granddaughter's first birthday.  When it arrived I went through it to check if there was anything lose or dangerous because, in my experience, if it's possible baby will find it.  Great job there.  Next, I checked on durability; because if became her favorite book I didn't want it wearing out quickly.  Another great job.  Then the story.  It is simply peek-a-boo whith characters which is VERY engaging to a new one-year-old.  This is a little more expensive than some of the other cloth books out there but I think it more than makes up for that with quality.
