Our child did not like to take car rides.  We originally had a plain Brica Mirror, which worked great, but she seemed to get scared of seeing herself in the large mirror.  She would cry during every car ride and sometimes it would get to the point of her choking on saliva and us having to pull over and calm her down.  She was also colicy, which may have been another reason she didn't like the ride.We own a Subaru Forester and this mirror fit perfecting on the rear middle seat.  It has made a world of difference!  She enjoys her car rides now.  She loves the lights and music.  While the music lasts quite a bit of time, having a remote is awesome.  We have never had any issues using the remote from the front seat.  We also purchased the Land of Nod baby CDs, but with this mirror, we rarely use them.  It's nice to have the cds as a back-up.  We looked at every option to try to calm her down during car rides and this was a God send.  I would highly recommend this to any parent whose child seems to hate, just hate car rides.
