I cant say enuff about this stroller, we upgraded from the city mini which has much smaller wheels and felt tippy with my huge daughter in it. This is just fantastic and I wish I would have found this stroller along time ago. the seat height is perfect for taller kids with a 21" seat back and a 26" height to the top of the canopy which mind you extends so far that the sun will never get into a riders eyes. the buckles are longer than most strollers offer meaning they will secure my 55lb daughter with out being overly tight in the belly/chest area and are not easily removed by toddlers who try to escape. the handle bar is adjustable and comes with its own parent tray. the wheels are large which makes up most of its weight but the push is a dream we've taken this to the mall and on hilly park grounds with ease! the hood also has vents on the sides which allow for more air circulation and a window type view for older children who want to see out of the hood with out being blinded by the sunlight.my daughter is 55lbs, 41" tall and fits this stroller with ease, my 10yr old even fits (she had to test it out also).
