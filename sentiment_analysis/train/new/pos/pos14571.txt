I'm not sure why there are bad reviews for this product. I have tried several bottle brushes, and this is the best one I have found yet.  Though it doesn't last forever, it certainly lasts MUCH longer than the Munchkin brush.  I purchased several Munchkin brushes and they only lasted about 2-7 days each.  This brush lasts at LEAST 2-3 weeks, and the floating little brush is awesome!  No more losing the nipple brush in the dish water.
