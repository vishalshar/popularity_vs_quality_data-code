I love having lids.  For three years we were using the Munchkin Snack Catchers, which I also love.  These OXO cups are better for me because I always have one or two filled with fishy crackers or dry cereal in my diaper bag/purse.  They get tossed around inside & by the end of the week my bag is filled with crumbs, not to mention whatever may be sneaking it's way in to the cup.  The lid is so simple & so perfect.  My bags stay crumb free now & I know no lint or other kind of shadowy bag lurkers are sneaking their way into my son's food.When I first received it I was a bit disappointed because it seemed so much smaller, but it fits more than I expected.  Each cup fits exactly one full 1oz bag of Gerber Graduates Yogurt melts.I also like that the lid screws on, as my three year old was able to remove the lid from the Munchkin cups.  I make this one super tight & have not had any issues so far.I have the blue and the green & the colors are pretty true to what is shown online.  I prefer the blue, but like having different colors for different types of snacks.  I also love the rounded design of these cups.  There are no edges or corners, which makes them easy to slip in and out of large bag pockets.The only concern I have is that after a couple of months of use, the flaps on the top of the lid are staying slightly bent inwards, leaving a larger hole on the top for escaping snacks and crumbs, as well as slightly getting in the way of the snacks.  This isn't a huge problem with the lid on, but if the hole gets larger I may run into a situation where I may as well give him just an open cup to eat of of.  My Munchkin cups were used for three years & on a more regular basis.  They are still like new, including the lid flaps.The perfect cup would be a combination of the Munchkin Cup and this one.  For me, the lid is the deal-breaker so I would have to go with OXO.
