We just had a second child and needed a second monitor.  Our 3 year old Summer Infant Slim & Secure is still going strong for the first child although the buttons are difficult to press.  So I was looking for something similar and discovered that there were a lot of changes in the baby monitor world over the past few years.  These new monitors have all these new features that look nice on paper but in reality you're paying for stuff you don't need.  Did you ever need to pan and scan the camera before?  Why do you need to know the temperature in the room remotely?  Do you really want to talk to your child two-way and freak them out for life?This set seemed to be the best combination of value and features that we were looking for.  It's working great out of the box and I can offer the following points for you to consider:- This model seems to be more "solid" than our last Summer Infant monitor in terms of build quality- The camera cord is still a long 7.5V DC supply with the same connector so you can reuse an older cord of the same specs (our camera was permanently installed so this was a nice benefit)- Having two units should increase the lifespan of the system.  The handheld unit will fail long before the camera but now you have two handheld units!- This model is easier to use than our old Summer Infant Slim & SecureAlso, you can compare Summer Infant models and features here:[...]
