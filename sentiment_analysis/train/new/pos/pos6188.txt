I purchased this because I kept setting my baby's pacifiers down all over the place or I'd tuck one on the car seat with him so I could easily access it.  That system wasn't working out for me, and this is a much nicer solution.  I'm currently using the Avent Soothies pacifiers and usually tuck one in this pod with a pacifier cord so that I can keep it clean until I arrive at my destination and can secure it to my son.The snap is nice and secure, and I usually just attach the pod to my purse or diaper bag when I'm heading out.  I bought the "Gray Safari" pod and I personally find the design to be very cute, and the interior is easy to wipe down.
