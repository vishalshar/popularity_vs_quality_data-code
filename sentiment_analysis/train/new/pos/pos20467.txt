I have three boys, but this is the first time I've used monthly stickers. I always thought these were a little pricey for what they are---large stickers. Out of laziness & the need to simplify my life this time, I chose to just try them & I'm glad I did! It really just makes the picture-taking-on-the-right-day thing so much easier! No need to fiddle around with the chalkboard, make a mistake, re-draw the whole thing over again, try to get it in the picture frame etc. Just stick one of these puppies on your babe & snap away! :) The colors of these stickers are rich, vibrant & printed well. The adhesive on the backing is sticky enough to adhere to baby's clothes, but not so sticky that you can't take it off & store in back on its sheet in case you need to do a retake or maybe even save for a subsequent child. These stickers matched my child's nursery decor perfectly...not that that was a deal breaker ;). I highly recommend these to make life easy-peasy! Oh, & if the sticker looks gigantic in the picture of my LO, know that he's only about 8lbs there, as he was born over a month EARLY! So, may not look so large on yours at one month ;).
