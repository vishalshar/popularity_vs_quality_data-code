I bought this for my my house for when my nieces and nephews visit, and as a spare for occasional use I would have like one that was easier to put together and take down. This one has cheap plastic hooks that snap over the sides (very hard to hook on)  for the bassinet with two metal poles in the bottom that are not solid, they come apart into two halves. Not nearly as well made or easy as the one I had for my daughter 16 yrs ago, but it was a lot less money so I guess it just shows you get what you pay for. The diaper/wipe holder is nice, the mobile doesn't wind up and turn by itself so it just dangles there, kinda pointless if you ask me, but I guess it's something for the baby to look at besides the ceiling fan. Overall, it appears safe, and will serve it's purpose and the price was excellent!
