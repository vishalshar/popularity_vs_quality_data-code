I lent this item to my cousin after their son was a year old and still wasn't walking at all. I had used it with my daughter with great success. It helps not only with your back but in teaching the baby proper balance and how to walk on their own. My cousin began having a therapist come out to help their son catch up where he should be development wise. The therapist said she was going to look this up to find one for her sessions because she had never seen anything like it and it worked so well. I guess if a therapist is even saying it's good (that was there to help the baby learn to walk), then it must be good!. It wasn't too long after they really started devoting some time to this that he was walking on his own. I think  the parents were real scared of him hurting himself too, so this helped calm their fears as well cause it slings the baby in and holds them super well. It doesn't look like much when you get it, but it really does work well. We had a lot of fun with this lil thing. It's a great price too! I bet baby's r us would try selling it for $60 if they had it. They can be such rip offs. <3 Amazon!!!
