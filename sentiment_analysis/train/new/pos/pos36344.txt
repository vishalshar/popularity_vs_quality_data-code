The mini co-sleeper was one of the first products that we purchased for our child. This sleeper has been an invaluable product that keeps the baby within arms reach at all times. The co-sleeper is easy to move from room to room and breaks down and sets up with ease. Great for those who travel with infants and the additional storage area maintained within the system saves time and energy when in need of quick supplies. A must have first purchase for new parents.
