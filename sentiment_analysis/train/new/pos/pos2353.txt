The splash guard is a soft plastic and if you have a Cars-obsessed girl like we do,  the guard is completely removable.The revving sound isn't crazy loud or anything.  I like that.If it were a defect,  and it isn't so this is not a real complaint...  it would be nice if Lightening, Raoul and Francesco were on the front of the seat and not on the back.  Because of this,  my daughter insists on turning the seat around so she can see the characters while she uses it.The soft seat itself is easy to clean,  the hard plastic part is tougher because of the sound button is not wet-proof.  But, that's just a common sense thing and not a flaw.I would recommend this seat for girls or boys.
