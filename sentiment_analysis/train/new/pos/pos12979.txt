I agree with others, the packaging was ridiculous. I actually scratched the paint trying to cut the zip ties.We have both the 3 shelf and 6 shelf one. The "boon" logo is far more noticeable on the 6 shelf one, less so on the 3 shelf.The diameters of the shelves are as follows (more or less):6 shelf-Top left: 4"Top right: 2.5"Center: 4.5"Larger low shelves (right and left): both 5.25"Bottom center: 3.125"3 shelf-Left: 2.75"Center: 5.5"Right: 4"
