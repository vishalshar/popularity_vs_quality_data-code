I had a larger high chair for my 2 year old and needed one for second child so I took a chance and ordered this one.  We live in a 900 square foot house so space is tight and the idea of a folding high chair to save space was really appealing.  I paid $34 for it on Amazon, which is the same price as Meijer.  I love this high chair so much I bought a second one for my son (in the boy colors)  Other reviewers complained of the back reclining too far.  The back does recline a little bit more than desired for smaller babies but both of mine (2yrs and 9 months) are comfortable in this high chair and I can fold them up and put them away when we aren't using them.  I have already recommended this highchair to our parents for when our kids come visit.
