This fits on both my wife's van and my Subaru windows.  They have both been up for about a month now without falling off at all.  I check it often and I have not seen any reason that it will fall off on its own anytime soon.  The only thing I don't like about it is its size.  It is a bit bulkier than I imagined.  I guess I should have read the dimensions prior to purchase.
