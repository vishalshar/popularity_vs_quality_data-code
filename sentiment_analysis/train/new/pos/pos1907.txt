I'd give this between 3 and 4 stars. It does dry nicely so in not worried about mold and is easy to clean. However, the top part of the seat is constantly collapsing on itself if my daughter tries to sit up (6mo). It's not a huge huge issue because I always have a hand on her anyway, but still very annoying if she gets particularly exuberant.It does not float in the bath and properly supports her, it does make baths much easier. I like that it folds very flat and I store it away in our closet. I wish it had a convenient loop to store it on a hook, but I can just tie something around its base to do that.I do not have a chubby baby, but I've heard the more solid seats that look like bumbos are nicer but chubby legs don't fit as long and are hard to remove babies from. This seat avoids that problem.
