Pleasantly surprised and impressed with this diaper.I've tried another imagine style and wasn't impressed but liking their price and style I tried this one, based on its good reviews.No PUL around the seams scared me. Thought it'd be leak city for sure! Not the case! Haven't had one yet. Another reason I tried this one is I heard it had a generous fit, and it does! Fits great on my very big 1 year old who I fear will out grow some of his one size bum genius diaps before he's done with them. Love love the fit. Super soft lining that has stayed soft so far with quite a few washes. Nice big pocket opening, makes for easy stuffing! Seriously. For a cheaper brand of diaper, impressive! Way better than Alva's!One big thing though!!! Wash cover once before use! I'm sure most people do, but I only stripped the inserts and didn't wash the cover. When wet cover was on top of my diaper stack it bled red onto the other diapers!!! No permanent damage but it scared the crap out of me.After first wash, I soaked it on its own to make sure it wouldn't bleed again and it was perfectly fine, so just be careful the first wash!Would and will buy again!
