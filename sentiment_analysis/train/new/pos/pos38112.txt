The product itself is high quality, but the attachment to the bed part of it is unique & didn't work on our ikea bed frame. I can't explain very well how that part is made....but it's kind of a hook/latch to attach to the opposite rail, & that hook is connected to the product by a thread that you tighten after hooking the latch to the other side. That's great on theory, but if the latch/hook type thing doesn't fit the bedrails shape, you are out of luck. I ended up taking the thread & wrapping it around the rails in the middle of the bed sort of tying it....but it's not overly tight. Would be extremely perfect/ideal if that latch worked on our bed!
