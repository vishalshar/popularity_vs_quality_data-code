I didn't have high requirements for this product.  I just wanted stickers that would go on the baby so I could photograph him.  These stickers did the job.  On nice thing is that they allow for re-positioning.  If you don't like exactly where you placed it the first time or didn't get it on the wiggly baby quite straight, they have enough stick-um that you can take them off and try again.  One thing I was not thrilled about was the stereotypical "boy" and "girl" designs. I would have liked some more gender neutral choices of design.
