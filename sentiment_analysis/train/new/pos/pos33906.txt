These bottles and my UppaBaby Cruz stroller have been my guilty splurges having a baby. I really like the Lifefactory bottles. I bought the starter set of six 4oz bottles with some added gifts they threw in for $65.00 here on Amazon and then 3 of these 9oz bottles for about $11.00 a piece. They're pretty, safe (glass), come with the outer grips (unlike Dr Browns glass version which you have to buy the non-slip casings separately $$$), and can be used later for food and juices as baby grows. These are pretty expensive at retail prices but if you really like "pretty" things (like I do)..... and are on a budget...... wait and keep your eye open for sales. I hate wasting money and am happy I was able to buy a beautiful product at really competitive pricing = a great value.
