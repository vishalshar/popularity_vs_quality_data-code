After I decided I wanted to get this style of chair (because of our small space and not wanting to have to buy a separate booster seat), I compared features to the Stokke and Keekaroo. We've had it for a month and I'm really glad we went with this one.Advantages over the more expensive models: The seat height adjusts with a button instead of an allen wrench which is a major advantage. I've used it already as impromptu extra seating for adults in our dining room. I wanted a five-point harness for my super squirmer, but I haven't had to use it yet. Cushion and tray are included.Disadvantages: I imagine the Stokke is faster to assemble (though really this wasn't the worst non-Ikea assembly), wider (vs. longer) footprint, which could be an advantage depending on your space.Everything wipes down really easily with a baby wipe or clorox wipe, it seems very sturdy after re-tightening the screws after the first use, and the espresso stain wood seems higher quality than I expected. If I were in charge I might make the tray a bit bigger or more rectangular so it sits closer to our table, though then it wouldn't be able to fit in our single sink so easily. (Note - our dining room table is above average height, otherwise I think it would slide over it nicely, or of course you wouldn't have to use the tray, it just seems easier for the baby to pick food up with the lip of the tray). I wish the tray was more adjustable, but it's already more adjustable in height and depth than most. My only real complaint is that it seems like there are quite a few nooks and crannies where food gets stuck on the belt and where the tray attaches, but I haven't seen any chairs where this doesn't happen.
