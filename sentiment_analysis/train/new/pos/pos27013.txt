Since I'd already babysat one grandson, we had a large supply of toddler toys for the second to grow into.  For #2's birthday, we thought it'd be a fun idea to put together a big box of new bath toys, and this one has been a particular hit!  The bottom of it has holes and he loves when I fill it with water and sprinkle it over him!  Having colorful, fun toys like this is such a great way to calm the trepidation babies sometimes experience when they graduate to the adult bathtub from - in our case, the secure feeling he had confined in the kitchen sink!  Has to feel like he's in an ocean now.  Having fun with toys preoccupies them and takes their minds off of their fears.  He can easily pick it up with his little fingers, and loves plopping it back down in the water to create his own "splashies".  Very happy with this purchase.
