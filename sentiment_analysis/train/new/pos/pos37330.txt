This product is the far the best sip cup that you can buy... and it is very creative... I would recommend this to anyone... my son is 13mths and I bought it for him and it is very cute, innovative and easy for him to handle... the only flaw I found as that I found that the bottom part where the snack comes out should have hen able to fasten rather that push in to reassemble because it might the easy to him to pull apart... aside from that, it is a fantastic cup.
