Safe for our little girl but not idiot proof lol. We haven't experienced any of the moisture inside concerns other reviewers have had BUT.. Being first time parents we are more than a little freaked out by all the possible germs/toxins/etc that our baby could get. The 3 things come in a little ...plastic baggy with a piece of scotch tape holding it closed and the baggy is, of course, inside a cardboard box..with holes/seams/openings/germ spouts whatever. So, in all due diligence, we BOILED the items before giving them to our little girl. Made of corn you say 0.o? DOH! They are intact, especially the large rattle, but the little pieces in the other two things expanded or the housing shrunk and they don't really ...rattle. But it's okay, she still likes to sometimes chew on the non-noisy ones. I gave 4 stars because we feel that the company should have mentioned not to boil...or better yet put the items in some sort of heavy duty, vacuum sealed bag...or something.
