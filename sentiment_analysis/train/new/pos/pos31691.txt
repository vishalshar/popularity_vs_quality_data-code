This was the first toy that my son really responded to and played with.  He immediately took notice of it and pretty much just went nuts for 40 minutes straight.  We've had it for a few weeks now and this is still a big favorite.  Nothing else seems to have this effect on him.We bought this for the mirror... the mirror is great.  It looks pretty normal (very little distortion) but is baby safe as you would expect.But this thing is so much more than the mirror, its like a mini activity station.  The giraffe neck has movable beads (like an abacus) that don't get much action from our son yet.  The biggest thing he loves are the leaves on this thing.  At the bottom there are these green leaves that are fabric covering some kind of crinkly sounding plastic  He just loves to touch these.On the right you have the zebra.  This has a transparent sphere with plastic beads, so it acts as a rattle.  When you spin the sphere, music is triggered to play.I have to say that is genius, because our son doesn't yet have coordination to push a button, but when he slaps at the rattle, he does make the music play.The music is not too annoying, because it switches between several different songs.  As you might expect, kind of a cartoony, jungle instrumental with some animal sounds mixed in.  A switch on the back lets the music play for 1,5 and 15 minutes when you trigger the zebra.This thing has nice straps that you can mount to a crib.  We actually attached ours to the toy bar of a bouncy seat made by the same company.  That seems to work pretty well.I think this thing is priced pretty well- and its priceless for the reaction we got from our son.
