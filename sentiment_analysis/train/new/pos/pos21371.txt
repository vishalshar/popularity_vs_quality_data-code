This is a very well designed unit and fits nicely in the Odyssey. The Saab 9-3 is so narrow that one is unable buckle the seatbelt as the booster covers part of the buckle receiver.The rigid European Isofix Latch is leagues ahead of all other belt latch systems in terms of safety. These will not loosen and require constant re tightening over time like belt latch systems. The Isofix has been shown to be superior to belt latches in European testing. The rigid Isofix was a pleasant surprise that I did not know was available in the US. While it was a breeze to install in the Ody, it was a difficult fit in the Saab because of the hidden Latch anchors (not the booster's fault).If you have difficult to reach latch anchors, you might spend the extra money on the Olli with the quick release latch system, it was a real bear to release the Ozzi latch buckle on the tight Saab.I don't like the arm rests on any car seat and these are like others; hard plastic. I plan to fashon some padding not for the elbows but on the inside to protect the kidneys and spleen. I cut the arm rests off of the excellent Safeguard child seat; something I will not do on this since the rests act as a belt guide.Here is some data on Rigid ISOFIX vs flexible Latch belts.
