This mouse is adorable and is a good substantial size! The button on his jacket is at least an inch across.He was a gift for my niece's second birthday, and she almost immediately unzipped the jacket.  Another reviewer was disappointed that the jacket doesn't completely unzip, but it's very hard for little hands to align an open zipper and could lead to frustration, so I think it's a good design.The mouse itself is very soft, sort of a velveteen fabric, so there's added play value as a snuggly friend.  I also liked that the colors are bright and gender neutral, so when my niece outgrows it, her little brother can play with it. There's nothing about the doll itself or the clothing that suggests it's a girl vs. a boy; no ruffled underwear etc.Overall, I think this toy was a good value, seems to be high quality, and was just what I hoped.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another, and would recommend it to others looking for a learn-to-dress toy.
