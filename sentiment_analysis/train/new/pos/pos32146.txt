I love this gate.  It is awesome.  Best gate I have ever seen.  It looks great, installs easy, opens and closes with out any effort, is easily removable, leaves very little on the wall if you temporarily remove it, has a large passageway, and is of the highest quality.  If I could, this would be the only gate I would buy.With all that said, think before you buy!  I initially bought two of these.  One for the passageway into the kitchen, and one for the top of the stairs.  I had to return the one for the top of the stairs because I didn't think thoroughly about the installation.  This gate has you screw a bracket onto each wall.  Then you just slide the gate down into the brackets.  Done.  I knew I would have to remove my stair rail to get the gate to slide down, but didn't think about the other side.  We have a half wall that has a top plate on it, then is trimmed with molding.  There was no way I could slide the gate down into the brackets.  The molding, top plate, and, of course, the stair rail were in the way.  Make sure you have nothing protruding over and above the where the gate will be, before you buy.  For the kitchen passageway, it was just two 9ft smooth walls, and the gate worked perfectly.So, buy this gate without hesitation if you have smooth walls with no moldings, trims, or anything else protruding that could interfere with the gate sliding in and out of the brackets.
