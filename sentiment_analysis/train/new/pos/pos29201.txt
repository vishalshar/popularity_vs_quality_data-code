I don't think I could say enough about this bath tub, but I will try.It is great for that "transition" period, when you baby is just starting to sit up but not quite secure enough to sit independently. The sides are made of soft foam beads that provide plenty of cushion. So if you baby falls over he has a soft landing. It doesn't matter if your baby falls forward or backward. My son could lean off the side to play with the water and he never fell into the water once. I could actually sit by the bath tub without having to feel like I needed to hold him up and he could play independently.Another feature I loved is the hook. When you lift the tub out of the water you need to drain the water from the bath. The hook was very useful for hanging it up to drain.Things that would be useful to know:  It does not "float" on top of the water, it is made of soft cloth so the water comes up from underneath. So you need to fill up the bath with just enough water so that it fills the inside of the bath tub about half way when you baby is sitting in it.Also, when you are letting it drain, make sure to squeeze the bottom. I could see where it might mildew if you do not, although I never had an issue with this.Although I got this when my son was older, I can see where it would be great if used as an infant bath tub by flipping it over.Final Verdict:  Amazing product. I truly wish I had had this for all three of my children. Unfortunately I only had it for my youngest son.
