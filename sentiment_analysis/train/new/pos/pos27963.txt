Good for my little one in the backseat when the sun takes over.  Doesn't black out too much but takes the sunshine down to a better level for my 17 month old.  Attaches well and comes off easily.  Takes a few minutes to put on and secure to the window, but no complaints for me.  I like that it isn't patterned with any crazy characters and maintains a small amount of adult dignity on the vehicle.  Fits my honda accord back windows well, but a little too big for the VW back windows.  But still better than what I would find at any local retailer.
