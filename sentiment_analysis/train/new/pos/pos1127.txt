I have both the Boppy and the My Brest Friend pillow.  When I first got home from the hospital with my first newborn, I grabbed the Boppy pillow first to start breastfeeding because it seemed like the easiest to begin with.  I had lots of breastfeeding problems in the beginning and the Boppy pillow didn't help!  After a few days I decided to try the My Brest Friend pillow instead.  Amazing!!  It supports your back and makes it easier to sit up while breastfeeding.  It doesn't move and slide around like the Boppy, and it sits higher up.  I always had to sit with my knees up or put a pillow underneath the Boppy to get it high enough.  And you can get up if necessary (while holding the pillow and baby securely) without having to break the baby's latch!
