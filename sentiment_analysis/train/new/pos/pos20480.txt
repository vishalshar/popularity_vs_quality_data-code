Bumpkins makes an excellent bib.  Any of the designs are cute but we especially like the bugs.  I purchased these for my sister's little girl and my sister loves them as well.  They wipe up easily, catch food in the pocket, and best of all, when my son is done eating, I wash it with dishwashing detergent, wring it out and hang it on the dish rack to dry.  They dry incredibly fast and look great even after I wring them out.  The price is a little higher than a bib that can be found elsewhere but you will find yourself wanting no other bib after you have tried this one.  The others take forever to dry or stain easily and you won't need to buy as many bibs you would need otherwise because they clean up so well and dry so fast.  I think the slightly higher price is well worth it!
