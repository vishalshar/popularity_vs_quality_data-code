These things are great. They're cute, they're magnetic, they do exactly what the package says they do.... truth in advertising, it's that what everyone really wants?  The floating magnets inside each one is ingenious. They'll stick to each other upside down or right side up or whichever way you want to stick them because the magnets inside aren't fixed to anything and are able to orient themselves to whichever way your kid is playing with them. They also have rubberized chewy-esque little limbs/wings/tails which my six month old really appreciates. We like the Pond Stackers! You will too! Get some!
