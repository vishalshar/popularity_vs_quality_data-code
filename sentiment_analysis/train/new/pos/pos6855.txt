Everyone who talks about the instructions being difficult to follow are right. My husband and I remedied that by tossing them to the side. After looking over all of the pieces a few times, we were able to understand how the gate latched and mounted it on our own. The hinges and latch are made from a very thin plastic. One of our pieces was broken straight out of the box. Luckily, it wasn't the main latch and my husband hit it with plastic glue. Everything is holding up well and the gate is visually appealing. Our son is only 7 months so I'm nervous about when he gets a bit older and starts to climb it. Sometimes I wonder if the hinges/latch should have been metal for added strength.
