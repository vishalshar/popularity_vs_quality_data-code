I bought this border for my son's S.S. Noah nursery... I was excited to find it on Amazon after I realized Babies R Us did not carry the matching border to this set. Make sure to read the inside of the label which is where the directions are (we accidentally trashed them on the first one we unrolled). We just used a saturated sponge to apply water to the border and then stuck it to the wall... it looks AWESOME! It is definitely a perfect addition to our Noah nursery. :-)And one thing to note... if you measure the room and determine that the border will JUST make it... get an extra roll. The tape that holds the roll together will tear the first several inches of the border which you will have to cut off before getting a starting point. I tried to avoid this, but it was inevitable.
