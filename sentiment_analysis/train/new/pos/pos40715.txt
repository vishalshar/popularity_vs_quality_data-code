I prefer this swaddle blanket to that of the other muslin swaddle brand (you know, the very popular, rather expensive one). I find the prints/patterns more appealing, the fabric quality is excellent, the size is generous, and it washes beautifully (just keeps softening, while maintaining its strength and stretchiness). Best part for first time parents: easy to follow instructions subtly sewn on! So you don't have to stress about remembering how to swaddle when you're learning. I will be buying more!
