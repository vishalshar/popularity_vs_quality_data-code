I love this crib set, it's adorable! The sheets themselves are very soft and I love that the printed sides make it look like its a bumper. After reading the other reviews I was worried about it shrinking, but I washed in cold and dried on low and the sheets fit our crib mattress perfectly! The only reason I'm leaving 4 out of 5 stars is because the sheets did fade significantly after the first wash. I got 2 sheets, washed one and left the other in the packaging. Comparing the two the fading is VERY obvious. I am hoping they do not continue to fade every time I wash. That said, it doesn't make too much difference to me because it's still a very cute set, just what I was looking for, and I think the sheets are adorable even if they are faded/lighter. As long as you're aware that they will fade some, you won't be disappointed with these sheets!
