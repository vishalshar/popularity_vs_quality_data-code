i love this pillow!! I truly love the organic nature of it - avoiding questionable fillers used in other pillows.  I have a son that has asthma and as such, this pillow made so much sense for him. I loved it so much that I bought one for me. I purchased this pillow from the manufacturer the first time but would absolutely go to this vendor instead next time.  Pillow arrived quickly with no shipping costs!  Also, washing in the machine had not been an issue.  Low spin/bulky load and it will be fine.
