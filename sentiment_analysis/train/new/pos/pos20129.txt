I just received this shade so I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but I did attach it to my stroller & I can already tell I'm going to love it! It's much bigger than I had imagined, which is good. I read some other reviews before I purchased it which gave me some concerns about it not being sturdy enough. But after handling it & attaching it to different places on the stroller, I'm finding it to be quite sturdy. Some of the reviews talked about it moving and/or bending as you walk or when the wind blows. But I think it just depends on where you attach it to the stroller. First I tried it on the handle of the stroller & it did want to move a little because the clamp would want to tilt on the bar it was attached to. But if you attach it to a place that has more for the clamp to bite down on, such as I did (seen in photo), it doesn't move at all by itself. The underside of the shade is a UPF 50 silver fabric. This shade is also foldable, which I didn't know. It folds very easily if you follow the picture guide on the package, & is held with an attached elastic band. Also, I find the ball joints of the arm strong & tight, but not so tight that you can't easily reposition the shade. I'm thrilled with this shade & would definitely recommend it!
