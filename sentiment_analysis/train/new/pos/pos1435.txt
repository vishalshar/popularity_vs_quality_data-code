The set is great…Pros:-I got it for my daughter when we first transitioned her to a toddler bed.  We were really nervous about her being upset at giving up her crib, but when the package came and she saw the adorable Minnie Mouse comforter, she couldn't wait to sleep in her "big girl bed."-The sheets are nice and soft.-The design is very sweet.Cons:-The pillowcase is too big for a standard pillow… seems like a king sized pillow case which is an odd choice for a toddler bed.  As it is, I have to fold it under the pillow, which isn't a problem per se, but takes away from the design.-The little wall decorations… well, I may not be the most handy person but I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to get these things to stay on the wall.  There is no adhesive, they have little indentations, which I guess you're supposed to be able to use for hanging, but they're so shallow that no picture hanger or nail that I own does the trick.  I tried poster tape, etc. but they fell off in a matter of hours.  Not the end of the world, but a little annoying.
