The reason for my purchase:- I have a low coffee table with a glass top that has sharp corners + a wildly energetic puppy = not a safe comboPositives:- The foam material is sufficient padding to protect against unsafe table corners- The sticky material is quite sticky- You get plenty of the sticky material, in case you ever need to reapply- Actually looks pretty sleek on a glass table top- Great value, for the priceNegatives:- Not a thingRecommendation:- If you are in the same boat as me (a sharp-cornered table top + young loved ones), this is an easy buy.  It's cheap, it gets the job done, you won't regret buying this.  Problem solved.
