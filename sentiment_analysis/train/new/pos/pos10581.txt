This product was just what my husband and I needed to feel comfortable co-sleeping with our baby. Although both of us wanted our baby in the bed, we both worried about being so tired we might roll over onto the baby in our sleep. A friend told me about the Snuggle Nest and I felt it was worth a try. We have a queen size bed so it's a tight squeeze (husband and I have to sleep on our sides) but the snuggle nest works great. We swaddle our baby and place him in there. He seems to love it. He sleeps well and we know he is safe. The surface is a little hard but baby doesn't seem to mind. Our little one is 24 inches long and fits in the nest just fine. He does wiggle his way to the bottom of the pad after a bit of fussing but as long as I get up and deal with him quickly, it's never a problem.  I LOVE the night light. It's not too bright and it allows us to see the baby to help place the pacifier in his mouth  or check on him if he coughs or spits up.  I also love the womb sounds. After some night feeds baby just doesn't want to settle down. I put baby in the nest and start the womb sounds. Baby always starts to calm down and drift off to sleep. This is a really great product. It's light, folds up nicely and give us peace of mind. I highly suggest it if you are worried about co-sleeping.
