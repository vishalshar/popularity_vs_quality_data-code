I have been using this stroller for the last 6 months.This is nice and my son loves it.The seat is comfortable and the stroller has also sufficient leg space. I can recline it easily for my son to take a quick nap.The small window at the top lets you see inside and my son can check who is pushing the stroller. He prefers his mom to do that though.The stroller packs up nicely and take very little space and is really light and portable.The cup holder is also handy.The two drawbacks are -1)the wheels somehow gets locked and turning is not very convenient2)the boot space is very lessThe shipping was fast and customer service prompt. Overall its a good one at the price
