Our son is 3.5 months old and absolutely loves this play mat.  I was a little skeptical after reading some reviews referencing the activation of the star (by shaking/hitting) and claims that the star no longer lit up or played music.  However, the bright lights and music were present in our product.  Our son also loves the mirror and dangling red bird with grip.  My son has had no problem activating the star, he simply kicks one of the arches and it has functioned every time.  While the 10 songs can get annoying after hearing them for a half hour straight, there is much more variety than other musical baby toys we've experienced.The only problem I've encountered, which is rather insignificant, is occasionally one of the rings holding the cat/dog picture will fall off of it's attachment area.  However, this is generally after moving the mat from 1 room to another, so perhaps the shaking positions the rings to be more vulnerable to detaching.I think the bright colors and real-life pictures are great perks.  I would highly recommend this product if you'd enjoy a few minutes to get some house work done, but still keep your child in sight and entertained!
