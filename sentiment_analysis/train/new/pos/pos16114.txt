I felt I needed to write a review since there are so many that are negative!The tick/tock sound others talked about: It isn't that loud! If it doesn't bother my baby then I don't find it to be a problem. I have slept in her room and it didn't bother me at all..actually I didn't even notice it.It is a beautiful clock and went well with my Dr. Seuss theme. I did all of the characters rather than just cat in the hat or fish.My daughter loved watching the clock even as a newborn! Now she is 11 months old and still loves to look at it. She even knows to look at the clock when we say "one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish!"It was worth the money and I can't imagine her room without it.
