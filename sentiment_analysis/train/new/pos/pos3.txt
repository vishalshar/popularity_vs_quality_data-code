This ornament is a very cute addition to our Christmas tree.  It is very colorful and kid friendly.  It was a little hard to figure out how to get it personalized.  Following my purchase, I had to go the Amazon link for sending an email to the seller and wrote what I wanted on the ornament, but it came with exactly what I asked for.  It also arrived in a timely manner.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
