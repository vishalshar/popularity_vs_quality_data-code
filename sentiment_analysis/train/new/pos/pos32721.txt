I haven't yet put the baby in the seat, because I'm still preggers.  However, putting this together I was shown just how stable this is going to be for our little man.  The plushness of the seat is equal to the comfort seen in the My Little Lamb cradle n swing by Fisher Price.  I would for sure recommend this to someone else.  Especially if they have an adoration for elephants!
