This gate is great. We use it as both a dog gate (80lb Husky/lab) and as a toddler gate...great for both.Gate stays secure with either dog or toddler bouncing off it.First gate we've had for over a year now, still great.Most recent one we've bought has changed slightly. The actual swing part is not the same color as what you order, its a light grey with blue plastic. It looks quit funny. Looking back at the pictures after getting it you can slightly see this (I thought they were just high lighting the swing part when I ordered it)The install points work great as long as you don't have a tapered base board, but still works (at least 2" from floor of flat base board would be ideal)I considered only 4 stars for the color change...but really, it does not affect functionality.
