Unique reasons why you should consider this bedding set:1. Unisex colors.2. Simple yet beautiful design.3. Good quality cotton fabric.4. Easy to remove the wrap from cushion and hence easy laundry.Other thoughts:Most of the bedding sets in the market have heavy embroidery/design work that may wear off as days goes by.The comforter and the side padding has concealed zippers to detach it from the cushions.Looks lot cuter in the crib than shown in the pictures.I'm not a big fan of organic materials; yet picked this one and happy about the choice.PS: This bedding set made me to write my first review ever in Amazon.
