I was hesitant to spend so much on baby monitors, but the cheaper brand I bought at first broke after a few months and we were moving to a new house, so I thought these deserved a second look and I have never regretted buying them. As others have pointed out, these are wonderful if you have more than one child or your child is ever going to be in more than one room in the house. I love being able to switch channels depending on where my daughter is, and having two receivers means I can carry one throughout the house and leave one at my bedside. It's true that they're pretty brightly lit in a dark room, but if you turn them facing the wall or face down it's fine. Better to have it too bright and adjust it than not bright enough.I've also been pleasantly surprised by how good the reception is. I've never had problems with static, even when my daughter is sleeping on the third floor of the house and I go into the basement. My house also has aluminum siding that often blocks cell phone reception when you're in the house, but again, I've had no problems with reception on these even when I've gone out into the back yard. In fact, the other night I forgot I had the one receiver in my coat and only realized when I was walking the dog and had gone several houses down the street from my own and finally some static started coming out of my pocket. We don't use the walkie talkie feature much, but it's nice to have for those moments when you don't want to shout downstairs for a new bottle. Overall this has been a great help for us with only one child, and I know it's going to be a real life saver when we have more than one.
