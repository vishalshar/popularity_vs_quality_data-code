This little rug is great! Not too big and not too small, just the perfect size for the bedroom floor or underfoot in the living room. Having twins, they each could zoom their train or cars around the tracks and still have breathing room. The construction/material was better than I had expected and I have washed it a few times without incident. I let it hang dry and the colors did not bleed. Definitely recommend.
