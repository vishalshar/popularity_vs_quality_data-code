This is a great product however, I only received the clip on device but I was refunded part of the amount since I did not receive the complete product.  The clip on will work without the other unit.  It is not very loud where you can hear in the next room, but you can hear it go off if you are in the same room.  You will need a sound monitor with this. It worked well for us at night because I was breastfeeding and getting up several times a night and would sometimes accidentally fall asleep.  We also have an angel care monitor but this was great when I would fall asleep with the baby.  It provided me with peace of mind and I highly recommend this item.
