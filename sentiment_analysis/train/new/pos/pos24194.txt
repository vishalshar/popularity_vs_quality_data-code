Update: After first real time use (The baby has finally arrived :-)There's one significant drawback.There's no option to set the app to keep your device's screen on. What's called "Keep Awake" on Android devices.Update#2: After some research, found a workaround to keep screen awake while using PIXPO app on Android devices.Just install Wakey app from the Play Store, payed version recommended. Read the app description for more details and how to use it.[...]The camera is as described - not more, not less.Don't expect to get state of the art HD camera. It is a simple camera, VGA resolution (640x480) but the quality is definitely satisfying for the purpose of watching your baby sleeping.The camera works almost out of the box if you use the Ethernet cable to connect to you home network.Just download the Android or iPhone app (I have tried both) and follow the instructions in the Quick Start Guide brochure.If you want to use the PC app, just download it from the product page in VideoSecu website or install it from the CD that comes with the camera.At the beginning the PC app didn't work, until I understood that I need to run it as an administrator.Right click on the app shortcut->Properties-> Compatibility->  run this program as an administrator (mark V in the Chceckbox)->okFrom here just follow the instructions in the Quick Start Guide brochure.The big problem was to connect the camera to the WiFi network. I tried to follow the instructions but with no results.Even after a few e-mails with the technical support they didn't give me a a good solution.Finally after a few days I managed to understand the problem. The network name shouldn't be too long.After you choose your network in PIXPO app WiFi settings, pay attention that the name written in the app is perfectly matching your network name, because if the name is too long, the app will cut some letters from it and you won't be able to connect.Pros: the camera and the app does what is expected to do, as promised. If you are aware to the problems mentioned above it will work almost out of the box.Cons: It is not very user friendly when there are problems, Customer service was not professional or helpful.#VideoSecu, #WiFi, #PIXPO, #iPhone app, #Android app, #PC app, #WiFi Baby Monitor, #WiFi IP Camera, #WiFi Baby Camera, #Baby Monitor app
