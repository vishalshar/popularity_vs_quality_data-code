We LOVE this gate.  And I will tell you the number 1 reason-it is the best pressure gate out there.  We never want to attach it to the wall and this one doesn't have to be.  Yet it is not like the flimsy wood ones that anyone can knock over easily.  We had one of these gates when our kids were young, but then we passed it along thinking we didn't need it anymore.  Now we have a dog and I immediately sought to find another one like the one we had with our kids.  Hands down the best pressure gate out there!
