This fits perfectly on my summer infant 3D lite umbrella stroller. I was not a fan of the color options available so I was pleased to find that it is reversible with the back side being grey, which will match any color stroller you have. I noticed in one review of the red one, the red peeks through in the strap slits when it is reversed to the grey side, however on the green one the green does not show through. So it's great that any color you order will give you the option to use the grey side (I'll include a picture with the grey side for reference). This padding is perfect for the summer infant stroller I have, since the seat didn't seem all too comfortable for long trips. Thanks to this liner, I can use my lightweight stroller for such trips, knowing my baby will be comfortable.Overall it's a well made product and the material is terry cloth. Another review said its like a towel but that's not very accurate. Terry cloth, while it's reminiscent of towel material, is much softer than towel material.
