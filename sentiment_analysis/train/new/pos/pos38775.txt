I really like this stroller.  I LOVE that my carseat (the Safety 1st OnBoard 35) clicks right into it without any problems and that it's so lightweight and easy to set up.  However, I wish that 1) it was easier to turn; it is almost impossible to maneuver one-handed and sometimes it has problems not wanting to turn on linoleum.  It feels like it's dragging sideways rather than having the wheels actually turn. 2) the underneath storage was a little more accessible; it's quite a large storage space, but in order to get my diaper bag in there I have to pop the carseat all the way out.  The opening between the carseat and the top of the storage compartment is fairly narrow. 3) it was easier to tell if the carseat was all the way in; sometimes we'll put it in and it'll seem to be all the way in, but a little later we hear a click telling us that NOW it's all the way in, whereas before it wasn't. 4  my husband) it had better shock absorbency.  I understand it's not a jogging stroller, but you can definitely tell when you're going over a crack in the sidewalk. However, my baby seems to enjoy the off-roading type feeling ;)Also, the two parts that are red in the picture (the side clip and the button on the handlebar) are actually gray on my stroller.Aside from these minor complaints, I absolutely LOVE this stroller.  I am so glad I bought it and I would definitely recommend it!  It is super convenient and doesn't take up much room in the car at all.
