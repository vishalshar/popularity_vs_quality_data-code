We bought three of these on the recommendation of a sleep expert and our 7 month old took to them right away (she was 5 months at the time).  These are marketed as "baby safe" and after testing it ourselves as well, we feel comfortable with her having them in her crib even though she is less than 1 year old.  Previous to this we tried Angel Dears Angel Dear Napping Blanket, Green Froggy but seem a little big for her.  The blanket part was larger and we always felt nervous leaving them with her due to the risk of suffocation.  Our little one sleeps with these new ones for every nap and overnight and the first thing she does is grab one and hugs/chews it to sleep.  I would recommend buying several as they get dirty quickly and we actually put 3 in her crib with her so she can always find them if she wakes up looking for one.The only con I would say is the little hairs on the lamb head/ears have already become matted and ratty after only 2 months of use, even after washing.  They do get washed 1-2 times per week.  If I could go back, I probably would have bought a different style without the short white "fur" as they would probably last longer.  We have already had to buy 3 more to replace the first ones.
