I was so happy when I opened the box and the Taggie Blankie was exactly as expected!! My 2 year old lost hers 2 days ago, on Halloween. I was lucky to find the exact same one!! I ordered it Saturday night with 2 day shipping expecting it on Tuesday. Happy to say it came today, Monday a day early, and my daughter doesn't even know the difference! I think I will order another one as a back up. Thank you so much!!!
