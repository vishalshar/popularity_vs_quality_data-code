My 18 month old was obsessed with Toy Story. He also refused to use a sippy cup for milk - he only wanted his bottle. Enter the mystical, magical powers of the toy story sippy cup. These cups transformed my son from a whimpering, sobbing, crying for his baba baby to an independent toddler with sophisticated tastes. Overnight!!!But seriously, we had been trying for weeks to wean him off the bottle and all the tears stopped immediately once these cups arrived. We just crossed our fingers and prayed that a Buzz cup would be included and thankfully there was one Woody and one Buzz in each of the two orders we made. Never underestimate the power of a favorite cup!These cups are very well designed as well. They are very easy to clean and they are the most leak-proof cups I have ever seen. And we have tried a lot of cups! I mean, if he holds the thing upside down and shake shake shakes it a few drops do come out. Not that he ever does this... hmm... maybe we ought to work on that.I do not have a single negative thing to say about these cups after our 3 months of use. They're awesome!
