Baby loves, makes wife's commute at time a blessing to distract the child when she is a bit cranky. Light though not bright is enough on those dark nights driving home to see how your child is doing. However note its not so bright it will wake her.The music ... a bit creepy in terms that they are not your typical baby songs. But as long as your use to it, its a no brainer that the distraction at times is far more precious to help calm your child.
