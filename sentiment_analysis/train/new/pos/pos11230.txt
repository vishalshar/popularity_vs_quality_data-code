These duckies were a big hit at my son's construction themed birthday party. The kids ranged in age from 1 to 6 years old. I froze these duckies in big blocks of ice and let the kids hammer them out of the ice block--one at a time, with adult supervision, of course. They had SO much fun and they were all so proud when they finally set the ducks free!
