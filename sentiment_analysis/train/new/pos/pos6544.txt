I needed something to label my son's lunch at preschool without having to physically write on the lunch box and this tag did the trick. You spend the money to pick out a cute lunch box they love, who wants to write their name in big letters with a permanent marker across it? I had one label on his lunch for the whole school year last year and just pulled another one out to use for his new lunch box. We never had any issues with the pen smearing or fading or the tag falling off. Definitely did the job. My only complaint is there's only one "style"....would be nice to choose different colors/themes, etc.
