I got this for me first, baby second.  It's beautiful! and I love a cross body bag, especially because we have daily excursions with the babe.  I'd been using various purses/totes to carry gear around after our skip hop duo deluxe was stolen (and I *loved* that bag; curse you car prowler!).  The differences between the two diaper bags are:1) daddy can't carry this bag, at least without hipster jeans and ray bans on2) a price difference of about $100. that's pretty much 3 skip hops for the price of 1, yo.3) skip hop has more user friendly with its magnetic closures and mesh pockets, well designed compartments, durable canvas-like material.4) both are roomy and come with stroller straps and changing pad, but the hayley also comes with a bottle cooler, mini purse and zip pouch for dirty stuff5) i'm afraid to use this bag for baby because its so beautiful. but, like I said, I got this bag for mama - i'm sure the fear will melt away by morning when i take it to work.My only gripe so far is that you can't just shove your hand into a pocket to grab that binky/wipey/parking money.  You'll have to put that baby down and show off the gold tone hardware, supple faux leather, and solid construction while you reach for that butt wipe.  Oh also the metal zipper on the outer pocket catches easily (it is metal, after all).
