this did not appeal to me at first, because the price seems too cheap, and the manufacturer writes in broken English.  the picture on the monitor is equal in dark and light conditions, the camera has more LEDs than any other, and larger screen on monitor.  seller was very prompt as well.  it does interfere with your wireless router, though, so plan to use it when you're not on the internet.
