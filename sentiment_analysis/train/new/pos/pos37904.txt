This is the second set we have bought. For close family members. Both Mom's adored it! I can't image not. One was the black and white the red is more a burgundy but still worked great with red accents. My favorite part is how easy it is to get in and out of the cars. You just lift the handles and it swivels right around to lift your precious cargo out. Every where they go they are asked where they got it. We ordered it on line because they are not sold in SLC, UT. Love it, can't say enough.
