I seriously questioned why I should be paying $30+ for a table pad and whether it would really stay put on a coffee table with no lip, but now I understand completely. This product is impressive and worth every penny. First of all, it's got 2 really heavy duty cords in it so it stays where you need it to. As I mentioned, the top of my wood/glass coffee table is flush with the sides, and it holds beautifully. I purchased the small size for a 136 inch perimeter, so it's a tight fit, but it doesn't ride up and pop off, or shift when my twins pull up on the table, which is what I expected. It's got about a 4 inch vertical to wrap around the top and the sides, and has been saving my 9 month olds from injuries and my table from bite marks for about 5 days perfectly. It has enough padding, plus it comes with 4 additional flat pieces to wedge into any corners for additional tabletop safety.
