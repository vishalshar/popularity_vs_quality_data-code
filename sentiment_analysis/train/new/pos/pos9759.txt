Love this!  The quality of the support belt on it own is likely worth the price... just really nice and smooth material.Patch cord issue... , at first ours wasn't working...Like it would work only work well with one cord connected for 2 of the speakers, but now when both cords were plugged in, for all 4 speakers... I thought it was user error, but I called the US distributor (Ritmopregnancy . com) and they said the patch cord was bad and they sent me a new one right away.  We just used it with 2 speakers and it arrived 2 days later.  This is likely what others experienced as they said there was a small batch of bad ones.My wife is wearing it without playing music as well, as she said its better than her other support belt.  We haven't done phone calls yet when I travel, just music, but that's the plan.  I will update.
