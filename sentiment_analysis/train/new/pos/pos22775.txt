We have only used the spoon so far, but it is excellent for little ones learning how to feed themselves. The ability to adjust the neck of the spoon to any angle for your kiddo sets this spoon far above the other angled spoon/fork pairs. The spoon head itself leaves a bit to be desired; it is a perfect circle with a lip all the way around, so it makes it difficult for the little one to actually get the food off the spoon once its in his mouth. I'd have given the set 5 stars if the spoon head were designed like a normal spoon. Still, its a great set, and the little guy was successful in feeding himself on the first try, thanks to the spoon's design!
