I first ordered these wipes four years ago for use with our first baby, and just ordered a new pack for baby number 2. The good news about these is that in addition to being organic cotton, they are soft and a very good size for use with babies. Note that they are also the perfect size for a toddler to hold and use and wash themselves in the bath when they take an interest - my four year old still uses them. Having just received a new pack of these from Amazon, I can report that I see no change in quality since I first ordered these four years ago.As you can imagine, the set I have from four years ago have been washed countless times, yet they are still in good enough shape that I can use them for baby #2. One word of caution: These do fray around the edges after multiple washings, which is a shame. Still, the fraying is not so bad that I couldn't just snip off the stray threads from around the edges and continue to use them. I have yet to find a product from Under the Nile that I wouldn't want to recommend. Great products that stand the test of time.
