I absolutely LOVE this product. I have not tried the mesh feeder yet, so I will write another review later.the food grinder is AMAZING! my son is 8 months old and we are slowly starting to introduce him to table food.Background: I have made my own baby food for both of my children. I buy fresh fruits and veggies (mostly organic), use the baby bullet steamer and baby bullet to puree the foods. I exclusively only used the two baby bullet products to steam and puree/mash all of the baby food. I did this from the time he was 4 months till 8 months. At 8 months, the amount of food he ate was exceeding 2-3 times the amount of food I could make with the 2 bullet products, so I started to look for other products that I could make larger quantities of food at once. that is where I found this munchkin grinder.GRINDER: I love this grinder. although, you can only make about 1/2 - 1 serving for a 8 month old, this product is amazing!its easy to use and VERY EASY to clean. (I hate doing dishes, so the easier the better). there are about 3 pieces (blade and handle, bowl part of grinder, and bottom part of grinder). you just stick the food at the bottom and grind slowly as you push the bottom up. its quick and you control how mashed/puree the food is so the older you get, the more texture you can have.I only wish it was bigger so I can make larger quantities at once. this is great for COOKED food that's easy to mash and things that don't need to be cooked like bananas, avocados and things like that.
