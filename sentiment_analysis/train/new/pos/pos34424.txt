Got this for my small dog, she LOVES It, very funny to watch her play with it as if she walks past it and it moves it will giggle and get her attention. Our cat is also a huge fan of this and loves to steal it from the dog and have hours of play. I know it is a baby toy and if we had a baby it would be an awesome toy for the kid, but we use baby toys for our small dog as they are more durable and have the attention getting sounds that my dog loves. The giggle is not too loud, so it would not scare a baby, this is a great toy for both human and animal.
