I bought the crib bedding set, which only came with one valance.  The window in the nursery is about four feet wide, so I needed at least three valances for a "full" look.  The valance is exactly as pictured and matches perfectly with the one valance that came with the bedding set. I paired the valences with white satiny panels.  Beautiful!
