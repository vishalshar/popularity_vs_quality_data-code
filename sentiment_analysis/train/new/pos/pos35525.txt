Just received my 100 rubber ducks. They are all in good condition and all 100 are accounted for!My review on the product... They are in good condition and don't have a smell to them. I didn't really get a big variety more like sets. I got 4 of each duck and a lot of the ducks look very similar to the next one (only difference is color) these are on the plain side with most just being a solid color or a normal body rubber duck with an interesting  paint job (camo ducks anyone?). There are a few very unique ducks (square mine craft duck) and I even received cute little dinasor ducks. Paint job is actually very good on all the ducks! One thing I noticed is that the description says they have holes in their mouths to squirt water out of. Not one of the ducks I received have a hole in their mouth. All have the normal hole on the bottom of the duck. I did not test to see if they do float or not but the description says they will NOT float.My honest opinion.... These are good ducks and perfect for me to pass out on Halloween to the little trick or treaters. If you have the purpose of giving these ducks out to many different kids they are perfect. If you plan to give it to 1 kid they might be bored by the selection. I would buy these again to give out at a carnival, Halloween or party!
