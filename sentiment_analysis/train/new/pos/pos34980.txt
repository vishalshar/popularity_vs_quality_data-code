We used this on our stairs going up to our third floor and attached it straight to the wall.  The stair well is narrow so this seemed perfect to help our littlest ones navigate the trip up and down from our bedroom.I did end up drilling holes and using the provided small screws to make the railing more secure and not slip by screwing the railing directly to the wall mounts.  I didn't see that in the instructions but it definitely proved necessary as the railing was slipping and sliding when you held on to it.  Save yourself some time and drill the guide holes.  Trying to screw the screws in without them proved futile.It's not unattractive and blends nicely into our whiteish walls.  The low profile is exactly what we needed.  Very pleased with the overall effect and effort involved in setting this up.
