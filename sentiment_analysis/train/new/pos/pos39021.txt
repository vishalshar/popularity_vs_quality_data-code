We have a dog, cat and two toddlers.  I researched all available safety options for our 6th floor NYC balcony and decided on this.  One year later, this is the fifth time I'm buying this product: we used it for a year before our balcony was redone.  I like it because it's not opaque, which other alternatives were (e.g. fencing) so it allows light in and maintains any vista you have.  I also like this solution because it's nimble.  The cable ties allow you to secure the netting loosely (use fewer) or quite taught (use more).  For me, I actually overlap the netting so that the balcony has a double layer.  Though this is not necessary, the product is reasonably priced enough that doing so wasn't cost prohibitive.  I also purchased additional cable ties so that the netting could be secured very tightly.  Please note that this was my preference: the single layer of netting with the cable ties included in the box are absolutely sufficient in providing an easy to set-up safety solution.  I read another reviewer's comment that her daughter cut herself on this product and I can understand how this happened: the product, while not sharp, does have ends that are plastic.  I spent a lot of time (<10 minutes) cutting these edges off.  I was willing to invest this time as a precaution and would recommend that others do too to avoid unnecessary cuts for adults or kids.  This product also held its own in months of direct sunshine, rain, wind and even snow.
