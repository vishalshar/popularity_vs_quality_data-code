Honestly, after seeing all those mediocre, garish choices at Target and BabysRus, I wanted to 'throw in the towel' (no pun intended). I wanted a classic, all-American towel... and I found this!  It's lovely!  The blue gingham gives a very classic baby boy feel, and frankly, the price is not too bad.  When I received it in the mail, I fell in love with it. The texture, thickness, feel, etc - I had no problem with it. I read other reviewers say the towel seemed a bit thin, however, I don't find it that way. But that's just me.
