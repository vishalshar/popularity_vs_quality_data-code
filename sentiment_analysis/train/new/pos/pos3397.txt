My 3 year old has decided that all fruits and vegetables that aren't pureed and squeezed through a pouch are for losers.  I was buying the applesauce blends from the store but the cost was adding up fast and I hated all the trash it was generating.  I researched many different brands of reusable pouches and these seemed to have the best reviews -- especially regarding leaking. I'm happy to report that we haven't experienced any spills either.  I put the lid on, fill with puree of choice (usually applesauce), wipe the zipper threads and seal.  My daughter LOVES the animals and the pouches really are great for on-the-go healthy snack.Not so great: These are really messy to fill, especially the 2.5oz size.  I may invest in one of the other brands "pouch filler" to help with this. It's not the end of the world to wipe the inevitable mess with a damp cloth but when you're filling a lot at one time it gets cumbersome, not to mention the wasted food.They also must be hand washed and air dried.  I use a baby bottle brush and if you get them before the food dries on there, it's pretty easy to clean, but it is not as easy as throwing them in the dishwasher. You also have to air dry them. I have chopsticks set up in my drying rack and slip one pouch on each chopstick. This seems to work pretty well.Overall does what it's supposed to do.  I'll update if there are any issues with longevity.
