This is such a great blanket... my daughter has had hers since she was born (GREEN DOT VELOUR ON BOTH SIDES) over 4 years ago... it has seen tons of airport floors, airplane floors, hotels, parks, food stains and on and on... It has held up wonderfully. This is my go to gift for any family expecting a new baby.  NOW... the real reason for this review is for the DELIVERY!! AMAZING AMAZON PRIME!!  It arrived in just under 24 hours!!! THANKS, AMAZON!!OH...and one more thing about the "my blankee" product. I love this blanket because it has dots on both sides. I've ordered other "my blankee" dot velour blankets WITH "fuzzy" on the other side... I don't recommend them -- the fuzz doesn't stay soft (not the way we use and wash them, at least)... but the blankets with the dots on both sides hold up FANTASTICALLY.
