I got 2.5 dozen of these from my baby registry almost 2 years ago and came back to leave this review after buying more for a new baby due in March. This isn't because they're worn out. In fact most still look brand new with only a couple having light staining. Previous baby, not yet 2 years old isn't potty learning yet and I need to increase my stash since he's a heavy wetter and requires 2 at each change now and there isn't enough to share.OsoCozy VS. GMDNew baby makes baby number 7 for me in all. Prior to baby number 6 I used Green Mountain Diapers flats (aka Cloth-eez). If you aren't familiar with the brand, they're supposedly the best. However, I can't tell the difference between the 2 brands unless I compare the serging technique on the newer ones. Prior to the newer ones (2000's), they were all bleached (my oldest is in college, so this is a long time ago). The softness, thickness and over-all quality are the same though.Flats VS. PrefoldsI prefer flats because they dry faster and are more durable than prefolds since they don't rely on stitching to keep multiple layers held together. They also stain less and sun easier. I also like that I can fold them to the size I need without buying different sizes. I do have some prefolds laying around from babies number 3-5 that I'm not afraid to use. They just aren't my preference.
