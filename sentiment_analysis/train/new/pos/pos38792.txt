-Appears to be very well made.-I cleaned the area on my tub wall very throughout and allowed it to dry before I applied the 3M strips. Hoping they last as long as possible that way! I will update with duration if they don't appear to last.-This holds all of our tub toys and is not even filled to the top. we have about 8-10 small to medium tub toys for reference.No cons so far - I am very happy with the purchase!
