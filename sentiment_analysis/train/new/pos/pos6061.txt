This worked great for gate checking our Bob stroller. Other reviewers complained about how difficult it was to transport through the airport given its size. Our solution was to put our carry on bags inside the stroller bag. The stroller bag has a handle and wheels, so you can easily pull it through the airport. Once you get to the gate, you can remove the carry on bags, insert the stroller, and check it at the gate. You will want to practice disassembling the stroller to fit inside the bag before you get to the airport. It is not too difficult, but you have to follow the directions precisely to get it to fit. The bag is expensive, but it was worth it to have our Bob stroller with us on vacation. A standard stroller would not have met our needs.
