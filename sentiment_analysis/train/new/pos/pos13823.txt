I'm really pleased with this mattress protector.  Yes it takes a long time to dry but it doesn't bother me.  I set it to low heat for 50 minutes and it's dry.  What's more important is that it works to prevent leaks from going to the mattress and that it doesn't have chemicals that are harmful for my kids.  The water barrier is a food grade type of plastic in between the layers of soft cotton.  You cannot feel or hear the plastic.  I have a chemical free non waterproof mattress (from Sleep Essentials) so it's really important that I have a pad that works so the mattress doesn't get soiled.  I actually have the fitted one around the mattress and then the flat one on top of that.  When I change the sheets, I just remove the sheet and the flat mattress pad. I have 2 of the flat pads so I can wash one and use one.  I've never had a leak go to the second pad and we've had some big leaks.Yes Naturepedic mattress pads are larger than others that I've used.  But it's never caused a problem and actually I'm glad because sometimes we get a leak that goes all the way to the edge of the bed and some other covers I've had in past don't protect the edges and they've leaked.Since I'm very happy with these pads, I recently ordered one for a twin bed that will also be for a non waterproof chemical free natural latex mattress from Sleep Essentials.
