I like these fine. They do the trick, but just know that they are very soft and "squishy". They hold a door in place just fine, at least they work fine for me, but I use one at work and I have often bend down to move it and put it in place. I used to have an old bookend as my doorstop at work. It was metal and I could just nudge it with my foot to move it. I can sometimes nudge this rubber one into place but it also flips around and bends if I'm not careful.The cow - well, I'm not sure how much it really resembles a cow but I don't care about that. I just wanted something that would hold the door and I love bright green, so this is the one I chose. I knew what it was when I bought it, so I'm not complaining about the material or the cow, just saying that it's very soft and pliable so if you want a harder rubber doorstop, or metal, this is not it. If you want something a little fun that does the trick, and you like the color, this may be it.I wonder if a mouse would have been better than a cow since the wedge appears to be swiss cheese? Or maybe these are swiss cows which is why I didn't recognize them!
