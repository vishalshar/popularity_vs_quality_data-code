I have had this product for 8 -10 years, so long I can't remember.  It has performed flawlessly all that time.  Recently I've noticed that there is some rusting and/or corrosion on some of the fittings.  Also it had starting acting up a month or so ago, and an internal shutoff valve seemed to be malfunctioning.  I turned the unit off for a day, and the problem corrected it itself.  Was it a piece of dirt or corrosion in valve that was causing the problem?  I have no idea, but though that maybe after 10 years it was probably prudent on my part to have a backup, so I ordered another identical model.  The original unit continues to function as good as ever, and the backup is still in the box unopened.  I am confident that when I finally press the new unit into service, it will give as good as the current unit is doing.  I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in a bidet.
