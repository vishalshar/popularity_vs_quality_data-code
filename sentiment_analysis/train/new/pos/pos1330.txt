These inserts are very soft to the baby's skin and you won't need to have any liner to prevent any kind or rash. I initially was dissapointed because even though I washed them in warm water before the first use, they didn't absorb a drop and my baby wet herself all over with all of them...but as we have had to use them when our bum genius inserts ran out, I have seen that after several washes they are becoming better soakers, although I still need to use an additional newborn insert with them...but I like them because they are being used now and work well...my baby is only 7 weeks and we get about 6-8 wet diapers daily.Would recommend but don't expect them to be a miracle, it just does what it says and I think the price is ok...
