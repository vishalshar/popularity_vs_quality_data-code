I have twins and one of them had a lost tooth sooner then I was expecting. I went crazy trying to see what I needed since this is my 1st time dealing with this. I found this and thought it looked great. All I know about my passed is that you put kids teeth in a plastic something or some parents even throw them away. Not me, call me cheesy or whatever you wanna call me but I think its great to keep them as a memory and when they are older they will see them and continue the tradition. This is perfect it has a spot for each tooth, and a plastic piece over it that keeps them in place. Very easy to use and small enough to store somewhere that wont take to much space.Once it arrived, I put a package together for my son from the "tooth fairy" it had this, and tooth pillow, and a letter from the tooth fairy. It was so cute and he was so excited. Little things like this mean alot to them. I suggest giving these out at baby showers so that parents can already have them ready for when the kids start losing teeth or you can be like me and just buy it for yourself.
