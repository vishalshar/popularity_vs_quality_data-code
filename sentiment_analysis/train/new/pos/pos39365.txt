These were given to me for my baby shower, and after my son was born, I found myself searching in the clothing basket for them over the 20 other clean blankets that we had. I just love how soft they are. They hold up so well, he is seven months old and still only uses them as blankets. I ended up ordering 6 more. I wish they made them in big people sizes! Don't hesitate. Its hands down my favorite baby product that we own.**UPDATE** Its now six years later. I'm on here ordering them for yet another friend that is having a baby. My two boys used them and only them until about a year ago. Every single day for four years for each child. Its the only gift that I give for anyone having a baby. And they always always tell me later that it was the best gift that they were given. They hold up so wonderfully. I've kept all of mine to give to my sister. And guess what? I'm sure they will survive her babies as well!
