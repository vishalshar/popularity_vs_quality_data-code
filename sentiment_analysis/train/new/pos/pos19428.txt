I bought Big Dots as a companion to the smaller-sized Dots for my daughter.  We've gone through several little Dots, (as well as loving the two matching blankies) and I thought it would be awesome for Dots to have a big brother.  Well, Big Dots was a hit and he (along with multiple Little Dots) are front-and-center on the playroom floor every day.  These monkeys are so adorable, so cozy, and so friendly.
