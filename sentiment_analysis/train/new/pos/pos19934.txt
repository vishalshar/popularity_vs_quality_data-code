I ordered it for my girl who lost her first tooth. It is very lovely and cute and my daughter was so happy to receive it as a gift. I am very satisfied with it except the fact that the box was poorly made. Honestly speaking, there was a moment that I was debating whether or not to return it due to the poor condition of the box. However, I decided to keep it because of  its details and cuteness. I guarantee you will love it. I strongly recommend it as a gift.
