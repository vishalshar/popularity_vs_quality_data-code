You do not even understand, but so many lunch bags have come home  to me dripping wet before we got this Thermos.  I'd buy some cute drink container I'd find at Target or Barnes and Noble and I'd use it for a few weeks and then, after another lunch bag (and its leftovers) came home sodden, I'd chuck it angrily into the trash.For the last year, I've just given my child juice boxes and disposable water bottles.  With soccer camp coming up, I'd become desperate.  I knew I needed to give my son cold water and a drink container he could refill.  He goes through so much water at camp.  When I saw the Thermos brand at Target, I immediately looked up the reviews here on Amazon and impulse purchased the sports Thermos.  ALL SPORTS ALL THE TIME at our house.  Well, it's been about a week now and no soggy lunches have come home.  Even better, my 7 year old is able to open the Thermos, fill it, and close it competently, so that it doesn't leak.  I'm now a devoted fan of Thermos.  I plan on buying their hot/cold food container for the fall so that I can send hot food in with my son's lunches.  I wish I could give this Thermos a billion stars.  Seriously.  Why can't other drink containers work this well?!
