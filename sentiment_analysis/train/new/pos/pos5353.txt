This is such a great thing to have for car rides for young kids. I have an almost 3 year old and we went on a trip that was long and this helped so much. We were able to set it up for him and he could color, play games on it and use it to hold his snacks and hold the DVD player to watch his movies. I love the pockets on the side. I opened it up while in the car and it had a slight bend in the middle (it might have helped if I would have opened it a few days before to let it lay flat longer). But that being said it didn't cause any problems for my son. The hard thing was if we didn't buckle it around him tight enough then it would slip off his legs, so once we realized that we just tightened the strap and it worked great. This was so handy to have and we will definitely use it again!
