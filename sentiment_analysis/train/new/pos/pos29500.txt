I ordered a set of these for the first time and found that they were great. I use them to create several designs on my nails and it is extremely easy. In the past I have used toothpicks and paintbrushes for this and it took me much longer to create designs than it does with the dotting tool and that the ones from the dotting tool look much nicer. They shipped quickly, were undamaged and came in a small plastic case which I can store them in. The color of each pen  was also a nice bonus as they do look pretty (soft pastels).Be warned, you do get 5 2-way pens, but this does not mean you get 10 different sizes. You get 5 sizes as all the tips on one side are the same and one of them has two sides of the same tip. I was warned of this from other reviews so was not surprised by this, and still find that these are great as I do not think any more sizes are necessary.Overall, Nice pens, look pretty and in a plastic case. Good shipping time. Good price. No product damage. Work well to create several designs. Only FIVE different tip sizes.
