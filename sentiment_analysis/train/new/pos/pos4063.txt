This set of 3 small (be sure to check the dimensions) is just what I wanted for a little girlto put her smaller toys and a doll with snap on clothes into.  It's not a sturdy set of luggage, so if you're looking fordurable travel cases, this will not fill the bill, in my opinion.  It's a lightweightfun set for kids to carry around their things or to keep toys with small parts together.  It could be used in a car to hold thefun stuff for the trip.  It's primarily composed of non-waterproof, heavy cardboard type materials.  The set is perfect for my needsand this Candy Girls pattern is cute as a button for a little girl.  The cases are easy to open and the handles on my set seem to bevery smooth with no sharp edges which could hurt.
