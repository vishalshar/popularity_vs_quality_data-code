My mother used these daily with all her babies. When I had a baby I couldn't find them anywhere. I called around and got told that no one carried them anymore because they had a bad rap for making your child obese, and not allowing them to learn to spoon feed (only if you are a lazy parent of course).I have a very different view. They are the best thing a mother could ever have. Great for transition from bottle to solids; when a baby is just starting rice cereal. With my second child it acctually TAUGHT him how to suck from a nipple other than mine. When you are in public they are great for feeding when you don't want a huge mess from spoon feeding at a young age. They are very worth the LOW price, and I reccommend them for everyone.They can be a little tricky to use, and whatever you put in them must be very thin in consistency without lumps. Anything out of a baby food jar works. We have used everything from avacados, to yogourt. Things like mashed bananas, peaches, and oatmeal don't work as well because of the seeds, and or consistency. I ended up cutting a bigger hole in one of the nipples to accomadate thicker foods.Great gift. I have had people down right thank me and say, "Wow, I didn't even know that they made these... what a handy way to feed."
