Can't say it enough - I love these cups!  We were using the older print (circles/bubbles) not the animals for about a year and never had any issues with the paint coming off.  I never used them in the dishwasher however, only handwashed but used a dishwand/sponge and still didn't have that problem. So I ordered the animal prints and was pleased that the paint still didn't come off. The valve inside is one piece and easy to use (and it's plastic so you can't "lose" it in the sink as easily as silicone/rubber only valves). Only bummer is I can't understand why you can't order replacement valves without spending $25 when the replacements are less than $5 but I had the old cups for a year and cleaned them very well and haven't replaced the valves on those yet. But I don't recall seeing replacements in the store.  These also have a good suction - a decent amount of fluid comes out easily unlike some others I've gotten for my 2 year old and tried to see how the suction was and you have to suck very hard.  These have never leaked or spilled on us either.  They were unavailable for awhile, I am so glad I found them again!  These are the hard spout but I'm going to try the cup-like rim soon.
