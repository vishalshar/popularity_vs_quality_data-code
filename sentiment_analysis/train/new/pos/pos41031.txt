This has proven to be an excellent solution to all of the stuffed animal clutter in a bedroom.  My daughter has a pet net, which has been a fantastic option for the 40,000 buddies she has.  My son has a much smaller collection and we were looking for something that would take up less space.  This has been a wonderful solution!This comes with a chain, mounting hardware (for ceiling mounting), and 20 assorted clips in yellow, green and blue.  The clips are sturdy and have a metal hook at the end, allowing them to easily be placed on any ring of the chain you need.  I've been able to hang well over 20 stuffed animals...even larger ones.  Each clip is strong enough to hold at least 2 buddies if you can figure out a way to get them close enough together to share the clip.  I've had no problems with animals falling down or out of the clips.This is also wonderful because my 3 year old can easily access and remove any of the buddies he wants.  He can even rehang some of them, though if you have a lot and they're really close together that's still more of a parent job.  I would guess we have over 30 animals on there most of the time, with at least a foot of chain up high that could still be used.  If we didn't have it in a corner we would have room for even more.  I would also guess this could be hung along the ceiling by anchoring both ends up high (if you didn't want daily access).I wish this came with more clips, but I understand why they make you purchase more ($$$!).Overall this has been a wonderful purchase that both 3 year old and mom are very happy with!
