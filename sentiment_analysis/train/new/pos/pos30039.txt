I have read the negative reviews and i just dont agree! I love this gate! I have 4 kids... it keeps my little guy out of trouble. He is 3 now and after 2 years it still is effective! It is plenty sturdy as my older kids (7, 9 and 11) have been climbing over it for 2 years now. When we first got it, it was a bit difficult to open but to be honest that is a good thing as i didnt want my little guy who is very clever to figure out how to open it. But after getting use to it is  easy and still keeps him out. We have a 72 inch opening so we also have the optional extension and it still works well. Get it but follow the directions carefully and you will love it too. There is no way that it could just pop open unless it was improperly put it... it is very adjustable so anyone whose is popping open needs to lengthen it a bit. Also, this is the only gate that i know of that can be easily removed and put back on (in like 15 seconds) when you are having company or cleaning carpet or whatever! My only issue with the gate is that when we got a dog a year ago he started chewing on it. after some time he made it through. we fixed it with duct tape and it still worked great but was a bit unsighty.. so today i am purchasing a new one... the same one because i love it!
