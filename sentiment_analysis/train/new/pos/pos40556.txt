At 6 months my baby boy developed bad eczema. He is constantly scratching his skin especially at night! We needed to find gloves/mitts that would stay on his hands through the night & that fit his hands. Most mitts are meant for newborns so we were having difficulty finding something in stores. These mitts worked great! I like how soft they are since he constantly rubs his face. They seem pretty breathable as well & stay on! Only complaint is that they develop little lint balls all over due to him rubbing. Not a huge deal, but makes me think they won't last long...
