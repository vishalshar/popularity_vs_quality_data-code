I've been very happy with this stroller for my 3 year old and my two month old.  It reclines far enough for a newborn.  The front bar comes off so my 3 year old can easily climb in, and when she gets taller, I can take it off so her knees won't bump it.  It fits through my front door, and maneuvers easily.  The only thing I wish it had was a cup holder!
