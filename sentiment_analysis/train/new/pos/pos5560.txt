I bought several calendars, since the photos and reviews weren't helpful. I gave it four stars since I won't be keeping it because of the grandparents issue mentioned below, but that's not applicable to everyone.Cute calendar, but "requires" as much writing as a regular baby book. Includes a Family Tree page that has specific spaces for grandmother and grandfather, instead of just grandparents. If there are divorced grandparents, you'd only be able to include the biological set. Each month has space for a small photo and the same list of standard baby book questions (stats, sleeping pattern, feeding schedule, favorites, dislikes, etc.) Day squares are small with no designated space for the number and would have no space to write if a sticker is used. Includes 56 stickers. There is a blank sticker to write birth month on to cover the "place sticker here" text.
