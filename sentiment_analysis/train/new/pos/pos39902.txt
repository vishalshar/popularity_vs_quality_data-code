This is a great double stroller as it is light (well, lighter than most double strollers), easy to fold with one hand, and my toddler loves the sit/stand option. However, there is one serious design flaw that you must be aware of before purchasing: when you fold the stroller you MUST be careful that the front wheels are in the right position AWAY FROM the frame otherwise the wheels can be damaged beyond use. The first time we folded this stroller after purchasing it, we didn't pay attention to the way the wheels were positioned and the frame completely destroyed the wheels. Luckily Amazon customer service was awesome (as usual) and we got a replacement, but you should be aware that the stroller isn't a simple one-handed fold and forget about thing. Pay attention to the way it is stored. Otherwise, we are happy.
