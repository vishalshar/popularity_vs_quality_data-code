These cups are great! I have been though tons of sippies for my son and have had a ton of issues. Either they leak or he can't get liquid out of them or he just doesn't like them. He's enjoyed these from the start. He did chew off the straw but it still works. I bought 10 over a year ago and he's still using them. He's extremely rough on things so I'm shocked these are still in one piece. The other problem I have is I can't find them anymore, his are starting to wear out and he won't use anything else.
