Excellent solution for teething child.  I opted to go with cloth, tie on rail covers because the crib we purchased is very expensive and we did not want to chance having plastic or similar covers remove the finish of the crib.  These can easily be removed and washed and attached with no problems at all!  Price-wise, it wasn't much more and I love the fact that they fit all size rails.  Our crib has rather wide rails which would have left other parts exposed with other covers.  Choosing a color and pattern is also a great touch, the rail covers match the baby's decor nicely.
