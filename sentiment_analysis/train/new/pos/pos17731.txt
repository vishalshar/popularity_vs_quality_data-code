Living in SC I didn't need the heavier version of this, but did need something that my daughter couldn't kick off like a blanket.  I've used this for several months now and absolutely love it.  I'm now trying to find it in a toddler size.It washes up nicely, and it is easy to switch between a car seat and stroller (no messing with staps-just undo the velcro, insert the straps and velcro it back together).  I also love the fact that you can just unzip the top off, or zip it back on easily. I haven't had any problems with the zippers breaking either.  I've used this in the summer (because of ac) and in the winter.  If it's really cold, I just toss another blanket over my baby.  There's no need to bundle her up in one of the heavy buntings or jackets.  I highly recommend this especially if you live in a warmer climate!
