My son really loves this bouncy seat. We've been using this as an alternative to the rock n play sleeper b/c we have such a low bed. I've also brought it outside on warm days and found the canopy to be a really useful feature. The music isn't too annoying and the volume level is tolerable. My son stares at the 2 toys on the canopy when it's down but for the most part we keep the canopy in the back position during everyday use. It is pretty easy to fold and unfold. What I like the most about this bouncer is that it is very stable and hard to tip or collapse. We have a cheaper model for downstairs and we've had instances where my older son(3) has leaned in to kiss the baby and bent the frame all the way back to the floor, this also happens if he sits in it(which is inevitable). This bouncy seat accomodates my 3 year old perfectly without any issues(not that we let him use it) and he can lean on it when talking to the baby and it won't tip.I rated this 4 stars b/c sometimes the music "skips". This only started happening after about 3 months of pretty heavy usage.
