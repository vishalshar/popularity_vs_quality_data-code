For over a year, we suffered thru crying with my son.  He would not take a pacifier, since birth!  We received one of these as a gift.  My wife was actually offended at first, but when our son grabbed it and was quiet, for the first time...we bought a dozen more!  This thing helped his napping, sleeping at night and finally gave us a little peace.....thanks.
