We love this set and I was surprised to see it was a cotton blend, not regular stiff cotton.  I read the other reviews about the items coming loose so before we gave this to the mom & baby - we tacked the bows and ruffles.  (the bows appeared to be just glued on)  It is ADORABLE!  The back of the dress goes up in center so when she wears it one can see the ruffled panties.  For the price you can't beat it and it's going to be perfect for Summer picnics and parties.As far as size - the range of 0 to 12 months is a huge span and I would say this is approx. a 6 to 9 mo.  It's stretchy and, as mentioned, the back is shorter than front so length isn't going to be an issue.  The other thing I like is there are no ruffles and collars, buttons, etc. near the baby's neck so it's fancy but comfortable too.Shipping - ship time was quoted at around 3 o4 4 weeks and I received this in 2 so that was pleasing as well.
