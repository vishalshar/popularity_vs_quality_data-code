Great product! I was a little worried about it after some woman's bad review about the tray not laying flat & food falling off...but come on, use your head & just don't try to balance the tray with food on it! She was talking about how the middle part that goes in between a child's legs lifts off with the tray.  The tray has a top tray that does lay flat however.  If you are the type of person who is NOT too lazy to think before acting then the high chair will be fine.  It is extremely durable & high quality, plus cuter than even the pictures show.  We are so happy with it, & our 11 month old daughter is in love with it, the only regret we have is not buying it sooner!  If you are thinking about getting this....do so, it rocks!  :)  Best product for the price for sure.
