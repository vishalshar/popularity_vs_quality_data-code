This pad is about a perfect fit for the Ikea changing table (all the other pads are several inches too long and Ikea recalled/stopped making the pad that does fit, so it is no simple task to find the right size!) One challenge to this changing pad is that the cute little covers are also all too large to fit, BUT I found a very helpful blog post that suggested a standard pillow case will fit - and sure enough! So if you have an Ikea changing table, get this pad, some cute pillow cases, and you're all set!  It's not as thick, or high-quality as the standard-size Summer Infant changing pad, but it's a good alternative if you need a smaller size.
