My daughter LOVES this set. We got it today, and as soon as I opened it, she said "princess!" She is 22 months and loves "princess fia". The set fits her toddler bed perfectly. I'm not sure why people would say it's for a crib, although isn't a toddler mattress the same size as a crib mattress? The color is beautiful, even brighter than what is pictured imo. It is really soft! The only downside (maybe for other people) is that the comforter is much thinner than I imagined, but it is not a problem for us as my daughter gets heated pretty quickly when sleeping. Overall, we love it :) washed as soon as we opened and put it on as soon as it was dry!
