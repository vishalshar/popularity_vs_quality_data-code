I've been using this bag for a couple months and I love it. I specifically wanted a diaper bag that didn't look like a diaper bag, and this fits the ticket. I looked at Petunia Picklebottom and several other brands, but didn't want to pay their price. This bag is a steal compared to those brands while looking great and working great. If I had to say something negative, it would be two small things: 1) there is no insulated pocket for bottles (most of us probably use a separate insulated bottle cooler anyway) and 2) the changing pad is too small (Easy and inexpensive to get a different one).Now, for the pros:1. This bag is the perfect size. I can carry two changes of clothes, diapers, wipes, diaper cream, changing pad, bottles, small toys, a clutch with my stuff, keys, phone, all with room to spare. You'd think the bag was huge to accommodate all that stuff, but it is about the same size as a normal handbag, very manageable.2. The exterior is super easy to clean and seems very durable to wear. Just wipe clean with a damp cloth, everything comes right off. Haven't had any messes inside. I would think its a little harder to clean the lining, but the outside is where most of my dirt shows up.3. It's a cute bag overall, doesn't look like a diaper bag, so I don't mind carrying it as my everyday purse. I have a clutch with my wallet and a few personal items that I carry in the diaper bag, so when I drop my little one off at the nursery, I just remove my clutch and have everything I need.4. The straps also unbuckle to be able to loop around a stroller handle. Haven't used this feature, I just plop my bag in the basket of the stroller or use a mom hook.I'd buy this bag again if needed, a great bag and a great price.
