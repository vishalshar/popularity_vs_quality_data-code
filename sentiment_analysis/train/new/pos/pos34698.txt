I put together a very gender neutral nursery for my little girl, and at the last second broke down and craved a little bit of pink girlyness in there.  This attaches very easily to my DaVinci Kalani crib.  The only thing is I wish there was a little flap of pink fabric that hung down to cover the white plastic plate that attaches the unit to the crib.  The plastic arm is covered by a nice fabric tube, and that is awesome, I hate the look of a big platic mobile.  The hoops are wrapped in fabric and the owls are made out of a sweater like material.  I love that the blue owl is winking!
