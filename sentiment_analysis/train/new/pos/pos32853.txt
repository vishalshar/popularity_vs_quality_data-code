I ordered this stroller for my 1 year old after researching "taller" umbrella strollers.  I am 5'8" and can push this stroller without my feet hitting the wheels like all other cheaper umbrella strollers.  I had narrowed my selection down to this stroller and a Maclaren but chose this one even though it is a little heavier due to the fact that it is sturdier and can hold more packages if some were to be hung on the handles.  The stroller almost completely reclines to help with diaper changes on the fly.  The awning is awesome also because it has a zipper compartment that can open up to almost completely cover my 1 year old.  Speaking of the awning, when I purchased this stroller the awning was somewhat warped after being in the box but I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a new one within 1 week no questions asked.  I love and appreciate the fact that they stood behind their product.  If I knew then what I know now, I would have purchased this stroller and bought the conversion kit to make it capable of supporting an infant carrier.  Basket is smaller but that is to be expected with an umbrella stroller.  I watched a youtube video on this before purchasing and was completely satisfied with the color, quality and company standing behind their product.  I definitely recommend this product to everyone!
