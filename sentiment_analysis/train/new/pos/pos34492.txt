This baby book would appeal to those with a more modern or minimalist taste.  It does not contain cutesy pictures, rather allows you to place your own cute baby pictures in it.  All the pages are a solid cream color.  The left page is for the pictures, which are self-applied with the provided photo corners.  Therefore, you can put virtually any size pictures.  The page on the right cover a different topic.  Some of these include one for mom, where you can put your name birthdate, places you've lived, schools you attended, hobbbies.  There is one for daddy.  There is a page for how mommy and daddy met.  One page is about how you found out you were pregnant.  There is a place to write when or if you found out the gender of the baby, and how you felt.  There is one for the baby shower.  There's a page for the baby's family tree up to his/her great grandparents.  One page is for the day baby is born.  There is a page for baby's firsts.  There are spots for birthdays for the first few years.  I'm not sure what it would take for me to give it all five stars, but it just didn't make me flip with excitement. Overall I'm completely satisfied with the book and it suits my needs.
