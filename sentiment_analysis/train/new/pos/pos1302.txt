We have purchased three of these.  They are the favorite blanket of our three great grandsons; they drag them along everywhere.  Only one of them needed minor repair when the edge binding came loose in one corner.  An easy fix.  Besides, they indoctrinate kids to the best tractors on the market !!!  I highly recommend these blankets.
