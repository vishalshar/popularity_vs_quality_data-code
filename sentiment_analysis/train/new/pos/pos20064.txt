I first got this toy 4 years ago at a yard sale for my oldest boy. Well, it's been through 2 kids, really rough boys, and we just had to get another one. They play with it every day, and it's still going strong. The handle did come off, that's why we got another one for my third boy to enjoy when he's old enough. I love this toy, and I'm so glad that I ran across it 4 years ago.
