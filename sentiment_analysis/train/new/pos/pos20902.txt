This is my daughter's FAVORITE teether.  We bought an extra so one stays with her car seat and the other can be around the house, etc.  It has a nice combination of the softer rubber (the white part) and harder rubber-covered section (the blue or pink part) which works for our heavy teether.  She can easily hold it herself and due to it's shape it's easy to attach tethers, and it quickly rinses clean.  We've also run it through the dishwasher (top rack) with no problems.  It doesn't have any gel or anything to get cold in the fridge or freezer but my daughter hasn't cared for those types of teethers anyway.  I am recommending MAM products and especially this teether to everyone I know.
