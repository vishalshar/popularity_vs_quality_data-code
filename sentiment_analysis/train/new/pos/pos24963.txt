I'm like the potty stool, it works well...BUT it is huge. It's big, bulky and heavy and our bathroom is a bit on the small side so it does make things feel cramped and a pain to move out of the way. Of course it can stay and adults can use it too, but I imagine it would be difficult for a grown man to stand in front of it... As for safety, it's probably the safest one you'll find. Five stars for safety, 3 stars for price/cost of shipping...so I give the 4 stars. I think if you have a large bathroom and wide open area around the toilet it'll work perfectly.
