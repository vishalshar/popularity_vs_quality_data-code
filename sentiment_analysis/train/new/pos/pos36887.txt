If you swaddle you love with this blanket. Large soft and cuddly blanket. Unlike other receiving blankets the ultimate swaddle is a even square so swaddling is very easy. If it is your first time swaddling you can follow instructions on the tag :) which are easy to interpret. This is a staple for any new baby. The blanket itself is so soft and keeps its softness after many washes. I use ours daily for the past 4 months and it is still just as soft and cuddly today as it was the first day I used it. Great product!!
