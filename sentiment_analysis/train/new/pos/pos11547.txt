Although there were other options out there for similar products, we chose this one because it was the least expensive option that was entirely plastic.  I don't know who's genius idea it was to make toilet seats out of wood (especially for kids), but that's just crazy.  This is entirely plastic and very sturdy.  It doesn't feel cheap at all.  Both seats feature a slow close mechanism, but I'm docking a star because they didn't bother to do the same for the lid.  It's really unfortunate as that's the piece most likely to be slammed by learning kids. Overall, though, we're very happy with the purchase.  The adult seat is comfortable, and the kids' seat completely covers the adult one so you don't get messes on the larger seat.  Ours was also very easy to install and stays vertical when flipped up for men or cleaning, despite what other reviewers have experienced.
