Out of all the baby info classes we did No One ever mentioned cradle cap!! So after a week my soon was born I noticed it wasn't going a way... this helped at 1st we would put coconut oil on he's scalp then massage with it seemed to helped but what really helped was placing a warm cloth soaked in water on he's head while we gave him his bath Then Used It And If Worked So Much Better On Removing The Cradle cap... Now We Use It Like A Scalp Bath scubber
