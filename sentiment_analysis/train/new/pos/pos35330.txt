Our baby isn't due until September, but we read a few reviews about painted wood needing to air out, so we bought early.  After several weeks/months of researching and reading reviews, this fit both our requirements and our budget.It definatly seems like a good quality product, but we'll be unable to tell until we start using it later this year.  The wood seems pretty strong, and when fully assembled, it seems very stable.  There are some quality issues with the metal bars that screw in to support the shelves.  Using the predrilled holes, the wood still split a little bit.  I don't know if it was just some of the paint, or the actual wood, but right now I'm not "too" worried about that.This review was written for mainly one reason.  The directions are the worst directions I have ever dealt with.  You get washers, and dowels that are never explained.  Thankfully, after a house full of "put-together" furniture, I figured it out.Overall, if you can figure out the directions, this seems like a really good changing table at a great price.
