I purchased the 3 Level Booster Seat for my 3 year old grandson who has just come out of his highchair and he took to it right away. It is easy for him to get in and out of.  I have a towel placed under it to protect the chair and pick up any food that gets dropped.  It also cleans up in a snap and as another review had mentioned, it is dishwasher safe.  The price is also another great factor for purchasing this booster. I highly recommend this booster.
