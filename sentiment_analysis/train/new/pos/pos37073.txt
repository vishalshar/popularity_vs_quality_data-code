Make sure that you are purchasing the all-brass baptismal shell, and not the white ceramic one with a gold cross glued into it.  There is a seller who seems to have latched the listing for their ceramic product onto this listing by mistake.  Regarding the brass baptismal shell, it is of excellent quality, and comparable to other shells available at double the price.  It has three ball-feet so that it can stand level, and is solid brass --not plated-- and has the fine weight of a brass product.
