I spent hours researching various toddler-sized luggage options in hopes of finding a suitcase that would serve my 2.5-year-old son's needs for a few years. I finally settled on the Travel Buddies set (after much wrangling with said toddler who wanted the pink version...we purchased the lady bugs). When it arrived, my husband and I agreed that it looked like it would hold only a few pieces of clothing, but no matter since my son fell in love with the suitcase immediately and spent an entire evening driving it around the house shouting, "I'm traveling. I'm flying on an airplane."Imagine my surprise, then, when I started packing his suitcase for our week-long beach vacation, and I fit the following items into the large suitcase:-Fourteen 3T t-shirts-Two 3T long-sleeved shirts-Seven 3T shorts-One 3T pants-Three pairs of socks-Seven 3T two-piece jammiesI did not have trouble zipping up the suitcase, either. Everything fit nicely and without a problem.In the small backpack, I was able to fit the following items with room to spare:-Four board books-Two stuffed animals-One pacifier-One Thomas the Train wooden engine-One Melissa and Doug magnetic maze game-One Melissa and Doug water pen activity bookIn other words, these little cases are workhorses. On the way home, I managed to cram a few t-shirts and other items grandma had purchased for my son into the bigger suitcase. Yes, we had to have another rolling bag for diapers, pull-ups and other toddler gear, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much we did manage to put into the cases. This set earns the high marks it has gotten here in reviews.
