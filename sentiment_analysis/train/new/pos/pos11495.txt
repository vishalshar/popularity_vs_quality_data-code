I like these liners. They're cheaper than just about all of the other liners that I came across and they're just as dependable as the two other brands that I've used. I used Imse Vimse and they just seemed so thick I was concerned that they wouldn't break down like they're supposed to, and clog my plumbing. Then I used Kushies, which I liked but these CuteyBabys were so much cheaper, I thought I would give them a try. I've been really pleased with these. They're soft, they're wide and long enough for our bumGenius diapers, and the perforation easily separates the sheets. These are my go-to liners for sure.
