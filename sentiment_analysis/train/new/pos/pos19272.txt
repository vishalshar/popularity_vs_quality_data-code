Purchased as a baby shower gift, for our daughter's soon-to-be-born baby boy.Brought laughter, as mothers in the room connected to the message and just how well a good pacifier can silence a loud "baby alarm"Purchased along with "Mute Button" pacifier, and a pacifier clip (very useful item to keep pacifier from getting "lost").
