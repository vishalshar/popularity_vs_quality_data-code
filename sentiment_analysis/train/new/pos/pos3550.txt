I adore gdiapers.  My husband actually is the one who initiated cloth diapering once we figured out "modern" cloth diapers.  He adores gdiapers!  They are super easy to deal with, are totally adorable, have matching clothes, are so economical and are diverse!  I highly recommend them to everyone who diapers!
