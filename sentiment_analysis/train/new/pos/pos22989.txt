I bought the on the go giraffe for my grandson shortly after he was born. It is his long-time friend named Gocko - his confidante and best friend, even without the voice box.  It became necessary that this lamb be purchased for his little brother. Big brother presented it to baby brother on the day of his birth and told him how special "Lambie" would become to him. When the baby is crying or fussy, just putting this next to him with one of the sounds soothes him and helps him recover from his upset right away. It is magic.The other thing - about 8 months into having the first on the go pet (the giraffe) the voice box stopped working. I quickly purchase a second one and it quit working about 4 weeks later. I contacted the company and within 2 days, they mailed not one voice box, but TWO voice boxes for the giraffe!  I was tickled with their quickness, their responsiveness and their generosity. Quality product. Quality company. Can't beat that.
