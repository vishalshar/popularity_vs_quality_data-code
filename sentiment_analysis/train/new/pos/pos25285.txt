My newborn, 3 weeks old now is absolutely intrigued by these cards.  I got the pets collection. When I first got them a week ago I had to hold them only a few inches from his face.  Now if I hold them about 12 inches from his face he is mesmerized.These are nice cards, they are easy to clean and should last a long time.  They have the same picture on both sides, one side is black with a white drawing, the other is white with a black drawing. They come in a nice storage box.  They are 7"x5".
