People: the description reads SNACK BOWL!! Quit complaining these are too small. Can you read?I bought 2 sets of these 2 years ago. My entire family (adults and children) uses these every single day for SNACKS. You know, like fruit or whole wheat crackers or something at a normal serving size? I don't know what you people are eating snacks out of, but these are a perfect size for a snack for a child or an adult.So, we use these every day and they get thrown in the dishwasher pretty much every single day and they still look brand new. We also use the tumblers. I appreciate the square bottoms on the tumbler so my kids (and pets) aren't knocking over drinks all the time.This is good stuff. Made in the USA for a reasonable price. These are durable! What more could you want? I'm buying more because my kids leave them all over the house when they are eating SNACKS and I have a hard time finding them sometimes. So, I decided to buy a few more.
