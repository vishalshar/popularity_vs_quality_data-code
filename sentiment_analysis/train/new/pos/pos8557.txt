My Grand-daughter saw SoHo at Babies-R-Us and requested the cowboy cribset. I saw the price and thought there was no way to pay the price they wanted. I went on line and found this set for less that half what I would have paid at Babies-R-Us. The quality was good and the number of pieces that came with the set were good. She was very pleased when she received the gift.
