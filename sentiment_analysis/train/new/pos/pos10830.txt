I was set on purchasing the Bob Revolution SE Duallie- hands down I was sold. Then we went to a big box store to test drive with my son's. Here's where the change in mind set started. My boys are 11mts and 2 years old. They fit just fine in either stroller now. Both strollers are great. So how did I decide? Here were the main selling points:1 - Collapsing. The Baby Jogger is SOOO easy! Just pull up on straps and it folds. The Bob wasn't bad, but there were multiple steps and it wasn't very smooth.2 - Head space. Neither of my sons are 'big' for their age and in the Bob my 2 year old was pretty much at capacity for head space. The shade actually got in his way. In the Baby jogger he had a good 8 inches of room to grow.3 - Foot rest. The Bob's foot rest is cloth; I'm not too sure how that cleans up. The Baby Jogger footrest is plastic, wipes up in a breeze.4 - Reclining seats. First the recline feature on baby jogger is awesome; just pull down on the strap. I totally struggled with making the seat recline on the Bob. If I had a sleeping child I totally would have woken them up. Secondly the mesh air vent in the baby jogger is key. Both of my little ones are hot boxes and this allows us to vent them a bit thus making sure they don't overheat. We also have a pergo double and they are all wet after napping in that stroller.It was really difficult for me to switch gears and not buy the Bob, gut at the end of the day, for us this was the more superior stroller! Hope this review helps!
