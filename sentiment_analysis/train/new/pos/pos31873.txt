My son has eczema and very sensitive skin. His skin is so sensitive that his own saliva will break his face out badly and cause large red rashes around his mouth. These open pacifiers are the best solution we have found and have worked wonders. Since they breathe, they do not break his skin out and we don't have the same problems we have had with other brands, including other MAM designs.I have to admit, I also love being able to see my son's smile when using them. :)
