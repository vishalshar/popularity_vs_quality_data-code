I love this bottle brush.  It's definitely the best brush I've ever used.  I exclusively pump, and I was having a lot of issues getting off the film from the breast milk.  This does the job nicely.  I use it with the Medela Quick Clean Breastmilk Removal Soap.  I have had it for about a month, and I use it every 2 hours for pumping parts and bottles.  So far, it hasn't worn down at all.  The nipple brush works great to clean the small pieces of my pumping parts as well as the nipples for my bottles, it doesn't scratch the bottles and gets all of the film off.  One of the things I read in a lot of the negative reviews was that it squirted water all over the place when putting it into the bottle.  I have had that happen with every bottle brush I've ever used, when you put something big into something smaller filled with water, of course the water is going to squirt out!  Just be careful and it doesn't happen.  I also read reviews that said the sponge tore, well I use this ALL THE TIME and neither brush is showing any signs of wear and tear.  I love the fact that the handle is really long, it makes it easier to wash the 9 oz. bottles.
