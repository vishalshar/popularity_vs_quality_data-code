I bought this for disposing of puppy pads. It's working out great for us. We use about 3 pads a day and a few handfuls of paper towels for near misses on the tile. It is very full after a week. It would be better to empty it twice a week, so as to not have to shove down the contents toward the end of the week. When closed, it's doing its job of eliminating the smells. You will get waft of stink when you push open the flap to make a deposit. It disapates shortly after the flap closes and then when the lid is closed. It's definitly a must to wash your hand afterward. Diapers, rolled up and taped might be a different story than pee pads since they're heavier and an easier deposit. Overall, I'm really pleased with the unit. It solved a problem in our home and looks good doing it.
