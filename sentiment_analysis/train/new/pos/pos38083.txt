Perfect for the Bob double stroller. Used this in conjunction with two 9 inch covers by the same company to completely cover my strollers dinged and nicked up push handle. Fantastic fit and super easy to zip on. If I had to do it again I would have purchased a set of these when my stroller was brand new.
