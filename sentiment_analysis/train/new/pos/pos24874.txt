I bought this for my 5 year old starting Kindergarten.  I thought I'd try a cheaper option before dropping $30 on a bento box.  Overall I'm pretty pleased with it. Although the description aims it at smaller children and toddlers, the portions of the box are actually quite big.  I can easily fit in a sandwich (or some chicken nuggets) in the large portion and two side snacks in the smaller sections.  I'm not really sure why one of the smaller sections comes with a lid and the other does not... It'd be nice if they both did but oh well.  If you keep the lid on one and it's closed, the food stays in the right sections no matter.  This fits nicely into his lunch box too.  My only real complaint is the top compartment, I do feel it's mostly unnecessary.  I believe it was probably intended for silverware but I don't find we have much need for it and because it's so deep in the lid, it means you can't put anything in the large compartment of the box that's not mostly flat.  For example, the compartment is big enough that I could throw in a juice box in that section with his sandwich but any juice box is too bulky and it won't shut because of the top compartment.  Overall not a huge deal, just something I see as a downside.  It found the lid was secure enough when shut, though I do have my doubts whether this will make it the entire school year but for the price I don't think I'll complain too much if it doesn't.
