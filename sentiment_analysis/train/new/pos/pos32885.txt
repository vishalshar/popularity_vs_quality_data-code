The Original Bundle Me has made traveling with our baby in the winter months much more convenient. Rather than having to throw on her little snowsuit and a blanket, we can slip our little girl into the Bundle Me. It fits nicely into our car seat. We also use the Bundle Me in her stroller. We received the Bundle Me as a gift and like it so much that we bought one as a gift for our friend's baby.As for the safety concerns, I was satisfied with the manufacturer's statement:"In line with JJ Cole's commitment to child safety, the Bundle Me has been tested to FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard) 213 requirements. All tests passed on the child restraint system, indicating that the Bundle Me product appeared to have little to no effect on the performance of the child restraint system."
