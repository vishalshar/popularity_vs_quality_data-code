I purchased the Britax Esprit stroller for my now 12 month old with the intention to use it when we travel by plane. I find that I am using it all of the time now. I really am happy with this stroller, you can not beat the quality for the price. Too bad they discontinued this model.I gave it four stars only because it has a few quirks and I figure five stars would be "the perfect stroller."Positives:-The fabric is very good quality.-Light weight and easy to fold and unfold.-Storage basket under the seat. (not the biggest but it is a good size.)-Easy to push even with one hand.-Adjustable leg rest is a nice feature for an umbrella stroller.-great price and good qualityNegatives:-The fabric forms a sort of sheild or hood over the top of the baby's head, this is too short for tall children. I fold it back but it is just a bit funky. (I still like the stroller though.)- The back support is a narrow piece of cardboard that slides into a pocket in the back of the seat. It is only the width of about two thirds of the seat and it runs down the middle. This is better than the strollers with no support but is seems that it would be nicer if it was wider.- The seat reclines by pulling a drawstring. It works OK, but I think the design could be improved.  Over all I really love this stroller and would make the same choice again. My Baby seems to like riding in it as well and will sleep soundly in it at times.
