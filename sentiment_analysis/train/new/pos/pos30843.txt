These are awesome leg warmers for babies, especially when you are giving your little one some diaper free time but its too chilly to leave their legs bare.  (I pare these up with infant absorbant tighty whities I bought from the Elimination Communication online store).  They don't fade when washed, didn't shrink in the wash either, (I wash them in cold).  The only drawback is that the elastic bands on each end are the same size.  So the bottom ones are great for around the feet and the ankles, but the ones on top are a bit tight.  After wearing them for about 30 minutes, my little boy will have a red ring around his thighs from the eastic band.
