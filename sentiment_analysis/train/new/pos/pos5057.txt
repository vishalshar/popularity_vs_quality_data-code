My husband and I got this for our road trips we'd be taking with our little one, who was 4 months old. He is on the longer side, so I wish we actually purchased this earlier than we did, because he's about to grow out of it and he's only 5 months now. Oh well, I'm looking forward to using this on baby #2 someday! It's an awesome travel, pop up bassinet, with a firm base and easy fold system. Once your baby isn't swaddled and really starts to move around, like swing his or her legs side to side, I'd not recommend it, simply because it's too small. Great for those little-little ones though!
