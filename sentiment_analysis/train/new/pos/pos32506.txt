We use this at the company I work at - we're in a shared tenant building, and the doors automatically lock behind you, requiring a keyfob to get in. However, we UPS and fedex visit our suite multiple times a day - and of course staff is in and out all day too. These allow us to keep the door free to swing open, and just pop it off at the end of the day to actually lock up.We tried a different brand previously - transparent sort of "U"/horseshoe shaped rubbery things, but after months of use, they stretched out and would fall off the door frequently. Since doors for businesses are often thicker than those in homes, I can't say that that brand was deficient in any way, but these work much better for our use case.
