This is my fourth car mirror and the best by far.  Here are problems I have run into with other car mirrors:Poorly designed attachment - the "adjustable" straps on one mirror I bought were so short, I can't imagine it adjusting to many types of vehicles and it did not fit around even the poles of my head restSmall mirror - if you can't see your baby without the mirror being in exactly the right position, it's pretty useless.Cheap/flimsy/foggy mirror - obviously this is a negative attribute in a mirror!This mirror is NONE of those things!  It attaches SO easily (I have an adjustable head rest).  It has a large clear convex mirror so you have great visibility to your baby - I can actually look in the rear view mirror and see her unlike every other mirror I have tried. All of the others are so small that you have to turn your whole head around to see the reflection - not safe while driving.  It is extremely easy to adjust to just the right angle and even when it moves around a bit from driving or baby playing with it, you can still see your baby because of the size and shape of the mirror.  It is just the best!
