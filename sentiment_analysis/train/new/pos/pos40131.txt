Bought this 12 oz. Avent Fast Flow Spout Cup (2 pack, Pink) to transition my 2 year old daughter from her milk bottle. She has been drinking her water from the 6 oz. Avent Soft Spout Cup (2 pack, Pink) for over a year now and we have had no leaking issues with it. At this point though, I would rather see her drink milk from a regular cup. The new cups are being used for water instead and the 6oz Avent Soft Spout Cups have been disposed.These cups do have measuring lines; the flip-top lid is great to have wherever we are since my daughter is always trying to find ways to play with the water. The cups I have received through Amazon are spill-proof and the only way my daughter has figured how to play with the water is by sucking it out from the spout and spitting it on the floor. She has tried throwing the cup and smashing the spout on the floors but to no avail.For those interested in knowing where these cups are manufactured - top & handle is made in England, the cup itself is made in China and assembled in the USA. The 6 oz. Avent Soft Spout Cup (2 pack, Pink) that I had bought over a year ago from a local grocery store is made in England.
