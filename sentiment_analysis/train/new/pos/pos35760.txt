Was looking for a double stroller to take on vacation to the beach, to use on the boardwalk and so on.  Considered the City Mini, but with the recall it was back ordered, so had to look at other models.  SO glad I got this one instead.  It is a bigger stroller than the City Mini, but well worth the weight!!  One thing we love it that my husband is 6'3" and it is the FIRST stroller he can comfortably push due to the adjustable handle position.  I have a 4 year old & a 10 mo. old & they both seem to enjoy it.  On the boardwalk everyone was actually begging to push it.  Even my 68 year old mother who has arthritis.  She dosent like to push it up hills, but REALLY enjoys pushing it on level surfaces.  It is a pleasure to push.  Were not runners, but I can imagine it would be amazing for that.  Kind a takes up a lot of room in the back of my SUV, but wouldnt go shopping without it.  Warning...it is heavy to load.  Great storage, and seat straps are really easy to adjust too!  Sun canopies are HUGE, love that!  Even with the girls weight diffrences it still pushes evenly.  Love the air tires, creates a nice cushion. Very worth the price.  Well made, not flimsy at all.  Solid.
