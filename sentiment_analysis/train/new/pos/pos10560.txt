I love this product, it's sturdy, lightweight with a bonus soft silicone coating on the grip and on the lever of the clippers. This prevents hands from slipping from the clipper just in case our little ones accidentally moves or jerk unexpectedly. Overall, this product exceeds my expectations as well as the price!
