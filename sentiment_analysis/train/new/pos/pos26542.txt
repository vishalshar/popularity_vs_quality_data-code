I bought these ducks for my 7 month old daughter. She loved them! All of them worked fine. I ended up giving one to an 8 month old niece and had to fight my 2 year old nephew to get the mother duck back! Lol! I promised him his own. It has been a week all ducks are still working fine. I will be ordering a blue set for my nephew. We don't use them in the bath, just as everyday toys for the kiddies.
