I bought this product for my toddler when I was breaking her of the bottle. She wouldn't drink milk from other sippies that are colored, only from clear bottles. I had a hard time finding sippies that are clear and not tinted, until this one. I've been using for a month and she loves it! She's very active and isn't always a good eater, and gets many calories from milk and it was very important to me that she didn't stop drinking milk altogether. I saw reviews regarding issues with the dishwasher, but I've always washed all bottles/ sippies/ accessories by hand and don't run them in the dishwasher, so I've never had a problem. If she drops the bottle a few times, the valve can fall out and you'll have to fish it out and put it back on, but it's not a big deal at all. Very easy to clean with the OXO bottle brush as well. Highly recommend! I've purchased another one now that this one passed the test.
