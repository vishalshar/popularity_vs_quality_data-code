I purchased this set so I would have a back up set of accessories to use while my other set was being washed, sterilized, and dried. I loved the Medela bottles because they are very easy to clean, small and portable, and it is very easy to read the amount pumped on the side of the bottle. I would have given this 5 stars but one of the breast shields doesn't always screw onto the bottle correctly causing me to spill milk that has collected between the shield and the rim of the bottle. I LOVE the steam bags included with this set. I hadn't used them until I got this set. I am very impressed with the steam bags. I use them at work to sanitize my pump parts before storing my pump away to take home. These bags make pumping on the go more convenient! Overall I am very impressed, and I would purchase this product again.
