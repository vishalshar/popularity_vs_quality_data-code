The stick on the wall ones never seem to work, so we went with this to hold and drain the toys after tub time. It holds a lot and can be in the way, but since we have a bathtub dedicated to the kids, and their bath it works perfectly. The only downside is it doesn't extend enough to go to the middle of the tub like in the picture. I guess we have a wide tub, but our daughter does try to slide it around sometimes and it falls apart if it gets to far from the edges.
