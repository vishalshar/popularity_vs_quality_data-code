Our 3 month old daughter loves looking at this - the bright colors esp. Whenever she gets agitated, we show her this book, and she quitens down immediately! She in fact reaches out and flips the pages, though I'm pretty sure she isn't aware of what she is actually doing. All in all, a great buy. P.S. - the book doesnt have audio sounds, just pictures of animals and the sound they make.
