We have had the monitors for about 2 weeks now, and the wife and I love um. We are in a 2500sqft 2 story house with the main monitor at the top NE corner of the house, and the parent monitor(s) working very well downstairs, even to the SW corner of the house (As far as you can get away from each other). Occasionally the parent monitors have had problems talking with each other.Pros- Ok range- 2 different push-to-talk buttons on parent monitors, "parent only" or "child / parent"- kickstand to prop up parent monitor on desk- belt clip on parent monitor works great and its very light- touching the child monitor near the transmitter light, turns on a blue colored nightlight so you can see in room without waking up kiddoCons- Power button on Parent monitor is on long side of unit (the natural way to hold the unit will have you turning it off with your middle finger when you try to use it). Would have been better if Push-to-talk buttons were in that location and power button was on the left side of unit. very frustrating- Sometimes when parent monitor is charging, it flashes the blue battery light. (In a dark room it would be pretty bright)Other Facts about the Unit that are neutral.- the child monitor is the base transmitter so, trying to use the parent monitors with the base OFF will not work.- walking into the child's room with a parent monitor in hand, will wake-up everyone in the house from the feedback.Randy
