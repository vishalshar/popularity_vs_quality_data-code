This is a great changing pad. I like the fact that it is four-sided. It also allows for my daughter's head to be slightly elevated if you put her near the edge of the changing pad (which i normally only do if i have someone else with me, to watch her), which seems to help with her reflux. She doesnt like being completely horizontal, she likes any sort of incline.If you are looking for a changing pad cover, I would recommend this one:Summer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Green/BrownThere is also one tip I want to give first time parents that I would have found useful when registering ...Register for disposable "pee pads" (dr. office calls them "chux", or "underpads", etc). Amazon sells a bunch at reasonable prices (brand: Dynarex). They use these at the hospital and dr.'s office. You put these little pee pads over changing tables and they absorb any accidents. It will save you a LOT of laundry!!! Yes, you can minimize the occurences of accidents by putting a new diaper under the old diaper and other tricks, but no matter what you do you WILL have pee/poop getting on your changing cover frequently!! Downside is you will have more trash than you would have normally, but trust me --- when you are sleep deprived, it is a LOT easier to just throw away a dirty pee pad and lay a fresh one down then to realize that you have to do a load of laundry in the middle of the night holding a crying baby! :)here is the one i buy, normally can be had for $13 for 100 count:Dynarex #1341 Underpads, 17x24 in. 22 gram, 100 ct
