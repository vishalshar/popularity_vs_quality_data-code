We bought two more of these after receiving one as a baby shower gift. They've been wonderful for keeping our baby from punching her way out, and make re-swaddling easy after middle-of-the-night diaper changes. The material is soft and the velcro is secure. (I'll agree with other reviewers that it's loud, but if it was more quiet I'm not sure it would hold.) We always use the SwaddleMe when we're putting our baby down to sleep, and have also found it useful for wrapping her arms to comfort her during immunizations. I'm still not sure what the opening in the back is for - I'm guessing diaper checks, but since our baby is always wearing footie pajamas underneath, it doesn't help. (ETA - Seems the slot is so you can use the swaddle while your baby is in his car seat. We never did try that and our daughter has since outgrown swaddling.)For comparison, we also received a Miracle Wrap. Despite the loud Velcro, the SwaddleMe has been so much more useful. The extra fabric on the Miracle Wrap is cumbersome. It takes longer to wrap the baby, and our kiddo let us know she wasn't happy about it. She also managed to kick her way out of it every single time. Oh yeah, and Miracle Wraps are more expensive.Overall, I highly recommend the SwaddleMe. It's become and integral part of our newborn bedtime routine.
