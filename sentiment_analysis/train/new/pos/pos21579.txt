Pretty good, but make sure your wall is nice and clean and that you don't move them around after sticking them to the wall. I think i moved the alligator twice and it was the first thing to peel off. The edges of some of them also peel occasionally. also the picture is a little deceiving however, each piece is individual and can take up much more space than pictured. you have to cover up some of the animal parts to make them fit in the arc (like the giraffe and elephant feet). Also i'm not looking right at my daughters right now, but im pretty sure there's an animal missing in the pic that you get in the set.
