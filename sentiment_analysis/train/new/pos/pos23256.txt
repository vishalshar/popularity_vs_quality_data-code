Now first off I must tell you I looked around before buying this. I am disabled and money doesn't come easily.I needed something I could get out of the wayI needed something that was tough but not enormous or heavyI needed to be sure my kid was safe and not going to get outI also wanted to get a chair that I could get clean without needing a hose :)I found all of these things here. Feel confident your money is well spent, in fact you are saving compared to others that don't offer this.My wife just reminded me that the cover comes off easilythe strap are removable and easily hand washed, I do it oftenthe top tray comes off and can be washed somewhat easily.We have had this for well over a year (our daughter is 21 months) and we have put her in this since she was little.I try not to let this happen BUT,once in a while she will turn around and stand up in her chair (when I don't strap her of course, and supervised) and bounce repeatedly and the chair is still holding up fine. this of course is not ideal and ALL the force is going to the pivot point. THIS SHOWS it is strong however she is only 25 pounds and again I do not recommend letting a kid do this just letting you know it has held up to some abuse:)know that this will work for smaller spaces but is not a compact model hope this helps someone
