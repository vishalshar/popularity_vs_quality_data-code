i bought four  sets of these by accident.  I was going to cancel but then thought about all the baby showers and gifts I would be able to give.  I was  hoping that they would be worth the money and I was not let down.  Each mother was so surprised since they knew the cost of Kalencom and the quality.  I totally did not let them know that I got them on sale through Amazon.  These come with a bottle holder, small zipper bag,  and a changing pad.  They are super easy to clean and hold up very well.  Amazon is my go to for baby showers, Christmas gifts, etc..  I would never hesitate to purchase again.  High quality!!!!!!
