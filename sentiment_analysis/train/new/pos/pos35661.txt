Very glad we purchased it, was weary after reading some reviews but it arrived two days after ordering in a few pieces. I put it together by myself in probably then minutes max. the foot rest stuck a little but i watched a video review on youtube so knew it goes up very high and down straight. We  love this>> SO MUCH. Our boy is 6 months old and he is so easy to deal with when it comes to food time. I even let him make a mess.. on purpose to remove the washable cover for the first time and he used the regular chair a few days we love the handle.. SO easy. It isnt hard for me to push AT ALL.. and im a weak girl. no joke. But yeah easy to wipe clean easy to adjust straps Very fancy looking and it collapses pretty well but Is bulky in our very tiny apartment.. wouldn't trade it for any other non swivel tray kind because one hand to pop it open and shut IS THE BEST. our son is skinny and tall but it looks huge around him so there is room to grow!***UPDATE*** Jan 12 2015Room to grow indeed. Well my son is still using this hes now 3 He still has room to grow. It contains the mess and has been the prefered place to use playdoh finger paints etc. I love that the top tray is removable makes playing with moon sand and stuff a breeze and the latch works perfect > He loves it too, I was going to store it away now that he probably could do well at the table in a chair but he really wants HIS highchair :D still easy to clean and if you want to remove the entire tray part you just push the button and pull up... great for thanksgiving etc. otherwise I hope anyone that wants one more free hand will believe me when I say I push a button and in or out he goes so simple. Plus no need tofind a spot to set the tray it just swings open and stays there.
