This is my second one, I had previously bought one in store at Babies R Us shortly before my baby was born, for the same price. I opted for the magnet, because I wanted something for my van's exterior, as opposed to similar signs that suction cup to the inside of the window (which aren't as visible with tinted windows). It is a good sign for the price, but it does have some issues. Most notably, the yellow does fade in a few months. Not sure how much sunlight played a role in the fading, but my vehicle did stay outside in the driveway under Southern California sun. Before it fades though, the yellow is really nice and vibrant, but the sign could also benefit from being an inch or two bigger making it even more visible. The magnet did stay on very securely, never budged, even when I ran my van through a car wash regularly. Also, even though the yellow faded, the black only faded very slightly and the text was still effectively visible. For $3.99 it's not a bad sign that you can expect to last only 6-8 months before needing replacing for a nice new bright yellow one.
