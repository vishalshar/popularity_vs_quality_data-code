We had purchased this car seat 4 years ago for one son who hated his infant carrier. We liked it so much that when we had the next baby, we bought it again! I love the sliding adjusting straps, no more having to take the seat apart to thread the straps through the next hole up. Works great rear facing, reclines nicely and easily, and does just as well forward facing. Nice and cushy without being too much so. My only real issue was that the crotch strap only has 1 position, whereas some car seats you can place it further out as the child gets bigger. But I have skinny kids with little bottoms, so even this isn't a really big problem. Car seat works fine with my latch system.It is a bit (!) difficult to take apart to wash the seat cushion. Actually, the taking apart isn't hard, but trying to figure out where the straps hook back on is a pain in the neck. I finally settled on the older carseat for hooking it somewhere else, because I couldn't get the darn elastic to go where it was supposed to. Haven't taken the newer one apart yet, but should since they both need cleaned again. When I did put it through the wash, it pretty well kept it's shape, so that's good.Update: 2-14-2011. We used the older one until that child hit 5 and then switched him to a normal booster seat for the seat belt since you shouldn't use them after 5 years. Loved every minute of it. We're still using the one for our youngest son, 2 years now. In fact, we just had to adjust the back of the seat for the straps and still love the fact that you don't have to completely take the seat out of the car and unhook the straps, move the stuff, and restring everything! Just pull on the metal bar, lift the back, and pop the bar in place. We've settled for just using our shampooer to clean the seat instead of pulling it all off and not being able to hook it back on. If we were to have another baby, this is still the carseat we'd buy!
