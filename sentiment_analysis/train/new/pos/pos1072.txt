My baby was 9 pounds at birth and 12 pounds at time of purchase but her lil feet hardly hold newborn size anything on them, she's 2+ months now.  These play socks stay on perfectly with just the right amount of tightness so she can work at actually being rewarded with pulling them off eventually once she masters that skill...however in the mean time they stay on her extra small feet perfectly all through our play session and boy does she love these...they really get her excited...especially the crinkly butterfly one...so don't buy these if baby has larger feet than newborn size because these fit a baby smaller than that but they do have a small bit of leeway so I say newborn or smaller foot size these are perfect, otherwise go to babies r us you can find some with more of a stretchy material...these are not at all stretchy so they will either fit or they won't...I love them.
