This crib protector does just that, protects the crib from tiny teeth. It goes on easily as the whole length of the protector is Velcro which adheres to itself between each of the bars. It holds well and my 11 month old is more excited about the Velcro flaps that are on it to attach toys. There are 3 Velcro tabs that you can use to attach toys to for baby. The color is good and it held up well in the washer and I laid it out to dry. It is padded to protect the crib and baby. Great buy.
