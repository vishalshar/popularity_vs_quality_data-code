I have been cloth diapering for over a year now, and thought I had tried ever type of cloth diaper friendly cream, except for this one.  My son has had horrible butt rash the past 4 months.  Cracked and bleeding, raw and red.  I was at my wits end to try and find something that would work that wouldn't destroy my diapers and not have to use liners all the time.  My first go to was Motherlove Diaper Rash & Thrush cream.  This seemed to work good, however after a month his butt continued to be red everytime I put him in cloth with the Motherlove.  Earth Mama did nothing to prevent the rash or sooth it.  Switched to Grandma El's when it was still labeled as cloth diaper safe, it definitely helped a lot, but had to strip my diapers twice.  I still keep Grandma El's around for skin related problems or if I had to use disposables.  I was about to give up now that ammonia seemed to be the culprit, and thought maybe my diapers were the problem.  Alas, the diapers are perfectly fine, clean, stripped, bleached, sunned, etc.  So while researching online I narrowed it down to trying different creams.  I ordered CJ's and waited with high hopes, but low expectations.  Boy was I wrong!  I couldn't wait to get my son back into cloth when this came, and I am glad I didn't hesitate.  Not only does his butt look the best it has ever been, but he is back loving his cloth diapers again.  I cannot give this product enough praise.  While I know everyone has their own thoughts with what could have gone wrong, what their favorite creams are, etc.  I know that I have finally found the cream that best fits my son and I will never order another diaper cream again!
