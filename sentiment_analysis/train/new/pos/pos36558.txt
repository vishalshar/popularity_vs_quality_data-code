My daughter LOVES this toy, Because of this, we purchased multiple toys from this seller hoping to get an array of sounds and animals. Unfortunately, we got four pink pig balls that make the same noise as the other toy (orange tiger) so we're a little disappointed. We are saving the others for gifts, though - and now we have at least one back-up!
