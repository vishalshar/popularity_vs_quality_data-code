My wife started using the Medela pump that came with the standard size. Upon using it, she asked me to find her a smaller size. I could not find the Medela ones in stock anywhere or even on Amazon. I decided to order this one for her. She loves these and the kit includes various spare parts which is wonderful. I highly recommend this product as a replacement or different size alternative for the standard Medela pumps.
