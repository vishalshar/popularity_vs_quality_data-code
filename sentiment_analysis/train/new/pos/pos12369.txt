We were looking for a nightlight for our youngest son's room, and I found this gem! My twin boys have the turtle constellation nightlight, but that was nearly twice as much as this bear. It's cute, soft, and works great for what we need it for. We simply touch the back of it when we leave his room every night and it lights up for an adequate amount of time before auto shut-off. I highly recommend this product!
