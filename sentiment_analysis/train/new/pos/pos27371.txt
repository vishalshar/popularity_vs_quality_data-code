I have four kinds of baby spoon (sassy, gerber, toss'n'go, and these) and these meal mates spoons are my very favorite.I have been using these spoons for two months, from my baby's age of 6 mo to 8 mo.Pros:The most comfortable spoon in my hand, well-balanced, no sharp edges, not fatiguing like the sassy spoons and gerberA good shape for my baby's mouth, don't lose food on the way inHold just the right amount of food, I like a spoon that isn't too bigBright and cheerful colorsDishwasher safe, I have not observed any staining or bleaching from the dishwasherNice weight, not too lightCons:Yes, carrots do stain them.  Maybe reserve the orange one for carrots?  I really don't care about this, so I use them all for carrotsFood can build up around the back edge of the plastic coating.  If you're hand-washing, be aware of this spotNot great for travel because they're heavyAs for the other spoons I have:The plastic toss'n'go spoons are best for traveling because they're light and indestructible.  They are nicely proportioned for little mouths.The gerber spoons are fine, but not as comfortable or well-balanced as the meal mates.I really don't like the sassy spoons.  They do have the advantage of an extra long handle and they change color with temperature, but the plastic coating is too thick and too soft, and the spoon is uncomfortable to hold.  Worst of all, I find the sassy spoons taste like plastic,  Yuck.I'd trade them all in for these meal mates spoons.  I just like these spoons best.  A good, simple implement.
