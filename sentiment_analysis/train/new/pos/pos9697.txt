Although I have some complaints, I don't think it is necessarily the products problems; I have a feeling the manufacturer could compensate however, which is why I gave it a 4 out of 5. I have a Samsung plasma (pn51d7000) which uses 400mm VESA spacing but requires what I assume to be an 800mm VESA standard bolt because the bolts my TV needed did not fit into the holes used for mounting this device. Based on other reviews I have read, I decided to widen the holes with my drill. Once I did this, however, I found that because of the size bolts needed, I could not attach this unit to the TV because the holes on the mounting bracket were slightly too wide apart. To overcome this problem I used my drill to widened the holes ever so slightly by pressing the drill bit to one side of the already widened hole. After a few attempts the mounting bracket went on smoothly and I was able to finish the rest of the installation with no problems. Now that it is installed, as near as I can tell it works perfectly (I would prefer not to have an earthquake or child put it to the ultimate test!) and feel much less concern for the safety of the tv or my children.I don't know if this problem effects all of Samsung's TVs but I would assume they use similar mounting standards on all of their television sets. The product does work as advertised but it might require a bit of ingenuity to get it to mount properly. All told, between running to the hardware store and doing the actual work it probably took me a little over an hour or so.
