When I received the product, I was initally surprised that it was not a Graco brand product as listed in the product description and a shown in the accompanying picture. The item was instead manufactured by Ford and was sent with very generic pacakaging. Since I had never seen the original Graco product, I can't say how similar this one is to the original. However, it surprised and disturbed me that the product was described to be a Graco product when it was in fact from another manufacturer.That said, it seemed to work as it was supposed to, though I found it somewhat cumbersome to use. That is just the way the item functions. We received our carseat as a gift and brought while it traveling by plane, and we left the base at home. Without the base, which can attach to the latches, we needed to use seatbelts in the various cars we used while traveling, and therefore needed the clip. It has to be taken on and off each time we put the baby in and out of the car. It was sometimes challenging and often frustrating to get the clip to work properly and actually have the seatbelt be tight enough.In the future, I would consider a different type of car seat system that doesn't use this clip.
