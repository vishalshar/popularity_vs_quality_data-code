I love, love, love this bag.  I use it when I take my 89 year old mother with Alzheimer's out to dinner, the zoo, etc.  It is very fashionable, perfect size for carrying Depends, wipes and extra slacks in case of an accident.  The loops at each side of the bag for hanging on a stroller are perfect for slipping over wheelchair handles!  She can only drink Almond Milk so I pour the milk in a water bottle and throw it into the baby bottle bag.  No one would ever guess this is a diaper bag for an elderly loved one.  The price is rather high, but it was worth it to me to get something so suitable for my mother's needs without it blaringly saying my mother is incontinent and has to wear adult diapers!  It is beautifully constructed and believe me it has gone through a lot of use!  I can ditch my purse and put everything I need for the day in the numerous pockets it has. I have gotten loads of compliments - including from medical professionals.  I would highly recommend this bag for any aged individual that requires a bag that allows the freedom of enjoying a day out, having the private necessities readily available and no one is the wiser.
