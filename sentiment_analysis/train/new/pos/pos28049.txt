We travel a lot & it was becoming a hassle to take my son's bulky stroller on trips when it was not necessary as he got older. This stroller is very great for travelling. It works well for those that are tall to push the stroller around. It also works well for tall kids as my son has always been on the taller side. It reclines back almost all the way. There is sufficient storage and it is easy to use. My son really likes it!
