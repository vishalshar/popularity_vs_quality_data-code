Best thing ever. It keeps my baby's skin dry and diaper rash is history. The price is really good. I use them on top of my Charlie bananas cloth diapers. You need to touch the microfiber to know if it is wet because if you touch the cotton area that touches the baby skin you will not notice that she needs a diaper change. Do not buy small or medium size. Go for large! The small option is a joke.I bought 3 sets and that's all you really need. I wash them in hot water and line dry them. They dry super quick, probably 2 hours in the line (obviously you can use the dryer if you want)
