First of all, the overall design of this bag is super cute. The embossing is subtle enough for it to be taken to a work environment, but yet cute enough to make you happy :) I love the zipper pocket in the middle of the bag, separating it into 2 compartments. I also love that you can carry it by the short handles, or use the detachable, adjustable shoulder strap and carry it that way.However, like many other reviewers have said...the bag is big. I don't personally feel like it's SO big that you could only use it for travelling (a weekender bag, for example); I do feel like it's usable as a purse. However, because the bag is so big, it's also pretty heavy (empty). But even worse when you add all your belongings to it. For me, it was just too heavy to carry around as my everyday purse.Another note I'd like to make...most pictures of this bag show the backside having a loungefly logo. The purse I received did not have this metal plate on the back, in fact it has no logo anywhere. I don't know if that means this is a replica bag or what. I'm not sure if everyone received a bag without the emblem, but I just wanted to note that I did.TL; DR : the purse is very cute and well made, but it is a little big and heavy.
