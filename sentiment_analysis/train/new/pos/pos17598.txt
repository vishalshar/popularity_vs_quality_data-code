Update. I received feedback from the friend I bought this for. It's the only rattle her daughter likes and she won't even let go of it when she is sleeping.Great product. I'm dissapointed that this is being discontinued. It's hard to find a rattle with a thin handle for babies. I was given one of these for my first born 8 years ago. When my second was born I searched everywhere to find that rattle because we didn't have anything else he could wrap his tiny fingers around.Clearly, I bought this new one for a friend just in time!
