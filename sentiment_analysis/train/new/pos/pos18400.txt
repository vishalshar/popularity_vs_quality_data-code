This is a great clip I purchased to replace "Ulubulu Universal Pacifier Clip" because those clips are metal and started to rust after a while. This clip is very simple to use just place hook on pacifier and clip other end to baby garments. I sometimes clip it to the back of the shirt " neat trick" to prevent it from hanging on the floor when baby is crawling. So better to clip it right next to back of the neck rather than directly in front of baby. That way works as well but when your baby is crawling it will of course hand on the floor which is a germ issue if you don't have pacifier clip or want to remove it only to find they ask for it 2 seconds later. Also to unhook and hook is very simply and its safe to wash with just regular detergent. This Is a great buy I wish I bought it first before learning about metal pacifiers rusting the hard way.Hope this helps if so click the helpful link at the bottom and let me know. thanks
