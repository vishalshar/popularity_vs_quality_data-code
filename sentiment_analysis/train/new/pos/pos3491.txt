I like this sheet so much better than the thin ones.  It offers more padding and seems so much more comfy!  It is a tight fit, but I had no problem fitting the sheet onto my Eddie Bauer pack n play.  So, I would assume it should fit any pack n play.  Just make sure to wash in cold water, and hang dry.  I never put this in the dryer.  The only thing I don't like is the color.  It happens to match my navy blue playard, but I wish it came in some lighter colors.
