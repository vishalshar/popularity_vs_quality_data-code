Yes, this is awesome! If I could give it 6 stars I would! Now, of course, the thought of sucking out your child's snot is disgusting, but when they can't blow their nose, you have to do something. Most people recommend the Nose Frida, but you have to buy filters with that one. This one just uses ordinary tissues as the filter which saves a ton of money!This works by putting one end in the child's nose which leads to the compartment where you put a tissue. Then a long plastic hose goes up to the piece where you suck. No matter how much snot comes out, I've never had any get past the tissue paper (and I've used this for about 4 years so far with 2 different kids).The whole thing can go in the dishwasher and it has a mesh bag and 2 kid ends and 2 parent ends.Now, my kids do NOT like me to use it on them, which is normal. It feels weird to have someone suck out your snot. So, here's how I do it: Sit on the floor and lay the child back between your legs with their feet pointed down to your feet. Hold their arms and legs under your legs so they can't break free and hold their head still between your thighs. I know it sounds terrible, but you really can't use this if the kid is moving around, trying to get away from you. A few quick sucks on the aspirator in each nostril and you're done. There might be a few tears, but they'll feel better right away.
