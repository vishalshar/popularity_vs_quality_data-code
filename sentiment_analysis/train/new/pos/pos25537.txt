We bought the complete reindeer set (as well as a Santa Rubber Duck, sold separately) and put them on our front counter at our business.  Our customers loved it -- we received dozens of comments, people taking pictures on their cell phones, posting pictures to their Facebook news feeds and telling their friends.  It was great for business and getting our name out.  We'll definitely have them up on the counter again next Christmas!
