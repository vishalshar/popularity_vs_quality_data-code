I am surprised with some negative reviews with these bottles. You need to make sure you line up the tabs on the nipple. There are 2 tabs which line up in the nipple holder ( the part that gets threaded to the bottle). If these are aligned, it won't leak. My kid throws these bottles around, and they take some abuse. He has cracked one, but it was after months of use and abuse. We have several bottles and we gave done for the grandparents to keep at their homes as well. I think many if the leaking issues are user error, and not the product being faulty or well made.
