Assembly (B-): Not too difficult, but definitely requires two people.  No extra tools needed (except that one of the bolt holes for us was not drilled deep enough, so we had to fix it).  No assembly instructions attached but you can print them off online.  Takes about 30 minutes.Sturdiness and quality (A-): We contacted Westwood, and this crib is made out of mostly poplar and some rubberwood.  Not as hard as maple or oak, but much better than pine which will dent/scratch if you give it a dirty look.  When assembled, the crib is very sturdy and I'm sure it will withstand our to-be jumping boy.Color/Finish (C+): The color is very nice, but it is not as advertised online.  All pictures on Amazon and on their website show a medium-dark brown, resembling a medium oak.  The ACTUAL color is more of a medium-dark reddish brown, which looks more like a red mahogany or dark teak (see our customer image on the Amazon page).  Also marking them down here because there was a 1-inch scuff/dent on the head board which we will need to fix.Customer Service (A): This is unrelated to the crib, but we bought the combo dresser and it was missing some bolts, so we contacted the company and they promptly sent us replacements without any hassle.I also wanted to point out that in all the pictures, they have a cloth draped around the mattress support.  In reality, you can quite clearly see the metal legs behind the crib bars.As for shipping, note that this will not actually arrive in 2 days.  Amazon will hire a local delivery company who will contact you within a couple days.  We received our crib in 1 week and it was delivered right into our house.FYI this is made in Vietnam.
