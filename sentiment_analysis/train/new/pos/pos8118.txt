After doing loads of research online, by readding reveiws from other Mom's, I found this jogger to be a great choice. I purchsed this double jogger in 2006 after finding out I was pregnant with my 2nd child. My kids are only 14 months apart and I love to take them for walks. I had my daughter riding in it at only 1 month old, the safety straps for infants adjust easily and the backs recline & adjust seperatly. So my toddler could sit up like a Big Boy while my 1 month old could lay back and nap on our walks. My kids are now 4 & 5 and I still use it when we go to the Zoo, boardwalk, amusement parks, etc. It is very light, sturdy, folds up easily and the wheels are easily removed when needed to transport it. The only thing I wish is that the front wheel pivoted. When the children were younger & lighter it was no problem to lift the front tire to make tight turns, now that they are older and weight alot more it is harder to tilt it back to lift the front wheel up to make those tight turns. Also the black foam on the removeable safety bar had to be cut off after my toddler found it a great teething aid. I still used the bar without the foam covering and it worked great.
