I loved these for my son. When he was born he was near 8 pounds, and these fit better than any OS diapers I have. His belly bulged out bigger than his waist, so often bigger diapers would either be too tight in the waist or too loose in the legs. The low rise on these let me get a snug, below the belly fit that was also snug around his legs. He is 4 months old, 14 pounds now and they are at the end of fitting. They still go on, but are just barely long enough in the rise to still fit him.While they weren't absorbent enough for night time, they were plenty absorbent enough for him for daytime and naps.About a month after I started using these I noticed one of them had a small hole. I contacted the company directly, and it turned out the hole was covered by the warranty. Going through the claim process was super easy, and I had a replacement diaper about a week after I initiated contact regarding the hole.
