I have always put my son in the crib awake and turned this on and walked out of the room. He always falls asleep to it.  It is great!  You can adjust the length of the music and you can choose whether you just want music or the lights as well.  There are 3 different nursery rhymes that play. Initially sometimes the dolphin makes a creaking noise but this goes away as you use it.  The only downside for me is that my son now relies on it to go to sleep. He will go to sleep in hotels with some cajoling, but this definitely makes it easier.  It is not that expensive and I have purchased 2 more for each of his grandparents' houses.  Even though he relies on it to sleep, I would purchase it again.  I never have to rock him to sleep, he does it on his own.  Also, if he does not go to sleep right away, he will stand up and press the button itself. Now that he can stand in his crib, he entertains himself in the morning with it after he wakes up.  It is very secure with the straps on the side of the crib. I am never worried that it will fall on him or he will pull it down.  I have had it for a year and I have had to replace the batteries 2 times (use it every night). Takes 4 C batteries (and batteries do come with it when you purchase it).
