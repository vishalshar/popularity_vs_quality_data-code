I purchased this Nativity set for my mother, who collects Nativity sets.  I figured it was just oddball enough to appeal to her sense of humor, but still cute enough to keep on display.  The entire set is colorful and adorable, not to mention durable enough to let the grandkids play with without fear of breaking the pieces.  And sure, it's not a "typical" Nativity set... but given that this year also brought us the "hipster" Nativity set, it's certainly not the strangest one out there...Fun, cute, and child-safe, this is a great set for families, or for any friend with a goofy sense of humor.
