Love this bedding. The theme is perfect for our outdoors active family.  The bumper is very thick and cushey.  Have not washed it yet but the comforter appears very sturdy and well made.  Our baby loves looking at all the animals made from different textured material. Sheet pattern is very cute.  Also purchased the blanket to match. Great choice.
