I bought this a while ago for my 3 year old to make him feel like a "big boy"- just like his big brother- without giving me cause to worry about what he's drinking and where!  It's been a wonderful transition from sippy cups to open lid cups for him, specifically when he's running around the house with liquids other than water.It comes apart easily and washes great in my dishwasher.  I've never had any issues with reassembling the cup either.I do wonder what it is that makes these leak sometimes.  I have never had any troubles with it, but sent it with my son when he went to the grandparents and they had major leakage issues.  Maybe it's because I always screw the lid on with it in the closed position, so the liquid isn't drawn up the straw?  Not sure, I'm not very good at science or physics, so I can't say what it is that I'm doing "right." Perhaps someone else can give a clue as to what is causing this cup to leak for some people?
