I had a very hard time deciding between infant and child sizes because nowhere does it say which will fit a toddler. I have a 2 year old son who is a bit on the small side (18m clothes size). I went with the infant size and I'm happy I did. They fit him perfectly, but with very little room to grow. I am sure with the kid's size i would have cinched it up most of the way and had double layered suspenders. For me, these were perfect because they were just for a photo we were having taken and I doubt he will wear them again. The quality is great though, and they stay where they are clipped.
