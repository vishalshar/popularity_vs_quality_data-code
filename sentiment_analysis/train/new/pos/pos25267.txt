I was confused as to the difference between "6 months," "FAST FLOW (6 MOS. AND UP)," and "Variable Flow," "VARIABLE FLOW (6 MOS. AND UP)."  After much googling, it turns out Comotomo has exactly four model numbers on sizes:* NT1H - 1 hole, slow flow (0-3 months)* NT2H - 2 holes, medium flow (3-6 months)* NT3H - 3 holes, fast flow (6 months)* NTVF - Y cut, variable flow (thicker fluids)So some of the same "sizes" are listed under different descriptions for some odd reason. Hopefully this'll save someone from wasted time or from ordering the wrong nipple.A note about flow rate.  The Comotomo nipples do seem "slower" than nipples of other brands.  I don't find this a bad thing, as it seems that the flow is much more consistent than the nipples of some other brands.  Will report back once I get the variable flow one and do some comparison against the fast flow.-- EDIT 01/10/2013 --Meant to report back earlier about the variable flow vs the 3 hole, but...  Either way, unless you're actually using the variable flow for thicker fluids, I'd recommend using the 3-hole instead as it's more consistent.  The speeds are fairly similar otherwise.
