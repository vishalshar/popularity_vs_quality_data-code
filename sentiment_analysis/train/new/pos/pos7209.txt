I needed another set of tommee tippee nipples for my son's bottles.  He was still using the level one nipples at 6 months and so we decided to move him into the next level up.  Below is my thoughts:Pros:1.  Fit:  Fits the tommee tippee bottles perfectly.  No change in construction from the other nipples that the bottles come with.  I am assuming that the flow is faster.2. Transition:  The transition from the slower level 1 flow to the medium flow at level 2 was seamless.  My son did not really indicate that he noticed a transition between the two nipples.3.  Price:  I purchased this item as an add on.  There is not really much of a price difference between baby r us and these if you find the nipples on sale at the your local store.  The reason why I purchased from amazon is that I don't have to make a special trip and can have these nipples just delivered to my door, great plus for a new mom.Cons:1. Count:  I wish that the nipples come in a pack of three.  The bottles are usually sold in a pack of three, so if you are trying to get the same amount of nipples for your set, you have to buy two packs.  I do not know if that is a way you can have extra nipples on hand but I would rather have the same amount of nipples that the bottles come in.I would purchase again since my son is into the tommee tippee bottles.
