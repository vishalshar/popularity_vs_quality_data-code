I'd give this bottle ten stars if I could!!  I'm on my third baby who unfortunately has reflux, and I wish they had these bottles and nipples when my boys were babies.  I have tried countless brands, sizes, styles, etc of bottles and nipples for my 7 week old little girl and she was still fussy, choking, and spitting up constantly, even though she was on medication for her reflux. Her pediatrician gave us one of these bottles to try and I was absolutely amazed at the difference at feeding time.  No gagging, fussing, choking, or spitting up during or afterwards. I immediately noticed that she was getting a much better latch on the bottle and that every part of her lips were actually making contact with the nipple.  I went and bought six more of these bottles because of the vast  improvements at feeding time. My daughter seems much happier now when she is taking a bottle as opposed to nursing.  The shape and texture of the nipple is very similar to a woman's breast so for us there is no problems with nipple confusion any more. The only thing i would change is to make the flow a little slower on the slow flow, but other than that this bottle is perfection!!! One odd little fact that it took me a while to figure out is that the slow flow nipples have the number 2 on them (the mediums are size 3) and apparently there is no size 1 nipple. I thought that was a little odd and wanted to add that tidbit to my review because I spent quite a while searching for a non existent size 1 nipple to purchase.
