So I was ULTRA paranoid buying this. As a first time parent you are really nervous to make sure you pick the right bed. I would say my daughter never slept in her crib until about 4 months. Everyone kept commenting that it was too hard and I should think about buying another one...I was like  "this is one of the most expensive beds on the market soooo why would I replace it??!!?!"After doing more research and talking to more people it is important for your baby to sleep on something that is firm compared to very soft. So this is your mattress where it has a infant/toddler side where it softens a little on the toddler side. My baby loves her bed now and sleeps almost through the night. (The important thing we NEVER did in the beginning was getting her on a schedule. After we did that, DRAMATIC difference)The only thing I wish I knew before buying it is, the outside of the bed is wrapped in a thick(ish) plastic (easy to clean in case baby wets bed). It looked like a soft material online but I was a little disappointed it was a plastic liner over the mattress.BUT it has great springs and you can tell it is a quality mattress. So overall I have had success but before she started ACTUALLY sleeping on it I was a big nervous I was going to have to replace it. I would say if you want a firm quality mattress this is for you!
