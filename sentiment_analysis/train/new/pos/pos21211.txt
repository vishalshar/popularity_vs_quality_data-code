I have yet to find an Aden & Anais product that I don't absolutely love. I know some people don't like the Pinzon by Aden & Anais blankets as well as the regular boutique ones but personally, I love both of them. The boutique ones are slightly more sturdy feeling than the Pinzon version but I LIKE that they're different. The Pinzon version are a bit more light and gauzy so I like to use them as the first blanket when double swaddling my little guy and then use one of the boutiques for the next swaddle. At first I was using two of the regular blankets and it just felt like a bit too much blanket, doing it this way with one Pinzon and one boutique works much better.The Pinzon prints are also SUPER cute, I wish they'd put out a larger selection because I like them better than most of the boutique prints. I also have not had an issue with them being "rough" like I've seen some reviewers say. The Pinzon ones I have are just as soft as the original Aden & Anais blankets that I have, only difference is that they're a bit thinner.
