My 8 month loves this mat!! The mirror is awesome! They only thing I think that could make this better would be more padding. Other than that it's great! The Amazon pic of it does it no justice. It's super colorful and I put it in the wash on delicates and lay out to dry. Every time it's washed it seems like it gets brighter!
