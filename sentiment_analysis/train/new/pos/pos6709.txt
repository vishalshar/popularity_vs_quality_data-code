These new breastshields worked out perfectly!  I have been pumping for my 5 month old for awhile, but I suspected I had the wrong size.  I get more milk with these new medela breastshields already.  I would recommend anyone who is having issues with pumping take a good look at their breast shield size, there is a handy chart on Medela's website.  I will probably have to order a second set to keep at work now.
