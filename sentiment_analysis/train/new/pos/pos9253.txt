We purchased this crib sheet in 2012. It fits a standard crib. We got the blue color. The packaging was nice and secure and shipping was in a timely manner. The main reason for me to get this plush fitted crib sheet was to keep my son warm in the cold winter months on Michigan and Illinois. However, we have used this in summer as well and it does not overheat.Pros: It fits beautifully around a standard crib mattress.  The material is super soft and plush, much better than those synthetic fiber mixed sheets.  The color is so beautiful and does not take away from the surrounding decor. Not harsh at all.  The elastic around the sheet is nice and seems to be very well made.Update after 1 month:We have washed this fitted sheet many many times. Thrown it in the washer along with other clothes and dried it in heat setting of the dryer. It has neither shrunk, nor pilled not faded. It has held up extremely well. My 2 year old loves to rub his face on it. It does not stratch him and he has very sensitive skin (eczema prone).Update after 2 years (2014)- yea, we have had this fitted sheet exclusively on my son's crib for 2 years and not once have I had the thought that we should change/replace it. It is still as good as new and the color is still the same as we got it first. Not shrunk a bit and very soft still even after repeated washing.Verdict: This is an absolutely amazing crib sheet that is going to work not only for your first child, but can be handed down to future generations. Its that great! The price is unbeatable.
