I bought this assortment of toys to bulk out my daughter's toy collection at age four months. She is now seven months and still plays with these toys (some more than others). They're good for taking in the car or keeping in a specific room where you need to keep the baby busy for a bit (laundry, your room, etc) and they're easy to pick up and get out of the way. I have not experienced paint chipping like the reviewer before me, but we haven't had these all that long. Overall I am pleased with this set.
