The "Space Duck" was a small gift (along with many other things) for my GF.He is super-cute and seems to be of high quality manufacture. The rubber is free of defects and the "paint job" is colorful with no fading or bleeding into adjacent areas.The only thing to note, neither good nor bad, is that his little helmet is removable.These are cute, well-made, LIMITED EDITION ducks. Buy them!...gonna go watch Howard the Duck!!
