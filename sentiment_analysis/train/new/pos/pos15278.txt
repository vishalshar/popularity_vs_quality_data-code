Sadly I came here to buy another seat but now see that it's discontinued. I see their new model has a belt. What a shame. We have Eames fiberglass chairs. The booster is perfect for this. Doesn't scratch the chairs and stays put. Not having a belt is not an issue as this is used for three years and older. Although my two and a half year old fights with my daughter about who gets to use it. Found an older model on a bidding sight so I hope I get it.
