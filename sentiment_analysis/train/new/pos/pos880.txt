Being a first time mother, I was set on having the best of everything for my child. Looking for brand names, top products and everything brand new. That on it's own was expensive and still is!I purchased one diaper bag elsewhere and found myself stuffing it full to where it wouldn't fit anything. It was cute in size and just a pretty bag to carry around. It got dirty and after looking at it two months after having it I felt so bad I spent so much money on something that wasn't as useful to me as I thought it would be.I then found this lovely set on amazon. It's an amazing 8 piece set and perfect for a new mother. It comes with a bottle holder (good for one bottle and maybe a small ice gel bag to wrap around the bottle), a mini bag (great for my sons insurance cards and a folded copy of him immunization cards), a mini pouch (I place all his medications in it), a diaper changing bad (super easy to clean), stroller straps (never used), organizer (I use this in my sons sock, beanie and gloves drawer), a small medium size bag (on the go bag) and a large bag (for travel.)All items in this package have been super helpful in keeping me organized. They're easy to clean, all I do is use a lysol wipe to clean off any spills on the bag itself and esp on the changing pad. The changing pad is a good size where it fits more than just my baby's bottom. I love the smaller pouch I use for medicines, makes carrying it all a lot easier and it fits a lot. I carry the saline spray, tylenol, advil and vitamins in that little pouch with the syringes.It's such a helpful bag and for the price I can't complain.
