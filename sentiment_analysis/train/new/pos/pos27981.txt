It's just a plain board, that you can definitely purchase at a local hardware store.  I was expecting something a little different, considering it was $25.15 with shipping, maybe a logo or something fancy on it to make me feel that it was worth it.  However, I cant complain too much because although it is annoying to see what it is, the company recommends to buy this board, and you can't take a chance when it comes to a baby, so I would have paid hundreds for this stupid brown board, and you should too.
