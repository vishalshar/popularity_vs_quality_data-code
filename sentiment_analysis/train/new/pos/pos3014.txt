I needed something to contain my 7 month old son's toys in the living room. We did not need or want a big toy box, and I wanted something that would not hurt him if he fell on it. This box (and the medium, which I also bought) fit the bill for us. They are perfect.I love the bright, whimsical colors. The large is big, but not as huge as it looks in the pictures I see here. It has green plastic clips for the sides to help it stay open more reliably. I have added some photos with a wii remote and baby links for scale.The description here says "easy for little hands to carry." That's true, but the bottom of the bins is so flimsy, it will hang down and drag on the ground when carried if there is anything at all in the box. For soft or lightweight toys, it would be fine, but don't think Suzy and Billy (more like Hayden and Kaydyyynne?) are going to be able to fill it with heavier toys like trucks and blocks and haul it around. That won't work.But, having said that, I would buy it again, and I would recommend it to others. Love it!
