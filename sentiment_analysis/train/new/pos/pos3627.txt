I was looking for something I can use on our trip to Las Vegas with our infant, and I found a review on this item "Lilly Gold Sit 'n Stroll 5-in-1 Combination Car Seat/Stroller", so I ordered it and the product is FABULOUS. 5 in one is just awesome; Car seat, plane seat, stroller, easy to control, etc,etc, cannot be compared with any other I have seen so far. While in Las Vegas, a lady Bus driver at McCarran International Airport car rentals, said and I quote "I have been working here for thirty years and have never seen something like this, it's Fantastic". The folding needs a little practice but overall it is awesome especially with the removable sun shade. Very good for vacations and travelers. One thing does it all. The retractable handle make it ideal for space saving like in elevators, etc. It can be used as front facing or rear facing and came with all the straps to do that. Everywhere we went people were starring at us like never before.Good buy!!! Lol!!Lilly Gold Sit 'n Stroll 5-in-1 Combination Car Seat/Stroller
