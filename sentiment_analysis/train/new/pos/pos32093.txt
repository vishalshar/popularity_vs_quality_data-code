Our 7 months old loves his pup-pup.  He has had it since he was 3 months old and is a must have for the diaper bag when we go on outings.  It is small enough to easily pack but large enough for him to hold, shake and even chew on.  He has been using it on an allmost daily basis for 4 months and it has held up well.  He doesn't play with the taggies themselves much but the rattle sound is soft and soothing and the taggies offer a bit of color for interest.
