Im so glad I purchased these larger flanges. I was having trouble with milk supply and thought perhaps it's the flange size. My Ameda came with standard size flanges and I'm pretty too heavy. I know they say breast/cup size doesn't matter and it may or my not for some but it did for me. I'm a 38D sometimes DD depending where I buy a bra. But also, my nipple is fairly large. I used the Large flange and pumped and it was WAY more comfortable with the large flange size than the one my pump came with. Not everyone fits into the "standard" size. Sometimes you just need something more comfortable. I'm glad I went for comfort because now pumping isn't a painful chore!***Please rate my review as "Helpful" if it helped you because it helps me too! :) Thanks!***
