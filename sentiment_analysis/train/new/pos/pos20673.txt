I own both the Medela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump with On the Go Tote and the Philips Avent SCF332/01 BPA Free Comfort Single Electric Breast Pump.I've never managed to express from both breasts at the same time with the Medela. The reason is that expressing is never easy for me, I often have to take several pauses to get the milk flowing again and that is impossible to control and manage on 2 breasts at the same time, so my fault, not the pump's. I can only write about how the Pump in Style works while expressing from one breast only.Comparing their advantages over the other:AVENT CONS:- Gentler on the nipples. Avent's vaccuum builds more progressively, Medela's build more suddenly and it hurts my nipples.Plus Avent's got a silicone shield sleeve that makes it much more comfortable, altough the sleeve won't work when the breast is really full.- Smaller and less cumbersome- Easier to operate- Less leakage and more comfortable to use. Avent's design allows you to sit back, with the Medela you have to sit really straight or lean forward to avoid milk leaking back from the shield- More suited for smaller nipples. With the Medela it takes several tries to insert the nipple in the shield straight without touching the sides, which will hurt even more.MEDELA CONS:- More powerful- Easier to dissemble and cleanI prefer the Avent and have managed to express much more milk with it with no pain and raw nipples. The Medela made expressing uncomfortable and hurt my nipples.
