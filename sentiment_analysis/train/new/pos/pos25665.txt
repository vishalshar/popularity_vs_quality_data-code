This package contains two tree decals. Each decal comes in four main parts (for the tree), with a series of smaller decals for the leaves, birds, etc. that you can place wherever you'd like. I'm not going to lie: putting the tree together perfectly took me a while. But the decal was easy to remove and reposition as necessary, and the finished product was worth it! I had a few extra birds and leaves leftover from the first tree, so I distributed them around the nursery in fun places -- at the top of door frames or sitting atop furniture -- for my little guy to discover when he's a little older and can finally see that far.
