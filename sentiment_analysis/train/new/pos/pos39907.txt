I received a few of these containers at my baby shower. Once I started making baby food I found these to be the best of the three types I have so I bought more. The silicone is thinner than some of the other containers I have tried so it is easier to pop the frozen food out for long term storage. I freeze my purees then pop them out and store it in labeled zip top bags. I also like that they are individual cups (unlike ice cube trays) so I can keep some on hand (especially great for leaving the house. They seal tight and I have never had one leak in my insulated bag while on the go. I wish they came in more colors so I could color code a larger assortment of food but masking tape on the trays seem to work just fine. The lids are sometimes hard to get open when fresh from the freezer because of condensation so you have to dry them off and also if you fill them too full (things expand when frozen) and the lids will freeze on. Overall a great product for freezing homemade baby foods and you can use them without lids to make homemade popsicles.
