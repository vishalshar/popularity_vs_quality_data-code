These newborn diapers are my absolute favorite!! I have 5 months of experienced use with them & believe they made a world of difference for a cloth diapering novice as I was when I started. They take a while to completely dry when hang-drying, but since they are newborn diapers that won't need to last years, I felt fine throwing then in the dryer on low heat to dry them quickly. These diapers made me fall in love with All-in-Ones and I quickly added 12 Grovia O.N.E.s to my stash. Amazing quality that lasts!!!
