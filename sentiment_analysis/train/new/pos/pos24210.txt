Having this play area has been a LIFESAVER! It keeps my little one entertained so I can have a moment without her in my arms! This has many bright and colorful distractions along with my daughters favorite the triangular music and light box! It plays a few different melodies and also has a feature that anytime it is knocked or kicked the music and lights turn back on.  I also like that the sides can be positioned up so that she doesn't roll out of the mats area so easily. I was skeptical about the plastic "wall' pieces and that they would be flimsy but when put together properly they hold a 6 month old just fine! All the toys are able to be moved to different tabs or even different toys. The colors in the mat are vibrant to catch baby's eyes and the mat is nicely padded for hard floors. All in all I would definitely suggest this to anyone looking for something for a playmat and tummy time for a little one!
