I can see that most of the complaining is about leakage from the bottles. First, you have to keep in mind that for some people a couple of drops are a tremendous leak specially if the product shouldn't leak at all. That's why you have to follow instruction for everything, not just baby bottles. I have used several brands including the first Avent bottles. This new BPA Free bottles bought them to replace 2 old from a different brand (I really wanted to use and try these new ones) for about 2 months already and haven't had any problems, if I ever have a leak I just screw it back and done! I even give this bottles to a friend as a gift and she cannot be happier.Always keep in mind that people think different, this is not a bad product and will always recommend it.
