I've been meaning to leave a review for this stroller for quite a while. Alright, it's been over four years, but with kids you get a little sidetracked. Now that we're finished using it and put it up in the attic for storage, I thought I'd write a review about how satisfied my family is with this product. A little pricey but worth the money. We bought this before our second daughter was born and our two year old loved the sit-or-stand option. As the baby got older, it easily transitioned from and infant and toddler stroller to a two toddler stroller. Good solid construction, a little heavy, but it's solid. We've traveled with it and it easily folds up and locks into folded position so we could gate check it when flying. There's a large basket underneath to store the diaper bag and other small items. We had a small problem with the tray and Joovy customer service went above and beyond to correct the problem. You can tell customer service actually wants to help resolve any issue. Highly recommend.
