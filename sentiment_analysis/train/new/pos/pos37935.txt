I got this toy for my daughter when she was about 2 months old and it was not a hit at first. But now that she's almost 5 months, she loves playing with it. She loves chewing on its ears and face and enjoys squeezing its body. She has not used the teethers too much yet, but I know that she will soon. It is big enough that she can hold it without difficulty and pick it back up if she drops it. The colors seem to be attractive to her as well, and I like that it is not too garish. I think this will be one of her favorites for quite a while.
