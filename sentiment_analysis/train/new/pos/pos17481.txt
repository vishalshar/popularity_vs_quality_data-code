I love these spoons! I have a 3-year-old and 1-year-old twins, so I have used a LOT of baby spoons in the past few years.  These are my favorite.  I love that the handles are super long.  The bending feature is great for two reasons: 1. when feeding the babies, I can twist the spoon in any fashion that makes it easiest to feed ...depending on my proximity to them while feeding (sitting across, next to, or feeding them from behind while seated on my lap); and 2. I literally fold them in half and stick them in an Itzy Ritzy pouch, which then gets stuffed in their milk bag for on-the-go feedings (saves space and keeps them clean).  I have also washed them countless times in the top rack of my dishwasher and they are in the same condition they were in when I first opened the package.  The four-pack is the way to go, because it makes the cost per spoon less expensive.  When we've moved on from using them for regular feedings, they will become part of their arsenal of "play" kitchen items.
