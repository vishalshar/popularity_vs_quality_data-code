As a first time mom, I was reading reviews and comparison shopping like crazy to find the perfect high chair for our son.  Some of the other reviews said people had problems with their chair being wobbly or unstable...I disagree. I put our chair together myself, and have had no stability issues at all.  The harness clasps are tough to click in, BUT I would rather the clasp be difficult over too easy to get in/out of (no one wants their baby climbing out of their high cair!).  I will say that you need t take care to keep your child's (and your) fingers away when buckling the clasp.  The only negative I have come across so far is that the wheels are on the front only, which makes moving arounda little tricky. We have taken the seat off of the legs multiple times when visiting family, and it is SO easy to convert from high chair to booster, and I love the ease of strapping the booster to a normal chair! Overall, the chair is wonderful, the colors and pattern of the wasabi chair are great & have earned us many compliments, and you can't beat the portability options this chair has! My son is comfortable in it, and safe in it. What more could I ask for?!
