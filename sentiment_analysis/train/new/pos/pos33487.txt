We had a long road trip home coming and we needed a portable bottle warmer. We took a chance on this one since it was cheap and if it didn't work we weren't out much and could stop on the way and pick up a more expensive one. That was not necessary, this bottle warmer worked quickly and effectivly. It takes about 10 minutes to take a bottle from room temp to warm (our little lady likes them a little warmer than most, too). It seems like people thought they could get a warmer that acted like a microwave and would heat the bottle in seconds... We still use it, now for jars of baby food and it works amazing for those as well, taking only about 3 minutes to heat those. I would recommend this for anyone!
