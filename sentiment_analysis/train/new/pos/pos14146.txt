This product is good quality and does exactly what it is intended to do.  My kitchen chair has a cushion covered in leather and without this product my booster seat was making indentations in the cushion.  I put this down under the booster seat and it does not leave any marks at all.  It is also easy to clean and has a rubber grip on the bottom that prevents it from sliding around on the chair.I bought this to go with the Prince Lionheart BoosterPOD in charcoal gray and they match perfect and look great in my kitchen!Prince Lionheart BoosterPOD, Ash Base/Charcoal Grey
