This is our second crib, and the exact one we bought the first time. The first crib we got, had some damage to the backboard, I ended up actually having to go to home depot and finding some wood repair putty and paint to fill in the nick. I blame that issue on the shipper. Only advice would be careful and expect some small damage from shipping as the box its shipped in isn't meant to take a beating. Although you can probably ship it back for a replacement, it was way more hassle to do that, then for me to learn how to repair the wood :)The 2nd crib we got was in perfect condition after being shipped. That was good news. Overall this crib is excellent. No other issues so far. We do not use any bumpers or have anything in the crib besides basic bedding. Our toddler still sleeps in the crib and we purchased all the add-ons to convert this crib to a toddler bed later on (still in crib mode). Since we don't have bumpers, he does toss and turn at night and we hear thuds occasionally as he hits the sides, but the crib holds up just fine.The only questionable thing is the backboard tends to bend as our son hits the back of the crib. It hasn't caused any damage or broken the crib, but you can see some outline edges that are not painted because the board has separated slightly from the back wood frame.
