I want to start off be saying that the opening in this toy can only fit an iPhone 4 or 4s, so as of December 2014, it's severely outdated. You can make a 5 or 5s fit if you put it in kind of slanted. A 6 or 6 plus doesn't stand a chance of fitting. Once I upgrade my phone, this toy will no longer be of much use. Your baby can still play with the dangling toys, but the phone opening is useless. I still like the toy and my son does also. Maybe you can find a way to rig a larger phone to fit over the opening, but it may be a hassle. It would be nice if they made this toy to accommodate larger phones or a wider variety of sizes. But right now, I can't really recommend this toy considering it's made for the iPhone 4.
