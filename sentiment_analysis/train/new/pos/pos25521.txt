This is a great carrier, fantastic value for the price. It seems like baby is very comfortable in it as she usually goes to sleep as soon as I put it on, even if she's in a bad mood - in fact I first started using it in an attempt to calm her down as when she really gets going, the only thing that will calm her down is being held and after a couple of hours you get tired! It's great for quick trips to the local stores or to wear around the house if she's cranky as she loves the closeness and the constant motion. I've been using it since she was about 7lbs, she's now near 10lbs and there seems to be plenty of room yet for growth. It's comfortable for me to wear to even with an old shoulder injury, though you have to adjust the parent straps correctly otherwise baby will hang too low giving you a backache, but that's easily fixed. It's easy to get her in and out, the only downside is the front pocket is too small and tight fitting to be any good for anything at all - I wouldn't recommend using it for bulky things like keys as they'll dig into baby - but that's what diaper bags are for isn't it!
