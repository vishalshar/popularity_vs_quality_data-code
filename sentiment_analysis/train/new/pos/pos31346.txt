I was searching for the perfect infant spoon to use for my baby's introduction to solid foods. I was shocked how difficult the process was! I just wasn't really sure which direction to go. I actually spent hours searching and researching so many different spoons! The biggest obstacle for me was finding one that wasn't too big for his little mouth! Baby spoons seem to have increased in size! I came across these and read the reviews and figured they were worth a try. The price was definitely right!These spoons have turned out to be the best few dollars I have spent! I am so glad I went with these! You get 16 spoons! Which is way more than you need, but perfect so if you lose one, or leave it behind, no big deal! You can also keep a spare in the diaper bag. They are the perfect spoon for any baby just starting on solids, and perfect for little hands to hand while practicing on their own.I also bought the bowls made by the same company, so the spoons and bowls match perfectly! And I do not throw these away..we have reused them several times! They have held up nicely both in the dishwasher as well as being hand washed.
