We use this everywhere!!  I have tried the "Kalencom 2-in-1" and hated it...this Fisher-Price 2-in-1 was in a review from another user.  So happy I ordered this one with the other one at a loss.  This is bigger but portable enough as need be, comfortable unlike the other one.  We ordered this when my girls started potty training, for emergencies but now we keep it in the car for places that don't have a clean bathroom, my girls will prefer this over a dirty public bathroom - we put all the seats down in our mini-van and its like their personal bathroom!  We also used this camping, make a separate section off in the tent for late nights and when they couldn't walk far.  As for the top attachment we use it in the house or even when visiting friends.Also, you can definitely use regular plastic bags and just put paper towels for absorption but I order the "Nature Reward Toddler potty chair liners" they are cheaper than the ones sold for the fisher price - it fits and works just the same.I have owned this for over 3 years now - definitely worth it!
