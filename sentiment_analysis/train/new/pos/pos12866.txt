Thought this was very helpful to block out the NYC wind in the late fall and winter. (And obviously the rain.) Felt comfortable with this because of the side netting that allows good airflow. The plastic took a little while to gas off, so don't wait until you need it or it will stink a little bit.  Good hand hold flap.
