My daughter got this as a birthday present 18mo ago, in the hopes that it would help her sleep alone.  She still struggles with sleeping alone but she loves the bear and it has helped some with soothing her to sleep.  The bear is very soft and easy to spot clean.My complaint is with the motorized heart within the bear that does the heartbeat or vibration.  We are on our 3rd heart since getting the bear.  Our first heart wore out within 6 months.  It was not a battery problem, but a piece within the motor wore out causing a loud screeching noise when it was turned on.  Our second heart worked great for about 4 months until I had to change the batteries.  After that, it completely stopped working.  I tried several different new batteries with no change.  Our newest heart has been working great for over 6 months now (and I hope this continues).  I did notice that this latest heart lookes different to the previous two hearts, so I am hoping they have worked out any issues the previous hearts had.With all the problems I have been emailing the company directly & they have been great about sending replacement parts.  I also have other CloudB products that have had zero problems & I am hoping we have the motorized heart issue fully resolved.Even with all the issues with the heart, I still bought one for my god-daughter last spring and I would recommend the Cuddle Cub to anyone looking for a nice alternative to the tradtional stuffed animal or for kids with sleeping issues.
