I absolutely adore the Sleepbelt. We took it to the hospital to make constant skin to skin easier for mom and dad. We used it the first couple of weeks to cosleep and still use it to keep baby upright on our chests after feeding due to reflux. This is not a carrier/wrap do dont expect to walk around doing stuff hands free. It's easy to use, soft material and is perfect for sitting or lying with baby on you and have your hands free. We ended up buying one for both of us. Highly recommend.
