A little tricky to install...but doable.  First things first, the included directions are not great, but not as bad as others seem to think.  You just have to think through it a little bit.If you have the summit, the hood/visor MUST be removed.  This will involve unscrewing the visor from the frame of the stroller.  We could not get the seat to sit properly with the hood attached to the stroller.Once this is done...follow the directions as instructed in the included instructions.  The next trick comes when you are putting the chicco onto the adapter.  In order to have the seat sit properly in the adapter, you MUST have the bars of the adapter properly aligned.  So what are you aligning it with?  The two gray buttons on the side of the chicco near it's base.  They should retract when you press the release button on the back of the carseat.  Those two tabs are what you're aligning with the two black supports of the car seat adapter.  When you place the car seat in the adapter, you can then move the adapter bars such that the black screw things are nearly touching the black support arms of the car seat adapter.  Before locking the bars in place with the two red tabs on either side, try and lift the car seat.  You should be able to lift the entire stroller off the ground.  The car seat should not come out.  If the car seat comes out, you need to move the bars a little bit.  Don't get frustrated, just move the bars a tiny amount until you're able to lift the stroller off the ground by the car seat.  Once that's possible, lock the bars in place with the red tabs.This last part is the trick...it's not hard...just take your time....unfortunately this last part is also not in the directions, so that's a deficiency on baby joggers end which is why I gave only 4 stars.  But this does work with the Summit XC as directed.  Good Luck
