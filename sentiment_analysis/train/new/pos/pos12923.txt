Good, strong product. Not hard to put together if you are some what mechanically inclined. Directions were decent. Would have given 5 stars if packaging / handling had been better. You need to make sure you open it as soon as it is delivered and check each piece to make sure there is no damage. This item had some damaged pieces, but I will say the return to amazon was easy and the replacement was delivered within a week of me submitting the return request. I would also suggest not returning the first item until you get the replacement in case the second would happen to have a different part damaged, you can swap out the pieces you need.
