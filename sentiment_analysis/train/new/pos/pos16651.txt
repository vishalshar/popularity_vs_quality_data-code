We have an older style faucet that doesn't have a flow diverter so in that respect this little elephant is great. It fits onto the faucet and stays put for the most part. The first time we put it on the faucet our baby let out a little squeal of delight and approval at his new bath-time friend. My only complaint is after a few weeks, the rubber rings/edges/seal on the inside have started to harden and crease, so the fit is not as tight as before. It still works, and serves the purpose of removing scary metal edges from eyebrow height.
