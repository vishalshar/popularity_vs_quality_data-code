It is a comfortable seat, very well designed, soft and functional.  My baby takes her snap easily when we put her on it.As with other seats, you have to level it after installation using an object above of the front area (...)  I don't know why this happens with "all" these seats.The adjustable headrest lets you change the height of the back at the same time the baby grows.  It is a very convenient thing.The recline feature helps you on long trips to have the baby in a good position for sleep.We are very satisfied with the product.
