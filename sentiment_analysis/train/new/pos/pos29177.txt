This Mommy Hook is amazing!!Yes, it looks simple, but it is so much more. I have tested it, and it can strongly hold 8 shopping bags!! It is so strong! When I am not needing to use it, it is hanging on my stroller and while it may appear large, it doesnt get in the way, or cause me any distraction at all. I have bought 3 of these as gifts and every mom I know loves it! Highly recommended.
