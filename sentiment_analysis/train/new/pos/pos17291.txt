Mine came with all openings for earphones etc in the correct places.  Works well in the case and absolutely fits my HTC DNA (I have a case on it).  However, note that the strap may come velcro'd on itself in a way that makes use of the strap confusing at first - I had to realize the end was doubled up on itself and unvelcro it - it at first looked like a seam at the end.  Fits both my husband's much larger arm as well as my own.
