This product would have gotten 5 stars from me, except one thing: it's hard to use one-handed. It has a lot of elastic in it and you really need two hands to put it on the whole car seat. Well if you just took your baby or toddler out of the car and are carrying them, you only have one hand available. If I'm doing that, then I still lay it with the shiny side up on the main part of the car seat buckles and seat, to protect it as best I can. It really does make the temp of the car seat cool even in 90 degree weather - no more hot buckles to worry about! It should be a staple for every parent who experiences hot sun and temps. *A better design would feature a drawstring style, so I could put it around the car seat and then tighten it, which I think would be easier.*
