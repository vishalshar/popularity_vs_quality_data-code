It was recommended to me to swaddle my kids to help them sleep at night.  Both of my kids outgrew their swaddles long before they outgrew swaddling.  My first was put in sleep sacks.  But I found these blankets for my second kid and I thought they were much better - it's sort of like the Snuggie of the infant world which is nice for them because you're really not suppose to put anything in the crib with them for a long time.  I only wish that they made bigger sizes.
