The only thing was the hook and tape it comes with is not strong enough to hold it up. But just buy command hooks and it is wonderful. My son loves it when he has to go and he can stand. He has always been to short to stand up to the potty and steps made him too tall. And he had a hard time aiming. Now I don't have to worry if he don't aim because this will catch it. I am also a single mom and love this because now he can learn how to stand and everything so when he starts school he won't be clueless.
