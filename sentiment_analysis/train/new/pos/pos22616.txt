Our family has two young children hence two car seats and therefore two of these.  They definitely protect the car seats and make moving them around easier.  We've checked the seats as baggage on the airlines several times and these covers protect the seats quite well.  As a bonus, we can put heavy winter coats or sleeves of diapers in the seat cavity kind of as a free bonus storage.The seat covers aren't very stable when rolling.  I mean, they're OK...but they do tip over a bit and you end up pulling the seat cover while it's on its side.  Not a terrible thing but minorly annoying when you're in a rush and dragging suitcases and kids and etc. through an airport.  Also, there's not a really easy way to attach the seat cover to a suitcase so you can pull both at the same time.  There's a canvas loop handle on top which does help but it's not a buttery smooth experience.Despite the minor flaws I would buy this again and recommend it to others.  It's a decent product.
