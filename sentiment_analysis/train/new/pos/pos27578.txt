Mom of 2 toddlers, used this seat daily for over a year:PROS: Skid-proof bottom helps it stay put in chair; perfect table height; easy (and removable) seat to clean; fold up for easy storageCONS: After a year of heavy-duty every day use, the seat material began to wear off, exposing the foam underneath (see attached pic)****After owning the seat for over a year, I called the Oxo company directly asking if they sell replacement seat cushions (as the actual base was fine, I just wanted to replace the seat portion that had worn ) Not only did they offer to replace it for me, but they did it completely free of charge and shipped it to me! :)  LOVE this product (and many of their other products!) and love their customer service even more!
