I was looking for an economical pacifier wipe (one that had more than just 25 or 30 in a pack) for my four month old who continually drops his pacifier and teething "tools." I like that these are non-toxic and food grade, and they seemed to work pretty well.  There were only two small issues:  1) they get stuck together so I often end up pulling out two, which if you're not paying attention can make them go twice as fast; and 2) they are a little dry. I expected them to be a little more moist than they are, so sometimes for bigger items (like teethers), I felt the need to use two.I don't know how much cleaner they get the things my son chews on, but I really feel better that I can at least try to wipe down surfaces and minimize his exposure to germs when there's no soap and hot water available.  I haven't seen any other products that come close in terms of number of wipes for the same value.
