We have twin 3-year-old boys, and these wings have been the best safety device we've used yet.  They are very strong boys (and often work together at trying to pry things open), and they have yet to overpower this lock (we've been using them for over a year).  The important details about installing this lock is to make sure you put it up high on the door but no higher than up 3/4 of the door length.  Also, you want to place it so that it is VERY close to the other door, so that when the doors are closed, there is barely 1/8 inch between the other door and this lock.  Otherwise, anyone can get enough leverage to knock this off by pushing the other door.  When the lock is RIGHT UP AGAINST the other door when they are closed, not even I can push the doors so that it comes off!
