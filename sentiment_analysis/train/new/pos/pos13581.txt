Our baby, now 5 months old, loves his Pupsqueak and has since he was 4 or 5 weeks old. The soft plush, the bright colors, that cute bark, the squeak, the rattle, those crinkly ears--what's not to love? He loves to touch and pat it all over, pulling and grabbing each part to make all the sounds. He loves to chew on the attached bone and squeeze it to make the crinkle sound.Like all Lamaze toys, it's well designed and well made. It even has a handy clip on top of the head to attach it to your carrier, bouncy seat or diaper bag.The only negative is it must be spot cleaned; my baby drools all over it, so when I wash it, it's out of commission until it dries completely, which is usually the next day. But that's the same with all soft toys that can't be machine washed, so it's not a serious drawback.
