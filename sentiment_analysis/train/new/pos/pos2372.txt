I love this blanket! I have a set of the classic muslin swaddles, a pack of the bamboo swaddles and a dream blanket. Yes, I love A &A. I wanted something in between for summer nights, and this seemed perfect. I noticed that it was Aden by A & A, so I was a little concerned with the quality and softness since this is the "low end" line. Expecting a little less, I am pleasantly surprised! Honestly, I don't really see much of a difference. First, it is adorable. It's even cuter in person than the picture shows. Looks, check. Second, I washed it (with Dreft on warm and tumble dried low on a gentle cycle) and it held up perfectly. No loose threads, no pilling, no excess lint...washing durability, check. Finally, softness...If I had a large version of this, I'd have to cuddle up to this every night myself. It's so soft and breathable. Cuddleability (yes, I just made up a word), check. We'll see how it hold up over time, but as of now, it's perfect.
