This is a great product! I bought this for my18 month old son and he loves it. I did see some people say that after awhile, the seat begins to smell like urine, so I have rinsed the seat after he uses it and have not noticed any smell at all and have now had this product for over 4 months :) My son was super excited about getting this seat and it has really helped him start potty training successfully. The cup that comes with the seat is big but it is perfect for little boys and you can take it off easily when they are big enough and do not need it anymore. The design is very cute and looks as it does in the featured picture. It has not faded at all over the last 4 months.The step stool is also a very good product and my son has no trouble stepping up and down on it. It has a good grip on the bottom and has not slipped or moved once when I have put it on the floor for him to use.I would recommend these products to anyone with a child ready to start potty training!
