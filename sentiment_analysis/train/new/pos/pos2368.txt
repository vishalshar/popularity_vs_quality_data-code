I loved this stroller so much that I had to write a (my first ever!) product review. It is, hands down, the most easiest to setup and use baby/infant product of all the things we've purchased since our son was born 7 months ago. Being a small framed person, I had my apprehensions about maneuvering a 21 pound stroller and add to it the weight of a growing child. But, my fears were laid to complete rest, when I took my son out on a morning stroll last weekend. To my pleasant surprise, it turned out to be almost a one-handed affair all the way and back! Those forever-air all-terrain wheels make it feel like you're walking on air. Again the one-handed easy folding technology, the large multi-position canopy with the see-through windows to keep an eye on your little one as you walk, are just more value adding pluses. Folded flat, it fits nicely into our Accord with plenty of room to spare. The inclining padded seat is so comfortable, that our son never complains once he is nicely buckled in. He, in fact took an unprecedented 2.5 hour morning nap in it after the walk, last weekend. That speaks volumes about the stroller's comfort. I did research(thank you babygizmo) and compared it to other strollers in this range.. and so far, it has made me extremely happy that we chose this one! Worth every penny that it cost for all the pluses.
