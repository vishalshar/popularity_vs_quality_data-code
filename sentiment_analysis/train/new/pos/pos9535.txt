I went through three different thermometers for my newborn before purchasing this one.  My baby would not hold still long enough for me to hold the temporal thermometer still long enough to get a reading.  I also purchased a digital thermometer from Vicks that can be used under the tongue or under the armpit.  It worked well under the armpit, but wasn't very accurate.  This one is easy to use, accurate and lightning quick.  It's a tiny reader on the end so there's no worry about pushing it too far into my baby's ear.  I wish I had known to purchase this one first!
