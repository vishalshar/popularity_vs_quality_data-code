The bedding set arrived slightly more blue-aqua colored but we love it (see our attached customer picture)! I'd recommend matching wall paint after the set arrives if you plan on painting. But the color is still a great color for a girl or boy's room.We put the bumper on to take pictures but I've heard you aren't supposed to have a bumper in your crib for safety reasons so we are going to keep that off.I also like that the set has a common pattern - the black w/white polka dots. It is easy to find everywhere. We found a black with white polka dot lamp shade at pottery barn and a black with white polka dot changing pad cover.
