Really wanted to like it, but alas! I loved the idea of a natural+organic diaper, but I am disappointed. The velour fabric is really soft and PUL seems like good quality. This is where my compliments end...Cons: this diaper leaks; it's on the smaller size, I don't think it will last thru potty-training; hook and loop does not stay closed, laundry tabs do not hold in the wash/dry; inner part stained immediately (I don't particularly care about stains, but want to give full info); the insert is very rigid even after ten washes. Pretty disappointing for such an expensive product. I have cheap diapers that perform much better.EDIT: I am adding two stars for great customer service. While I wouldn't recommend the Velcro version, the replacement snap version works great, so I recommend it, and Babykicks as a company for standing behind their product.
