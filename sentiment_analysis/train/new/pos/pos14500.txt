I bought this for my stepdad's "Man Cave" and it was the perfect present. It's an adorable little rug with rich color, soft fur, and charming claws. It's about the size of a bath mat or small bath towel*, so for a gag gift, it's not awkwardly big or expensive. My stepdad has it atop the whiskey cabinet, kind of like a little table runner. If you're even thinking about buying it, go for it. When else are you going to be able to say you have a bearskin rug?*Too small for Burt Reynolds
