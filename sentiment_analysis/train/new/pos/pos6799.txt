Agree with other reviews. Has an odor when first received but it's either gone now or I don't notice it anymore.Not sure how it is for a diaper bag, but I love it for my work tote. I love the colors!!! Lots of compartments and accessories! I got all pieces promised. Using bottle case as my pencil case. Haven't needed the extra hand bag, I only carry a small business card holder with credit cards in it.One day I'll sew the diaper pad together for an iPad case...it's doesn't have very much padding though..more like batting used for quilts.Wish it had shoulder straps.
