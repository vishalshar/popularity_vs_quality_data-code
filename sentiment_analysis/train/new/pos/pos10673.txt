Delivery took 2 days & it was nice to receive 2 unexpected shammy rags that were included along with the bib!  The concept of the bib is what really grabbed my attention, so I decided to give it a try, and boy was I surprised at how well it works!  It keeps my little guy clean & dry while eating and cleans up large spills of water/ketchup incredibly well! As a Mom, my favorite thing about this bib is how easily food/stains clean out after use with a little soap/water and it's ready for your next meal (dries in 20-25 mins).  I cleaned up a mix of spagetti sauce, carrots, & grape juice off his tray last night and they both rinsed right out without staining. I used to keep a bag of used/dirty bibs under the sink that I sent through the laundry every 1-2 days, but that bag has been empty since receiving my ShamBibby:-)  I haven't noticed any "mildew' smell in the bib after using for a week which is amazing.  I was happy with the different colors I had to choose from & the bib came with instructions on how to keep it properly cleaned. As another poster stated, the bib does soften up a lot after using the first time. It's super soft after initial use so wiping little faces & hands are not an issue.  Great Product I would recommend for moms/dads that wanna make your hectic lives a little easier!
