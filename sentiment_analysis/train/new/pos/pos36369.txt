I bought this bedding set for my crib and it looks very lovely. Its a baby pink and the shipment was very quick as well. The crib set is very adorable.I will be using mine on a white standard size crib. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the words on the blanket (which it comes with) says Pooh and "Igor" instead of Eeyore. If you don't mind then its no big deal. Other than that u'll definitely fall in love with these sheets!
