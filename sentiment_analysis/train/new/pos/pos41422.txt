This is a nice high chair and so easy to handle.  I have uploaded a few pictures to show the colors better and how slim it is once folded - fully assembled.I'll start by saying that it was not difficult to put this chair together.  There's no need for special tools or even a screwdriver.  It took me about 15 minutes to put it all together.Things that I like:- Folds so slim that can fit behind the door once feeding is done.- Cleans super easy, the double tray it great.  So easy to wash in the sink.- There's no fabric involved the plastic/vinyl that covers the seat is easy to wipe.- The height adjustment is a neat feature it can really go very low if necessary.- The colors, not too flashy.Things I don't like:- I can't carry it around. I have to roll it on the floor (but the wheels are not good for my floor)  I am a small gal and can't lift this chair because the legs keep coming down.  The legs don't want to stay put if I lift the chair up, they roll down making me stumble and bringing the chair legs to an odd position.There are other features that this chair has like safety harness, adjustable foot rest, loocking wheel mechanism, and all the buttons to help lock in the chair.Overall, this is a very good chair for the price, sturdy, and easy to put away.Last note:I invite you to ask questions or comment before hitting the unhelpful button.
