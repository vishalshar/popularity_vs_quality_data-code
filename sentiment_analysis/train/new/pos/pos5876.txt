I bought the KidCo PlayDen for my 8 month old twin boys.  I wanted something that was expandable, metal and not horrendous looking.  While I ended up buying 4 extensions (at $40 a pop) to create a space big enough for two, it was worth it.  I should add, that if I knew I would need to buy so many extensions to make the size I wanted, I would've just bought TWO of the PlayDen sets instead of buying 4 24-inch extensions.  Oh well, live and learn.  I know that because of the quality of the PlayDen, I'll be able to resell to another mom once I'm done with it.  The den is easy to assemble, the gate is easy to open and close and the boys love it.  I put a huge plastic mirror between my dining room wall and the PlayDen to make it seem bigger and to entertain the boys and I also added some toys around the top rail to make it look a little less like a baby jail.  I also purchased the Skip Hop Play Spot floor tiles to go over the hardwood floors which also adds a bit of whimsy, plus cushions falls.  Wish I would've bought it sooner!
