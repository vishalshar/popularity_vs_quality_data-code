I love Graco infant car seats.  We had the Snug Ride22 for my daughter and were looking for the same seat for my twin sons.  Many of the new Graco Snug Ride 22 car seats are now adjustable from the back and I don't like that.  This seat is like my old model and has the strap adjustment in the front.  It makes is very easy to tighten and loosen the straps.  My boys were just barely 5lbs when they came home and these seats fit them nicely.
