This is our favorite snack cup! My 16 month old can easily get her snacks through the lid, and it is very good at keeping the snacks in while being tested by a toddler! The lids are easily slid into place and taken off! My favorite part of this cup is an extra lid that is attached to the handle that can be put over the slotted opening lid.  This is great for no spills in the diaper bag and since it is attached it can't get lost!!! Brilliant!!!
