I have used this for almost two years for my daughter. Since she turned one, this was pretty much attached to my daughter's waist.I believe that parents normally buy cloths that are bigger than the actual size that perfectly fits their kids because kids grow up fast.Unlike ordinary belts that have a buckle on the front, this adjustable belt does not add pressure on babies or toddlers' tummy. Adding no pressure is very important for babies and toddlers because they easily throw up. Having no buckle also makes children sit or crawl on their tummy more comfortably.More importantly, it does the job! It holds up pants that are big on kids!!  Since it is placed on the back, kids cannot unhook it or play with it. Unfortunately, my daughter has outgrown this belt. I will be happy to buy it again if there is a bigger size for bigger kids. All of my relatives asked me where I bought it when they saw it.It is seriously worth every penny.
