Space is a big issue for us on our apartment. When we furnished the nursery we opted for a larger dresser with a changing table on top, instead of a separate dresser and changing table. This gave us extra room for clothes, but less room for changing supplies. I looked at many different diaper stations, but they all took up too much space on the dresser.This changing station was much larger than I envisioned, but not large enough to turn us off of using it. It comes with everything you need to install it, and being able to apply the decals ourselves was a huge plus as we could tailor it to the colors in our nursery.The only disappointment was this: The wipes holder requires you to take a refill package of wipes, open the resealable pull tab and place it in upside down. We use the Pampers Sensitive refills, which don't have a resealable package. I would have been happier if the unit had a self contained wipes storage. For now, I am hoping that cutting a slit in the top of my refill package will allow me to use it without a problem.
