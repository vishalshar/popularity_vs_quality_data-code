Got her right on time. I was a little surprised by how small it was - great for traveling and keeping as a spare in the extra car, but for daily use it's a bit small. My daughter and I are both only 5 feet tall, so the low handle does not bother us, but for somebody tall it will probably be uncomfortable. The basket is very small too - won't hold our diaper bag, but will hold a purse and a small shopping bag. The cup holder on the handle won't hold our sippy cup - it's not deep enough and the cup tries to flip over. Over all - a nice small/short and compact folding stroller - but would not recommend for daily use. Also - my grand-daughter is almost 2 but very petite and only weighs 22 pounds - I don't think this will be very comfortable for her much longer.
