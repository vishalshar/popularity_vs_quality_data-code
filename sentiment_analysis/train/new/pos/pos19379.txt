Let me start by saying we have the entire spunky collection, 2 medium, 1 blanket and 1 small. The small spunky we use as our travel spunky, my daughter is only 1 and it is the perfect size to travel with her. Unlike the other reviewers I actually like that it is hard to use the bark box... when she's in the crib it will never wake her up when she is rolling around in her sleep. However I do not like that because of the bark box you are unable to throw it in the washing machine... The other sizes I throw in the wash and 2 hours late they are back to her clean as can be... this one you have to surface wash and air dry and even then its hard to get really clean. Other than that spunky is the perfect lovey and for the price if I have to I will just replace it.
