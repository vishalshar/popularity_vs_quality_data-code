We got 5 years use out of these - and could have gone longer but boys wanted "big boy" seats like their friends - so we finally switched to boosters.  These are super for infants all the way to little boys.  We bought them for our infant twins when we needed to take a cross country trip - they have excellent support and our babies were very comfortable on a 24-hour trip.  Easy to clean, very well made, just can't say enough about them.  This particular fabric was great because it matched the tan interior of our truck AND the grey interior of our other vehicle.  Spend the extra money and get these.  Well worth it.
