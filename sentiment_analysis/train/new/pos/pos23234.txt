My breastfed baby would not take any bottles. We finally tried these and he took them no problem. We tried many bottles before these and my son struggled with choking and gas pretty badly. These seem to help with his gas and easy his little belly, so we are happy parents! He latches easily to the bottles and doesn't choke anymore. They come apart and are east to please which I like. We bought a bunch of them! Great buy and I would recommend these to anyone who's transitioning from breast to bottle. The fact that they hold 9 oz. is nice as well because they grow with the baby!
