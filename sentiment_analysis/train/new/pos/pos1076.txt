I wanted a bedding set that wouldn't feel like it belonged to an infant in 2 years, something that could survive the toddler years, but that screamed little girl.  This fits the bill perfectly.  Bonus:  this set is 100% cotton and very soft.  Only downside to the cotton is that you need to iron the valance and bed skirt after washing unlike other bedding that is made of blends and doesn't bunch up in the dryer.  Lesson learned!  I also ordered the memo board and it all looks fantastic.  I'm actually planning on ordering the larger twin set for when she's older.
