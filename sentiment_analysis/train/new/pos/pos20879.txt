this sun shade is soooo worth the money. it is adjustable with velcro straps and can be adjusted lower to block more sun when you need it. Great for infants who shouldn't be using sunscreen before 6 mos of age. the shade allows airflow to the baby so it doesn't get as hot for him as using a blanket over the stroller. I can fold my stroller up with the shade still in place which is nice bc i don't have to keep taking it on and off. You can also fold it back out of the way when you are not using it for sun protection. the only thing i can advise is that you need a canopy for support on your existing stroller to use this shade-  it just extends the one you already have to block more sun. You can't use this on umbrella strollers that don't have a sunshade already. the shade has a pocket on both sides for waterbottles or other items- i find that if it's windy out-putting bottles of water in those oockets holds the shade from blowing up and exposing sun on your child. Overall you need this item!!!
