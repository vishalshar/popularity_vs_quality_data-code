I work retail and was given the go-ahead to use the managers' offices for pumping; "They lock, so you'll have privacy" I was told. After getting walked in on twice (both times the doors were locked, one time I had a sticky note on the door that they "didn't know what it meant") I decided to look for a door sign.This kit is fabulous! I love the 2 desk signs (I have a little desk area in the shared open office), the door signs are perfect, the tag for the pumping bag is brilliant and I like the extra stickers for the milk in the fridge. By far my favorite though is the "This side up --- Will cry over spilled milk" sticker for my little cooler!I've not been ashamed of pumping at work, but this kit has really helped me to really own it and be more proud of what I do :) And the peace of mind I get knowing that there is now no excuse for someone to walk in on me...priceless!
