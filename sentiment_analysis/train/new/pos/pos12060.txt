This product was purchased in conjunction with several other interlocking foam squares for my son's bedroom as we have hard wood floors. They work great and have been fairly durable. Prior to purchasing the foam products he would cry if he was on the floor... now he actually likes to be on the floor with his toys. If you are a little creative you can spell out a child"s name in the pattern for a personal touch. They are easy to clean. I generally use the chlorox wipes or baby wipes and it cleans up fine.  There was virtually no odor or chemical smell when i opened the package and now that it has been out for a few days it is completely non existent. This product can be as fun and educational as you would want to make it as it has colors, shapes, animals, numbers, etc.  I would highly recommend this product.
