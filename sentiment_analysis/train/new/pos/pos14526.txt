I love the bib/burp cloth combo! Works great and provides lots of coverage from drips and spills. The material is super soft and silky, but maybe to a fault.  It's not nearly as absorbent as my regular muslin aden + anais burpy bib.  The material just feels really wet when spills happen. While I love the look and feel of the rayon from bamboo material, I think I'll stick to the regular muslin burpy bibs in the future. The muslin version costs less too.
