It looks like some reviewers were a little annoyed with the functionality of this product, but let's be honest, baby proofing is a pain regardless. It's never easy to get anything open and adds an extra step to get to anything- but isn't that the point?! These lever covers work perfect and, once you get the motion down, they are really easy to open in one swoop. We bought one to start before we invested greatly in any one product. We placed it in our kitchen on our pantry door. My sweet daughter has a habit of trying to get into dog treats to feed our puppy, so we figured since that is currently our biggest battle we would start there. Our pantry is frequently opened, and it hasn't been a hinderance at all. I just ordered five more, because the price is so great. We initially saw these at Target for atleast double the price. I am excited to start locking down the rest of my house when I receive my next order.
