I tried many baby carriers with my 3 month old.  Believe me when I say, "I've tried them all."  Many thanks to Amazon for their amazing return policy! We've been using the Moby wrap, which I adore, but needed something that's quick and easy to put on, especially when out and about.  And my baby is over 15 pounds now, and the wrap gets too saggy over time.As far as soft-structured carriers go, this is my favorite!  The Boba 3G is easy to put on, it looks good, and baby is comfortable.  I like the feel of the soft organic cotton.  The regular 3G was a little stiff for my liking (just a personal preference). . . it was a nice sturdy fabric, but not for me.The carrier seems a little pricey, but I guess that's what you pay for organic cotton.  It also comes with foot straps, which some carriers don't come with and cost additional money. I am happy to pay the price knowing I am comfortable and so is baby.  I like Boba's philosophy, they seem really into babywearing and I feel like they are a good company.  I also feel good knowing this product isn't being knocked off like Ergo. . . so many counterfeit Ergos out there!I should add that I'm wearing my baby in the Boba right now!
