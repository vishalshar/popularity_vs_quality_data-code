I purchased this pad to go in our Graco Travel Lite Crib with Stages, which is more like a smaller version of a pack n play/larger bassinet. The mattress pad that comes with it is ok, but I had read other reviews saying that it wasn't quite as thick as it could be, and that this pad added a nice extra layer of comfort for baby. So based on that, I went ahead and ordered this.I was not disappointed at all! It's not so thick that it takes up too much room in the bassinet, but yet it's just thick enough that it will give baby a little bit softer layer to sleep on. But also not so soft that it's dangerous for baby either.I had also read a lot of people complaining about not being able to find sheets for this size mattress pad. One person suggested purchasing the Carter's Changing Pad Covers for it, and that they fit this mattress perfectly. So I took a chance and went ahead and ordered another one of the Carter's Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover's, from here on Amazon. I had already ordered 1 for our changing table mattress, and loved it. When it came I was apprehensive about it fitting, but again, was not let down. It fits this pad perfectly! So I actually ordered another one to have 2 to switch out.Great pad, and great price! I saved quite a bit by ordering from here on Amazon, as opposed to another online retailer. Thanks Amazon!
