We were going to take a long trip overseas to Lithuania. My son is one of the few kids that does not sleep well in a car seat. I don't think he has slept more than an hour in a car seat. So we were looking for something to make his neck and head more comfortable. We looked at many different products but he is so weird/scared of things we try to put around his neck that we though an animal character would make it more fun. Well, he was still scared but we go through that and made him keep it on. He ended up falling asleep and his head did not move around like in the past when he had nothing to rest on. It worked as we hoped and he slept much longer than before. Once we got past the fear of having it around his neck I donâ€™t think we will have issues like that anymore.Pros:-very cute-soft but firm enough-love the magnets to hold the bottom together. It really does work well and was a great idea. Also makes it very easy to remove and put on.Cons:not much. Maybe the fur could be softer, but keep the firm stuffing.
