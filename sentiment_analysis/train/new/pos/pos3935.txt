I was torn between purchasing a baby car mirror with a pivot/rotating arm or this flat one.  I'm glad I got this flat mirror as it works well and it lies flat against my seat.  It's easy to install and I put a burp cloth behind the top part of it to give it a better angle.  The baby shows up clear and is not distorted.  It doesn't move when I'm driving.  Though sometimes I knock into the mirror when putting my baby in the car seat so I have to fix it, but figured if I had a mirror with a pivoting/rotating arm that I would be more likely knock into it as it sticks out further.  I've used it in both a 2015 Subaru Legacy and 2015 Honda Accord in the back right seat's headrest.  Yes, it does create a small blind spot because the mirror is bigger than the headrest which I was worried about but it's the trade off for seeing the baby clearly.  I got this mirror because I drive alone and wanted to check on my baby to see if he was sleeping, unhappy, or in distress.  Recently my little one was crying while I was on the highway and I checked in the mirror and saw his hat fell over his eyes so I reached my arm back and lifted up his hat.  It is important to note that once it nighttime and dark outside, you can hardly see into the mirror unless you are at the traffic light or a car's headlights shine a certain way into your car.
