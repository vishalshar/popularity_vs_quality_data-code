We have twins, a boy and girl, and so have purchased both the pink and the neutral Comfort & Harmony bouncer.  As these are my 4th and 5th children, I can testify to having tried many different kinds of bouncers.  Before finding the Comfort & Harmony, I have never been perfectly happy with any of the ones I've used.The best features of this bouncer seat:-Toy bar that does not pop off every time you move the seat to a different location, and it EASILY slides back out of baby's face when you want to pick him/her up.-Two positions - works for newborns who need to lie almost flat and for older babies who want to look around.  Most basic bouncers do not have this feature.-"Bounce mechanism" is different than most seats - it bounces from the back instead of having a seat attached to two bars that bounce from the bottom of the front bar.  This means the baby bounces up and down gently (good for newborn) instead of back and forth (NOT good for newborn's head and neck position).-Removable cuddly, soft cushions and head support.  The cushions literally surround the newborn's body, making them feel safe and secure while they rest.-Music and sounds that are not EXTREMELY annoying; vibrations that don't shake the baby until he/she vomits!My twins spend much of their days in these bouncers, and I am SO happy with this purchase.  Other than their cradle swings, these are very comforting and sleep-friendly!
