Twilight Turtle and Ladybug have been one of the best purchases I have made for my children.  It is absolutely magical for little ones, and is enjoyable for adults also.  I bought this for my two sons who are nine year old twins, one of which is severely Autistic.  I honestly wish I had bought them years ago, because they love them.  My son who is Autistic is very hard to shop for, but the purchas of the Twilight Ladybug has brought him so much joy. While the shell is hard, the head, legs, and underbody are soft.  My son sits and pets the head of the lady bug, and then spends a few moments choosing the perfect color for that given night. Then as he goes to sleep, he sits and strokes its little head and legs. It makes me smile. My other son has the Turtle, and adores it. Each of the Twilight animals comes with a little guide showing the different constellations, and he will sit and find those constellations before he dozes off to sleep. The Turtle and Ladybug blanket a beautiful display of stars over the entire room. (walls and ceiling) It makes it an absolute magical place for children to go to sleep. There are no arguments at bedtime now. The boys seem to look forward to bedtime now. Battery life is extremely long with the Twilight animals.  We have had them for a couple of weeks, and they have been used everynight, quite a bit during the days, and I am yet to replace the batteries. I would definitely recommend the Twilight animals to anyone.
