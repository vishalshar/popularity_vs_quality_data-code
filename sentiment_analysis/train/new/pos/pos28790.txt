4 stars because the tray does dip down towards the child a bit and with no lip food would certainly fall off (especially our favorite blueberries!). I use an ezpz mini tray which i bought for eating out at restaurants and it's perfect (and unfortunately doesn't seem to be available on amazon yet). The silicone grips to the plastic tray and doesn't slip off. Good enough for me!
