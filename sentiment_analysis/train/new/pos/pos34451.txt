My older step stool was just a bit too high for the bathroom and the dimensions for the PRIMO Freedom Step Stool seemed like it would be a good fit for the bathroom. It works perfectly. While it has the bottom grippers the stool is able to be rearranged as needed at time of use (as long as not on it). I like the white color to match the toilet and not be so obvious there's a stool by toilet.Would be nice if the next generation of these stools would fold for portability. It's lightweight yet very durable for child or fullsize adult use.Definitely recommend this for hard to reach places in homes.
