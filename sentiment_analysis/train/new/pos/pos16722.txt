I love this feeding pad, especially now that my baby is a little older and seems determined to expose me. The cover allows for a very discreet and relatively safe feeding. The advantage over a blanket is primarily the weighted pad that keeps it on your shoulder, unlike the blankets that always seem to slide off. I always use it when I'm out and I love it. I haven't used the bottle system, I doubt I will...
