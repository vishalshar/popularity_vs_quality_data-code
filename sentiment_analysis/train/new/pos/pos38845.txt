My daughter or my son-in-law consistently forgot to leave the booster seat they use in their cars.  So, I purchased this and it works.  It installed easily into a 2004 Camry in the center postion of the back seat which has a shoulder strap.  It needs a shoulder strap. The cover is not as luxurious as the more expensive car seats but because I will be using it only occasionally, I think it will last years for us. I can now drive my granddaughter to the park so I am happy with it.
