This is an awesome toy! It has nice weight different tune with each squeaker. Crinkly, soft, and different textures on each leg. Its been a long time since I bought it (2 yrs) and guess what?!?!? Its still in great shape after 2 kids have had it. Squeakers are a little tough for smaller kids to squeeze but that's My only complaint!
