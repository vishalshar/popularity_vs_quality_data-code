We started trying bottles when my EBF baby was 10 weeks old because I was returning to work when he turned 15 weeks. He wanted nothing to do with any of the brands we tried (playtex dropins slow and med flows, advent, tippee, browns, first years, nuk). He just couldn't get a latch on those. I started to get very nervous he would never take a bottle! Then... wham bam thank you MAM! He could latch onto the MAM because of the genius nipple shape that lets him get a proper latch. It took a lot of practice, and me being completely out of the house while his papa gave him the bottle, but I'm happy to report that my DS finally takes a bottle while I'm away, (and even when I'm in the other room)! The final trick was switching to the fast flow nipple. He got only one ounce/ feeding with the slow flow, 1.5oz with the medium flow, and he is up to over 3oz/ feeding with the fast flow. And because the design is so cute and colorful, he actually starts kicking with excitement when he sees the bottle coming his way! He switches between breast and bottle with ease, the bottles are cute and the easiest to clean, and I love the self sanitizing feature. FABULOUS! Love you MAM!
