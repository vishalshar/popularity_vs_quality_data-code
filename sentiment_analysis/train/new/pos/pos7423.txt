Of all the toys we own, this was the very first toy that completely captivated my son starting around when he was three months old.  The red cheeks light up and he was fascinated with it from the very first time he saw it!Our daycare doesn't allow toys from home....so I bought another and "donated" it to them so it technically was no longer a toy from home.  Over a year later, all the kids still play with it, it's held up exceptionally well and the new babies are just as fascinated with it as my son was.The only thing I wish they would improve would be a way to better fasten it to the handle of a car seat so kids can play with it in the car.  We figured out a way to secure it so it wouldn't bump his head when it was hanging and he was soooooo happy!  It was even the first toy that he would smile at......If you have a baby where car rides are tough, this toy is a must have!
