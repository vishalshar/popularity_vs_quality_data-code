It seems like this carseat arrived about five minutes after I hit the purchase button. It arrived in great condition, too, and they even threw in a sippy cup!  ;-)The fabric on this cover (the Ashley Floral) is very attractive. I love that it can be rear- or forward-facing. A friend who had already purchased a different seat helped me install this in my car, and she loved it so much more than the one she got that she's getting this one, once her newborn is too big for her rear-facing-only seat. If only she'd bought this one, she said, she wouldn't have to go buy another.Haven't had my daughter in it yet, so update coming soon!UPDATE: I love the look of this seat. The fabric still looks great a year later, but the straps aren't the easiest to use. In fact, the two metal pieces that click into the piece between the child's legs don't "click" anymore. There's no audible click to assure that you've got them in tightly and correctly.  The plastic piece on the actual strap is pretty large, so for small babies it's plenty awkward to strap her in. The seat feels nice and safe when she's finally in, however. It just worries me that the metal piece no longer audibly clicks, and the seat hasn't been used all that often.
