This stroller cover is the BEST! I bought one of the cheap plastic ones and it ripped the very first time I used it. Ugh! So after just a few uses, that one was no good and I knew I needed something made with fabric and much higher quality. I was unsure of spending $35 when there were lots of $20 ones, but I didn't want to keep replacing them, so I bought it. I knew I could use it on our regular stroller for an upcoming trip to Chicago, but I didn't think it would fit the jogging stroller because that thing is HUGE. But I am glad to say I was wrong. It fits perfectly, and has stretchy cords and velcro to secure in place. My jogger has a little cupholder/cubby so I don't need the hanging pockets off the back, but those will be great for our regular stroller. The only possible thing I could want that it doesn't have is a window on the top to see my baby while we're moving, but still, it's amazing. I bought the gray one instead of a bright color because I figured we'd get a color too dirty, but I kinda wish I'd bought a colorful cover. ;) The stroller pictured is the Graco Click Connect Fast Action jogging stroller and the dimensions are 42"H x 24"W x 40"D.
