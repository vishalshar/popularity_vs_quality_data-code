I gave it 4 stars because there are alot of wierd pages in this book that I will not use and ended up just covering them with pictures (birth anouncement from the newspaper) I didn't do this and not sure that anyone does anymore being that very rarely do people even read the newspaper, so  I kind wish there wasn't pages that a minority of people will actually use.  I would have liked more common pages like first tooth and stuff like that, that all babies do.  I also do not like the current events page, I wanted this book for family things but I guess some people will like this page its just hard to put "popular bands" maybe it would have been better to put "bands that mommy and daddy like" but that is just nit picking if I didnt like a page I just covered it with pictures.  But I do love the book's style and look, its very cute and durable and also very vintage looking which is what I really wanted in a baby book.  I also wish that the photo boxes were a bit bigger I had to cut my pictures down alot.  But overall I am satisfied with the product and I would recommend it to others.
