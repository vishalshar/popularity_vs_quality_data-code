I did a lot of research when looking for the perfect umbrella stroller for my toddler.  I wanted a canopy and I wanted it to be able to fold up.  This fit the bill.

We've had this stroller for several years and it's held up fine, I just don't think it's worth the extra money we paid. The only complaints I have are that the seat comes unhooked and my little needs my help to reattach and that one wheel became squeaky within the first week of owning...
