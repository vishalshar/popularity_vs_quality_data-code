Worked great for us.  Easy on and off.  We got two, and with one of them though, one top screw kept coming off the side.  It happened while my daughter was going up, and that made her very uneasy.  It's possible that she plays with them while sitting on the seat (because she can reach them), but I'm not sure why it doesn't do that with the other one as well.  But having the handles there was nice for her to turn with until she was more confident.  She is small, so a little step stool just wasn't enough to make her feel good.  My son was larger, and a stool was enough for him (with one of those smaller pull down seats on top of the regular seat to begin with).  That would have been my preference for her, but she's too small, so this was best.
