I ordered this for my 4 month old son's Easter basket.  He loves it and cuddles with it for every nap.  He holds the head up by his face to use as a pillow and likes to play with the ears as he dozes off.  The fur is very soft and it is really cute.  There are a lot of other soothie blankets out there but most I have seen have an animal head coming out of the center and are on the smaller side.  I chose this over those because the head was at the top where my son could cuddle it and have the 'blanket' part hang down next to him.
