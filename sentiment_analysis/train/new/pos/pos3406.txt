Honestly I picked this play-mat because I happened to catch a "flash sale" on Amazon and got it really cheap.  We love it though.  My grand-daughter is now 3 months and is grabbing for the toys.  She kicks and coos up a storm when the music is playing.  The product seems to be well made and we have had it in use for over six months without having to change the batteries yet.
