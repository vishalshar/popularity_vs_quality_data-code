These wall appliques are highly recommended to add to any nursery or child's room! Exactly as pictured and described. Easy to apply and remove - especially if you step back and want to put it in a different place after looking at it.  My baby loves to look at the circle and turtles! I have the entire Cocalo Turtle Reef Collection in my baby's nursery and it is adorable. I have gotten many compliments, but mostly compared to my first child's nursery, these products are of much more quality, durable, easy to wash and especially comfortable & cute! Highly recommend! Also - great price in comparison to local stores
