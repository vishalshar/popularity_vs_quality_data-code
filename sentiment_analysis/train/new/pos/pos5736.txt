This could be a great diaper. BUT, the elastic on one of the legs has started to fail after only 3 months of use.... it's no longer stretchy. I had the same issue with the Crocodile version, (the back elastic is completely stretched out,) and was able to get my money back from Amazon, (5 stars for Amazon!!) but the green didn't start having problems until just after the return date for the product. Darn! I have washed these in warm water with Charlie's Soap, and have never once put them in the dryer, so I know that this isn't my fault. I also own red & teal covers from Bumkins, & so far those are doing just fine. It might be that the company had some bad elastic, but if so, it's very, very unfortunate, since that has caused me to leave a poor review. I also own a Rumparooz & a Best Bottom cover, and those are holding up quite well, after 3 months of use.11/15/14I'm amending my review to four stars from a measly two. After I contacted Bumkins directly via their webpage regarding the elastic issues they replaced my two covers and added an extra cover AND a bib to my package! These are very trim diapers. If you have a skinny little rug rat, then they'll fit beautifully. However, if you've got a chunky monkey, then I'd suggest another kind of diaper - the Rumparooz, Best Bottom & Buttons covers all have more room in them than these.
