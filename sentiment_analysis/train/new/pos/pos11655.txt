We bought this seat after my daughter outgrew her convertable seat at 4 years old.  I did a ton of research on different safety aspects of booster seats and one thing that really bothered me is that all of them stopped using the 5-point harness at 40lbs.  I found one made by Britax that goes to 100lbs, but it wouldn't fit in our vehicle since we have two other seats in there.  Anyway, I thought I was just going to have to settle for one with a 40lb weight limit.  While reading a review about the Britax seat I saw that someone suggested this seat, so I read up on it and it seemed perfect.The seat is great.  It was easy to install in our vehicle, it fits with an infant seat and a convertable seat on the same row (we have a SUV), and it is very comfortable for my daughter.  She really likes the seat, it makes her feel like a big girl.  The cup holder is a little flimsy and we didn't even hook it on, but she hasn't had one on any of her other seats either.  The straps to get twisted some, but are easy to untwist if you take the time to do it.  Those are my only complaints, and they aren't even that big of a deal.If you are wanting your child to be in a 5-point harness past 40 lbs, then this is the seat for you.  I know a lot of her friends are in the boosters that they just use the seat belt over them and I just don't feel that is safe enough.  But then again, I'm neurotic about my kids being in the safest seats and in their seats at all times.
