Just got this crib and I am very happy with it. We had previously ordered a different brand crib that was flimsy and awful- and more expensive than this! I was hesitant to order another crib online after that, but I'm so happy I did. The wood feels sturdy and firm, the white paint is even and has no odor. It was packed extremely securely, the packing itself was impressive. We also ordered the separate toddler rail attachment to have on hand.The crib is pretty easy to assemble, but the directions are a little unclear about the facing of pieces which might be why a few reviewers report that bolts "spin and spin and spin." The first end pieces I assembled had that problem at the top until I realized that I needed to switch them so that the bolt heads were within the wooden indent (specifically on the curved upward bars). None of the pieces are labeled as to which side is out or up, and it's not hard to figure out, it just doesn't coddle you through the assembly process. I am used to assembling furniture, but I did this with no help while in my 3rd trimester and it was a breeze. The railed sides are all flippable in the sense that you can choose whether to have the bolt holes outside or inside of the crib without changing the function of the crib, which is interesting. The images show the bolt holes on the inside for the white version however some other images of the same crib in wood tones show the 2 end bar sections with the bolt holes facing outward (which is how the directions have it). We tried it both ways and both work! We decided to have the end rail piece bolt holes facing out unlike the images on this product listing but the way the directions call for. The facing/positioning really only matters on those upward bars with the curve at the top.
