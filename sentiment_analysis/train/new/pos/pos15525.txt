When I was pregnant with my son I scoured the internet looking for an organic nursing pillow. I knew that he would be spending a large amount of his early life on a nursing pillow so it was important to me that it be free of potentially harmful substances.To me, it isn't enough that a product be organic or "natural", it has to perform its purpose just as well as or better than a conventional product would. This is absolutely the case with the Blessed Nest pillow. It isn't just an organic alternative, for me it is the best out there! I had an opportunity to try out the Boppy and My Breast Friend nursing pillows in my birthing class and aside from the conventional synthetic materials used in both, I didn't find them to be comfortable.I found everything I was looking for in the Blessed Nest Nesting Pillow! This nursing pillow has an amazingly soft organic cotton case, is filled with buckwheat, and includes an organic cotton cover that zips on and off for easy washing.This pillow feels amazing in my lap! It has just the right weight and is the perfect height to bring baby right to the breast easing strain on my arms and back. I can see why this pillow has the word "nest" in its name, the buckwheat contours perfectly to baby's body and creates a very comfy spot for bonding.The zippered case that comes with this pillow washes wonderfully and has a very soft feel. It has not held onto any stains and is nice and thick so that nothing gets onto the pillow below. I orderd a second case when I purchased my pillow so that I would never be without one.My pillow still looks completely new, I've had it for 3 years and am now using it to nurse my second baby.
