I bought this mobile despite the bad reviews because it was so cute. I have had zero problems. It is annoying to keep rewinding the mobile, but I prefer that to buying and constantly replacing batteries. I had three different mobiles--one for crib, one for changing table and one for his crib at grandma's. This one was by far our favorite. I suspect that all the broken mobile issues were due to user error--probably over-winding to make the music last longer. I never overwound the mobile and never had any issues. We have been using it for over 7 months. I took it out of the crib once my son could pull himself up, but we keep it in a corner of his room so he can still look at it. I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews and took a chance with this sweet little mobile!
