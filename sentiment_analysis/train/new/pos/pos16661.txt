This is a very soft sheet that fits my Graco Pack 'N Play with Newborn Napper Elite, Vance very well.  I bought two of them so I'd always have one available if the other is in the wash.  I've washed them a lot and they have held up really well.  These are thinner sheets (and as can be seen in my attached pictures, they allow the pattern of my pack n play pad to show through) and therefore will only provide minimal protection from spills and accidents.  This isn't a big concern for me.  I bought them mostly for my daughter's comfort and also to protect the pack n play pad from minor things like drool and spit up.The color of the sheets, if that's important to you, doesn't look quite like it does in the picture.  The actual product is less grey than I think it looks here, more of an ivory with hints of yellow/beige.I like that this is organic, and I love how soft they feel.  I'm very satisfied with these sheets, and I'd definitely recommend them.
