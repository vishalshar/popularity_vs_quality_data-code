I love how big this infant tub is!  I like that we can put our infant son in the sling for now, but when he can sit up, we can put him straight into the basin and he'd still have room to play.  When we don't use this tub and just take him into the bath with us, he still brings along the Nemo squirter and Puff water scoop (for lack of better description).  When he was only a month or two old, we used the scoop to rinse his hair.  It's much less traumatizing than using a full cup.  I also love that you can just throw the sling into the laundry...  It makes cleaning up so easy.The things I don't particularly like:  this tub is so bulky that it is hard to store in our tiny bathroom!  I wish there was a way to hang it on a hook on the wall or something.  Another thing I didn't like was the green "tray."  I though it was just in the way, but I fixed that easily by snapping it off and just throwing it under our sink for now.Overall, the design is cute.  It can be used for both genders, and for a long time!  We love our Nemo tub.
