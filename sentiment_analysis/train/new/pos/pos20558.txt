This turned out to be a great purchase for my daughter. I got it when she was almost 2 months old and she still likes it now at 19 months (she is 22 lbs). As an infant, she would fall asleep right away in it, in the glider mode. After she stopped taking naps in it, I started putting her in it every morning, in the swing mode, and put on a video while I made breakfast. Now she asks to swing in it to watch her videos and even just to drink her milk.Pros: Very sturdy (even for a rambunctious toddler), can plug it in (to save on batteries), grows with your child (with the gliding and swinging feature), tray comes in handy for snacks and extra security (until they learn how to pop it off)Cons: It only swings or glides well when the baby is fully sitting back, the mobile is useless and an after thought (but you don't have to use it).Otherwise, I love that I am getting some longevity from it, as the other papasan type swings seem to work when they are infants.
