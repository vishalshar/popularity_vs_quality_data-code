One of the best products I've bought on Amazon. I love that I don't have to worry about the kids escaping out of the slider. It installed easy (about 30 mins), there are screws involved so be prepared, 100% worth it my opinion.It comes with 2 pieces, one goes on the face of the slider and the other inside the track, I tried to get a good picture of it so you can see how it actually works.The pin that locks the door is spring loaded, all you do is pull down and turn a quarter turn and it's unlocked. Turn it back and the spring activates locking into the installed track hole.Another nice feature, there is a second stopper further down the track allowing the slider to be opened a few inches for fresh air, but not far enough to let the little ones escape. Can't recommend this product enough!Oh and I've been using this product for around 2 years and it's held up great. No sticky spring or broken parts. Works just as good as the day I bought it.
