My daughter was very fussy as an infant and wanted to be held or carried all the time.  If I didn't wear her in a wrap I don't think I would have gotten a single thing done in the first ten months of her life.  I initially had a Moby but was frustrated because I could never seem to get it tight enough and it didn't feel secure.  Someone recommended this one and it was a game changer.  It's got enough stretch to it so that you can get it nice and tight but the material is heavy enough to feel very secure.  My daughter loved being in it and it saved my sanity!
