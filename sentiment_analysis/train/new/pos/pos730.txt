I was blessed with a baby boy on April 28th. He is my first baby and I had decided to exclusively breastfeed my baby. However, I had issues feeding him, as he used to sleep while being fed and then become cranky as he was still hungry. So, my cousin, who is a mother of a 3-year old baby advised me to buy breast-pump. She recommended Evenflo and I decided to go for it.My baby boy is two-months old and I have been using this pump for more than a month now. I am very satisfied with the product. I love the bag that came along with it and the extra two bottles are of great help. This pump has 32 settings, which are a lot, but after a week's use, I got adjusted to the settings. I start with low and keep going higher. I just have to pump for about 15 minutes or so, around every three hours and I am able to express enough milk.The only con that I feel in this pump is it's parts. It has so many parts, so sometimes I feel lazy when I have to wash those. However, there could not be a better way it could be manufactured. Overall, I am happy with the product and glad that my cousin recommended this to me. I checked prices of other brand Medela and it is way to expensive. I couldn't afford buying it and I am glad I did not, because this pump serves the purpose at a much lesser cost.Also, there is no on or off button. I wish there was one. For now, I put it on lowest setting and disconnect it when I am done pumping.I haven't traveled anywhere far, so I have not used the pump with batteries. I still have to use it that way. But with electric plug, it is working fine.Though the pump comes with two extra bottles, I am planning to buy few more extra bottles that I could use for storing milk. Go ahead and buy this breast-pump without any second thought. It is worth the money. Hope my review is useful to the new mommies planning to buy this breast-pump. Enjoy breast-feeding and motherhood:-)
