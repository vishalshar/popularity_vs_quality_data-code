So far so good... No static, minimal interference, great range.  I walked to the neighbors house to test & could still see my baby in the screen.  We owned the day/night model (the one that looks like a giant white tv screen) for 3 years and the signal just started acting up recently so we ordered this one.  I have to say that I love that the camera pans and the zooming in feature.I would def. recommend this monitor!
