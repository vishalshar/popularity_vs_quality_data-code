A friend gave us this potty when our girl was starting to become independent.  She was fine using this but preferred the more traditional training "chair".  Now that our boy is becoming more independent, we've rediscovered this potty and just love it!  We've just bought a second one to have one upstairs and one downstairs.After having gone through this with two kids now, I like that it's one piece - our boy was taking the "bowl" out of the other kind that we'd used with our girl and putting it on his head.  You can well imagine how charming that is. It's also completely smooth - no bumps or ridges or crannies for anything to get into and fester.  With this one, I lift our toilet lid and seat and then just dump it quickly in. (Imagine the same motion as pouring from a full water glass at a restaurant into your kiddo's sippy.)  I've never made a mess EXCEPT will often have pee still on the seat of the potty where it pours out.  (I say this bc a lot of the reviewers complain that it's hard to dump but I just haven't had that problem, or more accurately, I see what they're talking about but it's just not that big of a problem.) I just have a roll of paper towels and a box of wipes by the regular toilet to take care of any mess, as you almost have to always wipe out the bowl of it anyway.  I think all training pottys have a similar problem when you dump it.  This one is easy for him to lift and move around and super comfortable to sit on and he pees INTO it and not on it.  The other one that we had (that has since been relegated to the closet), he would pee all over when he was sitting there.  YUCK.  This one is so much more comfortable for him - he sits with a book or a puzzle and is totally fine to "wait it out".  The other chair kind cramped his "style" if you know what I mean.I'd certainly try this for a girl, but it's a no-brainer for my boy!
