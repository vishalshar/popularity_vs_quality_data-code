We LOVE rumparooz, and use them for our 8 month old. They are the most absorbent diapers I've found and the double inner gussets really help to contain blowouts. I've never had an issue with leaking with a rumparooz! They also clean very well. My ONLY complaint, just because my son has very chubby thighs, is that the stitching/ruching of the leg holes often leaves red marks in my son's skin. Because of this, I think I'm going to search for a diaper with smaller stitches and gatherings on the leg holes.
