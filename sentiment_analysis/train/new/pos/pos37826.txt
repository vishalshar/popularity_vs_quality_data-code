They serve the purpose, and don't require drilling any holes in my cabinets.  They take a little practice to open, and require 2 hands.  I had to modify mine because the pulls on my cabinets are too close together. Like other reviewers have mentioned - the range is 3" to 4-1/2" (measures to the outside of the pulls).  To modify the device I drilled some holes in one side and and added a zip tie... This allowed me to use it on my pulls that are 2-3/8 apart.  Modification on 8 of these took about 30 minutes.
