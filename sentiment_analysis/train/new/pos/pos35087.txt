This is exactly what I was looking for!  I recently got a jogging stroller so I could take my daughter on runs with me, but also wanted to be able to track my runs using my iPhone.  Keeping the phone in the basket was not working because I couldn't see it while I was running.  The Brica phone pod attaches very securely to the stroller handle and I can angle it perfectly to see my phone without too much glare.  My iPhone with case fits in very snugly also.  Highly recommend this product!
