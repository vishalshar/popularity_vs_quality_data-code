After reading the reviews I guess the main complaint by most is that it wrinkles in the wash and I will agree with that, it does.  But, given that I'm only planning on washing the valance/bedskirt/wall hangings once in a blue moon and I don't care if the sheet is wrinkled, I think this is a great product.  It's inexpensive but still feminine and pretty.  As a second time mom, I really couldn't stomach spending $200 on a nursery set but with it being my first girl I was still a sucker for getting something pink and girly.  This worked wonderfully.  It's a huge set, I bought it and the mobile, painted the room pink and called it decorated.  I'm still expecting so haven't "used" it yet but the fabric seems fine to me.  Probably my only complaint is that yes, you can see a bit through the lighter beige color, they could have made that fabric a bit thicker on the valance/wall hangings for instance.  But for the price it can't be beat.Oh, and this applies to all nursery sets, but why don't they provide TWO fitted sheets and drop one of the other (less useful) items?  Half of the moms don't use the bumper pads, no one can use the comforter with a newborn (as an actual comforter, I turned mine into a wall hanging) and I think some of the 2 pillows/3 wall hangings/toy holder would be gladly replaced for another sheet.  Just my opinion if there's anyone from GEENNY reading!
