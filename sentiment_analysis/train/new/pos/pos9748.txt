This rain cover works perfectly on a stormy day.  The window to look out is large and my little man loves to play with the window as we trotting around.  If on the walk the rain stops, it's easy to leave the cover attached to the handles but roll up the rest of lay on the canopy.  This way, it doesn't bother me nor baby.The cover also is perfectly designed for the sport and fits like a charm.In response to another review, yes, this item is a little smelly out of the box.  As with all new manufactured plastic, there is a smell associated with it.  I don't think it's right to blast this cover for that.  Just hang it up in a garage or outside for a day before use.
