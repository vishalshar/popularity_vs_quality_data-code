I ordered this sheet b/c it was cute and the color would go with newly painted walls.  I wasn't sure if it was fitted or not b/c it did not specify anywhere on the description.  And none of the reviews mentioned it either.  I took a chance anyway.  As it turned out it was fitted and very nice.  I washed b/f putting on my grandson's crib and it washed and dried beautifully.  No shrinkage.  I would definitely recommend.
