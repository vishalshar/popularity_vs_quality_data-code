My 2 and a half year old son does not keep covers on him at night.  I always had to go in his room at night to cover him back up so he wouldn't be too cold.  I was ordering a sleep sack for my 6 month old baby when I saw that they had these for older kids.  It's as perfect for toddlers as the infant ones are for babies!  My son doesn't seem to mind wearing this at all and he loves that there is a truck on the front.  When I first put it on him I thought it was a little big because the bottom part almost touches the floor but he is easily able to walk around and climb in and out of bed with this on.  I think this helps to keep him warm at night even though I still go in and tuck him in when I wake up.  But it makes me feel better that he is not too cold at night (his room gets a little colder than the rest of the bedrooms).  When this is new the fleece is so plush and fluffy, but it does flatten out a little after several washes.  But the fleece is still warm and this has help up very well with many washings.  I love this and recommend for any toddlers who kick their covers off!
