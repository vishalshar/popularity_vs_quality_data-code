In reading the reviews from those who feel that a dishwasher works just as well as this sterilizer, I wanted to add my view.  I live in an area where water is expensive.  We ration water during the summer and have set schedules of when we can water our yards or wash our cars, etc.  So running the dishwasher vs. using 7 ounces of water to sterilize my bottles is a no-brainer.We were using the Medela steam bags before I found this, which only steam 2 bottles at most at a time.  Then I couldn't find any replacement bags, and they are supposed to only be good for a limited amount of uses.I have gotten a lot of use out of this sterilizer and I like its convenience.  We didn't start out with a lot of bottles, and this was perfect because I could have new bottles ready in minutes.Steam does stay in the bottles afterward, but we air them out for several minutes and it dissipates quickly.
