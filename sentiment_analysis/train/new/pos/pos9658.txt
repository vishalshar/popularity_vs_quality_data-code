very good thing indeed , easy to put on the bed in between both of us and also good use  to nurse the baby .it is  very useful specially if someone want to hold the little newborn , baby stays inside the sleeve and there is no fear of fall. it has zip so I could wash the cover and the pillow underneath after milk spitting
