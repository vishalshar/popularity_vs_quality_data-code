Great high chair with lots of options even as the child keeps growing.  Durable. My second baby is using it now and it's still like it was when my son who is now 4 used it. The good part is my son is using the booster seat for the table while my daughter (9 months) is currently using the high chair. Easy to set up. We have moved 3 times  since we got it and i fix  it up in a few minutes.Cons:The only problem i have is replacing the parts. One of the 5 point harness system was misplaced by our movers and there was no place to find the replacement.  So i had to buy a different company's harness belt.I also wanted a change of the seat cover and i could not find it. Though it was there 4 years ago when i got it. Not sure what happened.
