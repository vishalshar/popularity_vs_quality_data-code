My son is 1 year old and 20 pounds. I got embarrassed carrying him into daycare in an infant carrier and bought this seat after my best friend insisted to get this kind. (She has 3, one for her car and one each for her parents.) The carseat is nice and pretty easy to install. I like the knob that loosens/tightens the straps but I am not a fan of the double straps in the chest area. They are a bit difficult to adjust. I never used the seat rear facing for a younger baby. Also, the chest/head area of the seat is wide, making it cramped for other adults sitting in the back seat of my Passat.I bought the Evenflo Generations seat for my husband's truck. It also has the knob adjustment feature but doesn't have the double straps. I like this seat better for a child who is over 1 year old but it is definitely for an older baby since the child sits more upright.
