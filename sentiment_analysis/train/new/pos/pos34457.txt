This back seat organizer is the best one I've seen so far...It is very durable. Thick and feels like any kind of mess could easily be wiped off. It has a buckle connection to secure under the passenger seat headrest instead of hook and loop closures I've see on others. It has long straps with hook and loop closure on the bottom to go around the seat, instead of it just hanging from the headrest. There are two bottle holders on either side of the bottom pocket, which is designed to fit CD's or DVD's or a small case with them inside. There are two small caribeaners (sp?) on either side to hold toys, or plastic bags to be used as garbage bags, or whatever you can hook into something, two zippered pockets that will fit most writing utensils - crayons, pens, markers, etc. Then there is a top big pocket and a top smaller pocket on the front of the big pocket. These can hold diapers, wipes, books, coloring books, or anything else similar. It's rugged and will double as a back of the seat protector, too! It also folds nicely in half so it's easier to store when not in use. We will be purchasing another one of these soon. :o)
