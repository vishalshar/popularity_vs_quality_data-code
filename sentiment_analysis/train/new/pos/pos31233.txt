The wife picked this out for our baby girls room.  She isn't really into pink (neither am I) so turquoise it is.  After receiving it the wife washed everything that needed washing and got everything placed in the room.  I must admit I really do like it, I'm confused as to why it came with a pillow since a newborn baby, I assume, won't be using a pillow but I guess it works for picture taking purposes.  The colors are still bright after 1 washing with no noticeable fading.  Everything fits correctly and appears to be very well made.  I was a little apprehensive buying this because of the price, but now that I see it, I'm happy with my purchase and believe that we did get what we paid for.
