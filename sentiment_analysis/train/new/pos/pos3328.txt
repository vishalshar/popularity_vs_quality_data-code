I bought this because like many babies they like ducks and my daughter is no exception. She loves ducks, it was one of her very first words and now I know why!It does do a good job of letting you know when the water is too hot (although I never use it as a thermometer, because we have a separate turtle for that) and it floats upright, not many rubber ducks do that spots an added bonus. It's chewy and my daughter will play with it while she's having a wash. As I mentioned, I use a turtle bath thermometer too so I can see actual numbers for temperature but this is a great addition both toy and safety wise.I'd recommend this because it's value for money & fun for little ones. I think it's a must-have bath toy because it's so classy.We've been using it for a year and paint didn't come off (maybe a little bit on her nose), generally, it looks like new.
