Jeep Crib Netting ;  stretches to fit even the monster crib i bought and goes just about to the floor.  We bought ours to keep the parrots out of the crib instead of cats.  When full streched to the floor it is also quite effective at adding a month to the escape attempt learning curve.... unless you happen to slip knot it tothe top of the crib with 550 cord ;-)
