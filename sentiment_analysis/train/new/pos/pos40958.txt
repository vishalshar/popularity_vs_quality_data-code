I was having issues with our current sippy cups and we were about to leave for vacation so I wanted new cups so I wouldn't be worried about drinks spilling while we were on the road.  My 17 month old loves to put her finger in the sippy opening which usually widens the plastic and therefore it begins leaking.  The design of these cups prevent her from putting her finger in the opening and no more leaks!!  I love these cups.  I have only had them a week so I am not sure about how they hold up in the long term, but I will be ordering more.
