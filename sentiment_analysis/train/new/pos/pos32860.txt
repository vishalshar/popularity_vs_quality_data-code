Our baby used the Nest bed from birth through seven months old when she started rolling over. By this time her feet were stretching out the end of the bed (she is tall, 99th percentile for height) but slept as soundly as she did in the early days. Great for traveling, it is very compact, lightweight and extra useful being able to pack all the baby necessities for a week away - in the same bag as the bed! The only room for improvement we could see would be a darker color choice. On occasion the sides of the Nest bed did reflect light onto the baby - not a big deal, we just moved the bed but it was noticeable in locations that weren't as dark as her room at home. Again, not really an issue for us, just a point of note. We have been delighted with this super little bed and recommend it highly.
