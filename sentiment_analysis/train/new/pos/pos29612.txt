If only I knew 8 months ago that all the pain I was having was not from breastfeeding, or "irregular nipples", or thrush, but it was the wrong size flange!!!  I was using what the pump came with, 24mm and everyday I pump before I go to bed, and when I'm at work.  I usually work 3 days in a row, and it is torture by the third day.  I still use ointment on the nipples, thinking that I was not designed to breastfeed. My baby is 10 months old and I have never liked breastfeeding (this is my 3rd) because of the discomfort, but did it for the benefits to the baby.  With my second child I even stopped at 9 months because the pain was unbearable.  To me, I feel like I'm in month one postpartum every time I'm hooked up to the machine.  Unbelievable that I found out about flange size through a breastfeeding documentary!  I would have suffered through to the end.  Not anymore!These fit me perfectly and within 2 pumping sessions- NO PAIN!!!!!  Thank you, thank you!!! I might actually start enjoying breastfeeding!!!!  I wish this was taught postpartum in the hospital- the importance of correct flange size.  My milk output has increased slightly- I pump 4-5oz and was able to pump 6.5oz today.  Yay! I hope it keeps up, I might even continue to breastfeed past one year!!!  A BIG HEARTFELT THANK YOU to the company who thought to produce smaller flange sizes!  Don't know how hard it will be to keep clean, but at this point I don't care I'm so happy about the pain being gone.
