This is my second Kiddy Platter (formerly the Piggy Platter). I ended up throwing my old one out after a few years, because the design led to water being trapped in the edges leading to mold. I was hesitant in replacing with the same product, but I researched the new design before purchasing. It has worked great to contain the (extreme) meal time messes of my 2 year old and the new design is great. The edges are completely covered on both sides so that they are sealed tight. This tray combined with the Baby Bjorn molded bib keeps a LOT of food contained and off my kitchen floor at each meal. I would highly recommend.
