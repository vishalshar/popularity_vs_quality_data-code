Tired of the little towels that never catch anything?!?! These are great for the size and the fabric is very soft.  Some of the Cloths that I have gotten have become more rough after washing, but not these. They are soft wash after wash and cover my full shoulder which helps when burping my little one.I do wish that they were thicker.  Not that they are too thin... Maybe like adding another layer of the same material.  Dunno, like triple ply. Just wish that they were thicker if you get what I am saying.
