This is another beautiful toy from Haba. It comes apart into two - the elastically bound crinkly petals part, and the wooden teether part with a face in the center that goes around. My toddler and I find games to play with it and if I engage the baby he will be interested in it, but if I leave it for him to teethe on he goes off and does something else. We bought it for him to chew on but we do everything but with it so it gets four stars. It's not really a rattle either. The petals crinkle, as I wrote before, and the face in the center goes around silently.
