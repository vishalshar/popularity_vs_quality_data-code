This is a great baby thermometer by Graco Baby.  Most importantly it is accurate and it takes temperatures quickly.  It truly does work in a second.  Its nice that you don't actually have to probe the ear at all, just put the tip of the thermometer in the entrance of the ear canal and it works fine.  The nice bright LCD screen is great for taking baby's temp in the dark while she's sleeping.  I like that it will save up to 10 readings in memory for future reference.  Its also simple to set the reading for Fahrenheit from Celsius.  I would recommend this thermometer.
