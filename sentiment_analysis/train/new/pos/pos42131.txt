HERE'S the FIX to the WEAK MOTOR:Take some twine and tie one of the leaves to the bar in it's up position. That relieves enough tension from the motor to run the rest of the thing normally. Also, tie back the right side of the leaves so they don't catch on the plastic leaves when it rotates. If you don't fold the leaves back, it stalls when they catch on the plastic ones. I posted a picture of what I did, BUT Disclaimer: use what you believe is safe, baby safe, biodegradable love glue or hypoallergenic whatever. Don't blame me if you do something stupid. This is just what I did to get it to work.Other than the crap motor they put in. We love it. Lots of stuff for baby to look at.If we didn't like it so much, I wouldn't have wasted time jerry rigging it.
