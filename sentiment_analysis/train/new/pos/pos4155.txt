I was hesitant to invest in blankets like these, but these are absolutely worth the price. The A&A 2 pack set I was looking at are a smaller size at a higher price, and knew I wanted to find the 47" square to be able to use these as long as possible. They are as soft as advertised and I find myself using them as swaddlers, a nursing wrap, and a car seat cover.  There will be more uses as the newborn grows. The print is a cute and modern gender neutral. I will be ordering a second pack!
