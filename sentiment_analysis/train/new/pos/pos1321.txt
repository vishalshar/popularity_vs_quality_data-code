These waterproof pads are just perfect for several reasons.Absolutely the perfect size and therefore convenient and versatile. ......we use one on the changing table, another in the crib, keep one in the diaper bag for away from home changing, and another in he basket of supplies in the family room.These pads are soft enough that they can be put under your baby's face during sleep.The pads wash and dry beautifully...no creases, no pilling and no shrinking or fading.  After four months of frequent washings, they still look brand new.
