Good product easy to use, similar to other types of toddler toilet seat protectors, it is a bit tricky getting the toddler on and protector staying in place, but all in all works ok for me, probably will be less useful when he is too big for me to lift onto the toilet though.  Also, these are not flushable which make them more useful but kind of gross to deal with when my toddler is done.
