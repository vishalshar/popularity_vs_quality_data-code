...that's what sets this seat apart.There are of course some other nice features, but that is the main one. The SUPER nice thing about it is that you only need to buy another bracket to switch this to a different bike. Too bad those brackets are so expensive, at forty bucks ea. at the time of this review.For instance, it reclines, and the side head pad area is height-adjustable. This also seems to be the only seat that can be used with kids down to 9 mos. old. (9-12 mos. they recommend checking with your pediatrician; the child has to be able to hold his/her head up easily)Installation was not hard, took me about 40 minutes, taking careful time to do each step. Following the instructions is a must, or you will be frustrated. For example, when I was test-fitting the seat rails into the quick-release bracket, I had a heck of a time getting it to lock in place. But once I tightened the bracket mounts fully, it was just perfect. This was in the instructions, a bit later in the process.The seat can also be slid back and forth along the rails, to balance it properly. You see the weight of the child makes the rails flex a bit, which also acts as a suspension system for the seat. It works great.On the first ride with my daughter, she screamed for 5 minutes; just something new she didn't like. Then, she relaxed a little and enjoyed the show. But the end of the ride, I felt her head slump forward against my butt; she was out like a light, gently rocked and bounced to sleep on that springy seat.All the buckles and straps are well thought-out. I expected this, after buying two Britax car seats and a stroller.Other bike seats are rigidly mounted to the bike somehow, so even with some cushioning, they will yield a more jarring ride to the kid than this one. I'm glad I spent the extra money for this one.I'd buy this again in a second.
