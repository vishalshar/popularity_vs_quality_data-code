This is a must have!!! I didnt get one for my shower and for the first 6 weeks she wanted to be held and every time i put her in her swing she would scream. I had a friend recommend this seat and i am so glad she did! She never did like the swing and she loved this seat. She could bounce and move herself and she just seemed more comfortable and free than she did in the swing.It is also great that it is so portable that you can put it in the bathroom while showering or put it in the car with ease to bring to the in laws house. When it was time to start solids at 6 months, i used this as a feeding seat and it worked out great. When she started really sitting up good and getting stronger it was time to get rid of this seat and i had such a hard time because it had become such a life saver. I kept trying to use it but she would just start flipping herself foward in it so i had to stop using it. It is the best baby product ever and she loved her little animals she played with. The elepahant was her fave.
