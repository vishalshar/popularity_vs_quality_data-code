I have had these about 3 weeks now. I got them mostly for my no show socks, so they don;t get lost. They have thick ring in the base, and the lid to hold the shape. And it is triple walled, which is really nice. THe thing keeping it from getting 5/5 stars is the zipper. While it is holding up well, and has not had an issue, it is all plastic. I fear it will break in the future! I sincerely hope not, I really like this product!
