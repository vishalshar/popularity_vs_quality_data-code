Genuine BOB Trailer attachment pins with Lanyards. I purchased a used BOB Yak trailer, which was missing the original pins. I was using metal coat hangers as a replacement for some time. However, my homemade pins did not fit securely and did no have lanyards, so they were easily mislaid. You cannot beat the price for these ($10 for 10) and the quality is very good. These pins are designed to fit securely, and cannot be mislaid. No more cutting wire coat hangers!  I highly recommend these BOB attachment pins with Lanyards.
