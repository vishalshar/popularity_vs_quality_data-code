I was having trouble figuring out how to warmly wear baby in the cold weather. I couldn't get blankets to stay up, my jackets wouldn't close at all, and I didn't want to wear my son outside my coat because I prefer having him closer to my body. So I tried out this vest. It's pretty good - it does keep you and baby warm. Downsides: baby can't chew on carrier straps, which is one of his favorite in-carrier past-times; baby can't rest his head on your warm chest - he tries, and instead gets a bunch of cold, sometimes snowy and wet fleece in his face - yuck!; I don't see how you can do a side-carry (I haven't tried a back carry with the vest). I also don't think this would work with a very tiny baby - seems like they'd need good head control for the vest to work well. Pros: keeps baby's hands and feet warm! Helps keep you warm too, and keeps you and baby close. It's comfortable, soft, fits well. (I've used it with the Ergo and Baby Hawk mei tai carriers.) And when you are going from indoors to outdoors, it's fairly easy to unzip and allow baby to not overheat. Overall, I'm glad I have this fleece.
