We love this bug rattle! We got this when my baby was almost 2 months old and have had it for over a month, my daughter loves it more and more each day! The bright contrasting patterns attract my babies attention. She loves the crinkly sound the wings make. The ribbons on the bottom and the antenna are easy for her to grab and she is learning how to hold the handles now. This rattle has a lot of interesting textures and do-dads for a baby that is just learning to use their hands to grab, more than all the other rattles we were given.  I would highly recommend this rattle for newborn babies.
