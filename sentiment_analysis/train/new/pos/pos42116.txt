My SIL sent me a link about a child using this bottle on FB and right away I knew I had to get some. I purchased a set of 2 initially and after the first feeding, I went back on Amazon and bought the four pack.I am so happy someone invented this system. It makes feeding twin girls a lot easier and more enjoyable. My girls had no problems drawing up the milk through 16 inches of tubing. I wish I knew about these when I had singles. The great benefit to using this system is that I can pump, work on my computer or phone, and feed them at the same time. I place the babies beside me on the sofa so I can burp them or plug the nipple back in when they spit it out. Sometimes they feed on the boppy or sitting in a stationary swing or bouncer seat and that works well. I have not tried feeding them in a stroller but I'm sure that would work too. As one reviewer stated, hands free does not equal supervision free. You must be near at all times to ensure they're plugged in!There are quite a few parts to clean but the tube cleaner provided does make it easier. I gave a 4 star rating because the bottles that come with the system leak, one has broken after falling out of the fridge (I've dropped medela bottles before and they don't break) and the caps that are used with the medela bottles don't work on these bottles. So I use medela bottles, 6 or 8 oz, and disposable nipples I received from the hospital because my babies were used to them. Needless to say, you don't have to use the bottles and nipples that come with the system. Note: you cannot use the playtex bottles with the drop in liners with this system.Overall, I am happy with this system and have told everyone I know about them.
