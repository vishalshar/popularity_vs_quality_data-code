Absolutely fabulous for using in not only our son's carrier but anywhere else we may put him down in. Really helps him fit into areas too big for him. He's starting to outgrow it now at the 4 month mark and we are so sad he's getting so big so quickly!Definitely recommend to all new parents. If you look at the photo I attached, can you imagine if he didn't have this body support pillow? The carrier would swallow him up!
