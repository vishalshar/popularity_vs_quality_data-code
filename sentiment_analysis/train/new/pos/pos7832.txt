I bought this diaper bag three years ago when my daughter was first born. It has been through everything, milk spills, a hundred diaper changes, and has held up really well. I have had to turn the inner lining out and wash it with a mild soap and let it dry. I still carry it often, I can keep a spare change of clothes for my little, wipes, wallet, make up bag, a kid cup in one bottle bucket, a mom water bottle in the other, you name it. It never looks over stuffed. Have gotten tons of compliments from strangers, and they are always surprised when i tell them its a diaper bag. Also the smaller purse that comes with it has become my daughters matching purse. She loves it :) I would def recommend this bag. Actually thinking of ordering another one!
