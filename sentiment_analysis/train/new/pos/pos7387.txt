My kids have always used the Soothie pacifiers so I was excited to see they were coming out with bottles. I bought these for my 3rd child, I was impressed with the way they were made they seemed durable enough to last and didn't leak the few times we did get to use them. I never did use the little storage containers that came with them, not sure I would trust them too much as the lid just sort of sits inside it. Unfortunately my daughter had reflux and would scream & cry any time she was fed so we switched to another bottle (Dr. Browns) which really helped her out in the long run. She still used her Soothie paci though until she found her thumb which she prefers over anything.
