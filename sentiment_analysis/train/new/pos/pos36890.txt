I tried to buy a replacement tube for my Medela swing pump but was unable to find just the tubing. Since I was not interested in spending a small fortune to purchase the whole Medela kit I went looking online. This tubing fit my swing perfectly and is longer than the tubing that came with it. It is amazing how much easier it is to pump with just a slightly longer tubing. I am very happy with this purchase!
