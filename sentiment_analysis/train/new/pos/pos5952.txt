This is our first kid and we read a lot of reviews of different car seats. They both have their own pros and cons, and for first-time parents it's hard to decide which to chose. Here are the reasons why we chose B-Safe and thought it was good for us:1. We scoped down our candidate list to only popular brands, like Britax and Chicco. Safety design difference between different brands is not a concern for us because so many people have used them for quite some time and the car seat safety has been well verified.2. For a perfect match stroller. When buying the car seat we deinitely need to think of what stroller we want. Buying a car seat that does not match the stroller is just a waste of money. We like the Britax B-Ready stroller and don't want the hassle of buying parts to fit a Chicco car seat into a Britax stroller, so we decided we'll pick up a Britax car seat.3. Some reviews said B-Safe car seat base was not easy to install. We watched the installation instruction videos on Youtube before we bought it and found it was fairly easy to install. It turned to be true when I actually installed the seat in my car. I would recommend other people to do the same when making decisions.4. This car seat fits well in my 2011 Ford Escape. A bigger car seat might not work.A side note is that I personally think installing the car seat correctly is far more important, so be sure to take car seat inspecions. It's free in many hostipals and even in IKEA.
