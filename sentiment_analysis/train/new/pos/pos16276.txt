We are the proud owners this go round of an Uppababy Vista and all its attachments, the holy grail of strollers in my humble opinion. It was absolutely essential that we maintain this stroller well, since its going to be around for at least the next 4 years, and having done this baby thing a time before I understand just how much abuse and misuse these things take from their riders. Barf, poop, milk spills, crushed up goldfish.... the horrors this major investment get put through on a daily basis! This cleaning kit is a must have for anyone with a quality stroller. The items smell heavenly, they really WORK on stains and smells, and they are organic so you dont have to worry about exposing your baby to harmful chemicals. Keep that investment in tip top shape: keep this items in their little travel bag (included) in your car at all times so you are always ready for whatever abuses come your strollers way.
