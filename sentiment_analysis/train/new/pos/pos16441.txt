I have been searching everywhere for a stroller cover like this 5 years ago when I had my first child. We have tried every cover out there and this one by far is the best one. This is a wonderful product to keep your baby warm and protect them from the wind. It's keeps baby nice and toasty inside especially when it gets to bone-chilling temperatures. The cover is very well made and it stays put during windy days. Love the canopy that you can pull down to block the sun or to cover baby when they're sleeping. The material is excellent and the back of the quilted part is some type of velour-like fabric, which is soft to the touch.  Zippers work well and it's easy to put baby in and out.The only complaint I have with this is that it is NOT waterproof. After being in the light rain for 15 minutes, the cover was soaked and my stroller was drenched. If we had stayed out longer or had it been raining heavier, my child would have been soaking wet. For the price (a very steep price for a stroller cover), this stroller should be waterproof. I love this stroller cover but unfortunately I still have to buy those ugly plastic stroller covers to use in the rain. Please add a waterproof material to this cover so that it can be used in all types of weather and be the holy grail of all stroller covers.Aside from not being waterproof, we love this cover and I recommend it to any parent. Your baby will stay warm in frigid temperatures and block the wind. Just don't use it in the rain.
