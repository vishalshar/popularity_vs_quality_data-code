This little area rug is super cute and super soft! I'm always looking for softer, more pastel color hello kitty items and this is perfect! it's just the right size to put at the edge of my bed for when I get up at night and this little rug is super easy to clean as well! Just pop it in the washer on a gentle cycle and dry it on low heat and it's good as new! It does slip on my dorm room tiles a little since the bottom is fleece, but it's nothing too bad really, just a small nudge back in place is all you have to do. Overall, this is great for $17 dollars and I couldn't be happier with it!
