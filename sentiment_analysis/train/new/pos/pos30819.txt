This canopy is so cute. It was just what we needed to smoothly transition our almost 2 and a half year old out of her crib and into her toddler bed. There was a lot of pieces to put together, but the instructions were easy to understand. It exceeds my expectation for a canopy of this price!This should hold up until we're ready for a bigger bed.I would def. recommend this for anyone looking to make a toddler bed into a bed fit for a princess!In case anyone else wondered, this fits perfectly with the metal toddler beds as well as the others advertised.
