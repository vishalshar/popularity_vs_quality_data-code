Was not expecting such prompt shipping!! Anyhow been using for about 4 days now? And they are working wonderful!!! The many layers are very absorbent!! My only complaint would be the strange smell on them when they first arrived, but after prepping it (2 hot washes without detergent the smell went away)These things are awesome!!! Very absorbent!! And fit with my G diapers VERY well!! Would reccomend to a friend!!
