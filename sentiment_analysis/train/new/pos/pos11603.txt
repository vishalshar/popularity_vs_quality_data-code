I was leary at first to buy this one, it seemed "crappy". But it was pretty easy to put together and my Daughter likes it. One small minor con is that its reclined a little bit, but a small pillow or folded towel works perfect.Update: 10 months later. It crapped out a few months ago. I bought the IKEA highchair today.
