This is a great sling better than a basic front carrier and so easy to use.  My 4 month old got a little fussy at first but after a few tries she really enjoys being held and looking around to see what is going on.  I mainly use it when she doesnt want to stay in the stroller.  I bought a size bigger than i was suppose to get and it's perfect.  Very stylish.  My only regret is that i didnt buy a neutral color like black or brown since this pattern does not go with every outfit.
