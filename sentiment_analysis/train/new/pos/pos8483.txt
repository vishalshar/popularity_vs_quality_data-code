If you're looking for this cup and reading this review because you're unsure- stop.  Buy it.This stupid cup is 17 dollars but my picky, lazy, behind-the-curve 1.5 year old drinks from it- and likes it.  He swings it between his legs with the straw in his mouth like he don give a flying eff. He drinks so much that he soaks through his diaper, pj, blanket, and sheet most nights.Stupid honey bear cup taught my kid how to use a straw in 8 minutes.
