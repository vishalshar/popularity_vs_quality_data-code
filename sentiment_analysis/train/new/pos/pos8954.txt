I bought this snack tower recently so that I could have a variety of snacks in my son's diaper bag. I did a lot of searching prior to purchasing and was down to either this or the Zoli snack stack. I ended up going with this one due to its much lower price and the fact that it comes with a lid for every section, allowing you to use it as several individual containers also.I am pleased with the container(s) as individuals and the overall quality is good, especially for the price. The lids screw on pretty tight and seal well, keeping snacks fresh and secure. However, as others have stated, when stacked, the space available in each section is dramatically reduced by the curved bottom of the section on top of it. I would estimate that each section can only be filled about 2/3 full, except for the top, which would be like 1 1/3 (because lid curves out too - could heap that section depending on what you are putting in it). Small snacks (think cereal, goldfish crackers, cut-up fruit, etc) fill the space the best. Awkward and/or larger snacks (graham crackers, teething biscuits, etc) do not fit very well without being broken into smaller pieces. I recommend putting the largest items in the top of the stack where there is more room.Overall: Great if you want ability to use as individuals or a stack, but have to be ok with having reduced space when used in its stacked form.
