These have been a big help, especially in the early days of breastfeeding. I've used them both cold and warm, and definitely found them more helpful cold. The cover is really comfortable, and the cold was really helpful for the painful engorgement I would sometimes get. The gel pads are also a lot bigger than I expected, which I liked. They covered the whole area I needed them to and provided a lot of relief. I tried to use them warm a few times, but I could never get them to heat up to a degree that was helpful, and they didn't hold heat for very long. With the cover on, I really couldn't feel the heat at all.
