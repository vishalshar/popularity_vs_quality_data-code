If you need help with your LO wanting to use the big potty, but can't find a stool tall enough for them to be independent- then this is your best buy! Extremely durable to little ones playing the the handles where the hinges are. My daughter is so proud of herself and feels comfortable while  learning her body and her limits growing. The potty is made of durable plastic, the cushion is soft and fits nicely in our toilet seat. When not in use, it folds up nice and neat, not taking up a lot of real estate in your bathroom.Thank you for selling this product to help families potty train their children.
