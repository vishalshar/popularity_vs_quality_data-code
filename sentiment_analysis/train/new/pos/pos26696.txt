Both of my kids (4 & 18mo) love these water bottles. They are easy to fill and easy to clean. The markings on the side make it easy to track how much they're drinking on hot days. They are leak-proof when the top is closed, but will pour out if open so we only put water in it if giving it to the younger one in the car. The 4-year-old can open it without help. Like all bottles of this type, it can build pressure so either leave the straw open if leaving it in a hot car or open it with the straw pointed away from you so you don't get a bath. I've been using the 16oz version for myself for about a year and it's held up really well. My only complaint is that it doesn't fit in the cup holder built into one of the kids' carseats, but it does fit into all standard car cup holders so it may be a flaw of the carseat. (Bottle is 2.75 inches at the base if you want to check your holders before you buy.) The carry loop makes it easy for little hands to carry or for Mom to carry several in one hand. Overall, very happy with these.
