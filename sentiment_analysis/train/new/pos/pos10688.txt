I love love these!! The colors are fun (although I probably wouldn't get the pattern again since it has red in it and it can be a bit of a surprise when you are looking at it while using it... Let the reader understand!) However, they are wonderfully absorbent, COMFORTABLE, don't irritate my skin, and are easy to clean. I rinse after use and then soak until laundry day. Not really any extra work on my part and they are still pristine looking. I would confidently recommended anyone. Can't compare to other products since this is my first brand and I love what I got. I did find that these "super" size were only SLIGHTLY larger than a regular disposable pad, so if you normally get a larger size, don't order down! Other than that, enjoy!
