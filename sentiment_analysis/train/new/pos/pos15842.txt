I love this night stand! It has a reversible drawer plate without the princesses (pink/purple girly design) so when my 2 year old daughter is older it won't be too childish. It even comes with a screwdriver and all the screws/pieces are separated with an easy to remove backing. I do recommend a small flashlight if you're in a not so lit area so you can see the connection screw and lock. Took me 15 minutes to assemble (and I'm a girl). :)Bought two just because of the price and the quality.
