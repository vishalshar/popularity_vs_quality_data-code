I can steer this stroller while its fully loaded with kids and gear, and it turns on a dime. It maneuvers like a dream! It folds differently than the single stroller, which took getting used to, but now I can fold it up and chuck it in my minivan with one hand, all while holding a baby in the other. Awesome.  I live in the sunny South, so I love the two canopies.Note: Amazon's Product Description is inaccurate for this particular model on three points:1. This stroller does not come with a rear snack tray, it comes with an "arm bar".2. The rear seat can be all the way up or all the way flat - there is no multi-position recline.3. There is one parent cup holder, not two.Since I need the lure of food to keep the kids in the stroller, the lack of a rear snack tray was a major disappointment for me.  (The trays can be bought from Graco for $19.99). The two-position recline and single cup holder were less significant problems for me. All in all, I love my new stroller!
