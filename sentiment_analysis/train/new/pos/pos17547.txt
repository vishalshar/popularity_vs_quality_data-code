I was really looking forward to putting this together. It did take some time. At first it wasn't a big hit with my four month old but since then she has become very fascinated with it, especially sitting up. The toy adjusts for a child who sits and she seems to enjoy the toy in the "sit up" mode the best. It does pretty well on batteries and there are lots of things for the little ones to play with. The detachable toys are a great feature- if there is one that is a favorite it can travel along with you! Overall, a good product. Buy this used in good condition and save a little cash.
