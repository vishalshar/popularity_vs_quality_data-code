I like these decals because they match baby's room. They're very pretty. HOwever, they don't stick worth a darn on their own. I applied them on one night and the next morning over half of them were peeling off. I had to re-do it all and spray adhesive on the backs of each decal so they were tacky and sticky. Now, I'm not as happy with where I placed them so I'll have to see how temporary that adhesive really was and whether or not these decals can be removed and reapplied. If it is difficult, I'll buy another set but I'll start with the adhesive right away so I don't waste time trying to apply them without a tacky back.
