As everyone else has mentioned, this is the Classic Sunshade, not the Deluxe.  However, as someone else also pointed out, this is still a better price than the Classic so I bought it full well knowing I would not be getting the Deluxe.  It works well on my umbrella stroller (UppaBaby), so I imagine it'll be even better on my full size.
