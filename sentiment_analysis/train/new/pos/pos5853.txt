My 14 month old sleeps in this every night!!!  It is almost the same measurement's as a infant bed but I wanted something portable since I don't have much space in my house!It is awesome! I have crawled in with her sometimes (HA!!!).... A mother will do anything to get the baby to sleep :))) But her and I in there is almost 200 pounds in there and it feels so sturdy! Plus it folds up EASY!We saw this in babies r us and my husband and I were both super impressed! And I found in cheaper on amazon! score
