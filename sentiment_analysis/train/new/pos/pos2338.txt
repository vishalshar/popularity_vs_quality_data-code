I purchased this VCR guard because of my grandchildren.  They just would not leave those buttons alone. After much searching I found this VCR guard.  I put it on there and kept watching for them to try, but never saw them.  After a few visits I thought "well I just wasted my money because they have not even tried to change the channels."  So I was cleaning the TV screen and happened to look at the VCR guard where the light was shining directly on it just right and there were little finger prints all over it.  This is an excellent product and would certainly buy it again, only sooner.
