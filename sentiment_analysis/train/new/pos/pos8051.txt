Bought this chair for rocking/feeding my third child due this summer.  First 2 kids now have the rocker I used for them in their rooms.  I wanted something comfortable and attractive that wouldn't break the bank.  This chair fits the bill perfectly.  Some of the other reviews made it sound as though it was a little small.  It is a regular sized chair that sits slightly lower to the ground.  I bought the ivory and it is very nice and the fabric is so soft and cozy, I can't see paying hundreds more for a different color.  Would buy this again without any hesitation.
