I just love these diapers...  My daughter is only 6 weeks old, and although the one size is a bit big one her, adding a cover makes them perfect.  I also purchased some newborn sizes, but these work great too.  they are the perfect on-the-go diaper.  I wouldn't recommend the one size for a newborn, but if you get the newborn size to start, you should be just fine.  Until they arrived, I didn't know that the one size diapers are not pocket diapers, nor do they have snaps or a velcro closure.  They simply flap over, so you will either need a snappy or a cover.  Instead of a pocket and an insert, there is an extra absorbent insert like flap sewn to the inside.  If you're like me and change your baby every 2-3 hours, then you won't need a cover.  But if you want a little extra protection or plan to use these as an overnight diaper, then I would recommend a cover.  I also love the fact that I don't have to line dry these.  Because they're completely cloth, I can throw them in the dryer with my prefolds and inserts.  I only had to run them through the washer 4 times to strip them, compared to other diapers I have where I had to run them through the washer 7 or 8 times to get them really absorbent.  All in all, I would DEFINITELY recommend these diapers.  They are perfect for about 2 months and up, but get a few newborn sizes before that.  It's worth the cost, because you will recoup your money if you sell them elsewhere.
