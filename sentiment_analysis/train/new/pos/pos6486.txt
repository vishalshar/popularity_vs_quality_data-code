My son began ripping his velcro bibs off at every meal, making a huge mess and causing more than a little parental frustration. I finally found these snap bibs and they are a life saver! The snaps are VERY strong and my kiddo doesn't even try to rip his bibs off anymore. We can even swap out the velcro ones and he still doesn't mess with them. I've found the bibs to be good quality otherwise. We have been using them daily for a few months now, washing after each meal, and they're holding up well. I do wish the back was plastic like the front. It's a softer material that stuff tends to stick too. No biggie, it just doesn't clean up quite as quickly. These are definitely worth the $$ though. We'll only order these in the future.
