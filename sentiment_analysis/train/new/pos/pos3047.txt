We went from a Graco Snugride 35 Click Connect infant carrier to this convertible car seat after doing tons and tons and tons or research (parents seem to research baby items to death, don't we?!).  I LOVE the no thread harness.  I know you don't have to rethread harnesses very often, but even the easiest ones are still a pain when you have to do it, so I am super happy with the ease of just squeezing the handle and pulling up to move the harness.  It took a while for my daughter to get big enough to use the cushiony shoulder straps since the combination of those straps plus the Hug things were to big.  Now that she is larger, I am so glad the cushions are useable since they save her neck from getting lines and chafes from having the straps rub.It is a heavy car seat and not the easiest to move from vehicle to vehicle.  My first time installing took over an hour (mind you that I had never installed a convertible carseat before and infant car seat bases are such a snap to install), but subsequent installations take under 10 minutes now that I know what I am doing.  If you are moving from an infant seat to one of these, I highly recommend watching a youtube video, especially for the tethering options (which is where I was left scratching my head).I love having a seat that seems very secure and safe for my daughter.  The clicking when tightening the harness is also a nice feature for those that don't routinely place the child in the seat to know when the harness straps are tight enough.  Overall a great car seat in my opinion with very cute patterns (we got the cow patterned one).
