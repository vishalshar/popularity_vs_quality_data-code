We use the Zooper Hook On High Chair as our main high chair.The last thing we needed was yet another brightly colored HUGE plastic baby item in our way too small house, so we opted for a hook on. The colors are pleasing (it hard to see in the pic, but it is tan/brown with pink trim) and the design is simple and practical.It clears our 4" table skirt with no problem, getting it hooked on was a breeze. The clamps are covered in plastic, so you don't get scratches on your table.The seat is nicely cushioned, especially in the back so my baby does not have a metal bar sticking in her back (we looked at the MeToo, too and did not buy it because of the lack of cushioning)and comes with a cushioned suppord board as well.It has a full harness and a lap strap for safety. There is no metal bar in the front, but a nylon strap that runs between the clamps...less potential for little fingers getting pinched.I have already run it through the washer once, though it wipes down easily as well. If you do wash it, you don't have to take of the clamps that attach to the table, instead just take off the back bar and unsnap the seat, the support board goes in and out easily as well and is covered in plastic, so if you had a big mess, it wipes down clean.This is quite a big chair, my 7 month old has PLENTY of room left to grow into it.We love it and may actually buy a second one for being out and about.
