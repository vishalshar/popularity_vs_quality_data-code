This Toddler bedding set is SO SO CUTE!  For the money it's a WONDERFUL value!  The fabric is so soft and it washed & dried very well.  I washed all 4 pieces together in Dreft on Delicate/Cold.  Had no problems with colors running. I wish the flat sheet was "fitted style" at the bottom to prevent from coming untucked at night.  However, with a seamstress in the family and a little elastic that's easily fixed! Yes, the comforter is more of a blanket, but I plan on adding another light weight blanket underneath it during the Winter. As soon as my little guy saw it he got very excited and started pointing out all of the different balls on the flat sheet.  I hope he'll be as equally excited to start sleeping in this as we transition him into his "big boy" bed!
