We bought this bunny as a soothing noise maker for our daughter beside her crib. It works very well, but there is still room for improvement. Simply put, there are two improvements that my wife and I feel would elevate the performance of this item.1 - There are two pre-set durations for how long it operates, 23 minutes and 45 minutes. You select between the two using a slider switch. As there are times where you need a white / background noise generator to last for longer periods, this item could be improved by upgrading the 2 position slider switch to a 3 position slider switch, and reprogram the logic to where the middle position has no duration, remaining on until you turn it off.2 - The white / background noise generated works excellently to help mask sounds that might otherwise disturb our baby girl. However, when the pre-set duration is reached, the sound shuts off abruptly. The "sounds of silence" aka the absence of the white /background noise, is enough to cause our baby to wake up due to the quiet. The improvement that could be made is that, starting 5 minutes before the end of either pre-set duration, the volume could be decreased gradually so that by the time the end of the duration is reached, the sound is gone. This would allow your resting baby to gradually get used to the absence of sound, and avoid the abrupt end of sound causing your baby to stir.As I said, those two points above would take an already very good item and push it over the top into excellence.
