I purchsed this about two and a half years ago for my son and now it has been passed down to my 10 month old daughter. Without a doubt, this kept my son entertained. He loved locking/unlocking the doors to get the balls that he drops into the shoot on the side of the tent. He learned to match the colors and shapes in order to unlock them. I think it is a wee bit flimsy for it being for toddlers/kids. As my son got older, I had to remind him not to be too tough on it because it isnt strong/heavy-duty. Here's what is not so great about it; the latches on each side of the poles at the bottom which holds the fabric around the four sides seems to 'pop off' more frequently than I would like. Also, the other side of the tent where you latch (I didn't say lock - which I wished it did do) the half funnels to make the balls zig-zag down from the top of the tent to the bottom and shot out continue to come off. And it seems like they don't fit just right. They are not numbered or labeled on which funnel should go where. That's pretty annoying, especially when the kids do a lot of handling/playing with it. However, my son is now playing with it again since I brought it out for his little sister to play with. It's lasted several years and hope for a few more.
