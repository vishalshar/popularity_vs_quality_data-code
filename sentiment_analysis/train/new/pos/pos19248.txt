The inserts are of great quality. They absorb a lot ( my son who is 17 months is not a heavy wetter). I use them stuffed inside Kawaii ultra soft pockets, the inserts would be much better if a bit wider in the middle. I wash my son's diapers using All free and clear, which works great with the inserts.
