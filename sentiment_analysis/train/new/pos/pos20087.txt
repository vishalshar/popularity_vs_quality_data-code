I love this highchair. When it folds, the inside of the seat ends up on the outside of either side. I love this because you never get food caked in the nooks of the seat. I fold it down at the end of the day, spray it with cleaner, and wipe it down. It's super easy to clean. The Zoo Friends design is great because it masks stains. At dinnertime, my baby is in hew highchair around the table with the rest of the family. I give her a mashed up version of whatever we are eating and let her feed herself, so, of course, she makes huge messes everyday. However, you wouldn't know it from looking at this highchair. I love this chair because it is easy to fold down, it's compact when it is folded down, it's easy to clean when it's folded down, I can make it upright again with one hand while holding my baby, the material is easy to clean, and the pattern masks stains. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. It's also really cute!
