I really like this bib and just ordered two more.  This is the only bib I've tried with sleeves, but it seems to work very well.  I agree with some other reviewers that it would be nice to have more of an elastic cuff at the end to keep food from getting on the ends of my baby's sleeves, but the elastic cuff would also probably make it harder to clean and harder to get on and off.  The neck opening does seem a little large, but so far it hasn't been an issue and no food has gotten down her neck with the bib on (except for water when she's drinking, but only a turtleneck bib would solve that, I think!).  It is very lightweight and easy to clean and can be thrown in the washing machine if needed.  My daughter is almost 13 months and in the 90th percentile for height/weight, and the toddler size is a little big on her - I cuff the sleeves so they aren't falling on her hands.  I don't mind that it's a little big, because it will probably last her a long time.  I rarely use regular bibs anymore and only use the bibs with sleeves, although maybe in the summer if she's wearing a sleeveless shirt I will use a regular bib.
