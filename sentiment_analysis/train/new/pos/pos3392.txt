I am really happy with this product.  I love that I can machine wash the cover and put the tray in the dishwasher; although I rarely do either, there is definitely a time when I need to and it is quite helpful.  I am constantly hand washing the tray and wiping down the cover, both are quick and easy to do. The tray is large.  The high chair is safe and sturdy, even when not attached to a chair; I've used it on multiple kinds of chairs and have never been concerned about it tipping.When I first received the highchair the box said that the cover was NOT machine washable.  I was quite upset and called Fisher-Price to double check.  They informed me that it IS machine washable now!  I guess they updated it but the box did not reflect the change.The only negatives I have with this product are:  the straps are difficult to remove and clean, the tray doesn't fit well in the dishwasher and has to be laid on the top rack which leaves the bottom of the tray full of water afterward, the arms that the tray attach to don't come off or flip down/up so that it will pull up all the way to the table when used as a booster, and the chair doesn't fold up for storage (which would be nice!).Overall, I am very pleased with this product.  The pros definitely outweigh the cons.
