I love this thing! So simple yet it has suddenly become our number one bath time necessity.My 7 month old is just now to the point where she sits up quite confidently, but in the bath where it is slippery, and she wants to splash, this is a huge comfort to me. She can sit comfortably, lean over if she needs to reach for something slightly to her side, and best of all, when she takes a bath with big sis, she doesn't get knocked over! LolWe have had it a couple of weeks now and have used it a ton. When both girls were sick with bad colds recently and feeling cranky into the bath they went for some steam to clear those sinuses. They were both so comfortable they would have likely stayed in the bath all day had I allowed it. It seems to dry well. (A hint...let it sit in the drained tub for about 15 minutes after bath, so that a large amount of the water drains on it's own, else the thing weighs a ton!)Then just hang it up and leave it sit until next time. (I have a second shower curtain rod in the bath which I hang baskets of bath toys upon and I hang this on there as well. Perfect as it drips straight down into the tub rather than onto my floor.)My only regret? Not finding it sooner so that we could have used the sling side longer, though again, when the babe was sick, we did use it that way and she just laid back and relaxed, happy as can be, little feet kicking away.
