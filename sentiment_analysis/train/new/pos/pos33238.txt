I'm becoming a bit of a juDanzy collector at this point. These aren't the first "leg warmers" we've gotten form them. The quality is perfect and my toddler uses them on her arms and legs in the winter months. This pair was bought as a part of her Halloween bee costume and she's still wearing them months later.We use them on her arms sometimes in the winter when she's wearing a short sleeve shirt because she gets eczema and sometimes wants to scratch away - these don't irritate it and keep the eczema lotion on and prevent her scratches - plus they are stylish !
