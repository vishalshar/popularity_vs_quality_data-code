I purchased this as a gift for my soon to be grandchild. They are BPA free and the set comes with everything you need to get started. The bottles are designed to feed your baby in a more upright position and to prevent colic. My grand daughter was an awesome baby and had no colic what so ever. Not sure if the bottles helped with that but they may have. My daughter in law used these exclusively after she stopped nursing and was very happy with them.
