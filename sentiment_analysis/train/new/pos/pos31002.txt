My son has very serious eczema skin problems.  His skin cannot be against anything except for cotton.  This carseat cover, that is 100% cotton, did the trick.  Once we started to use this cover, the rashes went away immediately.  We have a Britax Marathon.  The carseat cover fits fine.  As others has said there is no hole for the front strap adjustment, and there side holes for the leg straps are a bit off.  But since the holes are velcro, that is not a big deal.  It would be nice if this company partnered with different carseat manufactuers to make cottons covers that are specific to different brands of carseats where the actual holes in the original carseat cover matched up exactly with this carseat cover, but that my wish list item and not a negative of the product.  As for the comment about it not being safe, the material is about as thick as a standard shirt, so unless you think that your child wearing clothes is a carseat safety hazard, there is no issue with this cover and the safety of the carseat.  This cover goes over the existing carseat cover.  It does not replace it.  Oh, I washed the carseat cover once when I first got it.
