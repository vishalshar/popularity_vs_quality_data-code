I have a blue fleece swaddle me, and I have loved it, but my son was born in May so it got warm shortly after he was born, then I purchased this one. It has worked pretty well, but he is better at wriggling out of it. I do love the material, it is very soft and breathable, and I use it all the time. When he starts to get out of it easier I just wash it again to help shrink it back to its original size, it seems to help. He has been sleeping through the night since we started swaddling him with the swaddleMe (from about 9pm to 5am) so I love it! He is more than two months old now and he uses it every time he sleeps!
