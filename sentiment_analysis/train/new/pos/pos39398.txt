We used this cup to transition from a bottle and it worked like a charm!  We had no trouble at all!  We just took off the handles and started using this in place of a bottle, cold turkey.  Because the spout is soft, it made for an easy transition.  My son now likes to take the top off and drink from it as a regular cup occasionally, but we like to leave the lid on when he's out and about.  It rarely spills, unless it is placed face-down and the spout is bent.  Then it will leak quickly since the spout is soft.  We bought a few of these and I'm very happy with them!
