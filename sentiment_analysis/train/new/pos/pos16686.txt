I love this set! It's so pretty and fit perfectly in my baby girls room. We moved into our house when my youngest was 5 months old and her room was a pretty purple. I didn't want to paint so I looked endlessly until I found something I liked. I got her name embroidered on the pillow and that turned out beautifully. It arrived timely and in great shape. It's quality, true to color and just too cute! The blanket is really comfortable too! I used it as a decoration but my little girl (now 18months) pulls it down every night to sleep with it. She even crawled out of her bed the other day and cuddled in her chair with it and fell asleep. The only negative thing I could manage to conjure up is that the sheet almost doesn't match. It does the job and you can't really see it so it's not unsightly but it's definitely not up to par, looks wise, as the rest of the set. Easy to buy a pretty matching sheet somewhere else for cheap though. All in all a year later it's still great, beautiful, and holding up wonderfully.
