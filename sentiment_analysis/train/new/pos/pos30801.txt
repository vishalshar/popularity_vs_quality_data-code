In a nutshell, I couldn't find a review that compared these two products.  I was given the Ergo, and I liked that the baby is in a more ergonomic position than that of the original, Active and Miracle Baby Bjorn carriers.  Then, BB came out with the One carrier.  I looked all over the internet for a frank comparison of the two but didn't find any so here's my take now that i've used  both of them.the Ergo Pros:- Baby in ergonomic position- Zippered pocket for your things- Comes in multiple colors- Has snooze cover- Less expensivethe Ergo Cons:- no front-facing option- less comfortable than the One- doesn't fold up neatly like the Onethe One Pros:- ergonomic back-facing position JUST LIKE the ergo- front facing option, TOO!- folds up compactly- more comfortable than Ergo- no need for too-hot infant insert.  newborns can go in this!the One Cons:- really expensive (but if you go to Buy Buy Baby or BRU wiht their 20% off coupons, you can get it for $160)- only one color- nowhere to put my wallet, keys, etc.In the end, I exchanged my Ergo for the One because the front-facing option was too valuable for me to not have.  And then when baby is sleepy, I turn her around, and the One has these zippers that turn it into an Ergo-like carrier.  So the One is really like having an Ergo but with another position!  I do miss the zippered pocket for my things on the Ergo... with the One, I have to carry a small purse across my body.  And there's no snooze cover on the One, but that's a small sacrifice for having a front-facing option.If I could, I would give the Ergo 4 stars and the One 4.5 stars.  If you're on a budget, the Ergo is perfectly fine!  But if you can splurge a little more and have a 20% coupon at BBB or BRU, then go with the One.Happy baby-wearing!
