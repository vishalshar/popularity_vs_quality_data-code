My just-turned-Five year old has a problem.  She is on the small side (she just moved from a 3T to a 4T, mainly due to her height increase recently), and she has no butt.  Also, she doesn't have the hips and butt that her athletic build her 8 year old sister has always has.  So, she's always having problems with her pants falling down on her hips and showing off her butt crack.  Thank god for skinny jeans.  Even those are loose on her, but it is better.  But still, the only pants that fit the waist were the 3T's which are way too short on her.  We could pass them off as capris in the summer, but in the winter?  Not gonna happen.I had seen a few bloggers in the last few months reviewing and offering a giveaway for these, which is how I discovered them.  I could have ordered them through the company website, but since I have Amazon Prime, and I like the return policy with Amazon, I decided order here, at least for this first time.These are really cute, heavy-duty elastic, with something like 6 different possibilities to snap it closed.  I found that she needed them on the "tightest" snaps with one pair of jeans, and could have gone a little looser with a different pair.  It's easy to get it just right at least.I worried about her going to school (kindergarten) this next school year, both with her inadvertent mooning, or the potential of soiling herself because of an uncooperative belt.  Since this item is placed at the back of the pants, it just makes it so much easier to use the toilet.As of right now, I am giving this a solid 5-star rating.  I just hope that they last.  The price is a little high, in my opinion, for a strip of elastic with 2 "male" snaps and 4 "female" counterparts.  But, if it helps my little munchkin, so be it.  I don't want to bother with pulling my sewing machine out to try making a set for her.
