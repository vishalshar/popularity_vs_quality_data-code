My little guy has been using this sippy since he was about 12 months and is almost 3 now!  It's the only sippy he has used day in and day out for milk.ProsCleans easilyLeaks very little compared to most soft spout sippys I have found.Handles in great position and detachable.Top rack dishwasher safe in my experiences.ConsIt has several pieces you have to put together perfect before each use/after cleaning or it will leak all over your little one.  It's not hard...you just have to pay attention.If they are teething they can chew holes in the silicone which messes up the spout... Makes it leak.Kinda pricy.
