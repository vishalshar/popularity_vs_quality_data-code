This makes a very cute ornament and it was very easy to use. I bought two and made one of baby's hand and one of her foot. You needed to press baby's hand or foot somewhat hard to make a good indent but I made it while my daughter was sleeping and it worked out perfect (she didn't even wake up). Also, the completed ornament was perfect the way it was, but I choose to paint the hand and foot once the "clay" was dry to make it stand out more. The ornaments turned out very cute and we received many compliments once they were hung on our Christmas tree. This would make a cute gift for grandparents too!
