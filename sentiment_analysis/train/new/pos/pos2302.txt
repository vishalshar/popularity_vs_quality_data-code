I love the Baby Deedee Sleep Nest! I ordered the sleep sack in December for my infant son after trying many different brands. I was getting frustrated because he always seemed to wake up with cold hands and feet. We live in Colorado so we are used to cold winters, but I don't feel comfortable using blankets in his crib. Some fleece sacks that we tried would trap the heat in and he'd wake up clammy. This sleep sack really seems to keep him at the perfect temperature. His room tends to drop down to about 65 degrees at night and he no longer wakes up with cold feet. I've also been very impressed with the quality. We use it for 2 naps a day and every night at bedtime, so we've really put it to the test. Two months later and it's still perfect after daily use. It really does live up to the hype and is worth every penny!!Sizing notes -- At the time of purchase, my son was 10 months old, 20 lbs, 29" long. The medium was perfect -- it fit him well with room to grow but not so large that he could wiggle out of it.Customer service -- I think the customer service is what has made me a Baby Deedee fan for life. I had an issue with the first sleep nest that we received. It had a small hole along the seam. I sent an email directly to their customer service and received a personal call within an hour. When does that ever happen??? A replacement was sent out immediately. 5 stars not only for the product but also for customer service.
