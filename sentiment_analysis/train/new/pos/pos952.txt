We purchased a Moby wrap and have used it for both of our children. After they have neck control, we move over to the Ergo (which is another great product more suited to slightly older children).Being able to keep our children happy while still being able to be active and work has been invaluable. I have been able to work on the computer, do the dishes, pick up the house, or have a peaceful dinner at a restaurant with the help of the Moby. If you do move around a fair bit, make sure to hold their head secure with one hand (probably obvious, but it bears repeating :P).I would recommend this to any parent. It may look somewhat complicated, but it is easy to wrap up-- if you are worried about the difficulty of wrapping it before you get out of the car or something, just remember to put it on before you leave the house: you can just tuck the little one in once you arrive at your destination, then go! Once the little one is too big or heavy for this, definitely check out the Ergo (we have the old style, but the new style is probably good, as well). Both the Ergo and Moby have been invaluable.
