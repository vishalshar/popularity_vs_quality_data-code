These are really amazing for babies and toddlers. I purchased these for my son a little over 3 years ago and he still plays with them in the bathtub. When I first bought them he was only 1 and now that he is 4 he knows how to stack the cups and now has so many different ways that he plays with them. Each cup has drain holes but they are out of shapes and some of the water will drain quickly and some slower. I love these toys that allow a child to help them developmentally to figure out how to stack from big to small. I like the colors and they stack also in a pattern. These are definitely quality stacking cups since I have had them for 3 years.  I find it easy to sanitize the cups because I put all his toys in the bathtub and sanitize them with just a cap of bleach and rinse them off really good.
