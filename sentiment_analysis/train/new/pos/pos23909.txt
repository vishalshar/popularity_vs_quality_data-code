UPDATE: Have to change this to a 5 star rating on 7/18/12 after leaving this original comment about color snafu last week and thought that was that.  Today, the retailer called me and apologized for the snafu and explained difficulties with my order.  He is sending me the correct "girl" colors at no charge.I am impressed by the service and the wonderful gentleman who called today.  Amazon does have some great sellers who do right for their customers!  THANK YOU!!!!!ORIGINAL: I have used Tommee Tippee cups for my grandchildren for many months.  They do not leak, are easy to clean and are very durable.  Highly recommend them.  There were 2 options to buy these, one with boy colors and one with girl colors.I made sure I was on the "girl" page when I ordered, However, what I got sent were boy colors with truck and dinosaurs.  So I am not very happy with this vendor through Amazon.
