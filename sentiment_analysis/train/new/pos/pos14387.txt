I started "potty" training when my daughter was just about 4 months after reading some things about starting early.  It was getting tough holding her up on the potty until my mom purchased this seat for her house when she watched her.Now that my daughter is sitting on her own and is 8 months old, she sits unsupported on this potty seat right on the toilet itself.  It's cushy enough for her and at 16 pounds it holds her just fine.I like the "shield" in front and helps with splatter.I will say that this seat topper fits differently on our new Kohler toilet.  It sits further back so that there is a small opening where my daughter's feet pretty much rest on the toilet itself.  But at my mom's house, she has an older toilet (prob 1970's!) and since it's a perfect circle, it fits right in.  You do need to push in the sides a bit to get it out.  So depending on the shape of your toilet it might fit differently.I have not yet used the actual potty seat itself since we are trying to get our daughter comfortable with the big seat.  She may transition when she can walk herself to the small seat.I'm happy with this seat overall...and I've done potty training once 12 years ago with my other daughter and didn't nearly start when I have this time!  So far so good and this seat helps!  In fact I came on here to buy a duplicate for my house so we can stop transporting the one my mom bought back and forth!!  :)
