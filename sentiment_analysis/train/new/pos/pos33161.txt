I used this chair a lot when my son was really young (2-4 months) and not sitting up yet.  He would lay in it and look out the sliding glass doors and enjoy it.  He slept in this chair and enjoyed the music and vibration.  He never liked the mirror part a lot but enjoyed it a bit when he was around 4-5 months - or maybe I should say it would get his attention but only for a minute and he'd be bored.  I often would attach different toys to it for him to play with, though.  He still used this chair up to about 6 months old and I would also take it every month when we would go visit grandparents and use it as a way to feed him in leiu of the highchair because it folds up so nice and flat.  I still have it set up in his room and use it for when he wakes up in the middle of the night to eat but he seems to have given that up this past week - yay!  I never had the heart to just let him cry and scream in hunger and he would sleep about 6-8 hours and wake to eat and I'd just set him in his chair and feed him for a few minutes (he never liked being held on his back by me which is because of his dairy intolerance as a tiny baby which caused stomach pain and vomitting so this allowed him to have his legs scrunched up to his belly and soothe his belly and also allow him to throw up without choking, if needed).  This chair proved handy and convenient for us and our situation.  This is one I will keep for the next baby.
