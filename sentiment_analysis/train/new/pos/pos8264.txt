Soft and cushy, not to mention adorable and well made. Both 6 year old(used just one for shoulder strap) and 5 month old love them. I originally just bought one pair for the baby, but my older child loved carrying them around and when I showed her what they were for she wanted her own too.For those concerned for baby seat safety, I'd say be smart and stay safe. I used them on my child starting at 5 months, probably been too big for him to use as an infant. The chest clip needs to be level with the armpit, I would think the straps could be folded on end without the bear head for a smaller fit. Also it's nice and cushy on top for your child to rest his head on BUT not cushy on the underside for between the child and the seatbelt so the seatbelt can fit properly, snug and secure. I think it's a safe product when used properly. I'm very happy with my purchase.I would highly recommend.
