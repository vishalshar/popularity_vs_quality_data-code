This pillow is very cute and my daughter is all excited to have it. But I washed it when it came because there was a slight smell. It did not hold up very well - a seam started coming apart. Being a toddler pillow I imagine I will need to wash it often and wonder how long the pillow insert will last.UPDATE:I wrote the company and told them about the pillow issue I had. They were very quick and helpful. I got a new pillow insert and it looks great. So, wanted to update the review for a better rating.
