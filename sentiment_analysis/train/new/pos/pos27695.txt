This is a very handy bag. It has numerous pockets and can easily fit a whole lot of baby stuff. Good to get organized because of all the pockets. The neutral brown color makes it okay for the daddy to lug it around as well without attracting stares. The long strap makes it convenient to put in on the shoulder and the short ones are handy if you want to just hold it as a tote. My only complaint would be about the design of the main zipper which is attaches by a cord on two sides. It makes it difficult to easily open the bag and moreover the cord broke after a couple of months of use. However it is a sturdy bag and will last long. Came with a diaper changing pad and travel diaper holder as well.
