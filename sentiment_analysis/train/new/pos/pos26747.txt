I've tried three brands of washable and several disposables and these are by far the best in the long run (the Kushies have a seam that is uncomfortable).  Babykicks also makes a flannel set, but over the long haul the jersey wash down to be softer.  I've never had an issue with crinkling and always put them in the dryer - they come out perfectly flat (otherwise any brand dries stiff and uncomfortable if left to air dry). After 5 months of use, mine are nicely worn in (like a favorite soft cotton T-shirt that's been washed a million times). Some people complain that you have to wash them 5-6 times to get them soft - in the long run you'll wash them hundreds of times, depending on the day I can go through several in a hour (once they have any bit of wetness on them I chuck them in the laundry bin).  If you're not yet nursing, buy several sets and just keep washing them every time you do laundry & they'll be great by the time the baby arrives.  The disposables I couldn't even wear for 15 minutes they were so uncomfortable, plus they made plastic crinkle noises.
