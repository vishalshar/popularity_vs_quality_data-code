Our whole family loves this bouncer!  The fabric is adorable, and a welcome change from all the "baby" colors of other similar toys.  Also, other bouncers have a fabric toy bar that cannot be washed and can get pretty grimy.  This one has a metal bar, so the seat can be tossed in the wash and the rest can be wiped down.  I only gave it 4 stars because the toys are not removable - I think it's nice to be able to change up the toys and hang your own things on the toy bar.  Sturdy, comfy for baby, and cute.
