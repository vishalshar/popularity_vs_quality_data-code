I can't say enough good things about this.  I purchased one for a trip a few years ago and loved it so much that my son sits in it every day 2 years later.  We started using it when he was 10 months old and he still sits in it for every meal at 3 years old.  I love the adjustable height and that it folds up so small and light for traveling.  I have purchased a second for my home and use it with my second child, starting at about 7 months.  I've purchased 2 more to leave at grandparents' houses for when we are visiting.  Folded up this fits in a grocery bag and easily goes with us wherever we go!  The whole thing fits in my kitchen sink to scrub it down when it is dirty.  This is one of my absolute favorite baby items.
