I bought this in a store for my grandson and he loved it so much i had to buy another via amazon to have it at my house for when he visits. His little hands can easily grasp any of the little holes which is great considering at this age he doesn't really have eye / hand coordination down packed yet. It it very light (not heavy) and makes a rattling noise when the ball inside hits any of the walls. I highly recommend this toy.
