I know some review say this is unsafe because it makes it harder to remove the belt in the event of an emergency, but your toddler removing his belt on a daily basis is far more dangerous. After trying things like consequences, turning the car around, time outs, and incentives - my then 3 year old was STILL unbuckling his top belt. Luckily the bottom part of thte 5 point harness is too hard for him to unbuckle, but without the top portion buckled and secured across his chest, I knew he was in danger in the event of a crash. I bought this out of desperation. I had to put it on once. He was so frustrated with having the power to unbuckle taken away, that was consequence enough. Now I simply keep it in the car and if he ever unbuckles or threatens to, I remind him if he can't be safe, I'll just put the Bee Safe belt on for him. That solved that. thanks for a great product!
