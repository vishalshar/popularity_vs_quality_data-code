These are great!  When my daughter was a newborn last winter, we'd ordered several packs of the Luvable Friends flannel receiving blankets, which were very reasonably priced and worked great as swaddles.  Now that she's 8 months old and 15 lbs, they're too small except to tuck around her as carseat blankets, so we needed some larger blankets for the crib, stroller, etc.  These are SO reasonably priced, really good sized, nice and soft, and much warmer than the the single layer receiving blankets.  My daughter loves them too!  I got the yellow set and it's really pretty -- love the different prints on both sides!
