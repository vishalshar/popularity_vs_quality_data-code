This is by far the best overnight fitted we've found. Tons of absorbancy, no leaks even going 10+ hours overnight with several nursing sessions. Also I love that soakers snap in - drives fast and no stuffing like with pockets. Any cover will work over this but we've been using the Thirsties size 1 snap cover.My son is now 5 months old and 15 pounds and I think we've still got a ways left in the small.
