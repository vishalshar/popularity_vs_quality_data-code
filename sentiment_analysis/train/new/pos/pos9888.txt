This bassinet is very easy to put together. Aside from the canopy not reaching the velcro on either side, I had no issues.A couple of things you should know about it so you don't make the same mistakes I made:1. If you are planning on using the incline (the reason I bought this bassinet) you need to know that the mattress pad is going to go underneath the incline part so you do not need a mattress pad protector. If the baby leaks, he or she is going to leak onto the incline cover first and then the incline and then the mattress pad.2. You don't need sheets for this because the incline goes in on top of the mattress pad and then an incline cover goes on top of that and mounts around the bassinet, snapping in. It's impossible to get a sheet on it unless you do not use the incline.
