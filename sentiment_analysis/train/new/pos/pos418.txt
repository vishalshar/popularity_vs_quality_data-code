These cups are fantastic!  I ordered a set for both my son and my daughter (different colors).  My son is 2 and he is very rough with his things.  These cups have been thrown, smashed on the ground, the top has been gnawed,  tossed up and dropped.  Still months later, I have no issues with leaking or breaking.  I fill the cup pretty full and when I put the top on I can hear/feel a click and I know it’s closed properly.  So if it’s easy for me to open or close, it must be easy for my kiddo to open too?  NOPE, I would call it baby proof!  Again, zero leaking issues!  That is so hard to find with sippy cups.  They all say it, but not all can stay true to their descriptions!These cups are super easy to wash.  The cup is 3 pieces that easily come apart.  I take the little stopper from the lid and throw all three pieces in the dishwasher.  Even with the rough usage from my 2 year old the cup hasn’t cracked at all or built condensation up from the dishwasher.Neither of my kids have had any issues with drinking from the cup.  Sometimes you will find leakproof cups to be hard for the kids to suck but this one they haven’t had any issues.  My kids are 2 and 4 so I’m not sure how a baby would be.Overall I’m super happy with these cups and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a great cup for their kids!
