I got this for my son and he loves it. He initially just followed the balls as they moved. Then we taught him how to pick the ball and place it on top of ramp and he just plays with it on his own and does not need much help from us. Initially when the baby cannot crawl you can keep the ramp opening towards the baby so that the balls come to the baby and they can pick it up and put it on the toy ; When baby starts crawling, you can move the opening to the side so that the balls roll outward and the baby then has to go to the ball and get it. Awesome for tracking, grasping and placing skills for babies.
