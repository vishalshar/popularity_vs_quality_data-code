My son wouldn't let me ever put him down so I ordered this and it helped me be able to actually get some things done while he was much smaller 3-9 months, now he's a year and we still use it whenever he doesn't want to walk or when he's sick ans just wants to be held, and my arms are tired! I had some trouble with the sizing and had to return it, and eventually buy a bigger one so that's why its not 5 stars, otherwise I absolutely love this sling.
