So I received the pacifiers and they were not as described or pictured; like many other reviews, it was missing the thick line that goes across the pacifier. I contacted the seller and they advised that the ones I received were the most recent from the manufacturer and offered solutions to my issue. Although they were not as expected, I was happy with the customer service.
