I have brought the sleepsack since my baby was 1 month old. I'm very fond of them given that my son always kick off his covers at night. This allows me to be at peice knowing that he is not cold at night and that no blanket will be suffocating him. I hate to say that the halo sleepsack only stops at Xlarge. My son will soon need to find something else since he's growing out of the Xlarge. I hope they will consider making something for toddler since till now my son will kick off his cover at night.
