Expecting twins soon, so I wanted to get a new chair for the nursery.  Contemplated all the big boys (PB, C&B, Ballard), but finally decided to take a chance with this one.  It had a similar look, with 1/2 the cost, plus free shipping!A bunch of reviews mentioned issues with delivery, based on our experience I'd say those have been resolved.  The chair was actually delivered by UPS, in a very large box, and the chair itself was wrapped in plastic.  No issues whatsoever.  Do bare in mind that this is a wide box.  It actually had to be removed from the box on our porch because the box itself was too wide to fit through the front door.The chair is very comfortable, yet supportive.  Great rocking action.  We got the ivory color and it is a very nice off-white but not yellow.  The fabric is very soft, with a great hand-feel.  I am a little concerned at how durable it will be in the long run (it's so soft and chenille-y) because we're used to the heavier canvases/twills of pottery barn fabircs which last through anything.  Good to know the slipcovers are washable.My only comment (being a product designer myself) would be that I wish the company offered more traditional fabrics like twills and canvases.  With such great construction, quality, and price, some additional basic material options would truly make them competitive with the higher-end chairs out there.  At least some supplemental slip cover options would be nice.
