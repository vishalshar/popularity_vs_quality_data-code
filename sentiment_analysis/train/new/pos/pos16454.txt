We bought four other brands of sippy cups before ever trying the Boon Fluid.  This is BY FAR the best cup we own.  In fact, we own three of these (one of each color).  What I love about them is that they do not use one of those annoying valves in their attempt to be "No-spill".  This one has a rubber-ish piece in the top that has a slit in it.  When my daughter (14 months) sucks on it she's able to drink normally, but when she carries it upside down, only intermittent individual drips fall out (as opposed to an entire stream of milk or water).  This is a major plus in our household because we've spent 6+ months learning that NO sippy cup is 100% spill-free.We did have issues with one of the tops we purchased [no one could drink out of it, no matter how hard we (toddler and parents) sucked], but after a quick call to Boon Customer Service, we received a replacement top in the mail 3-4 days later which has been working perfectly.
