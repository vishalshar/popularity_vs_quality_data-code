After reaching out to my facebook friends about my son chewing on his toys and still sucking his thumb, The great Miss Paula told me what she used to use in the preschool for kids who needed extra oral stimulation so they were not choking on toys.  So i ordered this two pack, knowing his sister would want one also, to try and help him stop chewing on tiny toys.The Chewy tubes are good and strong, easy to wash along with the normal dishes (we do everything by hand so i do not know if you could toss in the dishwasher)  I added a lanyard to the hand hold so it can be around his neck at all times and so far it is helping.  We will see how it goes as he owns it longer.  I'm very hopeful.
