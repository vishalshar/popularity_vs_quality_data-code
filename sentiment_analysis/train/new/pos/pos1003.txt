I bought this to wear while I was pregnant but usually forgot to put it on in the morning before work.  It made a lovely chime sound when I would move around.  The necklace part could be a little longer though.  My daughter was head down the entire time and I doubt she could hear it chiming while it sat on top of my belly.
