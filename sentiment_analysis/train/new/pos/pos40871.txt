I ordered this set for my son as a Christmas gift. He is almost 4 years old and tries to use daddy's chopsticks all the time. Getting his own set, complete with a case and matching fork/spoon made his day! He LOVES using this set and keeps them in the cutlery drawer, in their case. The chopsticks are perfectly sized for his hands, and are easy to clean. Even though they are small, they are also sturdy and have held up to his usage. Very pleased.
