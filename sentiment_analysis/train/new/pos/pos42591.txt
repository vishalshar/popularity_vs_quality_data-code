I was a little weary buying this item because there were some negative reviews on the size of the ice pack. I received it and am very happy with it! The size of the ice pack IS small, so don't buy this item if you are looking for a serious heavy-duty ice pack. I bought this item for my son when he runs into and jumps off stuff, and the imaginary boo-boo. Perfect for small hands to hold and they can't open the pack and spill melted ice everywhere (unlike the baggie-ice cube combo I've been using). So all-in-all it's a great purchase and the price is also very reasonable.
