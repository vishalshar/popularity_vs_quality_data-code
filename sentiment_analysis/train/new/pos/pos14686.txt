Easy to use. Easy to assemble. Easy to clean. Comfortable, affordable pump. No complaints. Definitely a product I am recommending to friends and family. Love that is comes with two storage cups and storage bags. This product is definitely worth taking your time and ordering. This is the 3rd pump that I've had in the past few years and is the best one I've owned yet. Wouldn't use any other pump after this!!
