I really love this sippee cup. It is easy for my baby girl to drink from it and with don't have problems  wetting herself. But the thing is I choose this ones because I expected  boys colors, so in the future I could used with a boy. They were pink with aqua. So if you have a boy please don't buy from them because you have 50% chance that it will be girls colors.
