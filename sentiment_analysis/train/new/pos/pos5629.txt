This little arch is a real hit with our babies. The animals that hang down off the arch are very sweet, especially the hippo which plays 3 lovely tunes when the baby hits it. The animals detach easily and can be attached to the playgym for more variety. The only negative is that the arch doesn't attach with great stability and tends to need to be readjusted frequently as it detaches easily from the infant carrier or flops forward onto the baby. Other than that it is a wonderful, fun and colourful arch!
