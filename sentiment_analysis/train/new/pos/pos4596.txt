I bought an additional package of these as my son loved the first pack.  We use them to link toys to various objects and he loves just chewing on them, particularly the letter X.  At 6 months old, he knows the difference between his X and the other letters since it has 4 areas he can easily chew on.I am giving this only 4 stars due to being disappointed in the color selection with the 2nd package I received - it is mostly yellow and orange letters whereas my first package had a good mix.We look forward to using these to help him learn the alphabet in the future.  Overall, I would recommend this as it is a good value for price and who couldn't use more links around the house to hook toys onto.
