This cup was a good surprise. For the price I paid I did not think it was going to be too good but my 1 year old loves Mickey mouse and I wanted to get him a Mickey Mouse cup. This cup is very durable (he likes to throw it from his high chair and anywhere else he is) and it is leak proof although you would not think so since it does not have any type of leak proof seal. This cup is a great cup for a 1 year old and great price for my pocket!
