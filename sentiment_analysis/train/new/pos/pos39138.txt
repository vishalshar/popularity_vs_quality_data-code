I had a set of the "boy" colors, and recently ordered a set of these "girl" colors.  My previous set has held up well, and I stick them anywhere in the dishwasher (top rack or not), microwave them, and let toddlers eat off of them with their stabbity fork skills.  Comparing my new plates to old plates, the old ones have a few more scratches and tend to have dishwasher spots because I don't hand wash them, but otherwise seem to have survived toddlers completely intact.One thing that would make them better is if they would nest to stack.  They don't.  You have to stack the bottom edge of one of the top edge of the other.I tried buying a different brand that did stack (and was cheaper), but that brings me to the next good thing about these: they are relatively heavy /and/ non-skid, so they don't move around very much on the table or tray when not-so-great utensil skills are trying to push them back and forth.The instructions say they can turn color over time with use; I scrub off tomato-based products on /everything/ before I put in the dishwasher and haven't had any issues.  The instructions also say to boil in hot water for 30-35 minutes to remove strong, absorbed odors such as garlic or onions.  I haven't had to do this either; I'm not storing garlic cloves in the things!BTW, the pink color is REALLY dark and bold hot pink, darker than the picture.So they may be expensive, heavy, inconvenient to fit in a dishwasher, and don't stack ...... but they're still very useful and worth the downsides.
