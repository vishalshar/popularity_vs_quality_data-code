Bought this to extend the gate for my kid's playroom.  LOVE this gate and the extension works perfectly with the KidCo Northstar gate .  I have two small dogs and a very strong boy and this has a very sturdy frame and a little pop button on the ends that allow you to move it around to shape the gate however you want and then lock it tight so it never moves again.  I have been using gates before my baby came to keep the dogs in certain rooms of the house and this is the best gate we have had so far.  Best of all, it isn't ugly!  Attached some pictures of our playroom!
