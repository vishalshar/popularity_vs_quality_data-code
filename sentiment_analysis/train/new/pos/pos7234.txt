I bought these when my son was about 4 months old, he loved them and was able to grasp them easily and bring them to his mouth. Now, at 8 months, he gnaws on them all the time. I switch out the different shapes to help hold his attention and curiosity. There is always one in the diaper bag too, just in case. I highly recommend, as with other Infantino products, this is a great buy. UPDATE: Now that my son has outgrown the need for teethers, these make fun bath toys too!
