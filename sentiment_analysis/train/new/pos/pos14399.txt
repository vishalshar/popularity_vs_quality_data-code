We purchased 3 cameras and have one receiving monitor.  The purpose for this monitoring system is to be able to hear and see if our aged, physically handicapped father with advanced dementia needs assistance.  They have been a life saver.  I am able to be in another area of the house and still see or hear when he needs my assistance.  The picture reception is great in light or dark and the sound reception is reasonable.  I highly recommend this product.  If any part of this set up died, I would purchase replacements without reservation.
