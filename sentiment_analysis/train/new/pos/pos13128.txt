Just like our mess of kid cups, we had a mess of odd-shaped kid plates and our cupboard where we keep them was always a gamble to open. Would the Elmo plate come crashing down on us or would the ladybug ones? I don't know why it took us so long to just go ahead and buy a set of normal-shaped plates but I'm tellin' ya; I'm not going back.PROS:- BPA Free- Non-skid base- Fun colors- Dishwasher safe (top rack)- Grippy rimCONS:- Odd number of plates in setMy toddlers really enjoy using their new Munchkin Toddler Plates. The non-skid base is great for keeping the plates in place and also makes it harder for my kids to push their plates away when they're refusing to eat (not often). BPA free plastic is a must in my house and the fun colors are a hit with my kids. I also like the grippy rim because when they put their silverware down on the plate, it helps keep it propped up without sliding into the plate of food. It also helps prevent silverware from ending up on the floor. I recommend the Munchkin Toddler Plates over Munchkin's Multi Plate set because of the non-skid base and grip rim.Though the plates are top rack dishwasher safe, we usually hand wash them. They are so much easier to hand wash than our old plates that were sectioned off into separate eating areas. Those were a big pain to clean.My only complaint, and it's a very minor one, is that the set only includes 3 plates. I really would've preferred that they added a 4th plate and increased the price of the set. I have two kids which means I MUST wash at least one plate after breakfast if they want to use them for lunch.The Munchkin Toddler Plates are a great value and I see them as being the last set of kid plates we buy before we transition our kids to our Crate & Barrel porcelain plates. We'll probably need to buy one more set though so we can have enough for an entire day's worth of meals or for when we host other kids.
