My older daughter received this baby book as a gift before she was born.  There are some things I wish it had and some pages I think are pointless but I think you'll find that with any baby book.  I got used to the book and the way it worked though so when I found out I was pregnant again, I bought the same book for my second daughter.  I can't complain, it does exactly what it needs to do - record the milestones.  Any extras I wanted to remember, I just wrote in on my own lines or added some extra paper to the back of the book.
