Since it took me months of research and purchasing and returning monitor options to select and be happy with this one I thought it was only fair to share a few thoughts. we were looking for a baby monitor that has both a dedicated viewing screen AND a simple remote viewing option. This allows us to have a babysitter watch the kids in their room without having to give anyone but us remote access ability and without having to dedicate a phone or ipad or computer to viewing the baby (most remote viewing options also have a ten minute limit and you have to sign in again). We can also check in from anywhere with the simple app that summer infant offers - can always check in from work, etc.among the many other options that we tried, we also used the dropcam which, while it does not have a dedicated viewing screen, can be accessed through your smart phone. The dropcam has superior night viewing and a better picture in general but it has a ton of lights shining in the dark and I couldn't justify that in a baby room at night. just too bright and distracting. this unit, while the night vision is not great, has such a tiny light that the tradeoff of being minimally invasive to the kids at night seems worth it. and since the sound is excellent not seeing specific details at night is fine for us. it also has excellent range for the dedicated monitor (across the street, different stories of the house, etc.)I highly recommend this unit as the only option out there that works well for the dedicate screen / remote viewing combination. Hoping that the industry recognizes this gap and fills it soon as there really aren't many options. As long as you know the limitations (meh night viewing) you will be satisfied.
