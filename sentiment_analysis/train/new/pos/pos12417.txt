I used bowls to take along for snacking but it was hard to push a cart (turning) and hold a bowl for our son at the same time. When I saw these I figured that I would give them a try. They are wonderful! I HAND washed them with dish soap in cold water. I don't see them holding up in the laundry mats equipment for very long or even in a regular washer unless you put them in with your delicates. They took about 16 hrs to dry fully (the sandwich sized ones took longer...about 24 hrs but I think that is because they didn't get the air flow like the minis did) with "hanging" them upside down on our sons dish/bottle dryer (I have a picture).They do not keep snacks fresh (it's like having them sit out in a open bowl), but our snacks never last that long anyway and the company never said that they were air tight. We have only used the Gerber graduates products in them so far, no fresh fruits or veggies yet. I have, also, only used the minis even though I have the sandwich sized ones. I was planning on using them in my husband's lunches BUT he was afraid of people stealing them. I'll probably use them when we go on longer trips.I saw a customer say that they are no longer made in USA. I bought my bags in April '13 also and they are all made in the US. So I'm thinking that if this is so, they have done this right after I bought mine.
