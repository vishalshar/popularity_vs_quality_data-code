I got this present purely based on the two previous reviews, I desperately needed something for a baby shower that had slipped my mind.This product arrived two days early (isn't shipped by Amazon), which was approximately 5 days after order.  My friend LOVED this, it was beautiful, pretty and very well put-together.  The only notation, I have is that the wagon is about 15" long, so if you were thinking this was a big old wagon, think again.Overall, beautiful and recieved a lot of postive comments from friends and the recipent.
