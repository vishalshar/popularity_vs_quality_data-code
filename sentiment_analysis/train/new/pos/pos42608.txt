My son is addicted to these things. They are GREAT! But, sometimes they are hard to find in stores. The only thing that you might want to keep in mind as far as purchasing them online is that you don't know what colors you will get. We got BLUE and PINK. But, if you have a screaming baby wanting a binky at 2am in the morning it really doesn't matter what color it is.
