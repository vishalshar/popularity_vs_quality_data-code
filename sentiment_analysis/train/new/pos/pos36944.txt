I have a 3 year old and drive a F-250 Truck, which does not leave alot of room in the back seat, so we could not get a reclining booster seat, and she was always falling over and forward, which scarred me because I can not imagine that it is good for them. The Toddler Coddler holds her straight up, I do not know how it works but it has worked for us great. The only downfall that I have is that she will not use it if she is awake, (because she is picky) so I still have to pull over and put them around her after she has fallen asleep, but once they are placed I do not have to worry about her falling over anymore :) I would recommend this product!!!
