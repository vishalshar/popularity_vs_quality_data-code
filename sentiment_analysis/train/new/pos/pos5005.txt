The most comfortable I've slept being pregnant.  Love that it's a "C" shape so I can still roll out of bed with no problems.  I picky with my pillow choices so I didn't think I could replace my head pillow but this snoogle has been incredibly comfortable.  It's also great to wind up behind me for support while sitting in bed and watching TV.  I've even packed it up for vacation and it made over night driving (while I was the passenger) easier to get comfortable and sleep.  I've put it in the dryer a couple times just to fluff it up since I use it constantly and it works great for a little extra fluffing.  So far I've used it for 6 months & I will be packing it for delivery too.
