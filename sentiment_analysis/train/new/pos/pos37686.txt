This hamper isn't as big as I thought it would be, but it's perfect for a load of baby's laundry.  The Cars design is so cute and it is really light, making it easy to carry between rooms and to the washer.  The one downside is, we have only had it since my son was born (July) and it already has a hole in the bottom.  Not the strongest material, but if you aren't too rough with it and don't overstuff it, it should last a little while!
