I decided to get this for my twins because they love the Baby Einstein take along tune toy and I thought it would be nice to have something that played different music. They started playing with this when they were 7 months old and they definitely like it a lot. They lights capture their attention and they like to chew on it. I will say that this toy only has 2 settings for the music, on and off. There's no medium setting for the volume, like the Baby Einstein toy has. Also, this toy is soooooooo sensitive! You barely touch it and the music starts playing. For that reason, I try to remember to turn it off at night, so that we don't accidentally step on it and have to hear it! Also, there's a large variety of tunes and they sound decent, although not as nice at the Einstein toy sounds. There's also this one super annoying sound- a lady's voice singing about "playing with me". Ugh- I could do without that one. All in all I do recommend this toy, especially since it's not very pricey.
