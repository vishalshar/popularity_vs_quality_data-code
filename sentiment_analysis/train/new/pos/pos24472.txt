This rug goes perfectly with the Dena Happi Tree collection. It is the perfect size for a nursery. Although it says spot clean on the tag, since babies will be babies, I had to wash it, tried it in the washing machine - and it still looks perfect!I placed mine in front of the crib and it looks amazing with the bedding!
