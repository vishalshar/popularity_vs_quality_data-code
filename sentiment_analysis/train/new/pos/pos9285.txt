I've been using this monitor for 12 months now and love the portability.  It is nice to easily move the child unit to different locations.  Great for weekend trips or places that you don't have access to a plug.  It is also clear enough that if I turn up the volume, I can even hear the baby breathing.Update 12-21-2007:Still using this moniter and I just bought a second one for my sister's house.  Lasting quality.  Too bad it is so hard to find now.
