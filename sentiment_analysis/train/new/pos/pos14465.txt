I bought this for a friend who has had 2 boys previously and is now pregnant with a precious baby girl! She is very frugal and prefers to reuse what she already has, but she confided in me that she would love to have some pretty pink things, but couldn't bring herself to spend the money. This was just perfect! It is so nice and plush, has great features, and she can't wait for baby girl to join the family so that she can enjoy the bouncer.
