This is a really good option for the uncertainties involved with the child who hasn't really gotten the "hang" of timing potty visits.  They don't take massive amounts of pee but are very very good at protecting the furniture and cause just enough leak that the pee might dribble down the child's leg.  We are just happy that she can't soak the couch anymore!  Now we HOPE we can get permanent results soon,  Pads don't seem overly thick but are good and absorbent
