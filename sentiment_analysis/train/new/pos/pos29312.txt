This Roxie mannequin was purchased for photographing fashions for an online store. Our initial purchase was based on her unbelievably good cost plus very good reviews.The plastic mannequin came in a large box and each of the eight components plus a long black wig were wrapped in plastic. No instructions were included in the box, but she's very easy to assemble - maybe 5 minutes to do. Just be sure to begin with the glass base and move upward.With the exception of having an extremely long neck, the mannequin is very realistic.  After placing my coat over her to cover her nakedness, my dog visited her several times and wagged his tail while sniffing her fingers for a treat.  She has scared my husband at least half a dozen times since assembling her on Christmas morning.To dress her in coats, shirts or dresses it's easy to remove her head and arms; replacing the arms can be a little tricky as clothing gets caught in between the torso and arms while trying to snap them back together.  Sometimes she swivels away from me as I try to do this and I find myself chasing her in circles like a strange dance. I'm a greenhorn so placing pants on her required me to take her apart down to her main leg (which is attached to the glass base), then add components back together.The parts that swivel or move are her head, her arms (up and down), her hips and one of her legs. She stands on a glass base and I can easily lift the entire assembly to move her around (and I'm only 5'3" to her 5'8"). As others have mentioned, I will likely replace the wig at some point which looked acceptable at first but gets a tad ratty looking after much activity. Her lashes are lifelike but no piercings (anywhere) for jewelry.I have no regrets with our purchase - this was an excellent value! Definitely recommend.
