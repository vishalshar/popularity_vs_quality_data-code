Overall rating is very good.  However, it was a total surprise that we had to put it together piece by piece.  Instructions were good, but we were a little lost at steps 10-12.  With some prodding, the customer service rep asked a technician for assistance and ultimately was very helpful.  Be sure to check for freight damage when opening the box.  The quality is good, although the wood is a little soft.  They had to replace the top with a new one since it was scratched in transit.  On the positive side, the unit is well engineered.  We were amazed that the changer does not move and is held in place only by the pads.  It's a helpful piece of furniture for a relatively small room since it hold lots of clothing and baby "stuff."  The fact that it is sustainable wood is a plus.
