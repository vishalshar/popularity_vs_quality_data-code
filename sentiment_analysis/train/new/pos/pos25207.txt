I am very pleased with the Gumdrop Bottle set. I purchased this for my daughter who will only take the gumdrop pacis and would not take a bottle. It was my miracle. She finally took the bottle without a problem. I know from being a mom to two children that I need a break from the kids every once in awhile, and now I am able to get that. The other really awesome thing about this is that the bottle screws right into my Medela breast pump! No having to transfer milk from bottle to bottle!! Great deal.
