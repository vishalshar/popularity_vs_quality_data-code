I love these mattress pads!  We potty trained my daughter at 18 months and she did amazing during the day, but still had accidents almost every night.  These are SO much easier to swap out in the middle of the night than the fitted mattress pads we were using!  The elastic really keeps them in place too...I was worried about the mattress pads coming loose and bunching up with an active toddler.  Because they are so soft, we have been using these mattress pads on their own with no sheet on top, which has cut down on laundry even more.  These definitely are waterproof too (without being crinkly) - we've never had a problem with any of her accidents soaking through to the mattress.  I'd definitely recommend these over any fitted mattress pad.  In fact, our nanny decided to buy a couple for her 10 month old after seeing how well these worked!
