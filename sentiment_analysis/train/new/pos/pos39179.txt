Took me a long time to choose a good diaper bag. I did my research and really found to love this brand. With my first child I had a jujube which I also loved, but i got tired of the print. I wanted a diaper bag that looked more like a purse, since the bag goes with you EVERYWHERE.  I love that all the timi and leslie bags come with an extra purse for mom.  As for the bag itself, its a dream. I have a 3 year old and a 5 month old. This bag has more than enough room for everything they need. Its bigger than it looks in the pictures, easily fitting diapers, snacks, a blanket, extra jacket etc. Things simply don't get lost in this bag because of all the compartments. If you like things organized, this bag is for you.  I have the brown one, and its a great color. I always get compliments on this bag. It wipes off easily both inside and out, the side pockets fit bottles, sippy cups, and even water bottles. I suppose that my only complaint would be the hardware. All the buckles can be a little much, especially when you have the long shoulder strap attached as well. Also, I wish there was only one strap instead of two, the second one often falls off my shoulder.
