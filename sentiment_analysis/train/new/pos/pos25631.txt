I love these cups so much that I bought more! I bought the blue 9oz cups 2 pack. This is my first review ever writing about anything I have ever bought and I am an Amazon junkie!My son was off bottles at 9 months old (he is now 10 1/2 months) and I didn't want to give him a sippy cup. Only straw cups. I knew what kind if cup I wanted and searched high and low for the perfect cup. On many different websites and reading what seemed like 100's of reviews for different cups.I knew that I wanted a cup that my son could hold on his own while sitting in his high chair, a leak proof cup, a straw that you didn't have to suck super hard or bite to get the drink to come out of, and a straw that went all the way to the bottom of the cup so that you got all of the liquid and not leave an 1oz or 2 like others.This cup did all of that!The only two down falls which isn't a deal breaker is that the straw that goes in your mouth is slightly shorter then what the picture shows and sometimes the straw will get pushed into cup more and you have to pull the mouth part back out. Like I said, not a deal breaker, just informing others. And when there is milk in the cup and it sits around for a couple of minutes it starts to leak out from the straw.Update- My son is now 13 months old and I have bought 2 more packs of these cups. I love them so much and so does he
