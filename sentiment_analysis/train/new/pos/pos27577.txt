Could not disagree more with some other reviews, this is VERY sturdy. One of the more attractive looking changing tables in my opinion and it feels solid when you move it. I personally love the style of this piece too, its curvy and soft shape makes it fit in beautifully in the nursery. The shelving is thin like someone mentioned, but there are support brackets and so far I have had no issues. I'm very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend. Sarah (baby due in 1 week!)
