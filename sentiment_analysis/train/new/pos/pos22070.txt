I bought this carrier as a replacement for my Kelty hiking backpack as my 2 year old daughter was too big for the leg compartment of the backpack. I liked that this carrier had an open leg space, but that it also came with the stirrups for her feet so that her legs weren't just dangling. I was worried at first that my daughter may be too heavy to wear on my back comfortably as she is a 2 year old and weighs about 25 lbs, but to my pleasure the carry held up to its claim of being able to hold up to 50 lbs comfortably, and I comfortably carried my daughter for a 5 mile hike easily on the first use! The straps were comfortable my entire hike without needing adjustment or shifting in any way. My daughter also loved being in this carrier, and I could easily reach her to hand her snacks and a water bottle. My only complaint about the carrier is that the pockets it has are not easily accessible while wearing it, and the pockets are very small and almost useless. I ended up having to wear an extra waist fanny pack to hold her snacks and a water bottle. Overall, I would say that this carrier is very comfortable even with bigger toddlers and went the distance on long distance hikes.it was easy to use, breathable, as well as being made nicely.
