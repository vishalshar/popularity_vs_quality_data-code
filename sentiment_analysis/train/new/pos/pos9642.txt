My son is teething and he loves Sophie (so much so that we have several for home, car and diaper bag).  He also enjoys bathtime so when I saw this Sophie I bought it.  It does look like Sophie, a bit smaller, but is not a flexible teething toy.  It's also firm so for my 7 month-old he is not able to squeeze hard enough for it to be a squirt toy--yet.  All in all it is exactly what the picture looks like I just thought others should know it's not a good teething toy like the "real" Sophie.
