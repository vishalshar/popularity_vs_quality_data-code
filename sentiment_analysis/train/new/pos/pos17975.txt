We got these for our double stroller (a Bumbleride Indie Twin). They work better for us than some of the competitors that are one piece hand muffs, because the two separate muffs allow for more precise placement and work on different stroller frames including ones like ours that have a vertical bar in the middle. These are used by myself, my husband, and our nanny, and they've been working great in this Boston winter. They can be adjusted to the angle you want for your height and we were able to adjust the tightness on the handle bar to minimize how much air gets in. Down to about 20F we're still warm with the muff by itself. Below that I add a pair of light weight silk "glove liners" underneath (but I'm the type to get cold pretty easily and often do that below my own winter gloves too, and the slip in easily so no big deal). Definitely recommend.
