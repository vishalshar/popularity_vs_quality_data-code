My almost-2-year-old daughter is big for her age, and at 29.5 lb she has outgrown her BumGenius adjustable diapers.  She's not quite ready to potty train, and we needed something with the absorbancy of a diaper but easier for her to get on and off when she's ready.  After a big internet search, I came across Super Undies, and after a month of using them, we love them.  They're exactly what we needed.  They have pockets for inserts (very easy to use), are as waterproof on the outside as our previous cloth diapers, and my daughter likes the feel and the colors... so much, in fact, that we had to make another order because she refused to wear anything else!  I recommend the snap-on model (rather than pull-on) to parents whose kids still have some poop accidents; they make for easier clean-up.  Also, I was impressed with the care taken in packaging our order:  it was exactly as pictured on the internet, plus they included a cute little super-hero mask that's a lot of fun.
