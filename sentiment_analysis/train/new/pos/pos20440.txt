What a simple idea:  add a flap so that the bib protects the collar of the shirt, and make the bib water resistant (water proof?) while having it still feel soft (like terry cloth) and flexible.  (Unlike most water proof bibs, which are partially or completely stiff.)  They look pretty similar to standard bibs, but they just work better.To be fair, I didn't get to "field test" the bib, my kids are a bit too old.  I have gotten a few sets of these as gifts for friends though, and did run some water over one for several seconds, and it stayed dry on the other side.  I wish this had been available for my kids:  one of them was a drooler who would go through several shirts per day, and the wet collar would give him a rash.  I probably would have just stuck one of these on the him even when he wasn't eating.Th only other factor is the price, clearly they are more expensive than standard terry bibs, of which we had dozens.  Since these don't soak through quickly, you should not need as many of them, but more importantly, they should keep junior's shirt cleaner and drier, probably worth the cost if you can swing it, but again, I didn't actually field test the item.  (I did consider deducting one star for the price, it would be nice to have them down to 4 each.)  Finally, I can't say anything about durability, but they look and feel well made.  (More specifically, it would be nice to know how well the water resistance holds up after a few washings.)Disclaimer:  I went to high school with the inventor, and was friends with her brother.  I don't know if I have seen him more than once in the last decade, and I don't think I have seen her at all.  Knowing them is what got me to actually write the review, but the review is legitimate.
