It's the perfect tummy time may for my little one! The pillow is the perfect size and the towns entertain and distract her! There's extra loops to add more toys!The patterns aren't too busy and it's not too small, but just big enough! Can easily go on short trips to grandparents house or a friends / siblings house, etc.My only wish is that the pillow couldn't move! She does slide off of it which means you really shouldn't leave you baby unattended on her belly for very long (like day take a shower).  Otherwise, it's great and I would recommend it!
