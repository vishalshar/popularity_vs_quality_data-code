I bought this in hopes of replacing my daughter's pacifier with a "lovie." She now loves this little doll. I'm really happy with it except with the way it dries. I think the head and body are made of rolled up fabric scraps, not batting or filling. That makes it nice for the all natural "green" aspect, but a pain in the butt to dry. The balled up fabric in the head and body stays mushy and wet even when the rest of the doll is dry and the rest of the clothes in the dryer are all dry. I always have to put this dolly back in the dryer on medium or high heat for 40 minutes for that dense ball of fabric in the head/body to not feel mushy. I worry about black mold growing in there if it's not dried all the way. However, I'd still buy this dolly again since we don't wash it too often and I like the "green" aspect of it. It's a perfect size for 1-2 year olds. It's little but not too little. I think it'd be too little for a 5 year old, though.
