We bought a set of these for our 10 month old triplets hoping to achieve two goals.  One, we wanted to have something to swap out when they start gnawing on our tv remote and phones.  Two, we wanted small toys that we could toss in the diaper bag that had a big entertainment factor despite a portable size.  These toys absolutely accomplish this, and score big time on all metrics.  They love the silly noises the remote makes, although the only buttons they can seem to press on their own are the ones that make the toy talk in Spanish and French.  They love the songs the mp3 player plays, and enjoy chewing on the remote and smartphone as much as the real thing.  These were a lifesaver in a restaurant yesterday when they got antsy.  I'm considering purchasing a second set so we have one for the diaper bag and one for home.  The toys are colorful, fun, do lots of stuff for their small size, and are extremely durable.  They survived being tossed on the ground and run over by the stroller a few times already.  I would really highly recommend them.  I especially love that the kids are entertained by them now, but as they get older and understand more about how they work they will love them more and more.  A great toy for now, and to grow into.
