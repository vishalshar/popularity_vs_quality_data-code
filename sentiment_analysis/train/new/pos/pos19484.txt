This bottle sterilizer has many features that make it easy to use. The instructions are very detailed and well written. There are two clips that fasten the top of the sterilizer to the bottom to prevent the hot water from coming out and possibly hurting you if you don't let it cool in the microwave. The fairly small size does not take up a lot of counter space. I like how I can leave it shut and the bottles will stay sterilized for up to 24 hours. It even comes with a plastic tweezer like piece, so you can pick up hot pieces out of it. The box says that it holds four bottles. They are referring to the smaller five ounce bottles. It can only hold two of the larger nine ounce bottles. I wish it could hold more of the larger bottles. Overall, this is a well designed and built product. I would suggest it to my friends looking for a bottle sterilizer.
