This case has easy- roll wheels and a good zipper and is small enough for a preschooler to maneuver easily anywhere.  It is light and colorful, and a perfect addition to a precious grandaughter's travel accessories.  The price was very reasonable.  Needless to say --it was a hit under the tree this Christmas!
