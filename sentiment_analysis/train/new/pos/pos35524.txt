Your little girl will love this bedding set!! It comes with a sheet, flat sheet, pillow case, and blanket. The blanket was a little thinner then i had expected, but my daughter loves it! I think it is worth buying. The sheet fits perfect on a regular crib mattress it has never slipped off or nothing. The pillow fits a standard pillow perfect. I would recommend this for any little girl who loves Kai Lan!
