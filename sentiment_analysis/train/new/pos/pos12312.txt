These are great!  I highly recommend for anyone with a baby in the NICU or just wanting more sets to have for convenience. I can hardly tell the difference from the ones I got with the hospital-grade pump I've been using. My baby is in the hospital, so I'm pumping through the night, and with these I no longer have to clean the same set after each pumping in the middle of the night. I like that it's all one piece (other than the valve w/membrane), and that one piece is actually easier to clean than the parts with the shields that come apart at the shield area (my small baby bottle cleaner fits inside the area where the milk comes down). Excellent product. thank you!
