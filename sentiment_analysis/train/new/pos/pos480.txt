Love this tub.  I have used it since I brought my tiny boy home - used it first with the hammock insert for a while and then as he got bigger laid him back on the one side and then as  he started sitting put him in the green seat and now at 17 months old he is sitting in it with no seat insert.  My only thing I could say bad is that now he can get to the drain plug and he pulls it and let's the water out so I have to make sure I keep toys in  the tub with him to play with so he is distracted and not letting the water out but overall I love this tub.  This was my second son and I never  liked the tub I had with my first son - I have really liked this one a lot and glad I got  a different one for my second son.  Highly recommend.
