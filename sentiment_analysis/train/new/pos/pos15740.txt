At 1/3 the price of the similar Bugaboo Frog, the Britax Vigour stroller is tough to beat.The wheels are large, and the front wheels have spring shock absorbers, making walks with baby on cracked sidewalks a breeze.  It's very maneuverable, and rolls silky smooth.  Rolls easily on grass, too, for those trips to the park.The seat is comfortably padded, can face forwards or rearwards, and has an ingenious "infinite adjustment" to tilt the seat very precisely at any angle.  The 5-point harness, with two height adjustments, holds the child securely.  The seat is very easy to add and remove from the stroller.There is adequate storage under the seat, with waterproof plastic on the bottom for those rainy days.The construction is impressive, and the unit is very well made.  It even came with a portable air pump for the rear tires.The minor drawbacks are that the sunshade is on the small side (could have used another 6 inches of coverage), and the unit is not light.  However, it's not light, because it's made out of metal instead of cheap plastic.None of these drawbacks are a big deal, and I would but it again tomorrow.  It's a great stroller.It's age-rated for "6 months and up" but we put our 15lb 3-month-old in there with no problems.  She loves the smooth ride, and since the shock absorbers soak up bumpy pavement, the baby sleeps uninterrupted on walks.There is also a bassinet sold in England, which could be ordered.We're very happy with this unit.
