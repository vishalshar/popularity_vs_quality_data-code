This mirror is just as cute in person as it is in the picture. Unfortunately, it does not stick to the tile around my bath tub, thus the 4 stars instead of 5. The mirror provides a non distorted image, unlike the "fun house" mirror images of other child bath mirrors reviewed on amazon. The mirror is light weight, buoyant, and small enough for a toddlers hands, yet not so small that they cannot enjoy seeing their spikey shampoo hair and silly faces.
