This bag worked very well for transporting our daughter's Britax Roundabout during a recent trip from DC to Aberdeen Scotland with a connection in Paris.  The material seemed sturdy enough when we unpacked it and our seat fit just fine, with room for blankets or heavy coats too as an added bonus.  Upon arrival in Aberdeen I noticed the bag had a couple of cuts/tears, but was in otherwise good condition.  The carseat remained clean and unscathed.A couple of things:- The straps are unpadded. Not a big deal for us as we just loaded all of our luggage on a cart when we got to the airport and when we arrived in our destination.  We didn't need to lug the carseat around.  However, if you're gatechecking and have to carry this through an airport it wouldn't be a comfortable thing to carry.-Might seem like a small problem, but the  information/tag holder doesn't close.  It's just an open plastic slot with a blank card which could easily fall out. Would be nice if it had a closure of some sort, velcro, button, something.  I ended up using a diaper pin and that worked fine.  Not a big deal if you use an additional luggage tag.-Never tried rolling our carseat but the wheels seemed rather flimsy.
