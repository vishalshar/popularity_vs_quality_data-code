I recommend this product to every mother-to-be. I actually purchase this for every baby shower I attend. So many people don't know about this product so I enjoy explaining how it works to the whole party. When my son was 3 months old he had terrible teething problems and couldn't sleep. teething tablets were barely working and a friend on facebook recommended the necklace. My husband and I were willing to try anything (especially anything non-medicated) so we made the purchase and our little Gabriel loved it! He got sleep and started acting like a happy baby again. I think for those it doesn't work because they remove the necklace too often and they don't give the baby's skin a chance to absorb the oils from the amber. As for Gabriel, he wore his necklace 24/7 til he was over a year old. Now we got baby #2 on the way and we'll be buying another one of these miracles again. :)
