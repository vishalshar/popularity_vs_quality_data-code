I can't figure out why they would discontinue this soft huggable bear he removes when your child wants a hug I bought it as a gift for a 16 month old boy and he's so crazy about it he runs for it the moment I walk in the door and hands me the tail to walk him around the house this thing is great I took him to the park and there are gates so l just unhooked the lease to the puppy so he could play freely ,fast easy put on,washes like a dream!Great quality and sewing and can be made to fit up to a three year old.But best is he's like all the other grown up kids ,wearing a pack pack !greatest gift I ever gave a child and its safety is worth every penny no more worries of him running away from me as I am a senior and not that fast anymore but this is perfect even has a loop so fits your hand with a good hold and big enough for a diaper and water ect inside the back pack straps are adjustable great product.
