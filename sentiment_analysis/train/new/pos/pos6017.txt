We did a lot of research before purchasing a mat after my daughter started to crawl! This mat blew all others out of the water, and after reading other parents reviews I knew we had made the right choice. It got here Wednesday and we are in LOVE! It's big enough to cover her play area in the living room and I don't have to worry about her bonking her head on our hardwood floors anymore. It helps my knees tremendously when I get down and play with her as well! I would recommend to any parent whose baby is becoming mobile!
