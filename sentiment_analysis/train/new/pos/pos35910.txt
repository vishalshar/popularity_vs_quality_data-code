I purchased this for my car which is a Jetta and this fits perfectly and protects the bottom and back of the leather seats. It even has a place cut out for the car seat locks to attach to the metal hooks on the car and also hides them. The storage compartment on the front is very useful and i like that this covers the entire car seat we have which is a Chicco. The car seat does not slide at all when sitting on this mat. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with leather seats.
