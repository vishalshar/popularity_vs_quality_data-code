I did very extensive research before selecting a stroller and decided on the Quinny Zapp Xtra- Kenson Edition. I wanted a stroller that would fold into a bassinet style for a young infant, and could grow with them. This fit the bill. The runner up was the JJ Cole Broadway. If you are undecided on a stroller check that one out too.I am very happy with my purchase. I always get comments from people on how stylish it looks. I started using it with my baby when she was 5 weeks old because I could easily make this horizontal like a bassinet. She loves it. And it folds up for travel very nicely, although you do need to remove the seat to make it the smallest.The basket on the bottom has ample room for her diaper bag, purse and whatever toy we take with us.Cons: I have been using this for about 4 months now and the handle has some of the rubber peeling off. Doesn't bother me too much and it will be easily fixed by wrapping it with a rubber tape like they use on tennis rackets. Also when you remove the seat you really have to give it a tug because it sticks.Tip: When folding it up make sure to have the brake on. It sticks and is hard to fold when it is off.Overall I give this stroller a big thumbs up. Please let me know if this review was helpful. Happy stroller shopping!
