Amazing breast pump. First off let me tell you the prosClosed clean pumping system. ( I love how the hoses never come in direct contact with the milk)Rubber flanges  (oh my gosh talk about comfort. There are so many flange sizes in this set your bound to find one that fits)Easy assembly  ( it's super quick to assemble for those moments when you need to pump and run)Multi setting ( makes for the perfect setting at my pace when I need it)Okay now the cons.The lower settings on the machine does nothing for me. My baby has a strong suction so my body doesn't even respond those settings. However I'm not going to let that alter my rating because it may work for some other women, and I don't want that to alter your question on buying.The hoses that connect to the back of the suction on the flange system. Those things are hard to get off. I sort of wish that they came with an attachment like the other end of the hose does. I had to use both thumb nails in order to pop it off and it still gave me resistance. I would have to take 1 star off for that. I know it's possible to have attachments on that end of the hose and still be clean and sanitary. Other pumps have that feature.All in all this is a great pump for a momma on a budget. I would definitely recommend giving this pump a buy.
