These are great practice/starter cups They definitely help teach the child how to start to transition to a regular cup...now if I can just stop getting my son to put toys in his open cups..ahem.This has a 360 degree lip so the child can drink from any side of the cup.  I like that the membrane is removable so that you can wash beneath it.  I highly suggest you do this every time you wash the cup because we did not realize this membrane was removable when we first bought it and when I finally DID remove it, there was mold behind it.  We only use these cups for water cause I don't give my children juice.  I would imagine that would be much more disgusting if I were giving them milk or juice in these cups.  There was quite a learning curve for my children to learn how to use these.If I have anything negative to say about them it's that 1. the membrane is very difficult to get off.  I have to use a butter knife which I'm sure is damaging the integrity of the membrane itself and 2. the design will entirely rub off over time and you will just be left with the solid color cup.  Otherwise, I really like them.
