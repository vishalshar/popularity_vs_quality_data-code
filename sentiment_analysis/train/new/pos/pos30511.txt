I bought this as a surprise for my dad when I told him I was expecting, and I was expecting this little 3" rattle, adorable and all, but something that even infants could hold on to, and to my surprise, when I got it, I couldn't even close my hand around it! It's perfect for the little one to hang on to and won't accidentally eat it or anything, and it's so dang adorable! Total size, it's about 1.25" in diameter, and is about 5" high.
