I was hesitant in purchasing these after reading other reviews. I'm glad that I did. We have hardwood and tile floors. My daughter is 8 months and wearing out the knees of her everyday clothes. She is a chubby little girl for her age, and I was concerned that they would be too tight for her little legs. They are not, they work so well and save on the wear of her clothing. I don't use them like I should, and when I don't I can see the wear on her pajamas or other clothes in the knee area. You won't regret this purchase, well worth the cost. They do take a little longer to arrive by mail, as I believe they are shipped directly from Hong Kong.
