This fits my Medela Pump In Style pump perfectly.  I got my pump through insurance and it came with a hideous tan bag (not the tote, backpack or messenger bag, the hideousness is indescribable :)  I got this case to put the pump motor in and then I put the rest of the parts in another bag and I'm cool again. :)  But seriously, for $30 I'm very happy with it.I can see why another poster was annoyed that she needed to buy this piece and the bag by the same company as the bag didn't have the Velcro to hold the motor. The bag is expensive enough it should have the Velcro.  I just got his tiny case though and for the money I am very happy.
