I love these bibs.  I have a 6 month old who has been a puker since day one.  We are now to the point of less puke but now buckets of drool from 4 teeth coming in.  The bibs are perfect.  Yes, they're cheap but what do you expect for 10 of them for $8.  However, I have washed and rewashed and rewashed and none of them have broke down.  They are on the smaller side and a bit thin but that actually works quite well.  I have some other bigger, stiffer bibs that end up covering her face and sticking straight out because she moves so much.  We normally go thru 2-8 bibs per day depending on life.  I just ordered my 5th set and have them spread across the house, 2 diaper bags, 2 cars, 2 workplaces, and a daycare so we can just change bibs instead of clothes.  They are waterproof enough to keep her clothes dry.  Baby is about 15 lbs and there is still some room around the neck but I can see how some babies wouldn't fit in them this long.  They have a strong velcro closure which is good for keeping it on but sticks to rip off if she falls asleep.
