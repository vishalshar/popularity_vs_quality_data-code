I wanted to wait to write a review until we had used these for some time. I was so worried they wouldn't be this great because they cost so much less than other diapers. I have washed them in both a old washer and new HE washer. They haven't stained and have held up (they still look new). The bamboo inserts are amazing as well we use them during the night. They fit pretty skinny kiddos. My 1 year old is only 16 lbs. and they fit her great. I plan on ordering more.
