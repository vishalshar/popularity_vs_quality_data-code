This was one of a few swaddle products that we used. Several people also sent us a few MiracleBlankets, so we were able to compare the two.  For us, this worked the best.  The two main advantages this had over the MiracleBlanket for us were:1) not as heavy. The MiracleBlanket has a lot of material and is wrapped around several times. For us this caused some overheating in our newborn, as his lower back would often be wet from sweat after sleeping in it. We never had that issue with the SwaddleMe2) Easier to put in. The MiracleBlanket has several steps to put the baby in correctly. This usually meant waking the newborn after we already worked hard to coax him to sleep.  The SwaddleMe has that risk too, but nearly as great.  There is less lifting of various body parts to put this on, and the velcro straps are easy.My only two complaints would be: i) our baby outgrew this fairly quickly, where the MiracleBlanket definitely has a wider spectrum of baby sizes it will fit. ii) velcro can be a pain in the laundry if not careful - we always made sure it was velcroed together before putting it in the wash to control that.
