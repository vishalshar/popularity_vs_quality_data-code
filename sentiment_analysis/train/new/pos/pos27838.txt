I use this on my City Mini and have no problems.  It makes going for a long walk enjoyable. I usually listen to pandora from my cell phone.  The speakers are sounding a little garbled lately but I think it's cause I need to change the batteries, since we have a tendency to forget to turn it off when we get home.  Oh, and it fits a really wide based bottle of water which I love!
