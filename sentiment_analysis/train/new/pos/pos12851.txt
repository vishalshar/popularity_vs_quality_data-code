I started out the first 7 months with Doc brown bottles. Which were great -just so many pieces to wash. I moved over to Tommee Tippee and I love them and more importantly so does the baby. one thing i would change is that every bottle seems to come with a newborn nipple. So i wanted more bottles with fast flow nipples and you can't order them separatley. Basically i have extra newborn Tommee bottle nipples. overall great product, easy to clean and travel with, really glad i switched over.
