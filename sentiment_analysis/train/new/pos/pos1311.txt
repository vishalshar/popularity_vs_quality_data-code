I bought this several months ago when our other monitor was acting up.  I finally set it up this past weekend and am disappointed that I didn't take it out of the box sooner since the picture quality is WAY better than the monitor we've been using.Pros -* signal works well in our house - where the master is upstairs and the baby's room is downstairs* very clear image - clear enough that I can see if my daughter's eyes are opened or closed* camera on/off - I turn the camera off at night so our room isn't bright and like that I can choose to use the scan mode where it will turn on if sound is detected or just choose to use the volume to hear when our daughter cries* little to no feedback when sound is used - the other monitor we had was usually kept on a very low volume because there was an annoying hum/buzz when I turned it up.  This one is clear and isn't distracting when sounds aren't detected.* music - while the music selection is limited, I like that I can turn it off from the monitor.  I didn't think this was a feature we'd use but during nap time the other day, after watching her fidget for nearly an hour, I turned the music on and she immediately laid down and went to sleep.* battery - it has done well without charging during the day* add-on camera - like that we can add on another camera when baby #2 arrives in a month or so, however, the pan/tilt version doesn't appear to be available so we can only add-on the fixed camera.Cons -* the blue 'scan' indicator is annoying at night and I will likely cover it with a piece of tape or paper* green light on camera - this light stays on which means our daughter is aware of the camera now and often points to it.  Not a big deal but it could be distracting at night when her room is otherwise completely dark.
