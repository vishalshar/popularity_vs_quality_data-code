We really like these. Easy to clean. Don't leak unless turned completely over. Bigger and hold up better than take and toss. We like them for around the house use and use our bigger, spill-proof cups for in the car and on the go. We never had any issues with getting the lids on and clicking into place.My only complaint is that my kids have progressively chewed the mess out of the sippy part. I would LOVE IT if Munchin offered replacement lids. The cups are all perfectly fine so I don't want to buy 8 new cups and lids together but it would be awesome if there was a way to purchase just the lids. If that was possible, I'd put up 5 stars in no time.
