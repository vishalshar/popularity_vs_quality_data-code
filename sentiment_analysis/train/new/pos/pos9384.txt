I am VERY disappointed in this product. I specifically chose this water ring sling over others because the picture shows metal rings. When this product arrived, the rings are plastic, which is not safe. It appears as though they could break very easily. The product also came from China and smelled horribly of toxic plastic. I will be returning this and getting my money back. I do not recommend this; look elsewhere for a water ring sling!Edit: the seller apologized for the misunderstanding and refunded me; I appreciate great customer service!
