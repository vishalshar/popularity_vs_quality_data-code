This oven lock is wonderful and I wish I had bought it sooner! My little one liked to occasionally hang on the oven door. I never saw him do it when the oven was on, and of course I'm trying to teach him that the stove/oven is dangerous. But a little added security at such a low cost makes the oven a bit safer. The lock was very simple to install. Simply mount the adhesive to the underside of the oven door opening. Before you stick it on, make sure that the spacing appropriate for your oven door. That means, make sure it doesn't obstruct any locking mechanisms your oven may have for self-cleaning mode. Also, my door slightly protrudes where I mounted the lock (ie, door does not sit flush with the lip of the stovetop. So, I had to mount the lock slightly outward, so that the lock would close right. (See pics, it'll make more sense!) The lock functions very easily. Slide the gray part to the right and flip the lock up to open the oven door (like a hinge). Slide the the lock downward and it slides into the locked position. We've had this for a couple weeks and so far it works wonderfully.
