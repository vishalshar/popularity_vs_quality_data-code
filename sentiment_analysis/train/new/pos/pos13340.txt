Apparently, there is no science behind the amber necklace helping with teething.  In light of that, I bought the necklace with no expectations, other than that it's a pretty thing for my lovely daughter to wear occasionally.It arrived in the middle of a violent bout of "let's cut four teeth at once, because I'm a doer".  We were soaking through a dozen bibs and at least five onesies a day, and sleeping fitfully (she was sleeping fitfully, I was just not sleeping).  I put the necklace onto her damp little neck, so pretty.  I slept four uninterrupted hours that very night.  At the end of the second day of necklace wearing, I only had two bibs in the laundry, and she had stayed in the same outfit all day.So, to the scientists out there, I have anecdotal evidence to suggest that amber beads reduce laundry!
