I've found that Amazon reviews are usually dead on, but I was really surprised by the negative reviews of this product. We bought several different types of straw sippy cups to try out with our son before buying more of one brand (to minimize the assembly of  different types and parts, etc.). Two of the cups we tried were munchkin brand, two were vital baby, and then we got two of these. After a month of use: one of the two vital baby cups broke after a drop from a high chair (we liked it before it broke, but it only lasted 3 weeks or so), one of the munchkins my son doesn't like because you have to bite the straw to get water to flow out, and one of the munchkins spills tons of water out if it hits the ground. These have become our favorite so I'm buying more of them. They've survived drops from high chairs and strollers without leaking, hold up well in our dishwasher,  and my son loves them. They've survived the dishwasher and, once I figured out how to put them together, they are pretty simple to assemble (I've found that all of them have a few annoying parts to assemble).
