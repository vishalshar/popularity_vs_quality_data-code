My kids have no problem drinking in these cup. The straw seems to work properly. The only problem i have is cleaning it, the silicone straw in the cover as seen in picture can't be detached, if i put it in top rack of dishwasher it doesn't get cleaned thoroughly. So better to hand wash everything. The lower portion of the straw is easily detach for cleaning and it is hard plastic. I like the twist lid for hygienic purpose. I got the soccer/ baseball design for my daughter and son. Item arrived in secured packaging. So the double wall insulated cup are intact.This is an add on item so i went to order it even it says for ages 18/24M. My kids are older, 3 and almost 5. But trust me they still need non spill cups as they find ways (intentional/ unintentional) to make mess when using regular drinking cup.
