This lil Boo Bunny is adorable! We have a very adventurous and on the go 18 month old daughter. She runs everywhere she goes. So we have bumps quite often. She always wants her boo bunny, even if it didn't really hurt, and it rarely does. We lost our previous one, and she was very upset, so this is our replacement. It is very similar to the lost one, and she is just as content with this cute lil bunny. It's very soft, and the cube stays in the bunny really well. If your little one likes boo bunnies, this one will comfort them perfectly!
