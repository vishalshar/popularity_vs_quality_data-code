Wanted a case for iphone 6 with a thin profile, plain simple look, at a reasonable price, and this case satisfied what I wanted.The case includes a frame that holds the iphone6, and a back cover case that the iphone6 together with the frame can snap in perfectly.The frame is made of a softer rubber-ish material while the back cover is firm and I believe to be durable. The volume rocker and power button is covered, while there's a cut-out hole for the ring/silent switch, headphone jack. The lightning cable port also has a built in dust cover which is a nice feature. It can be hard to pull off sometimes but it is great if the iphone 6 is gonna sit in your pocket when your not using it.One thing to note about the headphone jack opening, It is perfectly fine for the earbuds that came together with the phone, also works for a 90 degree headphone jack, but  it doesn't fit in the headphone jack for my ATH-M50s that the threads for the 3.5mm to 1/4" adapter is too big to fit in. So if you have a full size over ear headphone that you'd like to use with this case, it might not work if the 3.5mm headphone jack is too big or has an adapter that is in the way.
