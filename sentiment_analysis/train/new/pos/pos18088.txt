I just got back from having my carseat installed by the Safe Kids Coalition. It is an organization that will install and show you how to install the child car seats properly. I have always heard great things about Peg Perego, and was exited to get this car seat. Then I had seen on the reviews of other Primo Viaggio seats the complaint of the seat not reclining enough and was concerned. Well I asked the tech who help us, about that and she said it is because the seat is not installed properly.The base of the seat has a knob on it that allows you to even it out more. In my car and my husbands car (honda pilot& buick regal) that still didn't work out. She suggested using a pool noodle (those snake like things kids use in the pool) to even the seat out more (not using the one with the knob) She cut it and placed in down between the back of the seat and the bottom of the seat. It made a huge difference and is totally safe. The baby will rest at a 45 degree angle.She also mentioned that this particular carseat was featured in a training video, and it showed the car seat in a collision. She was amazed at the safety of this seat and how it responded in the collision. It showed how all the features work together to support the baby.  After going and having the seat installed and talking to an expert, all my concerns are gone.I strongly recommend finding a local group that specializes in installing carseats and having them show you the proper way to install the seat. The place I went said they are nationwide, it was free and could save your childs life. 30% of all children killed in collision are killed because of improperly installed seats.
