We brought this nap may on a trip to Europe with my two year old son. It was easy to pack and saved us from having to we bring both a pillow and a blanket. we used it every single day, even on the airplane and in the airport! Great buy!!! Just be careful when you take off the tag, I accidentally ripped a hole in the seam but was able to easily sew it back up myself.
