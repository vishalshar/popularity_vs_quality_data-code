My son (10 months) loves tags, so when I was looking to find him a  "lovey" to snuggle with, I looked for something with tags.  He really loves this blanket.  He loves the tags and the silky on the other side.  I've purchased two of them so that we have a spare in the event one gets lost or dirty, but they have both started pilling around the edges on the silky side after only 2 washes.  I always follow the directions and wash on gently and air dry.  I even made SURE I washed the second one with only other blankets to make sure it didn't get snagged on a the velcro from a bib or a zipper or something, but it is still pilling.  I also wish that it wasn't so bulky.  Since this is a  "deluxe" version, there is some padding in the middle of the two layers which makes it a little stiffer.  But like I said, my son loves it.
