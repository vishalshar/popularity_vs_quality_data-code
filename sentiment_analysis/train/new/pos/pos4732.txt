Love this bottle bag. I only use it for to and from Day Care - I need to have 4 preprepared bottles each day. I was able to fix four 5oz Tommee Tippee bottles, and now I'm also able to fit four 9oz Tommee Tippee bottles - with even a little room on top for his wubbanub paci on top. NOTE: I do not use an ice pack for the bag - day care is only 10 mins away - and then the bottles are placed in a fridge. Highly recommend this bag. Super cute, durable, and easy to clean - NO issues this far and I've been using it everyday for a month.
