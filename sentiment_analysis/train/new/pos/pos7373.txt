Bought for my daughter when she started teething. I was very skeptical about if it worked or not. After putting on daughter and within a few hours noticing the drooling slowed down. I was impressed.  I'm planning to purchase another one for my next child since my daughter is still teething with back molars. I do believe that it works.
