We love this stroller! We don't have an infant seat that actually connects with this one but our brand sits in there just fine and there's a buckle attached to the stroller that you can use to strap in the infant seat so it works great for us!It was easy to put together: just add wheels and the canopy and it's so easy to fold and unfold! It drives really nice- not like you're driving a bus.Love the options to have an infant and rider or two riders or a rider with a child using the sit and stand!Don't hesitate! Get this stroller!
