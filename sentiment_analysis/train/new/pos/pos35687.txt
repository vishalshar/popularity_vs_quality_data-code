I bought this product for my 7 month old son who had begun to move around furniture. It's great!! He absolutely loves walking around in it and following me around. I found it very easy to assemble and like that the whole top console (the one that makes noise) comes off for play on the floor. He prefers to look through the plastic see through portion instead and watch the floor beneath him. I must say this, however . . . the noises are VERY loud. All in all - he seems to really enjoy it.
