After seeing the impact that SIDS can have on a family, I made a point to learn as much as I could about it. The more that I read the more terrified I became. How this awful affliction that can strike a innocent infant and their family at any time is beyond my comprehension. Worse yet is that there is no known cause. My next step of course was to see what I could to to help prevent it. I was so relived to find the movement monitor. After looking into the reviews and reading testimonials I was convinced to buy it, and I could not be happier with my decision. My sons alarm has gone off 3 times, all within a 24 hour period while we were on vacation. And not once since. The first two alarms were back to back; I shook his belly to awake him up both times and after a few seconds he woke up. The third time when I went to wake him  his eyes were wide open in surprise, I think from the sound of the alarm. in each instance he was laying in the exact position he fell asleep in and his monitor was securely attached. I hate to think what that day would have been like if I had not bought the monitor. I could not be more grateful for this product. I know that it is not a cure for SIDS, but every bit of prevention helps. I breast feed, he sleeps on his back, there are no blankets or pillows in his sleeping area, and he is never around smokers, drinkers or drug users. Being educated and prepared are the only defenses against the tragedy of Sudden Infant Death Syndrom, and the movement monitor is a formidable foe.
