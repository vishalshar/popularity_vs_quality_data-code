it's in the water at work and everyone seems to be conceiving. i bought several baby calendars and these stickers for shower presents. as an old parent with undone baby books this is the way to go. new moms don't get it. you think you'll have time to pull out that book and document daily happenings. you get lost.  put a baby calendar on the fridge have the extra stickers, bookmark your day and the memory will be there always. remember most great accomplishments are in the first year. spend your time with your child.
