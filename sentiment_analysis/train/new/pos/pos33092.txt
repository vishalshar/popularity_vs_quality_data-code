I bought this because the master bedroom in our house is downstairs and all the other rooms are up, so our room had a mini nursery in it for at least 6 months and I wanted her first bed to be nice looking and sturdy- none of that plastic frilly junk!I think this is a nice looking cradle, I'm pleased with it. I really love the heavy turned legs though, they look nicer in person than in the picture. It feels more like a crib than a cradle.The mattress support, which you can't see, is a particle board type of thing. It didn't completely bother me, i had no problems with sturdiness but it's a little inconsistent with the presentation. Do buy another mattress! I made due with mine by trimming it to size, because i could not find a reasonably priced replacement anywhere. But it's very thin, just a single piece of 1" soft foam. A couple of weeks ago i was walking through babies r us and saw one that was labeled for a bassinet but the right dimensions and would have been perfect and it was nice and plush but enough firmness to support baby from the bed. Don't worry about it being a tight fit against the head and foot board, your baby probably won't ever reach those parts. As soon as she could get out of her swaddles, about 8 months, we put her in her own crib upstairs. But i can't get rid of it, it looks like a sweet little doll bed. So many times we rocked her to sleep, I don't regret this purchase at all! However, i should say I didn't pay full list price. I felt like the sale price was about what it was worth.
