My l.o. enjoys walking with it. When I pull it out she lifts her arms to put it on. She has delayed gross motor skills and refused to walk unless she's holding my fingers with both hands. With the trooper she can walk around and grab things, and squeal about it. She enjoys having her hands  free. I use it maybe 5 minutes at a time.She's gaining confidence to walk on her own, she really tries to move on her own after I remove the trooper. I've used it as a high chair tie, but she was not fond of its use in that aspect.
