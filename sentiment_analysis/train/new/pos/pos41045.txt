Like many moms, I wanted to try the cloth diaper route but I didn't want to spend several hundred dollars on a complete set only to find out that cloth diapers weren't for me. So I settled on this set based on the affordable price and mostly positive reviews. I will say that they worked fairly well for my 1 year old son. I used them throughout the day, including naps, and used disposables at night for absorbability. Overall, I was very happy with this system, they absorbed pee very well and I didn't have a single daytime leak. Poop was also easy to clean, no stains whatsoever left on the inserts. Also never had an blowouts, so I would say they fit quite well, especially with the adjustable snaps. Easy to soak, wash and after 8 months of use, they held up very well. Like other reviewers, I agree that they are a little bit bulky but this never really caused a problem, even with my large 1 year old. For the price, I think they are great. If you are using this system to supplement disposable diapers, I would totally recommend them. (Note: Ignore the "Regular Guy" name on this review. Replace with "Regular Guy's wife/partner.")
