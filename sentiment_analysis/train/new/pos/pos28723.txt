Great pillow... Non-toxic, perfect size and support for my little man.  Haven't washed it yet, which allegedly is the downfall of this product.  Pricey but expected when you're buying quality products that are better for you.  Would recommend.*update* so after a few nights watching my son with this pillow, I find its way too small.  The support and thickness is good, but he moves and is quickly off the pillow.  I should have listened to other reviews and ordered a standard sized pillow for him... Especially considering the price.  Would not recommend the toddler-sized pillow.
