This wall mobile is a best buy!  Starting from the first day home our baby would stare at it.  As he grew a little, he was just mesmerized by it and now at 10 weeks he bats at it and coos at himself in the mirror.  It make changing time our favorite time of the day.  He will literally entertain himself for 20 minutes with this thing!  You can use it before they are ready for play mats and gyms and it's much better than the crib mobile because it is closer to him and he can reach it.  It's pricey, but worth every penny!
