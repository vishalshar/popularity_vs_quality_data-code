For our baby shower, we received TWO of these Horton blankies. They are lovey sized, not a real-sized blanket. They are perfect for a baby to snuggle up with, or for a toddler to carry around. They are soft, with sateen ears, and ribbons on the nose and tail. The head, trunk, and ear tops are stuffed and plush. The rest is a flat, soft blanket. I'm not sure how people keep thinking they'll be a full-sized blanket, since they have a plush head, it wouldn't be a comfortable one.My daughter decided early-on that Horton was her lovey. She calls him by name and he has to be with her 24/7. This means that his ears are tattered from her rubbing them, he goes in mud puddles, in the dogs' water dish, gets covered in food, and hits the washer at least four times a week. He has held up. We bought a third Horton on Amazon because we know there will be a point where one of her alternating Hortons gets lost. We've got to be ready for that.I'm including some photos of my daughter's love for Horton over the past 15 months. I hope you enjoy them. If you want a lovey for your little Seuss fan, this is the one for you. Mind you, the sateen on the ears does rip away rather quickly, but that doesn't matter to us, because under the sateen the fabric is nice and not rough. We don't mind a bit of tattering on an object that gets so much love.
