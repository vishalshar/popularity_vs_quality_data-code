Not all kid stuff with transit themes has bikes! These ones are really cute little illustrations. Colors are more muted in the transit vehicle mat than the image appears on an iPhone 6s (grayish mustardy yellow, more brownish orange, more olive green, etc) but totally functional. Sturdy and easy to wipe, great size. I put grommets through the corners to attach this to fully cover a kids table, and it's great. Also a good size for a floor mat for art or under an kids table, kids place at an adult table, or high chair. If you don't plan to carry this around in a storage bag, the one included is sturdy and a perfect size to carry: several disposable diapers, bag or small pack of wipes, a small folding changing pad, one outfit, small diaper cream, small hand sanitizer, and bags for diaper disposal.
