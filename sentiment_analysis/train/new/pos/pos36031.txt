These are the only pacifiers my baby likes. They are durable, and he has not been able to chew through them despite having two bottom and two top teeth. There is a big difference between the 0-3mos kind and the 3+ kind; the 3+ kind are thicker and less flexible. My baby does not like the 3+ kind. He is 8m old and w are still using and liking the 0-3mos kind.
