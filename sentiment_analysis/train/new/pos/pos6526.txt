The toy was on a list of top toys, and of all the put-in-take-out toys, was my favourite.  It came and was even cuter.  It's been tough for me to find things that are not overly loud and with a lot of blinking lights, but this, though it make soft animal sounds and says their names, did it in a soft, non-obnoxious way.  Perfect.  Slight problem was that it stopped working after a week, and, though I did not keep the packaging (it was a Christmas gift for my daughter), Amazon promptly sent me a return authorization for a hassle-free return.  I really just wanted another toy and e-mailed, but it was out of stock.  Well, within a month, it came back in stock and so I was able to order it again.  Adorable toy, I think it was a fluke that it stopped working, and I could not ask any more of Amazon-- the customer service just shines.  Way to go.  My daughter loves the toy, can't wait to get the new one back. Great developmental toy for my baby, outstanding Amazon customer service.
