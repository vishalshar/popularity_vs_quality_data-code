There are lot of Lambs & Ivy Papagayo things to decorate a nursery from toy boxes to step stools along with bedding they even have a mini crib set. I love the colors. I think its genger neutral but more on a boys side. Great theme for any nursery. I love this mobile because when you wind up the music it actually spins around, i have had other mobiles where it would always get stuck. I enjoy this and recommend the purchase.
