I bought this sheet for my baby's vintage aviator room and it is nice and thick (not like a lot of other crib sheets) and very soft after washing.  The colors don't run, which is nice.  If you put your baby in a striped sleeper though, try not to panic when you check on them and night and they blend in with the sheet.  :)What happened to the price??  I was going to buy another one, but the price almost doubled!  When I purchased this in March 2012, it was only $18.00, but now it's listing at $33.  That's an insane price for a sheet.
