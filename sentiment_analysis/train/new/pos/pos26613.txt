This has so far lasted through 3 children and has been loved by all. The crunchy sound the wings make and the flower shaker have been the most favorite aspects of this toy of my little ones. And I love that I can hook it onto their baby carriers/car seats and the side of the stroller when we are on the go, or look the belt of a high chair through it while at a restaurant. Lamaze toys are get, but this is our favorite for little ones. The mermaid one is a close second.
