When I was looking for gates, I thought a video would have helped see if this gate would work for us.  So hopefully this will help you.  In general I like it.  The lock is tricky and it is loud.  But, I guess that's the price to pay for having a gate that doesn't get in the way when the baby's sleeping or not in the house.  It was not easy for us to install.  But our railings are abnormal and so any gate would have given us trouble.
