These bowls have been in constant rotation for 2 1/2 months. I like these much more than Beaba plates and The Cali Bowl that we also use. The silicone material is obviously much safer than plastics and it's safe in the microwave too. Our Kinderville bowls do not smell. I think that cleaning with vinegar or baking soda when needed is totally reasonable if they get funky. I agree with other reviewers that these bowls are a little on the small side for portions.  My (small 1% sized) 16mo seriously eats a load of food, so I just refill the bowl. I'm okay that it can't hold more because my son loves to dump out the contents of his bowl. I highly recommend these instead of plastic.  Haven't tried any stainless steel bowls or plates yet because my toddler loves banging things too much.
