This product is a great teether for young babies the design allows them to easily grasp it and then place in their mouth. The size and design allow them to also work on small motor skills while massaging get their painful teething baby gums! The only part I do not like is that center of the handle has a hard part that my son does not seem to like as much as his other similar one made by this company that has the center one solid piece. Easy to clean and sanitize
