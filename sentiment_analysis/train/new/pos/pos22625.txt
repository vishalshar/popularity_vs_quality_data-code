Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter who absolutely loves Hello Kitty! A lot of the Hello Kitty bedding sets I saw were a little bit too gaudy for my taste, but this was more simple and calmer in design! It is just as cute in person as it is in the picture! Plus, I was pleasantly surprised to see that at the bottom of the comforter the words "Hello Kitty" are printed on there, but you can't see that in the picture. It fits her toddler bed perfectly and went through the washer and dryer with no issues! I never noticed if it said this in the description, but you could totally use the comforter on the reverse side too! This is a great bedding set for any toddler that loves Hello Kitty!
