This seat is really nice, love the 2 cup/snack holders on each side. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I also have the Graco Highback Turbo booster, which is one step above this one. This is the second best from the inexpensive lines. My daughter can't nap in it like, her head comes down hanging, while with the Graco there's more padding around the head, so it keeps it in place when she falls alseep in the car. This seat is for my secondary vehicle and I do recommend it. Just make sure you have a pillow for your kid if she'll have to nap in the car.
