Very portable.  works well.  just pay attention and don't be an idiot and your kid wont get pinched or fall in (like in some of the reviews i read.)  This seat will NOT watch your kid,  will NOT aim pee down, will NOT wipe for you.  What this seat does do is make a big seat smaller so your kid can use a adult sized toilet.
