I bought this stroller for our Disneyland trip in December but I keep it in my car and use it all the time. It's the best! My daughter naps comfortably, stroller has a full recline. Its very easy to recline has 3 settings.  I would assume it can be done while there in the stroller just depends on how light your child sleeps.Easy to pop up, & fold down if not wearing flip flops. It's compact just like an umbrella stroller should be, doesn't take up much space.I just wish it would roll when folded so I could drag it. It's difficult to carry with a toddler when she says "I done riding".But other then that it's everything I wanted in a stroller. I would buy it againðŸ˜€
