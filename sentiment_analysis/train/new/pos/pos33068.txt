We have four children and a Jeep Commander. The Commander is a slim vehicle which seats 7. This car seat is about 1/4 the price of sunshine kids seat (the only other seat that seemed as thin). I bought this seat to replace an older version we used with our six year old, our five year old and wanted some fresh for our two year old (the was nothing wrong with it except it was dirty and well used). I love it! The style is nice and hides stains well.:)
