I bought this for our trip to Disney World.  Our daughter was recently potty trained and she was afraid of public toilets.  Her bottom actually fell into the water once!  So, her fear grew!  Hoping this would help, I brought it with us.  It worked wonderfully!  I never had a problem with it fitting on the toilets or it pinching her.  I just made sure it was opened fully before letting her sit on it.  I just wanted to insert a little trick I learned to help her with public toilets:  take tiny Post-It notes to cover the sensor for the automatic flushers.  She was always afraid it would flush while she was on it, and a lot of the times it did!  With the potty seat and the Post-Its, she was as happy as could be!
