This pouch (Mess Shuttle) is a fantastic accessory for my Ju-Ju-Be BFF bag. Please note that it is clear, not gray like the picture. I tested it inside my bag empty and filled with a 3-6 onesie, a pair of 3-6 shorts, a pair of 3-6 socks, a bib, a burp rag, and a teepee for changing and it closed easily. I bet if I hadn't just shoved the items in the pouch it may have been able to fit a bit more!Filled it fit nicely in the BFF bag without overcrowding. If you have a larger bag you might want the space station but I am more than happy with what the mess shuttle provides for my bag. :)
