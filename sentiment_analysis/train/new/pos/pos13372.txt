LOVE THIS PUMP!! This is not to replace your double electric for work pumps or heavy duty pumping although if you don't mind one breast at a time, I have found the suction works just as good if not better than my Hygeia pump. I use this in traffic if I'm running late and get engorged on the way to pick up my little guy. Or if he sleeps through the night and I need a quick pump I use this. Cordless and so easy to use. Toss it in my purse and I'm good to go.
