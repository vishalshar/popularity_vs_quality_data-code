I love these!! I bought myself a set to go in my purse for emergencies (because let's face it, I'm an on-the-go kind of girl and I never know when I'm gonna forget to grab silverware) and they are so handy! They even come with the little case so you can slip them back in if they're still a little dirty and they won't go jangling around your purse. Seriously, forget these being a kids set... they are a life saver for adults! Also, the case is nice because it closes with a magnet and not a latch thing, so it's less likely to break if you're clumsy.
