We purchased these toys to give to our daughter for christmas. At the time she was about 11 months old. When I opened the box, I knew I wasn't going to be able to save them for Christmas, they were too cute! We gave them to her early, and she loves them! (so do I!)The turtles heads and tails are magnetic, so they link together in a chain in the tub. They float well. They float as easily upside down as right side up, but their undersides are colorful and when you flip them back the right way up they stay that way (until my daughter dunks them under again!).Each of the 4 turtles has a different thing that it does - one has a mirror on its back, one's back has a spiral pattern and it spins like a top, one's back spins like a ball, and one is a rattle with colored balls inside. These toys don't take up a lot of space, so they are great if you are trying not to have a ton of huge bath toys!
