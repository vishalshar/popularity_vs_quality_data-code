Parents of babies (who love to travel), you need to buy this toy!! I never bother to write recommendations, but this traveling mobile is freaking awesome. My 12 month old loved it during our trip to Colorado (which included 2 hour flights and 5 hour car rides). I was able to clip it to the hangar thingy in the car, as well as to the shade of the stroller. The claw is very strong and I never worried about it falling on my son as he pulled and batted at the toy throughout the long drives. I should have bought this toy many months ago!
