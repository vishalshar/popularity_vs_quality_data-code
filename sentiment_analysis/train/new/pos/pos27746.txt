love this so much! We already had the piggy for our first child, and loved it, so we got the alligator and it's awesome! The detail is great and is larger then I thought it would be. The wood is STURDY too- when they say it's a wood bank they mean it. None of this thin wood stuff- it's nice and thick. Which is great for kids too- you drop a ceramic bank and it's broken! But a wood bank is way more durable (and so much cooler if I say so myself). The piggy is adorable, but the alligator is just so unique I think it's my favorite now! I'm hoping to get a few of the other pearhead wood banks soon. They're so awesome!
