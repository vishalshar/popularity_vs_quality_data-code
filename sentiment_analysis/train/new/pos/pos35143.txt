These are about 10cm long and are gorgeous! I got mine to tie back a sheer pink curtain in my babys nursery and they are just lovely. The little flowers on the wings are tinged pink in the light, everything was sewn together properly and the wings are bendy so you can adjust them as well as the wire feelers on the butterflys head. Just so cute and a great price, very happy with the purchase. Areived quickly too.
