I received this as a baby shower gift and it absolutely gorgeous!  It can make a bad picture look good.  My child is 5 years old now, and ever now and again she asks if she can look at it.  We have several other baby books and scrap books, but nothing compares to this.  It's super easy to fill (no tap/glue/tools required, not even a crafty bone in your body is needed to make it outstanding).  I give it to all expecting mommy's from now on !  It's durable and my favorite page it last, at 1 year birthday, the pop-up is a set of balloons that hold pics of those who came to celebrate.  Adorable and worth the price.
