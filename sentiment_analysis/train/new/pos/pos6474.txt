You have to put the stickers on yourself; if you screw up, you can't move them.  Be Careful!  The product is great, my kid (10 months) loves it.  He likes to chew on them and has almost eaten off the sticker on the "No. 1" cup.Update 12/20/2012: I wish I had put the stickers on "upside down" - aligned so that when the items are stacked up from biggest to smallest, the numbers are right-side-up. Instead, I put them on so that they are right side up when the open end of each bucket is up. So now when my (second) kid is using these to make a tower, the numbers are upside down. Sigh. When you look at the picture on the site, note that they are having their cake and eating it too! The "big" picture of the #10 bucket is with the sticker on my way. But in the tower, they have the sticker on the other way. Do it the tower way.On the plus side: Still is great condition for my second kid!
