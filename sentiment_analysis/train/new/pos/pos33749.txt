INITIAL REVIEW. Will update after more uses by the kids.I like this pouch and so far see no reason there is anything "wrong" with it. After reading the many reviews of MANY different style pouches, I bought this style and the LITTLE GREEN POUCH (LGP) version. I'm glad I did because there are Pros and Cons for MY NEEDS for each of them. Ultimately, I think I will keep both. These for more fruit-based purees and the LGP version for larger meals/soups.As a product packaging designer myself, I would have designed the pouches to be both a bit more appealing to kids, while still showcasing their "green" attributes. Rather than focus only on the "green" aspect of the product.WHY I NEED THE POUCHES: I have a 12m old (also have a 2 year old that loves pouch-eating) that is a very independent eater and SUPER BIG eater that will scream and refuse to eat unless he is involved with feeding himself. I gave him a store bought Plum Organics pouch and he loved being able to hold + feed himself more than with just a lid-cup + straw.WHAT I PUT INSIDE:• SOUPS - broccoli soup, lentil soup partially or fully pureed• GREEK YOGURT BASED SMOOTHIES - fruits, greens, zucchini and black beans pureed with mango and/or berries for more fiber/protein.TO HEAT UP: I thought of it today – my retired from bottles Dr. Browns bottle warmer could probably safely heat the soup versions up so I could store in the fridge already made. It is used for plastic and glass bottles, so I don't see why not. It just uses steam.//  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //5 LITTLE SPROUTS (5LS)PROs• Spout it on top like other store-bought versions• You can see your contents through the back• Easily cleanable + fill-able through bottom zipper (ziploc®-type) opening with help of a NORPRO 3040 Funnel Pitcher I bought here on Amazon• utilizes standard cap, as most reusables seem to• no spout spillage from either only because both of my kids have just been sucking and not squeezing so far.CONs• smaller 5oz capacity• taller than LGP• does not stand up in fridge. Must be laid down flat.• bottom zipper may pose a problem in the future with contents spilling out by accident. most say it happens rarely.//  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //LITTLE GREEN POUCH (LGP)PROs• stands up on its own in fridge• utilizes standard cap, as most reusables seem to• has larger 7oz size available, while still being shorter than 5LS 5oz size• no spout spillage from either only because both of my kids have just been sucking and not squeezing so far.CONs• may be more difficult to clean if not cleaned soon after use• side-spout may be strange or not as natural for smaller babies to access at first.For regular meals with my independent 12m old, we normally chop up cooked sweet potatoes, bananas or strawberries for him to feed himself while we stuff a spoonful of broccoli soup, steel cut organic oatmeal, etc. in his mouth. He likes his food, just wants to spoon it in himself, which would be a gigantic mess at this point. I'll have him practice that with maybe his oatmeal since that sticks to the spoon better. He eats probably over 7 ounces easily every meal. Probably double that. The fact that he doesn't want milk anymore probably contributes even more. So, now I sneak in milk or Greek yogurt into many of the purees as well. I am not going to feed him every meal with these pouches, just use them for snacks, small meals or when preparing the meal and he's h-angry. Also when daddy is fed-up and wants to feed him easily with no screaming and no mess. Who wouldn't want less screaming in their life?~ The End ~
