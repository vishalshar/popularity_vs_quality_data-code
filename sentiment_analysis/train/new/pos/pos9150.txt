My husband and I are preparing for our first child. We fell in love with this design, and couldn't resist the $66 price tag for 13 pieces. After reading various reviews, I was prepared to be disappointed. I was not. I was thrilled with the quality, inspecting every piece thoroughly. The comforter is reversible, with brown, blue, and yellow polka dots. I do not think this is inappropriate for a boy, and I'm a sucker for anything reversible. The diaper bag that's included seems a good size. I could easily see several outfits, diapers, wipes, bottles, toys, etc., inside the bag without it bursting at the seams. Maybe SoHo has redesigned things after the negative reviews, because I have no complaints. I will update after it's been used for a while.
