We have been using these bibs for almost 2 years!  We bought one boys and one girls for our twins and they have really held up great.  I don't put them in the dryer but occasionally one will get in there with no problem.  I really like the inside out pocket so the food doesn't get stuck in the seam.Highly recommended!
