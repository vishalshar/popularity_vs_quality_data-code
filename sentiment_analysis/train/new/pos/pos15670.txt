This was a great purchase and it has been worth it. It is a great stroller for going around long distances, it has good suspension for bumpy roads, ice or sand. It also has perfect maneuverability for small places like supermarkets or shops with small corridors. I have used it everyday for the past 11 months and I have very small complaints. We don't have a car so this has been LO's transport method since birth and he loves it.Pros:-Bassinet is amazingly comfortable, my son used it to sleep hours and hours until 6 months.-Easy to reverse.-Amazingly good maneuverability when the small wheels are in the front.-Machine washable-Great suspension-Great break system-Shopping bag is big enough-Handle bar can handle quite some extra weight-Reclining positions for sitting are good, except when the child is parallel to the ground.Cons:-Bassinet is for short babies, my son outgrew it at 6 months, instead of 9.-Not so good maneuverability with big wheels in front.-Really difficult to fold, so I wouldn't use it as a travel stroller.-Sleeping position with the normal seat (parallel to the ground) is not comfortable for baby, his back is not flat so I don't recommend it for long periods of time. This is a problem with most of the modern reversible strollers though.
