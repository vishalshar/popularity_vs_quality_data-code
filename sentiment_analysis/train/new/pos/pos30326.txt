I've had this for 3 years and I still wear it sometimes and it looks nice! That is a testament to a truly durable and well made product.I got this because when my second child was a baby I saw a few moms sporting teething beads at the breastfeeding group. They were not wearing this particular item, but I was intrigued. At the time my son had just turned two and I had a 3 month old so I thought that was a good idea. I saw this one here on Amazon and got it. My son, who was not nursing then but wanted to cuddle when I put the baby down liked to play with this. Later on, my daughter would play with this and used it as a teething aid once in a while.I did not, and do not, wear this every day. I'm fairly plain in what I wear (t-shirts and stretchy leggings mostly). But I will bring this out when dressing for church sometimes, or if I am wearing something nicer (sad heh? Wearing a teething ring?). So it has a sense of newness every time I bring it out.The string is soft and has a pretty shine to it that I think it is very attractive. It has a few spots where the string is a little disheveled, but I've had this for a while and who knows how exactly it happened. The ring itself has some wear, but it just gives it a stone-like look that I rather like. I am not sure what the ring itself is made of, but it is like a rubber. It is sturdy and rather satisfying to bite into as it has a little give. It washes well with a little water and soap and that's all that there's to it!I would definitely recommend this as it is durable. I am not sure if every child will take to this as their favorite teething toy. But it is worth a try and if the kids ignore it, you can always just wear it.
