I am very pleased with this carrier. I am a first time mom & i love how comfortable it is.  I was weary about "baby wearing" at first but i have used this for everything!My back has been so sore since i had my daughter & my ergo has taken so much pressure off of it. I also love the insert, which allowed me to carry my daughter everywhere when she was newborn- even if it was just to clean the house.Now that she is 6 months old we do not use the insert, it has actually gotten much easier to carry her around in it now that she can support herself.The best thing is that every time i put her in it, she falls asleep within a matter of minutes!
