Works well, really difficult to put on some seats.  It's a high quality piece and works well once in place.  We rented a minivan for a long family vacation.  (Chrysler tonn-n-country) .  The threaded shafts for the hooks are maybe 3mm too short, it was extremely frustrating to put on.  When I installed it in my Pathfinder, a bit easier but it's not made to be easily installed and removed.  So if you do any hauling in your SUV, where you need to fold the seats down, it's a hassle.As far as functionality for the headrest itself,  five stars.  My five year old really likes it for long trips.  If they could only make a quick-release one....
