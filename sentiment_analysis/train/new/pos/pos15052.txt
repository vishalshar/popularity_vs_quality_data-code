My Bella Tunno Burpie in Tribal Coco was just delivered this afternoon, and I must say I am impressed! Fast shipping, and overall a very beautiful burp cloth, although it is a little on the small side. The backing is white terrycloth, which I wasn't expecting, but doesn't look bad at all. I'm so glad Amazon had this Burpie!!
