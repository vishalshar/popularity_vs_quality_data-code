These cups are pretty good. We bought them because they're the cups daycare uses and my child was transitioning to the hard nipple.  Leak proof as long as you get the lid on straight and tight. However, we've had these cups about a year now and have noticed that mildew was growing inside the white plastic piece inside the cup around the silicone seal. You have to stop and look hard at the piece to really notice it, but we finally got it all out today. It was really gross and I don't know how long I've been giving her drinks with this in it. I wash the pieces every use in hot soapy water, but I don't use a toothbrush or anything to detail scrub it every time. I'd still buy again, but now I know to be more conscientious of the washing.
