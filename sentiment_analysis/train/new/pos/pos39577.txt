I really like this product. The pictures really don't do it justice and I think the quality is quite good. The opposite side is a nice rich chocolatey brown with small white dots (as is the trim). My only issue is more to do with most bumpers and my crib which is that the ties are just not very long and where they're positioned they don't really match up with the bars as well as they should but I have a crib that has solid wood on both ends which doesn't help the issue. I'm debating sewing new strings in better spots so that the fit is more solid and less bumpy but I do love these bumpers and my daughters LOVES interacting with the pattern. I catch her chattering away and toughing the animals while putting herself to sleep.
