We bought this stroller for an airplane trip, the first trip for our daughter (25 months old). It was a good value. That is, it's not a *great* stroller, but it was inexpensive, did the job adequately, and we weren't worried if it got damaged along the way (because it was inexpensive). My daughter loved riding in it and constantly climbed into it on her own.Pros:- Inexpensive, very lightweight, cute, simple, comfortableCons:- The handles are short (as in, low) and it felt awkward to push it for long periods (I'm 5'7").- The black plastic covers on the handle ends would slide off easily. Not a big deal, except for when lifting the stroller (with child inside) up a step or curb.- The front wheels don't swivel well and it would sometimes be hard to get the stroller moving in a new direction.- Couldn't get the hang of unlocking it with my foot like I can with our regular stroller. I'd just have to reach down and do it with my hand.I definitely would not recommend it as your main stroller, but I think it's a good value to have for travel or certain outings.Note: There's a little plastic clip that holds the stroller closed when folded up. I didn't think it would hold up well to airline baggage handling, so I bought a separate luggage strap with a snapping clip for a few bucks to wind around the closed stroller and hold it closed securely. Before our trip, I practiced doing this quickly so that I could swiftly get it ready for gate check while in the jetway. I would recommend something like this for air travel.
