I bought this after having the mico for our first daughter. We have never had the trouble other people have had, and our little girls was in it until she was over 20lb. You can adjust the straps to fit your baby as with all car seats. She had very chubby thighs and they never dug into her when you adjust it correctly for your child.I loved the look of it (we got so many comments on how cool it was in the strollers) and it was so easy to click in the car and into my Quinney Buzz and zapp strollers. And perhaps it's just because I am using it with a second child but the seat belt option was so simple I thought we were missing something! I do agree when it was in the stroller it sat up a little bit, but our little one liked being able to see what was going on. We live in Texas and had no more issues with sun on her than we did with the mico in the Middle East with our first daughter. The canopy on the prezi stays on much better than the mico.I highly recommend it, our little one seemed so secure and always happy to get into it.
