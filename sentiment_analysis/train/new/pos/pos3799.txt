This first time parent often wishes that he could cage his baby. But the judgment of others at the beach and the tears of my child dissuade me. This portable baby tent allows my baby to feel the cool ocean breeze and to feel free, while at the same time preventing her from lunging face-first into a pile of cigarette-butt salted sand. Wins all around.Super small and light. This comes at the price of a tough-to-master folding mechanism that feels like wrestling a sentient slinky. Once you get the hang of it, it's quick.
