I just got these in the mail today. As a mother of infant twins I do have to say I love them. They are time saver! I found propping towells or extra blankets under the bottle and not as effective. No to mention soft blankets and towells on the babies chest and close to thier faces unsafe as a risk to SIDS. My twins are roughly 8 weeks old and do not have the motor skills to hold the bottles or bottle holders. I found that using them when they are propped upright in their bouncers, it works great with little movement. I am able to feed both babies at the same time with out much hassle. I rate this four stars because if you have multiples this is a great assocerie. Any bottle prop tht didnt allow my infant to move it, I would not like because as they are done feeding , I like how it is light enough for them to move it out of the way.
