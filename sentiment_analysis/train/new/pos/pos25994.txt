Bought this stroller because of the large front wheels which seem to work well on carpet.  My little girl is getting around with no problem and the height is very easy to adjust.  Very easy to put together (my husband did it w/o me having to read him directions).  Only thing that kept it from a perfect score is the "jungle crew" which are the stuffed animals that make sounds when she bats at them.  The songs are lame to say the least, they almost sound like elevator music, the animals sounds are cute...the lion growls, the monkey hollers and then you get to the elephant and all you can say is "what the !@#$?".  The elephant makes this "ooo, ooo, ooo" sound which is not at all accurate of the sounds that an elephant makes.  Also because the elephant is right in the middle, my daughter puts it in her mouth most of all and now the elephant goes off on its own w/o anyone being in or around the walker.  Graco should have spent more time with the sounds or maybe they should just not include it and knock the price down some.  The walker by itself is wonderful!
