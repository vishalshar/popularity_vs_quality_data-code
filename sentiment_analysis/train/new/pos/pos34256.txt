I wanted to go with glass after reading a ton about the plastic tupperware containers.  These definitely have more heft, and my daughter isn't old enough to hold her own bottle, but it doesn't affect me.  I have dropped these suckers on both hard wood and tile floors in my exhaustion and haven't cracked/chipped/damaged them in the slightest.  There are a lot of parts to wash, but she has reflux, and every specialist I've talked to after saying we use Dr. Brown's, has said some version of "good" or "they are the best."  That's enough of a convincer for me.
