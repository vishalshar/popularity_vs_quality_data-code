So I bought a similar mirror from a department store and it was completely worthless because it was not adjustable and difficult to get my baby into my view. I began my search for a new mirror to watch my new baby in the backseat. I found so many products and they all looked the same. I finally just picked one with the highest rating and mediocre price range. I ended up with this mirror and I couldn't be happier!The design of the mirror is pretty cool. The mirror rests on an arm that is easily adjusted and also stabilizes the mirror so your baby stays in full view. Some reviewers complained about this mirror obstructing their view, while driving but I didn't find this to be a problem for myself. I am guessing some consumers may not like that the mirror is not flush with the seat rest because it is designed with a slightly protruding arm that adds stability and functionality. In addition, the mirror minimizes the object of reflection slightly, similar to the rear view mirrors on the doors of your car. I found this feature very helpful because you have a complete view of your baby...head to toe and everything else in the periphery. It may be a drawback for some because it does make baby appear smaller and sometimes I have to glance at my little girl longer to see what she is doing.I am impressed with this mirror and I promise you that I am a tough critic!
