As simple as it is, this product has been one of those highly satisfying purchases I am glad I made every time I go to open the doors its used on. The lock is simple to install and use. It includes a dual sided adjustment bar that snaps on to the main bracket allowing this lock to be an excellent fit on a wide range of door thicknesses. The middle setting, achieved by using the smaller side of the adjuster makes for a good fit on my 1" thick door. The bracket without adjuster looks to fit up to about 1-3/8" and smaller doors can be accommodated by flipping the adjustment bar (see my attached picture). Once set to the right size (it's not super picky) it provides a solid lock that not only keeps our toddler out but is solid enough that I don't have concerns that it will break when an adult accidentally attempts the door.When I purchased the item, I was concerned about the longevity of the bar included to help slide it. What I didn't realize was this sits loose through a hole in the main bracket allowing you to easily flip the lock in the open or closed position with a simple flip of the wrist while also preventing any undue strain on any of the plastic. Finally, as a bonus, the clear plastic makes for an unobtrusive appearance that doesn't detract from our kitchen.
