Our local gym requires the children to be banded and we were tired of the adult sized disposable non tear bands they supply. These suit the purpose and my kids love to wear them! They fit my 3 and 6 year old perfectly, and happily I was able to cut an inch off the baby's so she doesn't have so much extra sticking out. They wear them for over an hour a day several days a week for a couple of months now, and they are all holding up great!
