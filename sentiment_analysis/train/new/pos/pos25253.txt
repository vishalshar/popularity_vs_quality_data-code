I have a 4-year-old and a baby due next month, so I wanted to get a video monitor with 2 cameras (without spending almost $300!).  This one had pretty good reviews, so I chose it - and I'm glad I did!  I've only been using it for about a month (and with only one camera for now - no use for the second one yet!), and it has some great features.  I love the intercom feature - I can talk to my son without having to go into his room.  He thinks it's great that I can "talk to him through the camera!"  The night vision works really well.  The only issue with the camera I've noticed is at dawn, when it is still somewhat dark but the sun is starting to come in through his window, the picture is hard to make out.  If I put room-darkening curtains in his room, this issue might be resolved.  It's not a big deal (I imagine this might happen with other cameras, too).  I also wish that you could turn off the video, but still have the sound working; however, since the monitor will automatically come on if there is sound in the room, this isn't too much of a problem, either.  I hope this monitor continues to work for us for the next few years!
