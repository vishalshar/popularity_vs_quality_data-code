We used the smaller size (fleece) for our newborn and I am certain it is one reason he learned to sleep through the night so young (8 weeks). We tried to wean him from it when he outgrew it, but he would flail his arms and wake himself up when we used the sleep sack. Our doctor said it was fine to continue swaddling him, so I invested in the bigger size, in this lighter fabric since it is getting warmer out. I love the flannel. It holds its shape, and it warm but not too warm. We only ended up using it for about 3 weeks before we found out by accident that he didn't need it anymore (it was in the washer, it was bedtime, so we tried the sleep sack again, which worked). Still, I am glad I bought it and would recommend it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the center velcro flap was harder to line up than on the smaller version.
