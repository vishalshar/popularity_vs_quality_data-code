Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 9 month old. It's 3.5in diameter and 5.25in tall. It's cute and sturdy and the baby still likes it after a few weeks of playing with it every day. The paint is chipped in a couple of very small places on the green base but it's not a big deal. I think it's a cute, sturdy toy that will have longevity. I even see my 8 year old pick it up and mess with it for a few minutes here and there. There's something about wooden beads on convoluted wires that can't be resisted at any age.I almost forgot! IT DOESN'T MAKE NOISE OR REQUIRE BATTERIES and still keeps baby's attention for several minutes at a time. Can't beat that!
