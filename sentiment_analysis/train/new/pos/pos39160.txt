I adore this product. I spent few days researching about stroller organizers.  There were 3 candidates:  Baby Jogger Parent Console Universal ($30); Skip*Hop Grab and Go Stroller Organizer ($20); and 3 Sprouts Stroller Organizer ($25).  Although Baby Jogger's enclosed compartments are a nice feature, I prefer to carry my wallet and iPhone with me, so I don't need them, and the drink holder is too skinny to hold anything other than a plastic water bottle.  Skip*Hop one seems to be the most practical one with a zip pocket and it is BPA-free and Phthalate-free.  BUT, this 3 Sprouts Organizer is cute and practical.  The functionality is essentially the same as Skip*Hop one and well-made.  And, the animal design makes my toddler smile and help learning animal name and color.  I worried about matching this vibrant yellow and gray (Rhino) with my Citi Mini Red, but they worked perfectly with Citi Mini's gray trim.  It also collapses with my stroller without getting dirty.  Made with 100% Polyester.
