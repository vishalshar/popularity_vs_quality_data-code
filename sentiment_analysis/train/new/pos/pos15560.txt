I bought this inflatable tub to take on a family cruise vacation.  I was worried about bathing my then 8 month old son in the standup showers in the tiny ship bathrooms, and this tub fit perfectly.  It made bathing him fun and convenient.  I also brought this out to the beach with us and filled it with a small amount of ocean water so he could play safely while we lounged and his older cousins played in the ocean.  (Obviously, your child should ALWAYS be closely supervised when playing in water!!!)  I also used this inflatable tub in the ocean - as a little raft.  This was also used when we returned home, in the bathtub, until he was able to balance himself properly in the slippery bathtub.  The inflatable tub provided good traction and he didn't slip around in it.  Also, the little frog/lily pad design is adorable.  The tub has a tag on it so you can hang it to dry and leave it inflated in between uses.  I did not have any issues with leaking.  This was a great purchase.  As I am writing this review, I'm sad to see that it is discontinued. I would hope that Safety 1st makes similar inflatable tubs so that others can purchase something like this one.  If you are considering an inflatable tub, get one! they are great.
