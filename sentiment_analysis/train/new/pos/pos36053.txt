BASED upon reviews when I was looking for this item, I CHECKED MY MODEL NUMBER WITH COMPATIBLE CAMERA model numbers.  I purchased my camera and monitor in 2011 so I did not know if we had a "new" model or "old" model.  I followed advice of one of the reviewers and looked up (google search) which extra camera models would work with our camera (MODEL 28034).  SO maybe the FOLLOWING INFO WILL HELP:  the search stated that the EXTRA CAMERA 28074 (this one listed, I check below before I ordered) was for Monitor Models 28034 and 28035.  So I nervously purchased this extra camera with that info.  When the camera arrived, I got nervous again because the box states it is compatible with model 28030.  However, I took it out carefully (hoping to return if not the right one) and followed directions included.  SET UP was easy and IT WORKED!  Yeah, so I now have a camera for the new baby we are expecting.  I also ordered the silicone protective cover and that box states the cover is compatible with 28030, 28034 (my monitor), and 28035.  SO it may be that this extra camera also works with those 3 models.  Anyway, hope that helps some folks!  Good luck with your growing families and the search to monitor them!
