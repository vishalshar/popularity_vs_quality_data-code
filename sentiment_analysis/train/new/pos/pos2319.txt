I bought this stroller when I was expecting our third child.  Number two and three are about two years apart, so we felt we needed a double stroller.  I had used a Perego Venezia with the first two and loved the quality.  Perego was the way to go for me. I have found the stroller to be good looking, lightweight, and very easy to steer.  I get compliments on it regularly while out with the kids.  I love that the baby can be completely covered when in his carseat (that attaches to the stroller's back seat), and my older son loves the room he has in the front seat.  You cannot recline the front seat when the infant seat is in the back, but that has never been a problem for us. There is not a whole lot of storage room below, but my diaper back is backpack style, so I don't have trouble with that either.  There is, however, plenty of room for an extra diaper and wipes (necessities).  I usually don't even carry the diaper bag, unless we are out for a long outing.  I just tuck the baby's bottle in his carseat with him and a burp cloth, and we're good to go.  The only thing I have noticed is that things seem to break off pretty easily.  For instance, when the stroller arrived, the hoods were crooked.  I thought it was probably a shipping issue.  Then, one of the handle height adjusters fell off.  We've had a few of these issues arise, and Perego has sent us new replacements free of charge.  I still think compared to what else is out there, Perego is still made better than the other double strollers on the market.  And it is definitely one of the best looking and lightest weight ones you could find.  I would recommend this stroller.
