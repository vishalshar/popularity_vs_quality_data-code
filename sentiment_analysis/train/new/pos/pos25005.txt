I've had this for several months now. Here are my observations:1. You CAN open and close this whilst holding your baby. To open you just need to use your foot to unhook the clasp. The fold is self-explanatory.2. The first 20ish openings it got stuck halfway open and I almost returned it but it stopped doing that and has worked perfectly every time since.3. Lie flat...yes it's a lovely feature but I rarely use it. I got this when my baby was 12 months and looking back the quest would have been just fine for us.4. Canopy. Easily the worst aspect. If it could move up and down the frame then it would be pretty damn good. But it can't! And unfortunately that makes it practically useless unless it is unzipped but then the baby can see anything. I find it hard to believe that Maclaren could have got this part so very very wrong!5. Storage. It sucks, there is no way around that. Accessing the basket is hard because of the back panel (the part that encloses the back of the stroller when it is laid flat). You have to lift it up each time you want to access the basket. On he babyjogger city mini this part can be rolled away but on the maclaren it can't because they have put pockets on the outside which I never use because any weight in there pulls the whole canopy backward.6. Suspension. Pretty good! I've been over most surfaces with this stroller!7. Seat in upright position is not fully upright and maclaren have stopped making bumper bars so the baby can't pull to sit up. My poor boy is always slumping down but it doesn't seem to upset him. This is the next worst aspect of the stroller after the canopy.8. If you are bothered about the wheels touching the canopy when it is folded then don't get this.Overall, if they could fix the problems with the canopy and the seat in its most upright position (make it more upright or bring back bumper bars) then this stroller would be perfect.
