The Pacifier I love. My baby girl already had one similar but it was a pony and it is so easy to keep up with and also it helped her start using her hands to grab sooner. She was able to hold it and pull it back up to her mouth at an early age. The Teether is okay. I do like it and my daughter uses it but there's only 2 places she'll chew on cause of its shape. But it does help and has been easier for her to use than teething rings. She can hold it better and parts fit better in her mouth than some of the teething rings they make now. Some of those things are huge and she started teething before she was 3 mo.
