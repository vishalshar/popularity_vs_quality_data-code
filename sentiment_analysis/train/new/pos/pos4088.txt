I took a gamble and bought this without any prior reviews.  This apears to be the newest Summer Infant model.  Reviews were generall strong for their older models so I thought this would be a relatively safe bet.  It was.  The item is well made, the anchor system works well on my daughters twin bed (also can accomidate queen size), and the foldown function works easily.  What matters most to me is that it's strong and secure.  Immediately after I installed it my daughter jumped in bed and rolled her full weight against it and it didn't move.  Based on that test I think I'll be in good shape.
