I have worked as an optician for 8 years. I ordered these for my 1 year old daughter. Are these the highest quality glasses I have ever seen? No, but at this price point they are far more durble and adjustable than anything I have seen on the market. I found the infant size to be slightly narrow , and It would be nice it the adjustable portion of the temples came forward a little more so they could be fit closer to the ear. It would also be nice if the nose area was more moldable for baby's flat noses. That being said, most childrens sunglasses are not adjustable at all,  so this is a huge step up.In response to other comments;  the shipping charge for a replacement pair is $5.95.This company does offer a polarized version  (this style is not) . In my opinion polarized lenses for a baby are a waste of money. They reduce glare, and some increase how vivid colors are. That is it. Therere is no additional eye protection from a polarized lens in regards to Uv light.
