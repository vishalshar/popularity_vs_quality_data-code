My mom bought this changing pad cover for my changing pad (duh!).  I'm just a newborn so my skin is very sensitive.  This cover is very soft so I enjoy laying on it.  The colors are vibrant and haven't faded after many washes.  I have even tried going the bathroom on it but my mom is still able to clean it in the wash - I guess that means the fabric is not easily stained.  This product makes me a happy baby!
