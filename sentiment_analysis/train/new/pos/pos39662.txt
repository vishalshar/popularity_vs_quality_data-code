Taking my daughter to the store was always a struggle.  She was constantly needing to be entertained causing me to rush through my shopping and always leave the store forgetting something.  More importantly, I was very concerned about the cleanliness of the carts.  Shop &amp; Play is a lifesaver.  My daughter (9 mos) is happy and the Shop &amp; Play has plenty of toys attached to it for her to play with.  I was given a Floppy Seat, but there are no toys to keep her occupied.  Shop &amp; Play has the best of both worlds.  It is also a great value for the money.  A must for every family!
