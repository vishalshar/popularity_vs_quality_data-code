We ordered one of these for grandma's house and then ordered another for our living room.  Fairly easy assembly (I did it myself just a few days after giving birth) except for the changing table, which took me a couple tries to get right.  The diagram wasn't nearly clear enough, and once the pieces are snapped together it's very difficult to take them apart again.Grandma discovered that she can roll the playpen through a standard size doorway (as long as there are no tight corners to contend with).  The major criticism we have is that the changing table tilts toward the playpen since it is only supported at two corners.  They could have easily fixed this by providing wide clips, like the one used for suspending the mobile.The mobile has a very shrill, loud speaker that barely lasts 30 seconds when fully wound.  The baby hates the sound of it, so I usually just turn on the radio.  I like that the mobile can be pushed out of the way easily since it rotates from the edge of the playpen fully 360 degrees.I ordered the organic cotton fitted play yard sheet from American Baby Company and a waterproof fitted sheet - they fit perfectly and provide a softer, non-plasticy surface for baby.We haven't traveled or disassembled this playpen yet, so I can't speak to the ease of doing so, but Graco supposedly manufactures the easiest playpens to assemble and reassemble.  This one has 2 wheels on one edge and a bag for storing the folded playpen.
