We have had a Tinkerbell toilet seat for about 4 years and it lasted great. My 17 month old decided she needs to start using the potty so we started with Tinkerbell but the seat cushion cover cracked and scratched her so I decided it was time to retire it. We love Disney at my house, so Cinderella was a no brainer. It was hard for us to decide which seat to pick. The seat come apart so it's easy to clean. You also haven't apply the grips for the bottom yourself. It fits well on my toilet and my daughter loves using it. I'm very happy we purchased this seat.
