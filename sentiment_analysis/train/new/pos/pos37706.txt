We have been using it for almost a month.Our baby loves it!He is willing to spend more time in his crib touching and looking at the colourful pictures.It is absolutely worth the money and makes the crib so beautiful.It has enough protection for our child that can turn his sleep positions 180 degrees within a night.Great choice!
