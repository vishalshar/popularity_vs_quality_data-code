I stay at home with my daughter, and I originally bought this bouncy chair because someone told me their baby napped in it all the time. My daughter never napped in it (maybe twice ever), but it quickly became invaluable in our household! It was a great place to set my daughter down safely when I needed to use the bathroom, make meals, or take a shower. The toys hung a little low for my taste, but I just took the toy bar off and handed her one of her favorite toys when I sat her down. Worked like a charm. My husband and I also used it to eat meals. We'd sit at our low coffee table to eat and place the baby in this seat right beside us, and she was pretty content while we ate. It's easy to put together, the batteries last longer than I thought, and I adore the pattern! Too cute! My daughter loves it, too. Once she got about 4 months old, she'd try to twist around to see the little animals.One word of caution: if you have an active child, re-evaluate this chair as they get bigger. The chair is rated safe up to 25 pounds, but my 14-pound daughter knocked it over at 5 months old. The chair only has a lap belt, not a 5-point harness, so she was able to kick hard enough to pop up out of the belt, which tipped the chair over backward. She was fine, thankfully. It just scared her (and me!). I don't fault the chair because she is a wild one. I had told my husband the same week that I thought she was getting too active for it. So don't just go by the weight limit. Trust your instincts when you think it is no longer sufficient for your baby's size, strength, and activity level.
