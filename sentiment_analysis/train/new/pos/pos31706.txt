Having a baby and a toddler at the same time, going to stores or on walks can be difficult. We have a double stroller, but it is so bulky that it makes it difficult to maneuver and heavy and awkward to travel with. And most grocery store carts only have one seat, so my older child is left to sit in the large area with the food (which can be problematic if we are buying a lot). These handles have helped us solve these issues. Our toddler was taught to hold onto something like this when leaving her classroom at preschool, so the transition to using it at home was seamless. We hook it onto an umbrella stroller when going for walks around the neighborhood or traveling through an airport, or onto the cart when grocery shopping. She gets the freedom of walking by herself (like a big girl), and we are able to reduce our irritation with bulky strollers or unsafe carts--I only wish we had found out about these before wasting the money on the double stroller!
