This was a great buy for my total breastfed baby. She has never sucked a bottle but we have tried every pacifier on the shelves and she would not take them. My friend told me to order this one and I am so happy because she is 9 months today and she know longer have to use me as a pacifier. We are so happy to see her finally taking one after all these months .I wish they would have sent pink ones but we got blue, oh well as long as she sucks it.
