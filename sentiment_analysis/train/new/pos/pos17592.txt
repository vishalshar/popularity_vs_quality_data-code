My baby used this carseat for almost 6 months, and I feel we provided her with one of, if not, the safest infant car seat out there.  I was very impressed with the feel of the fabric, which is pleasantly soft and cushy, as well as the overall quality of the car seat and base.  I have a friend who purchased a Snugride for her son, and after I saw hers, I changed my mind about the one that we had initially wanted to buy for our baby.  It was not cushy at all, and her son just seemed to roll around in it.  I am happy that we decided to change to the Britax, even though the price difference was fairly substantial.  With the side impact head protection, her head never flopped around like other babies did.It IS a heavy seat, as some have commented, but my friend who has a Peg said it was lighter than hers.  I think that any infant carrier is going to get heavy the more you use it - that's just something we all have to go through.We also purchased the Preview stroller that goes with the seat. It was not difficult to put together and rolled well and is very good stroller for the money.  The only problem I had was that while she was riding in the carrier, you have to fully recline the stroller which causes the basket underneath to be unusable.  I do like the stroller for it's weight and the $$.  As a first time mom, you don't always know what to get and while there are other features I now know would be nice on a stroller, I can't say that I still wouldn't get it again.
