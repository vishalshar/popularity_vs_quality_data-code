When I was pregnant with my second child, I told my husband that someone needs to create something to help pregnant/nursing moms shower without feeling like our nipples are being ripped right out of the sockets. If you've ever nursed, you know how painful the shower water can be during those early newborn days when your nipples are at their most tender. This really has made all the difference for me. I am small chested at about 34A, so naturally I got the x-small. When I first received the product, it was super tight on me. I mean I could barely fasten the two velcro straps together. However, after one or two uses, the fabric totally stretches out on its own. Now I'm having the opposite issue of it being too big. It still stays on, but it's definitely bigger than when I first used it. So don't fear if you get yours and it doesn't fit. Trust me, it will!!! I think everyone should probably order a size down then it recommends. I really love this product and have come back twice now to buy them for other pregnant friends.
