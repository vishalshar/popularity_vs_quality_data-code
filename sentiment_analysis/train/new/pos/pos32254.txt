We live in the cold north, so with winter soon approaching I was looking for a warmer sleep sack for our 8-month-old.  I researched A LOT and bought 5 different sacks to try out based on reviews... but I kept only this one.  The other warm sleep sacks were of rough materials, and their quality for the price was subpar in my opinion.  I was SO happy to find these.  They are made with a super soft fleeced organic cotton.  The colors are adorable.  I ordered the blue trimmed one for my "test" run, and went on to order all of the other colors.  As a bonus, they're US-made.  My only wish would be that they would make these for older babies!  The 6-12 month size fits to 32" inches.  Skip the other warm sleep sacks, and go with this one.
