I absolutely adore the crib set! I bought it for my daughter before she was born and she is still using it at 2 years old on her toddler bed. Her bedroom is Paris themed so it matches perfectly. I have washed all the items many times and they have held up very well and kept their beautiful coloring. If you want your nursery to look chic then this is definitely the set to purchase! Received very quickly as well!
