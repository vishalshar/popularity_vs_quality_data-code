Love these pads! I have read through the reviews, and it seems that customers' responses have been mixed, depending on factors such as milk supply. For starters, my supply is steady and I very rarely leak, so I can't attest to how well they "prevent leaking". I have also read of reviewers saying that they lost their tackiness after a short time. However, I have been using mine for several months and they are still tacky. From time to time they seem to lose their tackiness, but it comes back after I give them a good washing in super hot water or clean them thoroughly with an alcohol pad (I buy cheap ones, not the Lily Padz brand, and they work just fine). I think retaining the tackiness is just a matter of using the Lily Wash once a day and cleaning them with alcohol anytime you remove them.Since having my baby and breastfeeding, I have extremely sensitive nipples, and I experienced discomfort with any other nursing pads that would move against my skin beneath my bra. The Lily Padz are wonderful in that they keep me covered and comfortable all day and all night. These are the only nursing pads I use anymore!**UPDATE** I recently weaned from breastfeeding and continued using these pads until that point. The entire time I used them (9 months), I cleaned them daily with soap and water (I switched to regular liquid soap once the Lily Wash ran out, and I never had a problem) and used alcohol swabs after every time I removed them, and they never lost their tackiness. I still stand by my five stars!
