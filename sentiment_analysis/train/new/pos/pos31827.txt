Bought this as our travel stroller and REALLY like it on the first trip. Folds very compact, a breeze to put together. Super swift ride/turns in airports, nice solid construction... We also have a Frog but think the Zapp will become our favorite simple, everyday, handy stroller. Only suspected downside is the wheels being smaller than the bugaboo: a bit of a rougher ride if un-perfect terrain. Other than that, very very nicely surprised with the Zapp!
