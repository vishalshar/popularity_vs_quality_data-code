I absolutely LOVE this diaper bag! I had previously bought a different high priced diaper bag and didn't love it so I returned it and after researching the ratings on different bags, I ended up going with this one from the Bumble Collection. And it was a GREAT choice! The material is such a high quality and there are so many great features and different pockets that it is very versatile and is able to hold everything I need. I love that it has a double zipper at the top to make access to the inside of the bag very easy, even if something needed to be retrieved from the bottom of the bag. I also like that any pockets without a zipper are secured with a magnet. I really don't like Velcro on diaper bags because they make too much noise, so this really just has everything I wanted. I didn't really love the pattern at first but it has grown on me and I am so glad that I got this! Definitely worth the price and I think it has better features than even some of the higher priced diaper bags. I would recommend it to anyone in an instant!
