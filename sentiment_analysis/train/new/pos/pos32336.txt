This is my favorite out of many brands i have tried. Its kinda like a diaper as in it keeps the wetness away and absorbes more than expected.I have tried...Medela- which didn't absorb as much as i hoped, kept the skin damp and was loud (paper sounds).Is really thin though.Lansinoh- which was not bad probably 2nd choice but i liked the dryness the evenflo gave better.Johnsons-was small but very thick for major leaking, the fibers would stick to the skin.  I used this along with a thin pad when i worked. because it was small i wanted a back up to cover the area as i moved around but because of the thickness i would not use for everyday.Nuk-I would not recommend. There is no edge around it like most others so if you leak the pad may absorb it but it can run right through to the bottom of the pad and on your clothes. The others with the edge will keep absorbing instead of letting it run out the bottom. this is not shaped to fit the curve of the mother either.cotton washable pad- It was thick, quiet and comfortable, but one letdown reflux went through the pad.Evenflo- Absorbes great while keeping skin from being soaking in milk. Has a good edge to prevent the pad from leaking, is not really loud and fits my shape well.Good luck!
