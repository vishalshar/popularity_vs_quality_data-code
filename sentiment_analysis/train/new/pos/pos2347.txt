Came on time and just as expected, fits perfectly on my snoogle basic pillow. It only has one opening how I wanted and not difficult to put on but it does take two people, me and my husband had it on in under two minutes by rolling it up like a pantyhose putting it on one end and pulling it up while he held the end I started on. Very easy I wash it and put it back on once a week with no problem.
