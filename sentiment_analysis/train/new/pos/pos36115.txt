I have to admit, I was thrilled when I found these. I've been using Young Living Essential Oils for almost a year now, absolutely love them. They have encouraged me to educate myself about the products I used & how they can be harmful to not only me but my family as well. I've been ridding our home of harmful products & one that had to go was the makeup remover wipes I was using at the time.(If interested in Young Living or have any questions please contact me at blhock12@gmail.com )These particular wipes peaked my interest not only because they are organic but all the Scents the brand offers are natural Scents as well, I mean who really wants their face smelling of clean cotton instead of lavender, right?They are fantastic! They arrived on time & have the right amount of moisture so your face isn't left soaked.I typically only need to use 1 wipe to clean my face but occasionally have to use 2 depending on the amount of makeup I'm wearing that day. Another plus is that they don't leave that interesting film on your skin like other makeup remover wipes do.I'll definitely purchase these again & recommend them to anyone who is wanting to live a more chemical free lifestyle.
