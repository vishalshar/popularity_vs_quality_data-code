Overall I have liked this product.  I like having a larger screen for in the bedroom at night because its easier to see with sleepy eyes.  Plus at night, it's black and white for the night vision and it also makes it easier to see details, such as if my baby's eyes are open or not for immediate attention.  I also appreciate having the handheld unit for when I have to be in the kitchen or laundryroom and not in sight or earshot of the baby.  It also has a clip on it so I can attach it to my pants and go handsfree when carrying items.There are two things that I find I don't like with this item.1) The sound levels.  If I put it on the lowest setting, I can't hear my baby AT ALL through the monitor, though I can hear her crying from down the hall.  :/  But then if I put it to the next level up, its REALLY loud.  I'd rather hear her than not, so I leave it on level 2 to be on the safe side.2) The battery life saver.  The handheld monitor automatically shuts off the screen (leaving the sound on) to save battery life and though I understand why they did this and a lot of people might appreciate it, I find it annoying to have to keep pressing the button to turn the screen back on when I am actively watching my baby from another room.  Also, we've had the set for about 2 months now and the screen on the handheld unit has a black bar across the middle.  So far its only when the screen shuts off for battery life but I am wondering if it will become an issue when the screen is on and I'm trying to see the kiddo.  :/Other than that, I have actually been pretty pleased with this product and its the first one we've ever purchased and used.
