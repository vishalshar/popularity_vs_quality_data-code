I would like to start this review by saying that i rarely write them. I only write them when I feel strongly about a product. When my daughter started sitting up by herself I searched high and low for a mat that would be safe for her to play on without me having to be on top of her to make  sure that she doesn't fall over. The foam mats are safe but they don't really break the fall of new sitter and they can get startled and upset even if they don't really hurt themselves. Well I've have this mat for a few months now and my daughter rarely falls now, but back when she did I am so glad that she had the soft spot to fall on. It's also super portable to I bring it to her grandparents house and they always remark about how cool it is. I just put her in the middle of the mat and bring out toys and sit right next to her, not in back of her, which is nice. I'm a pediatric occupational therapy and I think that falling is a way for babies and children to learn about their bodies, so I wanted my daughter to fall and be safe rather then me catching her everytime she fell. I know this product is expensive but it is well worth it. If you are the type of parent who likes to get down on the floor and play with their child this is perfect too bc it's basically a comfortable mat. Sometimes after work I'm exhausted and shell just sit next to me while I lie down next to her and read her a book or push a button on her toy and everyone is comfortable and safe. I can keep going, but I won't bc this is the longest review I have ever written! But seriously, I couldn't recommend a product more.
