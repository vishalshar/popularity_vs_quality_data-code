I love my bag. I like all the pockets that keep everything separate. This is my second child and I had two other diaper bags I could have used instead of buying this one, but I'm glad I made the choice to buy. The other bags were spacious but they didn't have enough pockets so that I often ended up throwing everything in there and then having to sift through the bottom in order to find what I needed. This bag has two pockets on each long side and bottle pockets at each end. There are also pockets at each outer end. It's true that it is small and doesn't hold as much as other Vera Bradley style diaper bags, but it holds enough. Honestly, if I had more space I would just keep putting more and more stuff in and never think it enough. It's big enough for the necessities.Here is what I carry in my bag. I put a slim wipes box in the zippered area with the cute changing pad. Pocket #1 I have a Wet Ones pack, suction bulb, little noses, burp cloth and gas drops. Pocket#2 Extra bibs and burp cloths. Pocket#3 diaper cream, extra socks, paci holder, toy. Pocket#4 Five size 2 diapers. Two bottes in each inside pocket. The main compartment has two change of clothes, a blanket, and formula dispenser. I use the outside end pockets for extra bottles or a water bottle for me. There are also two slim pockets that are covered by the magnetic closing flap where I put  papers I get from the pediatrician after out visits and for random small things. Depending on what you put in, it could get bulky and the flap won't match up with the magnet, but if all you are doing is going out of the house for a few hours, this bag is more than enough.
