I bought two of these so each grand-baby would have one on his car seat. The babies play with them the moment they spy them. My mistake has nothing to do with this toy, but rather with the car seats. The bar that this toy curls around must be left in an upright position when locked into the car seat base in the car, so the baby cannot play while riding in the car. You might want to check how the bar will be positioned on your baby's car seat if you purchase this to use in the car.
