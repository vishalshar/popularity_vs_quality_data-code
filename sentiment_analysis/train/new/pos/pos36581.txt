These cloth diapers are amazing! We have had no leaks so far, and they fit my daughter well. She was 8 pounds at birth, but they did not fit her until she was closer to 10 pounds. They are worth every penny, as these will be with you for YEARS. I love these because they are very high quality, and save me so much money compared to the cost of disposable diapers. I would recommend washing at least 4 or 5 times before using, as this will increase their absorbency and help prevent leaking. The prints I received were absolutely adorable. I have purchased Alva diapers for 3 of my friends who were expecting and frequently recommend these to other mommas who are interested in cloth diapering
