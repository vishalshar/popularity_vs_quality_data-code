To be honest I had little to no belief that this product would actually work. My 2-year-old daughter had been sucking her thumb since she was 6months old. She was very bad, I would say the majority of the day her thumb would be in her mouth. The doctors said not to worry too much about it till she was older and I wasn't too eager to make her stop because I know that sucking her thumb soothed her. But her thumb got so raw, it became infected and the nail started to come off. I decided I needed to try something. At first I tried putting the things on her thumb that make it taste bitter, that didn't work whatsoever. So that's when I decide to try Dr. Thumb. I was so afraid that she was going to absolutely hate have this on her hand, but she only really got frustrated with it for the first 15-20 minutes. After that she didn't care it was on and she stopped trying to put her thumb in her mouth. She could do everything as normal and actually got mad when we took it off for bath and food (we told her it was her bracelet so thats what she called it and showed it off to everyone). So we kept it on the 3 weeks, as per the instructions, only taking it off for eating and baths. By the end of the first week she would stop putting her thumb in her mouth even when it was off. But we still kept it on to be safe.  By week three we were nervous to take off, but once we did to our joy she didn't suck her thumb!! It's now been 2 months since and she has not tried sucking her thumb once! This product is amazing and so glad we tried it! The only complaint is i wish it was easier to tighten & loosen the straps. You have to make fine adjustments to get the tightness just right, for they cannot take off. And with this setup it can be difficult to do. But once you got it, you don't have to worry about it too much.
