Very pleased with the crib, very solid and not too difficult to put together. I only gave it 4 stars because I thought they could have done the standard size crib mattress as opposed to the 3", minor detail. My only disappointment is the crib does not have the mattress height adjustments. Would be tough on a mom that had a section in the beginning. I thought I read it did but now cannot find that documented anywhere, may have been my oversight. Otherwise very sturdy and really sharp looking.
