My 3 year old daughter loves Gus, and I love that I don't have to wake up to her screaming in the middle of the night anymore.  He has four settings where he can stay on continuously, 10 minutes, 20 minutes or 30 minutes.  He has a high and low setting for the brightness of the light.  I know the ad says he's cuddly, but he's not at all soft.  He's made of plastic, but that being said my daughter sleeps with him in her bed and has rolled on him plenty of times without complaint.  I like that he's portable and so easy to travel with.  I only have two suggestions for improvement.  One, the buttons on the underside where you adjust the length of time he's on and the brightness are not hidden at all and I'm always afraid my daughter is going to inadvertently turn him off.  That being said, this has never happened.  I would just like to see the controls hidden under a plastic flap or something.  My other suggestion is that he have some way of shutting off in the morning.  Although my daughter likes the night to keep her from getting scared in the night, the light in the morning can sometimes cause her to wake up early (she sleeps in a completely blacked out room.) I wish there was a way to set him to shut off at 5 am, so that for the last hour or so of her sleep, he would be off.  I haven't found anything like that anywhere on the market though.
