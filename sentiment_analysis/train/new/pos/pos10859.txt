First and foremost, this is a nice looking and very practical piece of furniture. If you have ever had to assemble any "out of a box" furniture, the instructions are the same as all the rest. Its not, I repeat NOT a high quality, solid wood, lasts for 5 generations piece of furniture and you should already know that, because its less than $200!!! Have realistic expectations and you will not be disappointed. You're about to have a baby, so get used to things a lot more difficult than putting together a cheap changing table!!!With that out of the way, it took me less than 2 hours to put together by myself and in the end I made 2 adjustments. Instead of the flimsy cardboard backing that you know will come off like they always do, go to home depot and get a half sheet of 1/2" plywood, have them cut it to size ( the same size as the piece of cardboard that your not gonna use because you want your baby to be safe ) and attach it with 1 and 1/4 inch wood screws. This will turn a wobbly table into a nice solid table and you will be much happier. If you want, you can even put the cardboard on first and then put the plywood over it so it looks nicer at the back of the cubby hole, or just paint the plywood. If you dont do this you will have to figure out another way to make it stable because if you're anything like me, you wont want to screw the table into a wall stud like the instructions tell you to.Adjustment #2 was replacing the plastic drawer slides with real metal slides that i happened to have but can be bought at lowes, home depot or probably any hardware store. They function nicer and hold a lot more weight.In short, its a good table at a very budget friendly price, and it looks great. As mentioned earlier, YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY!!! If you lack the skills to follow simple instructions and the creativity to fix things that are less than perfect, you are about to have a lot more to worry about than a changing table.Good luck and happy building
