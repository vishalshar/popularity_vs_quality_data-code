The only negative thing I will say is that I thought you could use your own pacis with it. It comes with one attached , so you can't change them out. So the next issue was , how do I clean the paci? If you hold the dragon and only put the paci in low running water ... Easy peasy. Other than that... My grandson LOVES this !! I was surprised because he's so young I didn't think he'd even notice it ... But he does. So now I have to buy a hundred of them so we always have one incase one gets lost ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
