What a great idea! High quality, we have washed these and they held up well.We bought 5 of these, what a time saver! We tried to use the traditional blanket wrapping, but that didn't stay put.Absolutely love this product. We have given this product to many of my girlfriends for baby shower, along with a bottle of Vitaville Argan oil for the expecting mom.
