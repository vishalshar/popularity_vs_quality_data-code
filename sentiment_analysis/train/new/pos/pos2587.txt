I wasn't sure about getting a "space saver" high chair, but this one is great! It has a rubber track on the bottom and two straps, enabling it to be very securely attached to a chair.  It can recline for a baby who is not quite able to sit up yet and has a center "post" to keep a child from sliding down.  The deluxe version now has wipeable straps and the cover is washable and wipeable too.  The tray and the tray insert can go in the dishwasher.  I like the seat cover--it's cute without being too cutesy and is very unisex.  Would definitely purchase this again.
