I have 3 children aged 3.5, 2 and 4 months. I have0 purchased a lot of OXO kids products because I believe that they are well made and safe for my kids. I bought two of these bowls recently for my toddlers as they graduate from baby bowls.In terms of food portion, this size is perfect for the 2 growing toddlers (a boy and a girl). It also holds soup perfectly. The non-slip base is not exactly helpful considering that the toddlers were strong enough to move the bowl around, but it helped somewhat is maintaining friction to prevent any accidents, especially for my 2 year old.My only complain is that if the food is oily such as soup, it takes about 2-3 cleaning to fully get rid of the oil. Not a super big deal, but it's extra work especially when I have 3 kids to take care of.
