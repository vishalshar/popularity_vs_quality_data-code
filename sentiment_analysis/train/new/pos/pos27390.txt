The gate is as nice as it looks in the picture!  It matched our American Cherry woodwork perfectly and has a nice contemporary look to it.  The gate requires compression to work, so don't worry when it doesn't look like it will fit at first.  It will.  We use the gate to keep our small dogs in our laundry area when we are gone.  It works well and is easy to use, however, a clever dog can pull it out of place and escape, so you'll need to check the compression from time to time.  There is no door holder, so we had to find something with some weight to keep the door open when we are home.  We also didn't use the extra bar brackets that expand the door more as our doorway didn't require them.  I think this one gate would work well in a variety of situations.
