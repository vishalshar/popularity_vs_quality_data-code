I felt I had to add a review for this, because it's getting unfairly knocked in my opinion.  Not sure why this monitor is getting knocked, but we're very happy with it. We have an older Motorola that has just one camera, for when we only had one child. With a new infant we needed a multi-room monitor, and this vtech was a nice combination of value and features we wanted.  We wanted temperature readings, so this fit the bill. In general, very pleased with the monitor.Pros:- The cycle mode is excellent - rotates between the 2 rooms every 7 seconds or so.- Even if you shut off the screen if the kids are asleep, when sound is heard, the screen turns on and you can quickly see who's making noise- Video quality is fine despite complaints - it's not an HD screen like we're all used to w/ our phones, and we didn't need that. If you want that level of quality you have to pay for it. We didn't want to pony up.- The monitor is very sturdy build, has a very adjustable pedestal for multiple viewing angles- We've had no issues with reception, and live in a 3 story townhome w/ the kids on top floor, living area on bottomCons:- If I have to make a complaint, it's that the cameras themselves are a bit large; nothing that you can't pack away for travel but just bigger than our older Motorola.  But, it's a much sturdier build, so I'll happily accept that.
