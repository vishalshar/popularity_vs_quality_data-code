My baby took a little time to like this ball -- he doesn't pay that much attention to the tags, but now he likes the big soft ball to wrestle with ocassionally and he likes the jingley-rattley sounds. He is not interested in rolling it. He has a favorite tag, but doesn't focus too much on the tags. He enjoys it mostly when I hold a tag and dangle the ball around by his face making it make noise and sort of make it bounce-bounce-bounce (like dribbling the ball while holding the tag) ... he also likes when I through it way up in the air and catch it ... maybe he will eventually like playing with it himself when he's older (he's 10.5 months old). But I do like that it is a cushiony soft ball, so he doesn't get hurt. And I think the times when he does play with the tags it is good for his motor skills and exploration of the differences in the tags.
