We use the camera as a nanny cam. The camera is up and running for 4 months continuously and we did not have any issues. A recent firmware update decreased the latency of the camera on a local wireless network from 2 seconds down to maybe 0.5 seconds. The only thing I am unhappy is the android software support. Currently, the app does not support android 4.1 (jellybean). Hence at work, I am forced to use my compute rather than my smartphone. Also I was hopping that I would have an app on my Samsung SmartTV to log into the camera. One important thing: The smartcam is using peer-to-peer connection. Hence, you have to connect do each camera individually. Only if you connect to the camera, you will use bandwidth. This is in strong contrast to the dropcam solution. The dropcam solution is set up as a online dvr (digital video recorder) system. All data is sent via a dropcam server (US based) and hence the local area network will see much more traffic. The samsung smartcam only allows event recording to a private youtube account. If you are looking for surveillance 24/7, certainly the dropcam solution (monthly charge applies) is the better choice. Re-routing the traffic via a server vs peer-to-peer will add up to increased latency (5 seconds). Another note: I could not observe the timeout issues described by other reviewers.
