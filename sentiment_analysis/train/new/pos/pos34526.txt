Shipping was extremely faster from what I expected. So cute and you couldn't beat the value. Along with the tutu matching leggings, head band and shoes. I thought it was a little big for new born but the new mommy said that is her coming home attire. It matched perfectly with the 5 piece diaper bag  I also purchased.
