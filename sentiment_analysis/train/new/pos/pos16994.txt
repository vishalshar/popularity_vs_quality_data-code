We have an oddly long entryway into the living room and I could not find a gate that was long enough to reach end to end.I have 3 naughty dogs that like to poo and pee on the rugs.... Installing this gate has eliminated accidents because they now can't access the room when no one is home.The gate was super easy to install and was stiff when trying to open it at first. My husband showed me an easier way to lock the gate and now it's super simple.... Pull and lift then lock in place.I will probably buy another one of these for the kitchen area!
