I seriously love this toilet. On road trips.. We put our daughter on the potty in the car while going through drive throughs (two birds with one stone!). I take this thing every where, hiking, boating, road trips, parks, etc.it's teeny tiny, everyone says lunch box size.. I think my 1980s plastic she-ra lunch box (with matching thermos) was bigger than this!Other reviews talk about how hard it is to put the diaper on in a hurry.. My question is .. Why don't you keep a diaper in it?I don't know how it would work with a small diaper but I buy size 6 for it. This allows me to fasten the diaper around the sides AND put the lid back on the diaper. Which helps the diaper take the shape if the toilet so when my kiddo needs to use it, it stays put... Plus i don't have to fuss with it while she is peeing all over herself.You gotta be smarter than the diaper potty.. If you are, it's the best portable toilet out there.I keep it with  extra diapers and some Clorox wipes (travel pack or zip lock of ones from the house stash) in the nifty little plastic zipper case that the potty comes in.. Even has a handle.Took this to disneyland even.. Just in case we got stuck in a long bathroom line!Seriously, stop thinking about it.. Just buy it. No drippy, leaky pee bags. Just roll up the diaper, like you've been doing for the last 1-3 years and toss.
