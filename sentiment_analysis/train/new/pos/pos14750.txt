We bought the Tres Tria Co-Sleeping Solution because 3-4 nights a week I work a 12.5 hour overnight shift and our 8 month old son will not sleep in a crib. On nights I am home he sleeps snuggled up with me and he had a co-sleeper crib attached to the bed for nights alone with my husband. A few weeks ago he outgrew it and I was so stressed as to what to do. I looked up "co-sleeping" on Amazon and found the Tres Tria Co-sleeping Solution. During the day I use it as a bumper on the edge of the bed incase the baby rolls when we sleep. On the nights I am at work we push the bed against the wall and fill the crack with a folded towel. On the foot of the bed we stack my pillows to be used as a bumper. The Tres Tria goes in the middle of the bed and my husband sleeps on the other side. Perfect solution! Now the baby can sleep in our bed without me, as safe as if he were in a crib. I don't have to spend all night at work worried that my husband rolled over on him or accidently has an arm draped over the baby's airway. It is made of soft material but is sturdy enough that my husband wouldn't roll over it during the night.update to orignal post about price:I had an issue with the price because I saw it cheaper somewhere else when this is a Better For Babies exclusive product. Better For Babies contacted me immediately with an explanation. You can't find organic baby products at decent prices with customer service like this anywhere else.
