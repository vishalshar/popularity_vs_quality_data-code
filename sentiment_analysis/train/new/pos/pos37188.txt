I wish I would have ordered this first! I went with the rock n play, since everyone I knew had one and loved it. My baby has slept through the night since 3 weeks old and I was nervous to switch it up. But at 9 weeks her head was already beginning to flatten with rnp. That's why I bought this. It's perfect! Perfect height for bed, perfect size for her (she was 12lbs 24in at 8 weeks). She is now 14 weeks old and rolling over in it and I still feel safe. The only thing I don't care for is the mirror. I wish it detached. She moves so much she hits it with her hands. I just lay her head on the opposite end and it's usually ok.
