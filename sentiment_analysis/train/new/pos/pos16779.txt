this play yard is perfect for visiting grandbabies - I am not sure why others are talking about assembly problems.  Mine was fully assembled, I just needed to set it up, which can be a problem if you don't follow the instructions.  Since it was just like one I had previously borrowed from a friend, it was a easy to set up.  I think the side rails need to be locked before you push the bottom down into place.  Just need to get the baby to my house more often to use it!
