I needed new bowls for my kids (ages 6 and 3.5) since our old ones were 6 years old and in pretty ratty condition.  A friend had these bowls and they seemed very sturdy and cleaned up well, so I decided to give them a try.  These are the perfect size for kids, they hold everything from a bowl of cereal to ice cream!  We bought them in 2 color ways and also picked up 2 sets of divider plates from Re-Play. Perfect!!*Edited to add a photo!
