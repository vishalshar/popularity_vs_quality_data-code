These things are bad-ass! I bought them in March 2016 when my twins started daycare every single label on every bottle has stayed perfectly in place. The bottles get washed daily, sometimes multiple times a day and i steam clean their bottles regularly and no issues at all. It is now the end of August 2016, 5 months and no sign of coming off. If you have to label your child's items for daycare or school these are the way to go. I can't recommend these enough.
