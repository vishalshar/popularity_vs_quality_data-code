I purchased this for my special needs child and it works really well for him.  He is seven and it fits on his special stroller and car seat and also his other positioning chairs. I like being able to bend the side pieces so he can use it while reclining.My only issue is it would be nice to have a little larger cutout for the neck but this item is supposed to be for toddlers so that would explain the small space.
