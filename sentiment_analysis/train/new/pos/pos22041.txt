EXCELLENT mattress.  We bought this one to replace the one that's been well-loved for almost 7 years straight by 3 different kiddos.  Our 4th baby will be safe and comfortable, just like the older siblings.  Cannot say enough about this product.  It's definitely made to last.  Our last one didn't "wear out" until the third baby that used it was over 2 years old.  We replaced the old one because the comfort layers inside the mattress between the coils and the cover had definitely been worn down over the years and it was no longer as comfortable or supportive as it once had been.  I'm very pleased with the life we got out of the first one, so much so, that we chose the exact same mattress this time.  I'd highly recommend this.
