I'm an experienced bib user, having been through three messy kids. I have used both the Baby Bjorn and these and they are both suited for different stages.Our Baby Bjorn is very easy to remove, so I did not like using it under about 2.5 years old. It is firmer and less floppy than the Tommee Tippee and I do like that about it. Once my children reached the age of understanding that if they remove the bib, their food is taken away, then the Bjorn was appropriate.However, the Tommee Tippee is harder to remove, so for the kid that is wanting to take the bib off, the TT works better. I often read people complain that this bib is not tight enough around the neck and gives room for food to dribble down. I agree with this, I have petite children and everything runs big on them. However, it is easily resolved by taking a standard hole punch and punching your own hole wherever you want it and this makes it tighter. The other advantage is that this makes a slightly smaller hole than what the bib comes with, and makes it even more difficult for the child to remove.I used our first set of bibs for over three years before they got moldy. One I had left accidentally in our travel booster dining seat for several weeks and I could not remove the mold from it. The other one finally starting cracking along the bottom. They were well worth the money and we got our use out of them.
