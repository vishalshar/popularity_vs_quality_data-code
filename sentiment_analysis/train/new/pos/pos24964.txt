We don't have kids, but now that we are 30, all of our friends do. The lobster chair is the only thing we buy for baby shower gifts, and every time we do the other parents or parents-to-be ask for one!Of course, you don't need children to play with a new purchase, so before giving it away I opened the box and hooked it up to our table (See the picture I included). This thing is great! It folds up into a very easy to transport size, I would imagine you'd keep this in your car or in the storage pouch on your stroller. The fabric case has a couple of handles for ease of transport. It attaches to a table in a snap, and holds on tight. The seat is secure and deep enough that your kid won't topple out, but if you are worried or you have a particularly bouncy child, there are shoulder straps that are well padded but very secure.The included tray attaches easily and is nice if you want to protect the table surface from banging utensils or spills.I don't know if we are going to have kids, but if we do, we are certainly going to buy one of these (or two) for ourselves. STRONGLY recommended.As always, please leave any questions you have in the comments, and I'll get to them quickly. Cheers!
