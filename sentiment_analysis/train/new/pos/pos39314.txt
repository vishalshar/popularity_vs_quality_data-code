We have boy/girl twins and a 20 month old. Each of our children were swaddled as infants. They are the PERFECT size for swaddling. These blankets are durable, become softer (without pilling) after each wash, and are amazingly versatile. Even though our children are no longer swaddled, these are the perfect size for playing picnic, wrapping baby dolls, snuggling with on car rides, etc. When they were infants we also used these in their car seats- not to heavy or light. Over the years we've purchased several for ourselves and friends with babies. SwaddleDesigns Receiving blankets are an excellent product that we highly recommend.
