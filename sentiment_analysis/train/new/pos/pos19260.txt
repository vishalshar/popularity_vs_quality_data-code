My son is 15 mths and we have been using this for the past month or so and he LOVES IT!  I think it is a really great cup... it has only leaked once and that was when it was left in the hot car for 45 mins.  I had the lid closed on it and when I wen to open it, it sprayed me.  I have always made sure that the arrows are lined up and I wash all my sons cups by hand b/c sometimes after washing them in the top rack of the dishwasher they can still become kinda warped and cause the cups not to work right...this goes for other brands of cups I have used as well!!THESE CUPS ARE GREAT IF YOU USE THEN THE RIGHT WAY!
