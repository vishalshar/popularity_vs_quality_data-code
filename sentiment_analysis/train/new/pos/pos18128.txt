I bought this for myself because I am a short person and seat belts always rub my neck raw.  I am happy it came with 2 in case it breaks or I can share it with the children.  Now that I have used it a while, I am satisfied with this item.  It took me a few tries to get used to how it would work well but now I have the hang of it; the trick was to clip the shoulder part first, then the lap part and click it locked. I wish it would stay on the seat belt because I have to take it off when removing the seat belt or it pops out and falls but that is no big deal.  My neck feels so much more confortable now, especially when I go for a long drive.
