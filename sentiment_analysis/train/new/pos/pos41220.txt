Purchased this as a gift for a dear friend's little one.  It arrived quickly, in perfect shape.  The actual bear appears very well made for the price.  I liked the design feature that the "sound machine" part can be removed from the body for cleaning, etc.  This is a great decision, as we all know, kids' things get kinda grubby after a while. The sound box is nicely thought out, with an on/off switch, volume adjustment, and two timer settings.  Three "sounds" are selectable as well.  Personally, I would have liked a couple extra sounds, but that's just semantics and I knew what it included, when ordered.  Her little one didn't seem to care in the least, as she zonked right out with it next to her in the car.  :)  This made me happy.  Overall, it's very cute and, I think, worth what I paid.
