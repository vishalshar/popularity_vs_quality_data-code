This BooginHead strap is the best brand I have found.  The Velcro is stronger than other brands.  I have been using the exact same straps for 18 months now and they still are holding strong.  My 24 month old twins just started barely being able to undo the straps themselves.  By this age, they really don't need them anyhow.  I have another brand and the Velcro wasn't as long as the BooginHead brand and could easily be undone by a 6 month old right away.  I use these to hold sippy cups and toys onto our stroller and to hold sippy cups onto restaurant high-chairs so that the cups don't fall on nasty restaurant floors.  I own 5 of these straps and feel they are a great investment.  They were much cheaper than buying the snack tray and cupholder for my stroller.  Instead, I have a strap for a cheerio bowl and a strap for the cup.
