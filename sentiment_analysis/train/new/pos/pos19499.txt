I am so impressed with this crib skirt, it's exactly what I imagined it to be. The best part is how thick and durable the material is! I was really hesitant about the price, but they definitely didn't skimp on material for what they're charging. It fits our crib perfectly, the length is perfect for leaving the mattress on the highest setting for our newborn and still having the skirt reach the ground.
