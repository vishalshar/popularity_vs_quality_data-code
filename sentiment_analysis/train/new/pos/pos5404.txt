after a lot of research I decided on these because it says " it works with the natural development of baby's teeth"  I have never had a problem with my babies rejecting pacifiers so it could be that my babies really aren't to picky I don't know but she really likes hers and it has a cute design and its easy for her to hang on to she likes to take it out of her mouth and chew on the sides and she can get a good grip on it. It comes with a clip on cover that works really good and stays on
