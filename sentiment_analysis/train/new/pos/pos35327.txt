I don't know if it's possible to be in love with a stroller, but I am. The ride is so smooth and easy to push. I started out with the Britax B-Agile when my son was a newborn and put miles and miles on it. After two years the wheels were completely shot and it was just showing signs of wear and tear. I knew I could order replacement parts but I really wanted a jogging or all terrain stroller. After a lot of research I knew I wanted a Baby Jogger Summit or City Elite. Most people look to the BOB when they think of high end strollers, but after comparing them in person the Baby Joggers are so much better in my opinion. The biggest difference may seem minor to some, but as a daily user the handle bar is a big deal. BOBs and Britax strollers have foam handle bars that eventually crack. I had to buy handle bar covers for my B-Agile after a year. The cushioned, adjustable height leather like handle bars on the Baby Jogger is worth every penny when you're on mile 3 and your fingers aren't tingling. The canopy is comparable to my Britax but the side vents that are held open by quiet magnets are awesome. It's very cushioned and has a prop up foot rest, so very comfortable for children. This is technically not a jogging stroller but it has a safety strap because I think they realize people will jog with it anyway. My husband and I only use it on paved park trails, but I would get a true jogging stroller if you were to use it on any other surface. The cons are it is huge and heavy. I have an umbrella stroller that I keep in the trunk and sometimes my old Britax when when need something that reclines, but I will never take this in and out of the car unless there's a special occasion. If you use a stroller heavily and jog lightly, this stroller can't be beat.
