I have BUSY BUSY BUSY little boys and whatever is not locked up gets pulled out of my cabinets.  I have tried numerous different cabinet locks out there and these fit the best and are the easiest to use that I have found.They hang off of the knob by the grey circular part of the lock when you have it open so that it doesn't get set somewhere and not put back on and with a simple sliding action it goes right back on.  The locking mechanism itself is easy to press and pull right off when you need access to your cabinets.  I've worked with some that I had to wrestle with and were so difficult to use that I just chucked 'em in the garbage.  This lock is also fairly slim in profile so if you have knobs that don't give much space between the cabinet and the fat part of the knob, you're able to fit this one.  The version that I chucked was also so fat that if my knobs didn't have a whole lot of clearance between the cabinet and the knob, it wouldn't stay on.If you're looking for an easy to use cabinet lock, I highly recommend this one.
