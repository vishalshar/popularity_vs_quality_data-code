When I was pregnant, I received the Sassy Bugs that made music while attached to the car seat. I couldn't help but buy the guitar version for my sister-in-law, who was expecting a son. My brother-in-law has many interests, including playing the guitar, so I thought these Sassy guitars were a fun and personal gift.Babies begin to notice these around one month of age. They see the pretty colors and hear the different musical notes/rings. These toys then last until the baby is 7-8 months old because they are fun for them to bat at and look at in the car.If my next baby is a boy, I will be getting these for him (though baby girls can certainly enjoy them too).
