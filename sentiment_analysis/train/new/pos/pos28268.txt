I am now purchasing my second one.  The first one I purchased was 2 years ago for my oldest son.  He loved it so much, even after learning how to crawl and sit up, it became his favorite place to nap.  He played with it so much over the years the stuffing isn't as fluffy as it was when we first bought it.  It IS durable.  I love that, I can't even tell you how many times we have washed this item.  We are now purchasing one for our second son to enjoy.  I highly recommend this item.  I have had many friends ask where we got this item and what it is and they have bought one for their children as well.  It really is a Great price (same price we paid on March 9, 2014) we are excited for our other son to enjoy this as much as his older brother enjoyed his.  :)  Purchasing a new one today, March 13, 2016!  I'd say that is more than adequate time for us to say this product is worth the money!
