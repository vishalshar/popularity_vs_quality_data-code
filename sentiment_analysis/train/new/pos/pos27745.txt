My twins use these pacifier clips every night.  I just clip them onto their sleep sacks and they stay on all night.  It has allowed me to sleep peacefully through the night so that I'm not jumping out of bed to pop their pacifiers back in their mouths.  We also use them sometimes during the daytime and it helps to keep their pacifiers clean and off the ground.  The pacifier is easy to attach and remove.
