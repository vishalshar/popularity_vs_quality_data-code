We have had this set for 4 years and it has held up, with multiple children. The large toy box holds a lot, but I wish it had a way to separate sections.The cube drawer is great for smaller items that would take up random space otherwise.There are still no stains, and the fabric cleans off easily with water. I like that the fabric color is neutral and is not an eyesore. It's fun to customize the fabric with iron on patches!Some of the threading is coming apart, but this does not affect functionality; they are still just as sturdy.
