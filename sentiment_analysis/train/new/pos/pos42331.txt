My daughter used to scream in the car, she HATED it! Finally we broke down and bought this carseat, we got it on sale on amazon and took advantage of the trial prime membership to get the free shipping. Now I'm not going to lie and say my daughter is as happy as a clam in her new carseat but she is happier than before. In her old infant seat (a Graco Snugride) she would never fall asleep but now if she's tired and has a full tummy she sleeps very soundly in this new seat!Also, the safety features are amazing and the fabric is so pretty! I wish I would have gotten this seat for my son as well, but he already has a convertable chair. I love the huge side wings and how the frame of the seat is coated in the same stuff they put inside of bike helmets.I love the locking clip that holds the chair to the seat belt too. If you are looking for a seat that is easy to move from car to car I'll have to tell you this is not it but only because of the safty features which I think makes it worth the extra time it takes to move it. My sons chair you just slide the belt through the back of the seat but with this chair you send it though a special track and then it clips in place.My sons chair did not do well rear faceing because it was tippy. This chair stays in place perfectly and also is reclined very well whereas many other convertables seem to sit the child up to much so when they fall asleep their head falls forward. The chair looks big but it fits very well rear facing in our car too which is another problem we had with my son chair. The back head rest comes off of this chair makeing it a perfect fit! My sons carseat is an Alpha Omega Elite and it is rated really well by others and I also really like it, untill I compare it with this seat! I have never owned a Britax but I can't imagine it being better than The First Years True Fit!I would definatley recomend this chair to anyone!
