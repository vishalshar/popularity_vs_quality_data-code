I bought these because my little girl is just beginning to figure out how to crawl. Summer is coming and I knew she would not have covered legs for the most part and I wanted something to protect her from rough/dirty floors. These leggings are perfect. I love the black and white stripe, gives her a little edge and looks adorable!! They are soft and most importantly they stay up over her chubby thighs without digging in. They can also be pulled down over her feet should a cool day or evening strike, but don't fall down if you don't want them there. It's great because I can dress her in her hot weather clothes first thing in the morning but cover her legs if it's a bit chilly to begin with.
