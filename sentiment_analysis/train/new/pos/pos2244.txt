My granddaughter is now 1 yr old and no longer takes a bottle, but when she did this was the brand that we used. We never experienced any leaks and the baby seemed to love the shape of these bottles.I'm sorry that other customers experienced leaking, but I have nothing but nice things to say about this particular bottle.If a second grandchild ever comes, I will purchase this brand again.
