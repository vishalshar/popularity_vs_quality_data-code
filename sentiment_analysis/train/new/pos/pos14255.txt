You never know what toy is going to be the "it toy" for your child. For my 16 month old, this floor puzzle is it. He plays with it everyday. We help him fit the pieces together or build them into cubes for him to stack. The puzzle is kept in a drawer which my son can easily access. He takes the pieces out, puts them away, looks at the characters and sorts through them to find his favorite pictures on his own. We received the first puzzle as a hand me down and purchased a second one since he's so into it. Now we can build even more cubes!For those complaining about the size...it clearly states the pieces are 4"x4". This is not the foam puzzle you buy to use as a floor cover or area rug. The fact that it's not the size you want does not make the product worthy of low star ratings.
