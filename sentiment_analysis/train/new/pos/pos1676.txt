My son wants to be held ALL THE TIME. This, of course, is impossible. Anyways, this swing made it possible for me to get things done around the house.Cool things:-It plugs in!-You can turn the seat 360 degrees!-The chair rocks side to side or front to back!It always plays music and has a variety of soothing noises. It has six speeds.Oh and I am not the best when it comes to putting things together- it seriously took me less than 20 minutes and that's with my 3 year old "helping" (we all know what that means! LOL).I love this swing and would totally recommend it to others.
