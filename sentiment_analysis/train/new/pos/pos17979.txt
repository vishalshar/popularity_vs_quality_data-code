This board is exactly what we needed.  My daughter has been using this stroller since she was about 8 mos and always had a problem sliding down the seat.  With the board in place, she no longer slides and can actually see what is going on around her.  We are both very happy with the purchase.  I would recommend this to anyone who has this stroller.
