These are hard to find so I grabbed a couple. I use these normally during the winter months for my daughters bedroom. Gas heat destroys humidity so we must put some back into the air for her. These filters are quick to install, use and inexpensive. A perfect match. Mine usually last about 30 days before needing to be changed. Keep in mind that if you don't use them on a regular basis they can become nasty and you must change to a new one. Don't want those nasty germs getting into your loved ones.. A great buy!!
