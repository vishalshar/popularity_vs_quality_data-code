I would definitely recommend this! My daughter is 10 months old, and her gums itch really badly. She will chew on the ears of this and pull it out of her mouth to scratch her gums. She loves this, and it is holding up really well. It also comes with a clear case to put it in, for diaper bags. That is very handy. Quick shipping, good price. Great buy!
