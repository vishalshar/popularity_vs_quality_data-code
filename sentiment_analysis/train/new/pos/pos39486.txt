I purchased this for my 3 month old grandson. It has an adorable expression, which seems very vital for a baby toy. The colors are cheerful and the bottom banana clump clicks as it turns around. The only down side is the gorilla doesn't make very much of a "giggling" sound. That was fine with me. I prefer giggling sounds coming from babies as they play!
