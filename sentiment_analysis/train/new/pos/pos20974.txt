These NUK binkies are getting 5 stars from me, despite the obvious "problem" they've caused with my two year old. She's fairly attached to these binkies, and it might be a "one binkie to rule them all" situation since she talks to the binkie, pets the binkie, plays with the binkie, and has a fairly dramatic reaction to being separated from the binkie. We have purchased the Booginhead Pacigrip to ensure it is clipped to her at all times, everywhere she goes, similar to a life line or one of those baby leash things you see in airports. I've noticed a decrease in both my daughter's and my anxiety since we've bought the clip (complete with back up clip to go with the back up binkie in case of a devastating loss). So, it's helpful these come in a pack of 2. You know, "they" say you don't have to worry about prolonged binkie use, because "she won't be going to college with a binkie in her mouth." Well, mine might just be the exception to ruin the cliche.
