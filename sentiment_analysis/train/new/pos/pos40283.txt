I'll be honest - I am a little embarrassed to use this cart cover in public.  It's got all the bells and whistles and I'm sure I look like "that mom"... the one who carries a gallon-container of purell and won't let strangers even look at her baby sideways.  And heaven forbid that baby should bonk his head!  Oh no!But in all seriousness, as ridiculous as it might look with its big fluffy pillows and multitude of pockets, I love it so much.  I bought it when my son was six months old and about 20lbs - too big to be in the sling for long periods of time without killing my back, but too little to hold himself up very well in the cart.  We've been using it for about a month now and I still love it.  The side pillows are bulky enough that they take up the space on either side of my son and I don't worry about him flopping over.  The safety strap is completely detachable, so I can thread it through both the cart and the cover and buckle my son in securely.  The toy tethers have strong velcro and we have yet to lose a rattle.  I also love that everything is a little padded, so if baby falls forward or to the side and bonks his head, at least I know he won't get a nasty gash on his forehead.  It's also relatively easy to roll up  and toss in the car.  Installing it is simple too - I just set it in the cart, unroll it, put my son in, and then secure everything with the velcro and the buckle.  So far it fits on all the carts we've used except Michael's craft stores... their carts are way too tiny.At the risk of looking like "that mom," I will continue using the cart cover for several months and for any subsequent children we have!
