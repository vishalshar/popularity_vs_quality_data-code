I returned the Chicco Capri to order this stroller.  It just arrived today and I am totally pleased with this product so far.  I was hesitant to order it online because I like to see things and try them before I buy them but I went for it and it is everything I thought it was going to be.  The seat is well padded, the recline on it is great (it reclines almost fully), the basket is a nice size for an umbrella stroller and the canopy is awesome compared to most umbrella strollers.  One of the main reasons I returned the Chicco is because of the flimbsy canopy that didn't block anything from the baby.  It was just a piece of material that basically sat over the baby's head on two pieces of wire.  The canopy on the Swift blocks the wind/sun from behind - big plus - and it seems sturdy to me.  I think investing in a UV shade would be wise, because the canopy is a bit short in the front if the sun is head on.  The wheels are rubber (as opposed to the Chicco's plastic wheels) which seems to make a smoother ride.  Also, the color of the stroller in this picture does it no justice.  The actual color is a deep navy which appears almost black (until in good light) and the blue stripe on the seat is a very, very light blue and the trim is in a light silver.  It looks very nice!  I can't wait to start using it.  It's lightweight, breaks down easy and it's going to be the only stroller I use from here on out.
