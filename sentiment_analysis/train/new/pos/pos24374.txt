I used this for our toddlers when all we had was a stand up shower and a tiny bathroom. It fit perfectly in the shower, and I could fit both kids into it without it being too close for comfort. It folds up in a manner that doesn't require you to wait for it to dry first, and it won't get funky. I't like an inch and a half thick, so it slipped between the wall and our toiletry shelf nicely, out of site and way. They accidentally sent me the blue one first, but I called and explained, and they exchanged it with no problems. Worth the money. I highly recommend it, especially if you are living on little space!!
