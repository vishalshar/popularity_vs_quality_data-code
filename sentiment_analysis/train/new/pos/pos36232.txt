My baby and I have enjoyed this carrier.  It might take a while to get used to putting it on correctly, but overall it's been pretty comfortable for both of us.  The baby especially enjoyed sitting with her face out.  My back, however, hurt when the baby reached 16 lb so I couldn't walk with it for long distances.
