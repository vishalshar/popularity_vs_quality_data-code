I really like these better than the arm and hammer pacifier wipes. They don't dry out nearly as fast and they smell like apples not like cleaner. I keep them in the diaper bag to wipe off pacifiers, toys, yucky hands and even myself after nursing so that I don't smell like milk. Makes me feel better than using baby wipes and hand sanitizer wipes  which make anything that goes in the mouth taste nasty. a little pricey but great to keep in the diaper bag for when you just don't have access to soap and water on the go for a quick drop of a pacifier on the floor.*However- I am not saying these are an alternative to washing your babies pacifiers, bottles etc. ever, but they are handy for us newbie mom's on the go when your baby drops his pacifier or tether on accident and you don't have a back up!
