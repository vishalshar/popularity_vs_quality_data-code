I am going to gush about this seat!  I haven't been so pleased with a product in quite awhile. I am a Mother of three Young and Energetic children. Where was this seat with the first two?!?!  My first child I bought an Evenflo wooden high chair that was supposed to last.  My first one was hard on his seat though and it didn't make it past the culling when it moved.  For the second I think we purchased another Evenflo high chair , this time a plastic one, a regular one. Almost as soon as I got it into the house I began loathing it's Big plasticky Tackiness. Not so with this Delightful Booster!  I literally just set it Up and my Eighteen Month old son (  who is HUGE by the way ) and I can't stop fiddling with it He climbing in and out while the Other kids bask in the Glory of a purchase Well Picked!!!  It isn't often a retail purchase makes me feel so good. It might not be for everyone because everyone's taste is not just the same. We are going to be happy with this for the Day. It will probably make me smile each Time I glance on it from now until babe outgrows it!
