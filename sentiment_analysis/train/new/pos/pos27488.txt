This drying rack is surely more expensive than the others on the market but I find it very practical = once the bottles are dried, I fold the rack flat and put it away in a cabinet, under the sink.It can comfortably dry 4 "Born Free" bottles (with attachments) which are quite wide compared to the Beaba ones. I have been using this rack for about 2 weeks (age of my newborn daughter ^-^). The colours are vibrant without being too girly (IMO) and the drying rack seems sturdy. So far I am very happy with this purchase.
