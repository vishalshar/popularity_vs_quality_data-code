I cannot say enough great things about these blocks. They are sturdy, colorful, and very educational. My middle schoolers are using them to learn Korean. They like to play a game where they each pick a block from the pile. They take tines asking each other what the symbol means. If they answer correctly, then they keep the block. The one with the most blocks wins. After that they use their pieces to jointly put together the puzzle on the back. It is a lot of fun, and feels like play instead of learning.
