I went through all the reviews- I definitely didn't want to spend a fortune, but I wanted something that would work!These are sleek & attractive, simple & black. I LOVE how they only go about half way up the back of the seat so the car seat covers them up. The material is thick & durable, very good quality- they will do the job for sure! I like the little pouch in the front to store tissues or the emergency type wipes & as many people said, that little flap is keeping dirt of the edges of the seat from yucky shoes.I couldn't be happier- & they were a great price, seemed to be in the middle to low range. I would absolutely recommend these as the number one pick! I have the same brand with the super short back & that's why I went with these also- it was the height of the back that I wasn't sure about. For car seats, this is the perfect size!
