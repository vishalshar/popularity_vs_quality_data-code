I really like this bookshelf and I was just thinking to myself last night how glad I am I got it for my two-and-a-half yr old son. It makes him much more interested in his books because he can see them better. He gets them out all the time now whereas he rarely did before. And the extra storage at the bottom is really really nice because we have very limited space. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the books lean forward a little bit and I'm a perfectionist so it bugs me, but not enough to not be glad I bought it. Maybe we just have taller than average books?I am very VERY happy with this product and highly recommend it.
