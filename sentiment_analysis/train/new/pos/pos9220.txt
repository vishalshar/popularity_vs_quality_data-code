We are happy with our new stroller. With the addition of our second daughter, we needed to upgrade to a stroller big enough to carry both children.  We bought the doubles kit and the travel system to put the infant carrier from the car to the stroller.  The stroller is compact and well made.  Fabric is sturdy and appears to be durable.  We travel via airplane frequently and needed a stroller that is relatively compact and lighter in weight.  We also like that the wheels will allow us to take the stroller on trails.  A couple of wishes would be that the stroller would collapse completely when the travel system and the double seat are installed.  Winters are cold, and standing outside attaching both pieces to the stroller before putting any kids in is not the best. The travel system is works very well. Another wish would be for a little more leg room for my toddler while she is seated in the rear doubles seat.  Overall, we are pleased and would recommend the Navigator as well as other Phil & Ted's products
