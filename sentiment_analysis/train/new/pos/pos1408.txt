My son is 20 months old and he loves the Infantino puzzles. We bought him 4 of diff types of puzzles since they were a very good price. He loves all.For this puzzle, he still doesnt put the colors together yet. Every kid is diffrent. My friend's child of the same age can name the colors and put them together. My son however does match the texture puzzles in this set. Its amazing to me how he was able to find the furry, bumpy, scales, leathery ones together. He can also piece together the rainbow colors and the butterfly colors because they are more vivid, bright and colorfull. The solid pink, orange, green, blue, black, yellow etc is really not his 'thing' yet. But all in all its great. Maybe those solid colors are not interesting yet for him :)I see comments on how the textures puzzles are fewer than expected and I think its not so true. I believe I saw a crocodile, a fish, a lizard, a rabbit, a mouse and couple more. Thats a lot and its good enough for the prize.The quality itself is pretty sturdy. Lot for my kid to learn and its a fun activity to get down on the floor and play with kids. We have other kids over and they sit down and all group together. Execellent for playdates too. Kids are encouraged to play as a TEAM to put together things.All in all excellent purchase.
