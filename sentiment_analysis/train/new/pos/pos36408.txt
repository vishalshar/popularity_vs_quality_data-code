I didn't have any of the problems that others have reported.  pic quality is a about a 7 of 10 compare to a $400 lorex unit so I don't see a negative here.  range is as good as the expensive lorex that I also own at about 150 feet throughout my house of 2 stories.  zoom has better pic quality than full view which is strange for digital units.  design is smart and light.  others might  have set the timer to turn the unit of without knowing.  please read the manual if you are not sure.  I didn't have to refer to the manual because the unit itself is so simple to use.
