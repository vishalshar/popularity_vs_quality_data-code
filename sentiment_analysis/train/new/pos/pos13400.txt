It's not often that child car seats designers and manufacturers come with a product that is functional, sturdy, comfortable and seamless and with the highest safety ratings available. Add to that a great selection of colors and designs and you have a product Graco will have a very hard time to repeat and other manufacturers will scramble to imitate. This is the best toddler seat available in the market, unpretentious and yet with the highest quality and at a very affordable price.Some people complain about the padding and I don't see how this will be different from the kid seating directly into the car seat and not on the booster. The padding on the booster is not less than what an average car seat padding or cushioning offers or even more. Who doesn't feel uncomfortable after seating on ANY car seat after four hours? Even the most comfortable seat will put any decent rear end to test after so much hours sitting. In any case, my daughter has never complained on feeling uncomfortable on this seat even on very long drives. Granted, every kid is different but remember, kid's very young bodies adapt much better to any position and what would seem uncomfortable to us it may be just fine for them. I would say ust test it and don't judge the padding before using itIn any case, I doubt you'll find another great booster seat at this price. I also have two of the high back models and they are the same greatness as this one but with the added benefits that if your child fall asleep, it will support her/his head from moving to the sides, great for long night time tripsDid I mentioned that removing the seat cover, washing it and installing it again is a breeze? I cannot praise this seat more, great job Graco!
