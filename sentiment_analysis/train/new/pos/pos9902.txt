Assembly: The stroller took 10 minutes to assemble, not many parts to put together.Features: The clear look through panel near the handle bar is a really nice option. The stroller is very lightweight considering all the storage. It has storage underneath, 2 detachable fanny pack sized bags (one for each side), two cupholders for the adults, and one cupholder plus a tray for the little one. It is nice to have an umbrella stroller that has both a canopy and reclines. It reclines at about a 35 degree angle, more than enough for the little one to get some rest. The canvas is of good construction, it feels a little flimsier than my nice Safety First travel stroller, but that seems like it must have been part of the tradeoff for making it light weight.Cons: My only complaint is that the locking mechanism has to be manually swung around to get it to lock. Also, it folds more like a travel station stroller than a traditional umbrella stroller (i.e. handle and wheels pointing down, center of stroller at the top when folded up.I give it 5 stars because given the price point, this stroller is an excellent value.
