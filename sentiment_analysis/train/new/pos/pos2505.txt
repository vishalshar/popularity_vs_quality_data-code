This is my favorite stroller! We also have a larger jogging stroller that I bought before baby arrived now we only use our versa and Love it. It works perfectly for the urban life we live over seas where everything is smaller so I need a compact stroller but still need storage for carrying back all our groceries and getting in and out of the smaller shops and cafes. I go everywhere with it and the storage is wonderful the basket can hold a large diaper bag plus a lot more. It's so easy to pack up you can do it one handed. Love that it has the parent facing option my little one likes to look at us while we are walking around. My son loves this stroller he has taken 3 hour naps in it and been cozy the whole time. I give baby jogger a 110% on making this city versa. Perfect for the Mum on the go and shipped to England in less then a week!
