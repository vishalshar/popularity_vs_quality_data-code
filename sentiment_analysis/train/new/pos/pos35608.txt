This cup is adorable and of exceptional quality, in my opinion.  It is a small cup, so any baby or toddler should love it.  It is lined inside with pale off white thick plastic type material which is great because I have seen silver plate babycups show 'pitting' in the metal inside the cup with age/usage.  Pitting will not happen with this cup; the fixed lining s/b easier to wash and maintain too. Which makes this high quality.  It's very shiny and the plastic sip lid fits tight and is good quality sturdiness.  I purchased this cup for my niece's baby boy and had an 'H', his initial, engraved below the darling embossed bear.  Best baby gift I have ever given.  You will not be disappointed with the purchase of this cup for the special little one in your life!
