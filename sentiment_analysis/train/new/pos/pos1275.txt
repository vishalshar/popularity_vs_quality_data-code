We love these coated lunch bags by Mimi the Sardine. This is our second one (we have one for our little girl too). They are really well made and LAST. They are a good size for carrying the little one's meals with us, not too big and not too small. Love the zipper on top too, keeps everything inside even if it gets loved around in the car or stroller. Worth the extra money for this quality item.
