Awesome... Highchair/ booster. We use them daily as highchairs because of the ease of cleaning and they take up less room. They are Portable to take on vacations or holiday dinners @ the relatives. I now own 2 of these,(have a 2 year old & 3 1/2 year old using them) I bought the first one about 3 years ago, second one last year to replace a different/newer model that turned out to be junk. Great from about 6 months and my 3 1/2 year old (32 lbs.) has plenty of room. Adjustable tray 3 settings, also can be used as a booster, so they feel like part of the family up to the table. Better than the newer swing tray models by far.
