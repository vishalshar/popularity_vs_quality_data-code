I am a first time mom and bought two kinds of baby scissors. These scissors work very well for my young baby - I tried Piyo Piyo, but they are not as safe for infants - it's easy to go too far and nick the flesh of the most tender fingers... to make the long story short, a family member nicked my baby's thumb trying their darnest to be careful with the Piyo Piyo... I nearly fainted!  Luckily it was not a big deal and the baby did not budge. The blades of other baby scissors are simply too long, and the rounded edge does not prevent all nicks. The Pigeon has very short rounded blades that accommodate the size of baby's fingers much better and this really makes a difference when you are trying so hard to be precise trimming those tiny kitten nails. Did I forget to mention that this is hard to do even when the baby is not squirming a lot? Take a breath and your hands will be steady! If you're looking for baby scissors, get these right away.
