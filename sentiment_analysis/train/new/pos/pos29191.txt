What a sweet keepsake I now can cherish and pass on for generations to come! I've been searching high and low for something that I felt wasn't too girly for my little man for his Baptism. I finally found this beautiful Stephan Baby bonnet.  This Stephan Baby bonnet came in a sweet little gift box, with a nice prayer and saying. I already tucked ours away in my sons memory box. It was so cute for the occasion. Everyone commented about how cute he looked in his bonnet and how much they loved it. Even our priest said he loved it! The bonnet has a nice ribbon to tie under babies neck. My son is just turning 8 months old and it fit him perfectly. It has a beautiful cross embroidered on each side. and an embroidered border around the edge of the hat, and two bows on each side of the hat, and a bow in the back. I am so glad I purchased this hat, it was worth every penny and now I have something to pass on that my sons can use as a hankie in their pocket at their wedding or to pass on to their children. What a beautiful keepsake.
