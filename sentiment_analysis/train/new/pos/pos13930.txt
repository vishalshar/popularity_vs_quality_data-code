A friend of my mother, whom I had never met, sent this to me.  She told me in her card that this item had saved her many times when she couldn't get her Grandaughter to sleep and that it was a life saver.  I didn't think much of it when I recieved it and frankly, I thought that it was just a fancier swing-type chair but have since learned that this is so much more than that!When I brought my son home from the hospital, we learned that he had colic. Nothing would get my son to stop crying at times and being a new parent this was heart breaking.  Two weeks after he was born and in a desperate panic to stop his crying, my husband put this together (not hard at all) and my son responded to it immediately.  It calmed him down and then put him to sleep(never played the music on the unit because he didn't like it.)  My son spent the majority of his days (and nights) in this glider, until he was about 4 1/2 months old.  We would literally let him sleep in this overnight and we would get anywhere from 5-8 hours of sleep.  This was truely the BEST gift I had recieved and had decided that whenever I know someone having a baby, I'm going to "pay it forward" sort-to-speak and give the glider!!  It's worth every penny!
