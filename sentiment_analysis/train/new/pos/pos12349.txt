This high chair is superb. It acts as a high-chair, a swing, and a recliner. My toddler daughter still enjoys this chair tremendously, despite not having liked the swing mode when she was a baby. From a parental point of view, there are many positive features, and a couple of negatives. We have been using it for 19 months without any major issues, and I think we will be able to use it for at the very least another year. I bet that we will be able to sell it for a substantial amount when we are done with it, because it has held up REALLY well. We're clearly big fans of this product, and we went on to purchase the car seat, which has also turned out to be a fantastic product.Positives:The chair and cover are easily cleanedIt is solid and well designed so that it won't break or fall overIt folds up to occupy very little floor space (this was really important when we were in a small apartment)It looks and feels great (it feels like soft padded leather, not plastic or imitation velvet like so many others)The table surface is easy to cleanThe design of this unit is spectacular, and it's really well thought outNegatives:The removable tray has plastic alignment pins that don't line up well with the handle bracketsThe rotating plastic pieces that the plastic alignment pins fit into are cheap and often partly pull outThe locking mechanism on the wheels is sometimes difficult to release when moving the unitThe levers on the sides for unlocking the base (so that it can fold) are difficult to activate
