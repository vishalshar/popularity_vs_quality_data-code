I love this set! In response to the lady below, yes you can use it for a newborn. We have been using this set since our son's birth. We use the comforter as a play mat now, but plan on using it as a blanket when he is older. We have had no problems with the headboard bumper either. It ties very secure, and there is plenty of room in the crib, our son doesn't even come close to touching it. I was so excited to get this set. It is a great value for the money. I love the colors and jungle theme, they will work well for a boy or girl. I especially love the light. It is not too bright, and perfect for late night feedings! I also love that it shipped to our APO. I would recommend this to all new moms!
