Tproduct worked great for us because we have a small kitchen and with the rubber feet I felt safe sitting my son in it while he was supervised. It is very simple to clean off and seems very durable. The only downfall to it was that by 7 months our son figured out how to pull the tray from the sides and knock the tray off it, making it unsafe to sit in.  Many of our friends were impressed with the look and color choices that they have bought ones of their own.
