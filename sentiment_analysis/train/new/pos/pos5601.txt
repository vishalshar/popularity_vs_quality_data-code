I had been looking for this all over town, desperately trying to replace our original after it had worn out after nearly five years of use. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and chuckled at the thought that "you can't always believe what you read." I have no idea why so many folks seem to have a problem with this. Sure, you have to keep the water pressure down, but think of it as a low-flow, water-saving device. Besides, how strong of a spray do you need to rinse off a baby/toddler/preschooler? As far as fitting it onto a bathtub fixture, just be sure you're using the correct gasket and fitting the cup completely over it. It takes a little "elbow grease" and getting used to, but for me, the fun the kids have and the ease of use I have make it worth it.
