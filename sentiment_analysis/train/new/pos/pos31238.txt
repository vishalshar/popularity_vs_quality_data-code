I bought this product in the store before reading reviews. I considered returning it but decided to try it out anyway. The instructions say very clearly to not put your child in unless they can sit up by themselves unsupported. My son cannot but has become very unhappy lying on the floor and always wants to be on his legs. We put him in and sure enough he could hit his head into the toys (we didn't let him though). So we removed the toys and put a blanket around him for stability and he loves it. I placed a rattle in the tray for him to play with. The tray also has buttons that light up and play music that he can press.I can't believe people are giving this a bad review when they clearly didn't read or decided to ignore the instructions. If they can't support themselves then they will hit their head into any toys on any saucer, not just this one.My nephew, who is old enough for this, loved it and was occupied for several hours. My son loves being in the "modified" version that we made for him. So please, just be safe!
