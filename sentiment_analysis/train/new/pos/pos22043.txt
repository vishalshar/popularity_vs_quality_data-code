Great design. Locks into position (the teat won't go deeper into the mouth and choke your baby). The silicone is thicker than average (perhaps that's why a reviewer here said it is stiff). The teat is also much wider-sized. It was delivered to me before the estimated time of arrival. Many thanks to the guys at OTCRX4U, because I really needed the teats a.s.a.p.Two complaints: a. There is no size number on the package; all I got is "6+ m" (What is that!? Not all babies grow alike, you know? I ordered a size #2 fast-flow pack, but I don't know if I really got one; I am unsure because in comparison, the NUK size #1 I already have is waaaay much smaller in width and in length; if what I have is really a size #2, then I can't imagine how big a size #3 would be); and b. there is still (as of year 2010, All Rights Reserved) no indication on the pack for the correct up/down position for the teat to new users (I had to figure it out by experimenting my first NUK teat on my child!).
