My daughter loves it. Almost an all-in-one toy.1. Peek a boo flap and embroidered details and textures that works like a "book"2. Tuggable leaf shaped teether for her to chew whenever she wants3. Can be easily attached to the stroller with the strapTraining her to read books from young, making it her habit (haha)....Below is another peek-a-boo book that you may want to consider:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043D28B4?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B0043D28B4&linkCode=shr&tag=swiclu-20&linkId=PZFCK7ML5RMS4RHBSharing is caring,Cheers!
