I love this carrier so much! I'm a plus size mom and did a lot of searching to find a carrier that would fit my size 28, 4x body without needing an extension belt. The boba definitely fits the bill! I have about 4 inches left in the waistband before I outgrow it. I love that it comes with a little snap in insert for use with smaller babies because that means I don't have to spend more on a separate one like you do with other carriers. Also, since it's like a butt pillow, it doesn't surround the baby and helps keep them a little cooler than a full wrap around the baby insert would. I've been using it since my daughter was around 9.5 pounds (she was 8lbs14ozs at birth) and I haven't ever gotten sore shoulders from wearing it. She's over 14 pounds now and almost ready to stop using the infant insert. She loves it and I get a ton of compliments every time I'm out with her because it's such a pretty carrier. I recommend it to all of my friends.
