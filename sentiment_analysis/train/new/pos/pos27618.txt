The butterflies were great, they are pink (in the picture they look a little purple) They have little sparkly stars and moons on them. They hang down  about 12 in. from a white plastic ring, they include little screws in package. I scrunched down one a bit and was able to get it back in shape with no problem. I would recommend them.
