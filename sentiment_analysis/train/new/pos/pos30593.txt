WORKS GREAT. I was skeptical, only saw a few reviews that mentioned it working with other bottle types. I gave in and used ebates with coupon on diapers.com (since you can check out with amazon there as well woohoo) to get the actually cup and straw replacements that go with these since my kid will get there eventually.I got these to help transition away from the bottle... so far so good.They work excellent with Dr. Brown WIDE MOUTH bottles
