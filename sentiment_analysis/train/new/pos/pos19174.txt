i really wanted to say this is a 5 star product but there are two things that prevented me for so doing:1) i wish they were a little bigger (they measure 5 1/2"L * 7"W-chest coverage)2) the material used for the decorations allow for big spills to run right down the front rather than be absorbed- which is really the purpose of putting on a bib in most cases.so if you are looking for a cute bib for light spills or drools-this is it; if not try elsewhere.personally i still love the "green sprouts Basic Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bib 5 Pack" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002F9MV74/ref=wms_ohs_product) for absorbency and coverage (but they have back velcro closure) and also my new favourite "Neat Solutions 3 Pack Applique/ Print Interlock/ Knit Terry Pullover Bib" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CLYYQE/ref=wms_ohs_product). these are by far better choices for new self feeders :)
