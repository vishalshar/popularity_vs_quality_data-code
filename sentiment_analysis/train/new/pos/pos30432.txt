This was very convenient for my 5 hour flight with my 2 month old son. I did have a hard time getting it hooked in to the tray, its like i needed a third hand. If i wasnt flying with someone, it would have been very difficult to get it latched while holding a baby. Other than that it was great. My son was a little taller than the suggested height but it didnt cause any problems. When using this, do let the person in front of you know not to put their seat back, kind of an inconvienance for them, but luckily when i flew it was a sweet little girl sitting in front of me. My son definitely liked it too. It got a little hot on the plane and it was nice for him to not be right on me, but he could still look at me.
