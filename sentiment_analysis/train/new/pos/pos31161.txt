I have been pumping since my daughter's second day of life, because at first we had difficulty with her latch.  We have been giving her Playtex bottles for expressed breastmilk to supplement her nursing ever since.  It has been really nice for my husband and mother (who lives next door) to be able to feed her when I can't or don't feel like it.  I love that these nipples are wide like the areola of the breast, and they are easy to clean.  She never experienced any nipple confusion problems.  Overall our experience with the drop-in's system has been fantastic.  So easy to pump, store, and feed.
