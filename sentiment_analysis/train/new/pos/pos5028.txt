I have read the reviews about the size of this rabbit lunchbox and I think I may be able to clear things up a bit.  Let me start by saying that we have had this lunchbox for a year and are VERY happy with it! My daughter loves all things bunny and was over the moon to get this for preschool. We have found it very durable and I like that it is easy to unfold and clean. The fact that it unfolds to a lunch mat is nice, too.  Ok, about the size... It is definately too small for a lunch but works perfect for a snack! I think why so many people disagree about it isn't so much the size as it is the shape. The bunny head shape is very difficult to fit too much in. My child is not a big eater and I don't think I would be able to fit enough in it (with an ice pack and water bottle or thermos) for even her small appetite. I did give it 5 stars because it is adorable and (for snacks) it is perfect!
