This is the only cover I should have gotten.  I have a LOT of milk, and the plush covers just immediately get soaked.  This thing is a workhorse, and it's the one I use all the time.  It would be great if it also came in some cute colors, but I'm just so glad it's water-resistant!In response to the people saying it is not 100% waterproof- that is correct, but think about it for a second.  In order to be 100% waterproof it would have to be like a plastic bag, and that is obviously a safety hazard.  This cover manages to be water-resistant, but also breathable.  In my experience, if the baby gets a little bit of spit-up on it, you can quickly wipe it right off with a burp cloth and everything is fine.  If you don't get to it right away, or if it is a torrential spit up (the kind that soaks all the way through your shirt), it is not going to save you (or your underlying Boppy pillow) from that.  But that is ok, this still meets my expectations!
