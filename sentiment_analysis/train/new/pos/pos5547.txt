Love this console on my BOB Revolution. Fits perfectly even when folded. Had to read instructions carefully to make sure I had on properly.I knew when I bought this that the cup holders would be too small for a Nalgene, however I am happy to report I discovered it fits perfectly in the middle part of the console! Yay! When I have my Nalgene, I just use the cup holders for my keys, phone, sunglasses, snacks, etc.  I haven't been doing a lot of off roading so they have been secure in there.Haven't tried pump yet, but based on other reviews the trick is to "pull up". I recall reading this in the instructions, so keep handy in back of the console with the pump--which btw is not noticible at all when using the console.Minus one star because it's annoying to have to buy pricey BOB accessories. :/
