We swore we'd never be those parents, but our little kamikazi kid needs a leash sometimes.  Don't try to fool yourself by getting one that looks like a monkey backpack.  If you need the leash get the leash.  Our kid is much calmer when she's able to have a little bit of freedom to walk and we don't have to worry about her complete lack of survival instincts.
