As most people have stated.  These bags leak.  I have tried everything to keep them from leaking.  I love the convenience of pumping into a bag, especially while at work.  Otherwise I am washing several bottles a day.  However, since these bags leak, and are difficult to open and use.  So why 4 stars?  I came up with a way to use the lansinoh bags which have much better reviews.  You simply cut a small slit above the zipper in the lansinoh bags and use the adapter to pump into the lansinoh bags.  I provided customer images of how I use the two together.
