This is a beautiful bedding set. You get a lot of pieces for a great price. I was looking for Nursery Bedding that had a little red, pink and green at a fair price and didn't want to spend 200.00 for a nursery set. The material is decent and the set up looks stunning in my daughter's nursery. The price was the icing on the cake...VERY AFFORDABLE!!
