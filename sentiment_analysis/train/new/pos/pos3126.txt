I really like this stroller..it's lite and easy to manuver, easy to fold and it comes with a sac for when you travel... I bought this for a trip we are taking this summer...my 21 month old daugther fell in love with it the minute it arrived, now I keep it in the living room as she often sits in it to watch her favorate cartoon shows..my only regret is that I didn't purchase this sooner
