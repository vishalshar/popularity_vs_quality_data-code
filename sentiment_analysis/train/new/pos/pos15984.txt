Really good for security and deserves a recommendation, which I usually don't write.  I am using two monitors and several cameras for home security and I record everything since having my car vandalized.  They are indoor cameras, which I use indoors and also have some facing outdoors from inside the house.  They don't like dirty windows at night, focusing on the dirt found by the IR light.  Transmission distance from camera to monitor is adequate but I am at the limit and needed a second monitor.  I think that is a good security feature, as well as not being able to sync a camera to more than one monitor.  Immediately I was able to identify a problem situation outdoors which the camera had recorded and take action.  The recording function is the best feature for my use. You will have to be diligent about erasing to keep from filling the 32g card. They work best during daylight and are "soft" but adequate at night. The color is often odd, but the picture is good.  I put tape over the buttons I don't use to keep from turning on the lullaby, etc.The panning feature is available within the field of view only when you look at the 2x view, it gives you a closeup which you can pan within the fixed area of the camera's view.  Consider how much of the room you want to see when you place it.  The clip feature is very useful and allows you more creative placement options moving around the house as necessary.  The power cord is not long so you will probably need a surge protector.This is a good product with multiple uses, so I recommend you get a replacement from Amazon if you have a problem.
