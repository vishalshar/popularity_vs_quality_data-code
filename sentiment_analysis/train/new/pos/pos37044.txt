My son came home from the hospital with a bit of a flat head so I purchased this to avoid any further flattening. I used this regularly from when my son was a newborn to about 5 months of age (which is when I moved him into the crib from his co-sleeper). I found that in his crib he moved around too much for it to be safe for him to use.  The material for the pillow is velvet and feels very soft. Both sides have the dip in the center so you can use either side though the lion is only on one side. I used to put a burp cloth over the pillow for his spit up so it didn't stink. I did put the pillow in the wash and it misshaped it a bit but overall held up. Washing it cold and tumble dry should work.  Overall this pillow did help to avoid further flattening but I was only comfortable using it when my son was younger and did not turn and twist around much.
