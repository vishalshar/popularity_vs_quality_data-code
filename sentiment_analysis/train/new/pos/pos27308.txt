From other reviews, I knew this bag would require me to remove the wheels in order to pack the stroller. However, if you read the manufacturer's description, this is not stated ANYWHERE. That's quite misleading. In fact, the language they use leads one to believe you would fold the stroller and zip this bag closed around it.That said, I do like the idea of the bag even if the execution is a little un-user-friendly.Honestly, we're two adults with one infant, carrying a diaper bag and other needed items for a flight PLUS pushing the stroller PLUS carrying the bag for the stroller.Not exactly convenient.I know I don't sound thrilled, but here are the reasons I bought the bag:1) I don't want to own more than one stroller...so if this stroller is to travel with us, I want it protected. Most travel stroller fold inward so as to protect the seat, etc. The City Mini does not.2) Since the City Mini does fold inward, the belly bar I have on it for my son would be exposed to god knows what...he chews on that thing all the time and I want it covered when we travel.3) This is a pricey stroller and I don't want it damaged when we travel.  This bag allows for peace-of-mind gate check OR counter check if we don't want to bother with the stroller in the airport and sometimes we don't.So there are good reasons to buy this bag, especially if this is your only stroller and you travel a decent amount.
