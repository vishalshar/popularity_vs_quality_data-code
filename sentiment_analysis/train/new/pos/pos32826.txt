This is the BEST glass sippy on the market!! I love it, and the best part? We are gone with sippy cups as my baby is a big kid now and this is still an awesome cup, just forget the sippy spout and you have a big kid cup! I love nowing my kid was able to drink out of glass at all stages. We have had this a few years now and it is still his favorite cup, I am now going to buy the two pack of cups with out sippy lids from this company to expand his collection.  And wow talk about GREAT customer service! Shortly after buying it the sippy lid broke or tore is a better word, the company had me text them a picture and they sent me a new one said they were sturdy so it must have been defective, and they were right the second one sure has lasted!
