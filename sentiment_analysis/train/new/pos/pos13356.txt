I am always on the look out for anything turtle because it is my youngest son's nickname.  I was thrilled to find this, since I just built my boys bunk beds and they chose an outer space theme for their room.I chose to buy this one (a little pricier) after reading the reviews on the cheaper one I had originally put in my cart.Boy am I glad I did, since this one even comes with a bonus plush/rattling turtle.  Received in 2 days and in great condition.  It even came with batteries installed!  At around 4:30pEDT I tried it out in their room.  The Amber setting was pretty much invisible. The Blue setting was easily seen, but the Green setting was the best in the light of the afternoon.  I imagine that all the colors will be seen fine in the dark of the room.Love this turtle - it was worth the extra money (even not having seen it in the dark, yet!)
