They take a long time to get here, but they are wonderful! My Grandson was wearing them on a field trip with harsh cement terrain, and took off 250 miles an hour as usual. A couple were trying to hang on to their son. I told them "kneepads!" Mom says, "Great idea!" He doesn't mind them at all, and rather enjoys them, because he likes bouncing on his knees on the floor. I felt water in his knees before this. His knees were all bruised up. I jerry-rigged some socks waiting for the kneepads to arrive. By that time the water in his knees were gone, as were the bruises,  but he's great now with these kneepads!!!
