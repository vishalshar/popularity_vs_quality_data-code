This is a really cute simple rattle made for babies by Fisher-Price.  It doesn't do much, but its cute and colorful and the lion on the front moves around and that kept my granddaughter entertained.  There are beads that move along the circled top and beads that move throughout the inside at the bottom.  It is easy for a baby to grasp at both the top and the bottom.  It is really a simply made toy, but it is fun and easy to bring with you when you travel.  Its got a low cost and it keeps baby interested which is something I look for in a simple baby toy.
