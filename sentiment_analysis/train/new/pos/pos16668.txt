My daughter bought something like this on layaway at babies r us, it was going for a little over $700.  With Amazon we bought this wonderful well made, very sturdy  and beautiful crib, mattress that converts to toddler bed, 4 drawer chest, glider with ottoman, extra changing pad, crib fitted mattress cover for $824, and free shipping! Clearly the best deal was with Amazon, and this crib is beautiful, rich in color. Do not be fooled by the low price it is outstanding, well made and built to last for years. Babies R us charged my daughter a cancelling fee, and a restocking fee on the crib, a crib mind you, that wasn't even in the store. Save yourself aggravation and alot of money, Toys r us Babies r us, target and Walmart are a rip off, I will continue to shop for all my daughters baby needs right here on Amazon.
