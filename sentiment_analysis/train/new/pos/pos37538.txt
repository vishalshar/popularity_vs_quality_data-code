We follow baby-led weaning (aka infant self-feeding) so our son has been feeding himself with his hands since he started solids. I wanted to find a spoon that would be easy and safe for him to practice using to feed himself while he's still very small, but that he could grow into and continue to use for a while. This one is working great.My son is 9 months old, and so far I have just been loading the spoon with a bite of food and handing it to him to feed to himself. He can fit it into his mouth and doesn't have much trouble getting food off of the end of the spoon. The handle is a little long for him now, but he can grip it easily and it will still be a good length when he is older. He loves holding onto this spoon and seems to enjoy feeding himself with it. We have not used the fork or knife yet, but I can say that the tines on the fork seem just right. Sharp enough to stab a piece of food and pick it up, but not sharp enough to be dangerous. The knife is completely dull, but works to cut up something like a baked potato or omelet if your child wants to practice using a knife like the grownups.The quality is good. It feels like the set will hold up well indefinitely. Some reviewers have mentioned the curve to the knife. Yes, there is a curve to the knife handle. It matches the curve in the fork and spoon handles. It doesn't seem to me that it will make the knife either easier or more difficult to use.Overall, I would definitely recommend this set to other parents.
