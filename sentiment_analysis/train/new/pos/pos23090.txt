Purchased these because we liked the travel one so much!! Perfect sized spoons for little mouths and hands to grab. Soft silicone is a great alternative for warm foods not to burn the mouth. And with the silicone it makes it a nice gentle way to remove food from the side of baby's mouth without scratching their delicate skin. Just love it!!
