This chair is also made by Stork Craft. Everything on the box says Status, but in tiny print, it says manufactured by Stork Craft. We paid extra thinking that this was a different company. We didn't want to buy the Stork Craft after reading the reviews about the squeaks and the wood. We feel kind of duped.On to the chair itself. It's easy to assemble. The ottoman comes pre-assembled just like the Stork Craft unit. The size is fairly compact, so don't expect a huge glider. I'm 5'9" 160lbs and the size is great for me. The padding is ok. It could be slightly thicker. The arm rests are nice. The wood seems decent. It's definitely not high quality wood, but it looks like it'll hold up.The chair started squeaking on the left side after a day of use. I fixed it by spraying the 4 bearings with garage door lubricant. Now, it glides smoothly and no noise at all.
