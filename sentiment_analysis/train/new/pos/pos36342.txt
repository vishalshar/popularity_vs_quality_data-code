I tried three diaper bags before buying this one.I finally found THE diaper bag! It doesn't look like a diaper bag but it's really functional. I love that you can hang it on your stroller!PROS:- Insulated bottle pocket- Stroller straps for hanging the bag on your stroller- A lot of pockets (Inside and outside)- Nice changing pad included- It looks good and high quality- Functional- Big enough to fit a tabletCONS:No cons yet!  Just make sure the bag is not too heavy when you hang it on your stroller. ;)I highly recommend this bag, totally worth the price!
