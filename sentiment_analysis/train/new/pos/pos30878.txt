Love these cloths diapers! They arrived as expected and were in excellent condition. I bought 3 of these for my daughter who wanted to try cloth diapers and if she would actually use them. The price was VERY reasonable (I bought 3 for her baby shower @ $8.00 each) and the two inserts per cloth diaper are a very nice bonus. The inside of the diapers are super soft for a baby's tender skin. There is also a second gusset inside the diaper which makes this particular diaper better in my opinion. I say this because that will help to keep "yucky leaks" to a minimum. I truly wish these had been made 28 years ago when I was using the old fashioned ones with actual safety pins and rubber pants. Ha! Just go ahead and buy them. They are the best price and already include the inserts needed. A really great value!
