The uppercase letter play-mat is fantastic.  The foam is nice and thick and is very durable.  It beats an area rug for my baby to play on as it is very forgiving when he falls and also cleans up in a snap when he drools and spits up on it.  However, 26 pieces don't make a square so you pretty much have to buy another set to make a square mat.  One caution - if you are buying extra pieces to make a bigger, square, mat - the "puzzle' pieces Edushape Edu Tiles Puzzles, 10 Piece Set fit nicely and are the same thickness, color, and quality as the uppercase letters.  The "numbers" pieces, however are inferior quality (they are thinner foam) and the colors are off so they neither line up correctly nor match the color scheme of the uppercase letters.  If you need more pieces, buy the 10 piece "puzzle" set instead of the 10 piece "number" set.
