I bought two of these, one pink and one purple, for my twin girls.  They were just over 1 year old when I bought the mats, and I was looking for something to protect my wood table top from silverware dings/scratches/etc.  They had been eating primarily finger food off the table, but were starting to use silverware more often.  I didn't trust that they wouldn't just fling plates across the room, so I thought this would be a good way to transition to silverware.  They're just the right size for us, maybe a bit small for some people but perfect if you have a smaller table, and are just cushioned enough that they protect the table very nicely.  They can roll up the edges and lift up the mat, but it didn't take us long to teach them not to do that.  The benefit of these mats versus others (I also bought one of the green sprouts mats to compare) is that the mat doesn't slide on the table at all - it sticks very well to the table surface - and bowls/plates/etc don't slide on the mat.  The non-slick surface has made it easier for them to learn to use silverware with bowls/plates, since the bowl/plate isn't sliding around the table.  The last thing that I'll mention is that these mats travel easily - I just roll them up and put in a gallon-size ziplock.  The other brand mat I bought is more stiff and doesn't roll or fold well.  The only real downside that I can see to this mat is that the edges are not as raised so liquids will spill easier.  All in all, I'm very happy with these mats and would purchase again.
