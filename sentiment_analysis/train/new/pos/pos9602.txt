I ordered several calendars, since the photos and descriptions were not very helpful. I gave this one four stars because it will probably be going back, but nothing really "wrong" with it.The calendar itself is only one page and is hung from the center spiral binding, which I think is a waste. Only 48 stickers, including one for each month. Only one title sticker for each month, but, except for the first month, nothing is written in the designated block, so you could easily write in the month yourself. Squares are small, so the stickers would take up most of the space. Each month has a space for small photo and basic stats, favorites, etc.
