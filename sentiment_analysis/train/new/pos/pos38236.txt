I love that these have 4 sections. All the ones I find in the store only have 3 and take up more space that these. The only thing I don't like is that the cap is not as pictured. I had one that was on a hing like the photographed ones, but the ones I received opened in the opposite direction and were not on a hinge so you have to hold the cap to the side while you dispense. You get used to it, but it's still not what I was expecting.
