I am an exclusively breastfeeding mom and have found great use for these. These are really convenient to use because you can attach them directly onto the bottle that you pump into. I don't formula feed, but I use these attached to the narrower Medela breast pump storage containers. I just pump right into the containers, pop them into the fridge, and then screw on a nipple when I need one. Now I'm not dirtying up a breastmilk container AND a bottle anymore. Super convenient! They ones that look like this with the red base are a little more durable than the other kind with the tan-colored nipple. I've gotten both before - I think these may be a newer redesign.
