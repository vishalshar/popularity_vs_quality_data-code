I wanted to get a cute space shuttle bed, but realized two things: 1. I don't know if my daughter likes space as much as I do since she's only 19-months-old, and 2. I don't want to spend $2k on an awesome toddler bed (maybe later).So this is the bed that fit my budget and matched my bed and our daybed in style and color.It took me one hour and forty-six minutes from opening the box to throwing my toddler on the mattress. I'd say that if you didn't let your toddler put in the slats, run off with slats, have to breastfeed a baby, or eat a sandwich while attempting to put the bed together, it should take, oh, twenty minutes or so.What you get is a lightweight, sturdy, classy toddler bed that can hold a toddler (25lbs) and mom (120lbs) and a baby (10lbs). I'd suggest gently sitting down, moms. I haven't sat down in a huff yet because it creaked when I sat down the first time. It, however, handles my toddler's jumping just fine.The biggest pain in the neck was putting the slats in with the two side boards, but if you lay the bed on its side and make a fence, then tap them in one at a time, that should do the trick.Our chosen mattress was a My First Mattress also purchased on Amazon, and my daughter loves the combination. She also loves that she can easily get in and out of bed. It's her size.I was initially worried that she would hurt herself on the sharp edges at the end on the rails, but they are rounded, so I bought corner protectors for nothing (not really, I'm using them on my own bed).I've only had the bed for a week, but so far, it seems like a great purchase.
