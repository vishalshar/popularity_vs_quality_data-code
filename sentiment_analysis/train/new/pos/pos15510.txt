This crib set is gorgeous.  The cotton sateen is thick and a great quality.  Has a beautiful sheen, as sateen does, that brightens up any crib.  The colors are bright and the blue is a light aqua tone.  The cotton is soft and the quality is pretty apparent.  Definitely worth the money because these will hold up through atleast two kids.  The only thing is that the "mink" in the comforter isn't as nice as everything else in the set.  It's not as soft as I expected that to be, but not really a problem.  The fitted sheets fit my standard sized mattress perfectly and the cribskirt was beautiful.  I would recommend this to any parent looking for something that is gender neutral with a modern design.
