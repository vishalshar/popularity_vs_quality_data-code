As a new father, I use this warmer multiple times a day/night (I obviously can't produce the life-giving nutrients that my wife can). I've developed a love/hate relationship with this product, for the reasons listed below.Pros:- looks cool- does in fact warm the milk and bottle- it's easier than boiling water to warm the bottleCons:- takes around 3 minutes to warm a bottle with 2 ounces of milk (this seems like an eternity when baby is hungry and crying)- as other reviewers have mentioned, if you use a bottle with a larger diameter (Comotomo 5 oz bottle for example), the circular green plastic ring on the warmer will come out when you remove the bottle. This will cause you to curse the creator of this warmer under your breathe.- there's no audible notification that the heating is done (the light on front just goes off). So if you're walking around the house to try to keep your baby calm, you have to keep coming back into the room, to check to see if the warming is done.Ok ... baby's finally asleep. This tired dad is going back to bed!
