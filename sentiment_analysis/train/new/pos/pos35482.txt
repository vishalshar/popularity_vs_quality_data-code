We have been using these sea creature bath toys since our baby was three months old. She still loves them at nearly a year old. We've lost a few along the way but the remaining toys are in great shape. Their little holder works perfectly in our claw foot bathtub. We haven't had any problems with mold. They are a good size, nice colors, float nicely, and squirt a nice stream of water. Given their small size they are great teethers for those first few teeth too, when baby might have trouble holding some of the larger or more complicated teething rings or toys.
