I ordered this bag the week after our son was born and we take it EVERYWHERE!  We have used this bag for 16+ months now and that means EVERYDAY!  My son came to work with me for the first year of his life (a huge blessing -- I know) and the bag carried everything I needed...all of his stuff, my breast pump, extra bottles, my lunch, and even doubled as my purse for that first year (because you don't have enough hands otherwise!).  This bag is absolutely perfect and is still like brand new -- which is great as I'll be using it for baby #2 who is on the way and it will be used as everything once again!
