OK, so out of all these people who don't like these, some seem to be speaking theoretically.I have had mine for almost 2 years and have had kids using them from ages 9 months to 4 1/2 years old.The lids have always stayed on.  I have very curious and rough and tumble kids, and the tops don't accidentally come off, even when tossed around.  My kids don't even try to take the tops off.The lids have not broken with tons of use.Regarding the small one, I've never had the top fall off, even with much use.  Of course I wouldn't put anything wet into it and expect it not to leak in my diaper bag, but I've put ham chunks or cut up grapes and it is not a problem.These are a great product and for the money you can buy several and always find some to use!!  I am thinking of buying the munchkin kind just for variety and to see how they work in comparison, but they are almost 4 times the cost...
