This accomplishes what I need it to. I can see my grandson and tell what he is up to. I can tell if he is asleep, where his attention is focused, and if he is up to mischief (bottle upside down and leaking.)As to visibility - that is a function of car design and seat placement. I can see seat behind me clearly when mirror is attached to the passenger visor, but not passenger rear seat. Clipped to driver's visor it is a little annoying but I can see rear passenger side (where he sits).The reviews that discuss the quality of the reflection are perhaps asking too much of a $7 throw in the glove box product. I'm pleased with my purchase.Like other reviewer, I did experience the mirror "slipping" a bit. Piece of saran wrap around the ball, then insert into socket - fixed!Update: After 18 mos. use and abuse, plastic clip broke during prolonged freeze. Buyng new one. Still recommend.
