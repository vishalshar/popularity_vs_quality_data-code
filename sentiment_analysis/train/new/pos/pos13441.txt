The Lavender Lab was much bigger than I anticipated. He has lavender spots of the top of his head, the top of his back, and under his tummy. It really leaves a nice lavender scent lingering on the bed. I was a little surprised to find that the purple satin blanket the lab lays on is not attached to the lab in a permanent way. It is just attached with plastic tags, which I had to remove for safety. I'm not too disappointed about that, since it allows me to place the lab directly on the sleep surface as opposed to the scent having to get through the purple blankie, too. A plus is that you can bring the purple blankie that has been sitting next to the lab on car rides for better car napping without having to drag Lavender Lab along for the ride. He can remain at home preparing the bed for nighttime. I love our lavender lab and wish I had purchased him sooner. He comes nicely packaged in a sheer white bag that would be lovely for gifting. This is not just a night soothing solution for babies, but for anyone needing a bit of aromatherapy!
