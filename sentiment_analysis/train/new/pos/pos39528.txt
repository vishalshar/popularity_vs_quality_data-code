I was reading other reviews and I was a bit perplexed. This is an infant toy, not for adults. I bought 6 other toys for my 6 month old grandson and he loved this one. Lights, sounds, music, easy to hold. All of which were designed for a baby. I say it was worth the money, because of the way he enjoyed it. I know he will out grow it soon, but for now he really likes it. It's not high tech or had a billion things to do on it but it's a baby toy. I say thanks for keeping it simple, as he will no doubt be into that high tech stuff all to soon.
