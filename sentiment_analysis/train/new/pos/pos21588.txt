I wasn't sure about any covers even the coveted ones like thirsties until my son was actually born and I started using them and with the raves about thirsties I was very confident in their success but with bummis I was a bit nervous so I only purchased one and it was after I had already purchased all I needed and just wanted to give bummis a try and I have to say they were awesome!!! So petite ans perfect for little bums! Ugh I just wish it lasted longer than 3 weeks! My guy was 6-11 at birth and by three weeks he was almost 10lbs so it didnt last long but it was great while I had it. No leaks and full coverage. Can't go wrong with a bummis! Wish they made one size covers too!
