Initially purchased on Amazon but package was missing bag of screws and tools for assembly so wound up buying an open box return on an auction site. Nuna just came out with the bassinet for the MIXX this past summer and does not have a stand for it yet. The Jolly Jumper stand fits the MIXX bassinet perfectly. The only complaint is that when the canopy is attached to it, it's so heavy on that side that it tilts over that way. My concern would be that for babies with reflux, it would make it worse. Removing the canopy makes it more even but it seems like it would be a pain to remove and replace the canopy every time we took the baby out on the stroller. Otherwise, it feels safe and sturdy, and assembly took 10 minutes without issues.
