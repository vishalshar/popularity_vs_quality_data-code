I ordered these for the Graco Dream On Me 3 inch mattress. They fit better than other brands I've tried, that is for sure. They do leave a bit of mattress showing on the sides but that is okay since they cover it for the most part and I've had a hard time finding the "perfect fit" for this mattress. These sheets are not thick but not too thin, they wash up very well, do not peel, are soft and gentle feeling. I would order them again.
