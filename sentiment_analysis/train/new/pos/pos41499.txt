I use this organizer to hold my wallet, cell phone and lots of other items in my diaper bag.  I no longer carry a purse when I have to carry a diaper bag since I have this organizer that holds everything I need for me.  And by everything I mean, gum, lotion, hand sanitizer, a pill case, chapstick, single-use pacifier wipes, single-use Boogie Wipes, and single-use Wet Ones.  See what I mean about everything? :)  And my wallet is one of those long checkbook-sized wallets and it fits perfectly in the middle compartment.  It has a lot of compartments to make it easy to find things.I like that I can just pull this insert out of my diaper bag to grab whatever I need for myself without having to navigate through all of my baby's stuff like diapers, wipes, bibs, burp clothes, toys, etc.  You can imagine how much stuff I carry in the diaper bag for my kid if my organizer carries all that stuff I listed above for me (minus the Boogie wipes and pacifier wipes which are for the baby).  Even my husband has no problem retrieving something for me in that organizer unlike when he has to fish for something out of my purse.I recommend this to any mother who wants to organize and separate her stuff from her children's in a diaper bag or any bag for that matter.
