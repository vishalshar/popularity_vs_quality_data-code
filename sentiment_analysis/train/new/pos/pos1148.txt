Honestly, for what I paid, this chair is pretty dern awesome. It doesn't seem to be made extremely well, but it's not so rickety that I wouldn't let my 13 month old play on it. It's extremely padded and very adorable, it's just obvious that it isn't made by an expert craftsman. I'm sure if a larger, heavier child sat on it, it would probably come apart. The back isn't attached to the rest of the chair very well, but I backed the chair up to our fireplace so it doesn't really bother me. I only need this chair to last a few months, so it seems like it will serve my purposes. And my daughter absolutely loves having a chair that's just her size. I'm just going to have to keep her older sister away from it. All in all, it's a pretty good deal and it's much better than having an ugly Disney Character themed foam chair in the living room. At least this piece has some class to it and doesn't look juvenile.
