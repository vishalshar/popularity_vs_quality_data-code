In this video review, I show how this slipcover looks and compares to the original slipcover that comes included with My Brest Friend.  We tended to like this better for the reasons I explain and show in the video.  However, it's not really that different from the original slipcover so if price is a big difference and an issue, then the original slipcover would work just as good.
