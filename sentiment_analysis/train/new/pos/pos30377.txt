This product is awesome.  Some reviews claimed the plate was not the same the electric plates they replaced.  That was not the case for me, they were exactly the same size.  The product come with screws for two different types of installs.  One with a single screw in the middle, and one with a screw on the top and bottom of the plate.  For us, the screw was in the middle and the plate was the same size.  The product referred to the install with two screws as a decorative plate.  I'm guessing the decorative plate (with two screws) may not be the same size as this product, but I can't say for sure.  The product works awesome.  It is extremely easy to plug anything into the outlet by placing the plug in the slots and using the plug to slide the outlet open.  It is quite difficult to move the outlet into the open position using your hand without using a plug, which makes me feel a child would most likely not get it open.  We made an initial small quantity purchase to see if we liked the quality and look of the product.  After receiving it, we purchase quite a few more.  When I talked about the product to a co-worker, they asked what I thought.  Instead of telling them, I let them borrow one plate to see if they liked it.  When they returned it to me, they said they bought a whole bunch of them as well.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  It isn't that expensive, it is good quality, it is easy to use, installation was easy, and it give me peace of mind.
