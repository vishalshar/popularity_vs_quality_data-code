My granddaughter does not like the new silicone nipples. She used latex in the hospital but they are difficult to find. We were very happy to find the latex nipples on Amazon but not nearly as happy as she is! The latex is softer than the silicone and the Nuk orthodontic provide a slower flow making it easier for swallowing.
