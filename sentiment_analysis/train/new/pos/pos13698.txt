First of all, if you are trying to get a colorful laundry basket search some other place. These are too tiny to fit even a week's worth of clothes. However, these are great for organizing your kids toys...The orange is the tiny one that holds all my 2 yo's teeny tiny cars and can hold so many more! The purple holds his 20-30 tiny playdohs with all sorts of cutting, stenciling, and other tools for playing with play doh..The green we use to put all his plastic blocks as the bag that came with that fell apart pretty soon (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007GE75HY). And there is space to hold another 80 pieces in this...the last one holds his tiny flex balls for his clubhouse tent - holds around 100 (can hold more)...  These are just for you to get an idea of how much it can hold. Also, they are very colorful and light up the toy room with brightness. These are worth the price! The big bonus is that it is not in the least heavy, so my DS just loves to pick them up and dump them down - which is a play of its own (and work for the mom!) unlike having difficult to use organizers (his plastic blocks came with a zipper that he still finds difficult to unzip sideways and mom/dad always had to open it up for him to dump), too small bins that hold too little of anything and everything!!!
