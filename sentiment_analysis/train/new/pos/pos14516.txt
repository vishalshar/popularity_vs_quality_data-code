I'm only giving this 4 stars because I ordered these specifically because I wanted pink. The description never stated it being a random lot, so I thought I was purchasing pink. I was disappointed when I received them and they were blue. The item itself, are a great product. I love nuk products and these are the best size for my growing girls. Plus, I love the metal fork with the rubber handle. It's a good transition into adult utensils and a lot easier to stab food with then plastic.
