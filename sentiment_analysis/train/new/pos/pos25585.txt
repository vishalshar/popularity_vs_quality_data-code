I bought this after trying a ton of others and I was very, very pleased with it till I tried to buy the plastic probe covers. You can't find them anywhere. I also called Safety 1st and they couldn't help me either cause the product was to new and they weren't sure if it was going to stay on the shelf (whatever that means)I do like it and would like to keep it. The light is so nice at night and it reads in less then a second.SO I gave it a rating of a 4 only because of the trouble with the probe covers. I hope they resolve the problem soon...
