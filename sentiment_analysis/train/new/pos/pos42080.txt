I purchased two packs of the Toy Story 2 packs and one pack of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse 2 packs (the ones with the winnie the pooh photo that are really mickey mouse!) The designs were not the same in the two Toy Story packs one pack had a woody slinky and jesse print on a background of the print of woodys sleeve and a buzz lightyear one. The second had the same woody print and different variety of buzz lightyear. Very pleased with the color vibrance and designs on both versions and my boys LOVE Toy Story so they could care less if they were all the same. With 1 yr old and 3 yr old boys, the Playtex cups create a sort of "system" in your sippy cup stash. I got rid of the random munchkin and nuby and gerber smorgasboard that frustrated me so very much (the baby needed soft cups and the toddler needed bigger more sturdy ones) and bought Playtex Mighty Grips, Coolsters and Insulators. AWESOME!! Everyone knows kids hide their cups in terrible places and they get left there for weeks leaving the cup filled with a sticky chunk of stenchy milk curd or moldy sour juice. The Playtex cups and valves are completely cleanable with a simple bottle brush and nipple brush and can be sanitized to your hearts content. They are very rugged and are about 98% leak proof (there is not a cup alive which has an easy drinking flow and can also avoid leaking a drop or two upon being savagely and repeatedly beat upside down on the tile)I wish I had ditched the cheap crappy cups sooner- it is so nice to have a drawer with a wide variety of types and styles of sippys which all have the same valve and that valve can be bought in bulk on Amazon so that you have many many many of them at hand which makes grabbing and filling sippys to go a breeze :)
