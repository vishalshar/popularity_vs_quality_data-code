So I have a Medela double electric pump, which is awesome because it cuts pumping time in half. I bought this bustier (size Large, I'm a 38D) because I needed to be able to multi-task a bit more. The Pros: it fits well, and holds the pumps in place. I am able to attend to my kids while wearing it. I can read, fill out paper work, use both of my hands. The Cons: unless you are using a battery pack for your pump, you still need to be somewhat stationary and have the pump plugged somewhere. In other words, you can't just walk around freely all over the place, you are limited to the lenth of the cords. I work at a desk job, so that works out for me personally, but if I need to move from one room to another, it's not happening. Also, it takes a little time to put on and place the funnels into the "nipple holes" into the bustier. You have to try and do it quickly before a "let-down" (I got milk dripping everywhere the first few times I used it, because I took too long to attach the pump parts). Otherwise, this is a great product essentially to help you have your hands free.
