My daughter (4yrs old) loves these, we take them everywhere. They are perfectly sized for small hands. Easy to clean, dishwasher proof. Stainless steel seems good quality as no rust after being through the dishwasher multiple times. Only negative is due to the puppet nature the stems of these are quite wide so the do not store quite as easily as the other Tebimbi sets but still worth it.
