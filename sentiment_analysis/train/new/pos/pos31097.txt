Buying a parasol for a stroller is not an easy task. Most have mixed reviews (yep - I read them all) and since our stroller is not a known brand (it was purchased in Brazil) we were stuck with the ones that said "universal". To make matters worse I don't know exactly why but the pictures don't usually show the attachment piece very well, making it even harder to see if the thing will fit your stroller.I ordered the "Shadybaby" one and seriously, don't waste your time. That thing is crap. It looks flimsy, the attachment piece is of such poor quality that it broke when I was attaching it for the first time to the stroller. I didn't even leave home! We returned it, and it motivated me to write a review - the first one of my life - to make sure such a horrible product don't go unnoticed.But I digress - this review is about the lovely Inglesina parasol. Amazing parasol. It looks way nicer than the "Shadybaby" one. It is sturdier, the attachment piece fits perfectly and actually stays in place. It's shorter than the Shadybaby, which makes for better sun protection - the other one is 4 feet tall - what is the purpose? It has a movable coil-like part that makes for adjustment in every direction possible and the two-layered umbrella kind of diffuses the wind so it's not easily blown away. It comes with a nice package, which can hold the removable umbrella part. You can totally see why Italian design is so well regarded. It does not even compare to the other one and the price difference is about $5.00. Case closed.
