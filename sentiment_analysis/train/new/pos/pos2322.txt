Purchased this for my granddaughter's 1 year birthday. She loves it! It has lots of sounds and although I am very sound sensitive I do not find it too loud as other reviewers did, perhaps it has been toned down. It has a keyboard and it did not take long for her to make the connection. She loves to honk the horn. She raises the seat and places toys inside. It took a few weeks for her to master getting on and off due to her size. I think this toy will be enjoyed for a very long time.
