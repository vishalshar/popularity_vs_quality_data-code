Ordered it for my 18 month old, he is not yet ready :( But nonetheless we are using this as a stool to wash his hands over the sink, to brush his teeth. He likes to go Up Up Up n then Down Down Down :)Overall satisfying.. he did sit on it for more than an hour n we hoped he wud poop.. well he dint but thats not the story, I mean to tell its very comfortable to sit on it as he was happily sitting on it.Edited 3/21/2012After successfully training my 26 month old boy on this chair I feel I owe this product a review since long. Great Product, he has been using this for over 6 months now. Durable, easy to clean and music is ok. The music can be annoying at times as the chair is extra sensitive and keeps playing music due to other vibrations in home. But nonetheless, Potty Training Mission Accomplished!! I am not sure if the music helps in training (may be it did), but overall it seems very comfortable to sit n clean. And that all that matters :)
