AMAZING! my son is almost 7 months and we're still using it (although with supervision)this is NOT like a regular nursing boppy, it's a big pillow that nestles your babywhy i love it:great for preemies. my son was 5lb7oz and it was perfect. I think he loved it because it was cozy and kept him in a "tight" environmentit's elevated slightly so your baby isn't lying on their back and just staring at the ceilinggreat for transferring a sleeping baby. my son would fall asleep in it, then we'd move the boppy to his bed, and pancake scoop him out onto bed, easy transition!helpful for tummy time - forces him to work on his neck muscles since the center is dipped in but the pillow supported his check and pelvic areaeh...the lounger, when dirty does need to be cleaned, the down time it takes to clean it is tough since we came to rely on it so heavilythe covers are expensivei'd recommend this product to anyone. it gets great useage, and gives baby visibility to their surroundings. my son had a blast seeing his feet for the first time. when your baby outgrows it, make it into a dog bed! my dogs try to sneak onto it when the baby isn't in it.
