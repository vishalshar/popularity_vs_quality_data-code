We ended up just using the pillow and not using the whole wrap thing  cuz it was so bulky and uncomfortable. Especially during the summer time in San Diego, it was so hot It was impossible to wear. It worked well but it seemed like I was too much and a bit unnecessary. The pillow by itself works great. Started using it when he was about 2 weeks old and he's now 3 1/2 months and I'm still using it. I have the original ergo and the 360, the pillow works great in both. I use the pillow to turn him forward facing In the 360 so he can see what's going on, it works great and he loves it. I've seen some "life hacks" about just using a rolled up baby blanket or towel for the same purpose, I've tried that too when I forgot to bring the pillow with me to a BBQ at a friends and it sucked. Don't do that if you can help it. I wish they sold just the pillow part seperate.
