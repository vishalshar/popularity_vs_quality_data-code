Bought one of these three years ago for my first child's crib, and was so happy with it that we bought the queen size version for our bed, and another crib size for our second child who was just born.  The first one we bought, for my older daughter, has been washed once a week, at least, for three years and has held up extremely well.  No unraveling, no holes, no failure in the waterproof material. It has stood up to plenty of diaper leaks when she was an infant, and a few overnight accidents now that she's potty trained, and hasn't leaked onto the mattress once. Our queen size one has endured multiple spills and its own share of accidents since my daughter regularly sleeps in our bed when she is sick or napping.Unlike some waterproof mattress protectors, this is quiet, never "crinkly". When buying the one for our bed I was worried that my husband would feel it trapped heat and made him too warm -- he's one of those people who likes the thermostat at 68 degrees and will have a fan running and the window open even when it's cold out -- but he hasn't ever complained about this. It seems to be very breathable.  I'm happy that it is phthalate free, since I try to avoid questionable chemicals, and all of us have dust allergies, so the dust mite protection is great too. The only thing to be aware of is this is ONLY a mattress protector, not a mattress pad. It's very thin, so if you're looking for something that will add cushioning to the mattress, this isn't it.In short, this product delivers on its promises and it's very reasonably priced. No complaints whatsoever.
