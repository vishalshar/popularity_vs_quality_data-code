I bought this set as well as the "woodland animals."  Both sets are very cute.  I liked the look (cuteness) of these forest sets over any others out there. Both sets are easy to put up (although I had a little difficulty getting the deer in the smaller woodland animal set to look right, and the giant tree in this set to have the branches match up well).  I didn't completely follow the picture of where to place everything, and you do have some freedom to do that with it still looking great/works (I moved the fox to the ground rather than in the tree, and I placed some flowers, birds, and butterflies around the entire wall rather than directly on/around the tree).  I had no problem with the giant tree/animals set sticking to the wall.  However, the smaller woodland animal set will not stay on. I'm not sure why one set would be different than the other in adhesive.  This set is a 5 star product for the cuteness factor, easy to use, and stays on.
