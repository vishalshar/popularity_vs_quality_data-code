I purchased 2 of these fans to put on our Grandsons stroller when we went to Disney World.  He has very fare skin and over heats easily.  We attached the two fans on each side of his stroller and he was the most comfortable toddler there.  We were the only ones that I saw that had a fan!!!  We had people stopping us asking us where we got the fans and what a fantastic idea it was.  We even had some young adults stop us and give us a high five for the idea.  Thank you so much for the product.  Our grandson played with the fans and adjusted them where he wanted and I did not have to worry in the least that he would hurt himself.  Just to be on the safe side we would change the batteries each day because we would leave the fans on for the entire time.  Never had any problems.  Products arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I am always organized so I did have to bring a phillips screwdriver with us to ensure I could change the batteries everyday.  The battery cover doesn't snap.  It has a small screw that requires a phillips screwdriver.  So it you are out and about and don't have a screwdriver and need to change the batteries....then you are actually screwed!!
