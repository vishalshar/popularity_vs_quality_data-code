I recently purchased this car seat for my 9 month old who is 18 pounds and 28in long. I love this car seat. I looked over the other reviews and decided to try it anyway. One review said that the crotch strap pinches, but to me the strap seems plenty long enough. Others said that it wouldn't fit in their vehicles very well. I did have to put a towel under mine for the rear facing position and it seems perfectly safe. Others mentioned that it doesn't have the 2 reclining positions and mine did not either but it seems to recline rather nicely rear facing. Others said that it seemed their babies would outgrow it too soon. My daughter is on the 3rd slots but I think she'll be able to use it for a few years before she's too tall. The strap adjuster is very easy to use and I don't have to fight with the straps at all. Sometimes the straps twist but I have had this happen with many other seats as well. My daughter seems very comfortable in this seat. She has slept many times and doesn't ever complain. The cushions are great. I love that they are removeable and washable. I don't use the cupholder at this time but maybe in the future. Out of all the car seats I researched, this one seemed like a good choice for the money. It is very inexpensive and seems to be just as nice as the $300 ones. I got the ABBY design and it's so cute. I hope that others will give it a try.
