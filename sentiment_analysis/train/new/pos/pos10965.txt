I've been cloth diapering for 4 years now between my two daughters.  Of all the wet bags I've tried, these are by far the best.  I wash and dry them with the diapers, and they are still as good as new.  All of the other wet bags I own have either lost their waterproofing or had zippers break.  These are also the perfect size because they are compact enough to throw in a diaper bag, but also big enough to hold the 4-5 dirty diapers that I bring home from daycare each day.
