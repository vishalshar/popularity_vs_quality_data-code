It was pretty darn fun watching my baby learn how to eat with a spoon from this bowl. The "lip" did catch quite a few things that would have otherwise fallen on the table or in his lap. Note that the lip is rubberized and just a bit flexible, which is great. I don't worry about the baby hurting his face on it if he leans forward into it.The suction cup is good but not perfect; we have to reaffix it every few minutes. But in part that could be because our table is wood with a fairly smooth but not perfectly glossy finish. Probably like most tables.We wash it in the dishwasher and it has held up well over the last 8 months.It pairs nicely with a molded plastic "pocket" bib -- the food that he drops too close to his chest to be caught by the lip of the bowl falls into the bib. At least in theory anyway. ;)
