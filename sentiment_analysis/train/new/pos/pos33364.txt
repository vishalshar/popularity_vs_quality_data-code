I highly recommend this Potty because not only is it pleasing/fun to look at for both parent and child but it is smartly made.My son loves to flush the toilet-excited at the noise it makes-So how cool is it that this Potty has a handle that mimicks what happens when a real toilet is flushed! My son loves to pull it and listen to the cool sound :) .  I also like that it grows with your child until they are comfortable enough to use an actual toilet-Yep! It can be taken apart so that theres the part that goes over the toilet to keep them from falling in yet will enable them to use the big kid toilet. However, until that point is reached-the part that catches the poo/pee can be detached and lifted out with ease to get rid of in the actual toilet. I highly recommend this potty.
