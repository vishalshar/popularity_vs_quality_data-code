I did a moderate amount of research before purchasing this for my daughter at age 2.  (I did keep her rear facing in her infant car seat until then).  I know Britax gets good reviews.  We do like the "wings"-she can rest her head on them and nap for long trips.  The reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because the straps were very tight and it was tough getting my daughter in and out.  She weighs 27 lb at almost 3 years old (not very big).  I couldn't imagine how a 70 lb child could fit in this.  With a fleece or coat on it was almost impossible to get her in.  Then, last week-the plastic/rubber hugs strap thing broke.  So, I called Britax and told them about the broken hugs strap and also my difficulties with the too short straps.  They told me there are "longer straps" so they mailed me the "longer straps" and new hugs strap.  It was kind of annoying taking the old straps out and putting the new straps in but I did do it myself without having to call Britax for help.  The new straps do not have that cumbersome black/thin strap underneath that makes it hard to move the chest clip around.Bottom line: ask Britax for the "longer strap" so your 25lb + child can enjoy the carseat.  Register your product so Britax can help you ASAP when something breaks.We do like the Caitlin color, it's a pretty light lavender/grey.
