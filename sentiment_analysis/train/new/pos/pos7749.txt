I have one of these little child-size director chairs (all red with red mesh seat) from over 25 years ago that has my youngest son's name on it. I believe it was an offer via some product we had purchased . . . like cereal or something. The brand on the chair's tag was Tike Hike. When I looked that up to try and see if these chairs were still being made, Hoohobbers came up. I was very pleased to see that the same chair is still being made in many colors and a couple fabric choices. The original chair has held up great (looks like new) after over a quarter century of use by various little ones and now that we have a couple toddler grandchildren in the house, we needed another. I am very happy with the new chair (mesh fabric like my original and in primary colors) and it is virtually identical to the original. I'm thinking this would be an excellent choice for future baby shower or toddler birthday gifts. The 15-month-old and 18-month-old that toddle around this house love the chairs. They carry them around, sit in them, put toys on them - one puts the two together and uses one as a "foot stool!"  They will probably fit into them fine for, at least, another couple of years. Love the mesh because it is airy and super easy to keep clean. Have not yet used as a strapped-on-booster seat, but may try that out soon. Highly reccommend!
