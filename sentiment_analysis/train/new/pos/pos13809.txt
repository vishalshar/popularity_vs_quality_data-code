Not sure I am using these right, but they work great at keeping diapers clean. When my newborns wets or poops, the nappy liner catches it and saves me a diaper - cloth or disposable. I just reach in and swap it out keeping the diaper clean for 3 or more "catches". Hoping to potty train him soon, but these have saved me many diapers already. Ordering more now so I won't run out. Great price for the savings on environment and diapers.
