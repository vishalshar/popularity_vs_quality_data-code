Saw these toys online and thought they were fun with their different textures and colors.  I was surprised at how big it was, but pleased at how much cuter it is in person than it was shown online.  While my baby girl is too young to enjoy it herself quite yet, I am sure it will be one of her favorite bunnies.  If you watch on Amazon you can get this for a great deal a lot of the time too.  On a lot of sites they ask almost $40... and here you can get if for half that!
