I have been using Econobums for two and a half years and love them.  I'm a loyal die hard fan now.  I still have almost all of the initial order I bought at the beginning and am using them on our second child.  For all the abuse these things go through, the quality is unmatched.  I love the two piece combination in which I can swap out the insert when wet and use the shell again.  I have used the Fuzibuns which are one piece and it is too expensive and a lot more laundry.  I have recently started using the Best Bottoms and find them comparable to Econobums but more expensive.  But back to the Econobums...I did find that either they lost some absorbency and/or as my son got older and urinated more, I was having leakage problems.  The solution to this is to buy a booster pad.  I did not need these until my son turned two and believe the problem was really due to the quantity of urine.  The booster pad fixed the problem.  I bought this set for a friend and continue to buy these trial packs for my friends who have kids.  If you are dead set on using cloth diapers, buy the larger set that comes with three shells and twelve prefolds.  For one kid, I think you will need to have at least nine shells.  The more you have, the less often you will have to do laundry.
