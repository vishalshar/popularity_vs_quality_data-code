Had a problem with the unit upon receipt.  I cannot remember if the vendor exchange it or talked us through a reset of the pairing, but it was solid customer service as I recall.  The monitor was dropped on the "antenna" (just a decorative piece of plastic, really) early on.  That piece sort of floated loose but did not affect performance.  The actual antenna is just a bit of wire that does extend up into that plastic fa√ßade.  We usually kept both the camera and the monitor plugged in, but used either on battery power sometimes.  The battery life was always satisfactory.  The monitor just died and we will likely purchase another set and try to pair the monitor with both cameras.  Would have been nice if the time/date would have stayed set accurately, but it is a baby monitor and not a time piece.
