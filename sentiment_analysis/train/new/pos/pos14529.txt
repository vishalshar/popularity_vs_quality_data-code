I realize that when it comes to an item like this, it will never be perfect.  Thirsties Pocket All-in-One's have changed my opinion of cloth diapers, however.  I guess I had an image in my mind of sticking my baby with diaper pins, washing out soiled diapers in the toilet, and constantly washing diapers.  These are much more convenient then the diapers our mother's and grandmother's mastered.  I decided to switch when my 9 month-old had continuing problems with raw patches on his diaper area.  It started around the elastic and then spread, despite trying every cream or powder, Rx or otherwise.  I finally concluded that it must be something in the disposable diaper material.  I like the thought of saving the environment as well.  I started out by ordering one of each of the best reviewed brands.  When I had problems with leaks, I looked harder and found these.  They are cheaper (even more so since I don't have to order a separate diaper cover) and work just as well or better.  I like the leg gussets, although they sometimes dig into my little ones very chunky legs, they are great at preventing leaks.  I like that you can add extra padding for naps, nighttime or a car ride, and use as is for light duty.  My only small complaint is that they take a long time to line dry since the padding is built in.  It helps if you turn them inside out, but I still end up having to put them in to dryer to finish them up, which I hope does not make them wear out faster.  They seem to be very adjustable, which will be great when my little one starts crawling and thins out some. He is 24 lbs now and fills up the medium. I wish I had discovered them sooner.
