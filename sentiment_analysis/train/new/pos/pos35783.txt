First-off, the Diono Buggy Buddy is identical to the Sunshine Kids version. The company has simply changed its name.When I first saw this product I thought, 'What a great looking product, I wonder if it would fit my stroller?' Browsing through some of the reviews I found it difficult to see if my stroller would be compatible. I thought other parents would also find this frustrating so I browsed through all of the reviews and summarized compatibility reports (as of Apr/2012). I omitted solo reports so only reports of 2 or more are included. hopefully this helps.2 - BJ City Elite3 - BJ City Select33- BJ City Mini9 - BJ City Mini Double2 - BJ Summit7 - Bob3 - Britax Light6 - Britax B-Agile2 - Bugaboo Cameleon3 - Combi6 - Graco Ipo2 - Graco Duo5 - Joovy Caboose2 - Joovy Cooper3 - Maclaren Quest3 - Maclaren Techno7 - Maclaren Triumph3 - Maclaren Volo9 - Peg Perego Aria2 - Peg Perego Si7 - Phil & Ted4 - Quinny Zapp21- Uppababy Vista5 - WheelchairSome quick pros and cons:For ten bucks this is an excellent alternative to more expensive less convenient solutions. The buggy has lots of storage space including a zippered pocket.I should note that although the buggy works well for numerous umbrella strollers, it should be removed before folding since the wiring around the top does not allow for buggy to fold with stroller. Overall 90% of the reports were 4 or 5 stars with the negatives reviews primarily reporting problems with broken straps.
