This is a nice frame for baby's first year, month by month, pictures. It's a modern style and color, and just plain and simple and classy. It comes with pre-printed labels and some blank ones to make your own titles. I got two, one for each of my kids' first year pictures. I didn't like the other ones from Carter's, or others, that had a cheap silver look and baby themed designs, and I was very happy to find this one on Amazon. It was exactly what I was looking for.
