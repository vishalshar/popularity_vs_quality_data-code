This car seat, especially considering the price, is a very good car seat.  I haven't had much difficulty with the harness, and my nine year old son can buckle and un-buckle it with minimal difficulty (he did pinch a finger the first time he tried it).  Other than that, I love that I can adjust the strap height with a button in the back, and not have to re-thread the belts every time the baby grows.  I also really like how comfortable it is to detach the seat from the base.  I'm not sure how else to word it, I just really like where my hands go and how easy it is to pull the handle to unlatch the seat/carrier as I'm taking it out of the car.
