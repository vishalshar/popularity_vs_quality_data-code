This chair makes things really easy when you are on the go.  We used it for our travels to grandparents houses and it was perfect.  Fit on all the tables that we used and it was nice having my son right up at the table with us.  One warning is the chair is a bit heavy to travel with wish it was a tad bit lighter, and a little difficult to get off to wash. But once you have mastered taking off the cover it is easy.  I even use it at home sometimes too.  Definitely worth the purchase.  Glad we got it.
