I have been looking for a soft sided storage solution for the backseat of my car for quite a while now and never found anything. If it was soft sided, it was too wide to fit. If it was the right width to fit between 2 car seats, it was too short for the kids to access what was inside. If it was reachable enough it was hard sided and just not something I wanted. This is the perfect solution. It fits perfectly between 2 car seats, is tall enough for the children in those seats to reach inside, has a lid that attaches so it is not a safety risk, it has many convenient storage pockets including ones for drinks and on the sides that will be better when the car seats are gone, and is a soft sided carrier that you can even remove easily and carry with a carrying handle should you choose. It holds books, toys, drinks, and practically anything else you want to put in it making it a wonderful storage solution for the family on the go! I definitely recommend it!
