I liked the idea of the Space Saver for our 4 month old daughter because 1) we didn't have to purchase another piece of "furniture" to clutter up our already tight eating spaces, 2) it was dishwasher safe, and 3) it had reclining features and the tray adjusts to her size as she grows older (and chubbier, I suppose!).  Needless to say, this product satisfied all our needs.  AND, by far this is the cutest design Fisher Price came up with - gender neutral as well.  Things I discovered: it is VERY easy to "install" (if you call snapping a fastener to the back and under the chair "installing").  It is sturdy.  The cover is machine washable and can be removed/wiped easily.  The tray is very roomy for toys or keeping prying hands away from bowls filled with food.  Needless to say, we are 100% satisfied with this product: highly recommend.
