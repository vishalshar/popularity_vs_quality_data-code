I love this mobile.  It is very cute and vibrant.  My son loves it from day one.  He used to stare at it and smile when he was just a few months old.  Now it helps him to sleep.  Here are some information about the mobile.1.  It has a remote.  You have to make sure the RF is not blocked so it can reach the mobile.  I have it hung next to the light switch.  The light switch is about 5 feet from he mobile.  The remote can only turn he mobile off and on.2.  There are two volume.  Hi and Lo.  I use only the low.  High seems too loud since it's right near the baby's ears.3.  There is a little night light.  It's quite dim but it's good so it does not disturb the baby with too much light.4.  The mobile is very vibrant and eye catching.5.  There is a static ambient sound.  First I thought it was annoying.  But realized it's a great feature.  The static sound actually helps to soothe the baby to sleep.I will included a video so you can hear the music and the static sound.
