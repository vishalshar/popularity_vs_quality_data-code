Love it, but only used it for about 2 weeks before my baby decided he was ready for feeding himself chunks of finger foods instead of mushing it out with this so I did not get much use of it. It it good size for baby to grab onto, its fun to bang on the tray (and throw on the floor) :)It is easy to open and fill, it fits a lot of food but you dont have to fill it all the way for  it to work great, it is also easy to clean.DONT USE BANANA!!!as you nay find other people mention with not just this brand but all of the self feeder mesh products, banana is a nightmare to clean. I tried it anyways thinking maybe people were over reacting when saying how bad it is people said they had to just throw it out because the banana gets so stuck in the hols of the mesh. well I wish I listened I tried banana anyways and sure enough cleaning it out required two hour long soaks and me standing there for 30 minutes scrubbing inside and out. NOT worth it Bananas are mushy enough on their own to not need to be fed in this. However all other fruits and vegetables that we used I had no problem with cleaning, normally takes about 10 seconds to clean it. just no bananas guys. Love it, would buy it again if I had to.
