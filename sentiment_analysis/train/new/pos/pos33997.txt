I have been using this rocker for around 2.5 years for my son. i bought it for nursing but still use it to read/rock my son every day. I have it set up in my living room as we live in a small condo. It looks nice with my other furniture and doesn't scream baby rocking chair. It cleans up well with a little water and soap. I also purchased the matching ottoman which was a must have while nursing.
