These munchkin spoons are really good. I like them because they have a nice soft tip and they are gentle on my babies gums. It's also nice that they turn white when the food is too hot for your babies mouth.I got these as an ad on item on Amazon, they are a lot cheaper when you get them on Amazon then if you buy them and the store. They were about $2 cheaper. I like that they have multiple different colors you get yellow pink green and blue.I would definitely buy these spoons again, I am actually probably going to order another pack of them the next time I make a big enough order to do at ons.I paid full price for the spoons.
