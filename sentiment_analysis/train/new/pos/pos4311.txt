We use our "Fast Table Chair" every day.  We don't have a lot of extra space in our home but do have a center island that we can hook our chair up to.  This chair is very secure, comfortable for our daughter, and even though the fabric gets pretty mucked with food - it can be easily wiped clean with soapy water and a dish towel.  You can see in the photo that we also use a "tiny diner" mat that fits well with the chair and catches a lot of the food that would end up on her lap otherwise. Our daughter is now 7.5 months old but we used this chair as soon as she was able to keep her head up.  She started with a folded towel behind her back.  She really loves to watch me in the kitchen and with this chair she has a front row seat.  This is a must-have in my opinion.
