my baby wouldn't sleep at all until we purchased this. her hours of awake time were totally outrageous and sometimes they still are but she wasn't sleeping well at all until we put her in this and introduced some white noise into her life. she used to sleep less than two hours at a time. now she can do up to 8 hours straight.. she absolutely loves this. sometimes she fights it at first but you can tell once she is laying in it that the tight wrap is comforting for when no one is holding her. also our baby is a magician in getting out of things and so far only once has she maneuvered one arm out of this.
