I purchased these when we realized that we needed more than the one we purchased from BRU. These wash up pretty well and are fairly soft. I went with the terry over plush types because I've seen the plush ones pill up quickly. My only issue with this product is that my ring catches in the terry loops sometimes so I've got lots of little pulls in the terry. I don't have that issue with the BRU brand, but I also paid for 2 of these what I paid for one of those. Definitely a good product for what you pay for it.
