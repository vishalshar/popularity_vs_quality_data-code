We've been cloth diapering for over a year and have used this pail liner (in Quinn Plaid) from the beginning. It has held up EXTREMELY well to being washed (and dried in the dryer on low and medium heat) at least three times weekly. Unlike other wet bags I own, this did not "delaminate" when exposed to heat in the dryer. Excellent quality. Easily holds 15 pocket diapers and their stuffings as well as a bunch of cloth wipes (it could hold more but we wash every two days so the pail and bag are never completely full). We just put this in an open topped trash can and never have any stink issues. Highly recommend!
