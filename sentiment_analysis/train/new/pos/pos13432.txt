The velcro along the top goes from end to end and is a couple inches wide so it's thoroughly secured to the closet bar. I uploaded an image and you can see that mine is loaded up with clothes, sleepers, blankets, hats, socks and accessories in the pockets.The storage areas are pretty deep so I didn't have any trouble fitting everything in! The to two bins have a mesh barrier to keep socks or mittens from falling out. The divided bin is sewed in that way so it is not adjustable/removable.I'm very happy with it! It holds so much and is very large.
