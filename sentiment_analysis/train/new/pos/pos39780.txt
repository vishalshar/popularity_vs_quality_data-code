we only use the attachment for the double helix when the two kids are both asleep as the 3 year old typically uses the sidekick to ride on. love that we can add the helix extension, take out both car seats, snap them in and are good to go. dont know of any other system that can convert from single to double so easily. its is a stretch limo but it has saved our lives:)
