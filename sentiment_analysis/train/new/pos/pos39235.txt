I wanted to wait to do my review, that way I could give a good, accurate one, and I think using them since Feb 15, is a long enough wait!I found out about these when I was pregnant, I'm a first time mom so I did an insane amount of research, on the best products out, while also being cute. I read a bunch of reviews both on Amazon, Mom Blogs and watched the few YouTube reviews available and decided to get them, and I'm so glad I did! Not only do they come in all kinds of cute patterns for boys and girls, they're so comfortable for your little babe! I've used my ears since day 1 with my daughter and we both love them! They keep her head steady, allowing her to be comfortable and safe! I never have to worry about her head flopping to the side when I make a turn or when she falls asleep! Some reviews said they didn't like that the ears don't attach to the car-seat, I thought I wouldn't like that either, but I actually like it better! The ears have to be adjusted when you put your babe in their seat every time, so it's easier that they don't attach. Other reviews said that the ears are bulky, I also disagree, I think they're the perfect size for their heads! A big plus also is they're machine washable!I'm very happy with my ears, and would/do recommend them to everyone having a baby!Note- the ears don't come with instructions, so remember to take out the manufactured insert from the car-seat out before you use them, also, if you're looking into getting a pair for an older baby keep in mind, since their heads are snug they can't really move it around and some babies might not like that if they're used to mobility in their current insert.
