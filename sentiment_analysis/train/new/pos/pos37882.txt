This is a great paci holder, what I like most about it, is that because of its design you can use it on multiple paci brands.  The clip on this that attach to what ever you want to paci to hang from is strong, and easy to open as well as close.  I like the colors it it gets dirty you can hand wash it and it dries quickly if hung to dry.  The colors are true to the photos.  having a couple of these saves you tons of money on replacement pacifiers, you can even use these to hang babies teethers and rattle type toys.I like to write reviews I wrote this review without a discount and I paid full price for this item!I like to purchase through amazon becasue I often find the best prices around.All my opnions are my own,  please feel free to ask any questions you may have.
