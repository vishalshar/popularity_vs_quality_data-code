I just had twin girls a month ago, and these pacifiers have been a lifesaver in the times where I'm tending to one baby and the other baby has to wait. It keeps the crying down, and definitely soothes my girls when they are feeling upset and wanting mommy right away. It makes me feel good that these are BPA free, and they are very easy to clean. Durable, easy to use, and overall my girls like them when they can't get the real thing right away.
