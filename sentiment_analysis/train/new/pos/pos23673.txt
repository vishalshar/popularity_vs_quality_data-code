Our 1 year old is drooling a lot and we use this bib in rotation with the striped Ikea ones to keep his clothes dry.The Bumkins are cute but a little too wide at the neck for our baby.I like them with certain outfits because they're just plain colors. They do the job but the ikea ones fit better and are more absorbent.
