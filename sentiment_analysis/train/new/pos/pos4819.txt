Baby loved it for a while, but I don't love the paint quality... We started using before 1 year, and as the baby was teething, chewing and generally sucking on things quite a lot, the paint started to chip off. So I have been removing blocks that look a little too risky in terms of potential paint swallowing, and the count of blocks is fairly low now... Also my baby lost interest in them over time, we shall see if he gets back to them when we actually is ready to construct things...
