From a frugal working mom, the Kiinde kit was a lifesaver - and my babysitter loves it too. I wish I had found this kit with my first son. Pumping at work is a pain already, and having to clean bottles is just another step in the hassle of it all. I loved that the adapters fit right on my Medela flanges, and I leave them there, washing around them. The bottles screw right on and off and they freeze perfectly. My husband and mother-in-law love that they don't have to worry about pouring milk when they defrost it. They just defrost, snap the pouch right into the holder and put on the appropriate nipple. And that's another thing - great to have the option of different nipples, as babies can be picky.Very VERY happy with this product. Durable, washable, and easy to store.
