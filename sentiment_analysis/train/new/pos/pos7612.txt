I initially put this on our registry since other new moms I know had said that the edge of the crib can get a little beat up from wear and tear (button on your jeans leaving scratches, watch and bracelet dings, plus kids teething) and if we want to keep the crib long enough we convert it to a bed, we want it to look nice still. The reason I loved it is that it really is a great way to keep a few singing toys in the crib without having them be in the way of her breathing should she roll towards them and that we can move them out of the way as well. This piece is padded and washed well. I washed on cold and line dried.
