1. If you wash it right away I have had no trouble with stink in the cushion.2. The deflector works great for my son.3. It closes & is a stool & not just a potty sitting in my bathroom.4. The seat can be used on the adult toilet which is great.5. There is enough height to this thing & enough room in the basin to hold the sizable #2 that my son generates, smaller all-in-one potties are no good for this.6. When training my son sometimes sits a LONG time, so the cushion is not a bad idea.7. Easy to empty & clean.8. Fantastic price right now.
