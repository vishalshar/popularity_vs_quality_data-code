I live in an apartment on the second floor and have some astroturf on the patio for my dog to do his business on. I bag it up and shove it in this thing. It doesn't stink and I don't have to make frequent trips to the dumpster to dispose of individual dog poops. The flap that maintains the inner "seal" requires more force than I'd like (having to forcibly shove a poop through it is gross even though it's bagged) and the opening isn't very large so it's difficult if I've got a bag filled with several poops, but it's still a good solution for what I'm using it for.
