This is one of the cutest and well made ornaments of this sort that I have ever seen.  My heart was set on it for my new grandson. When it arrived, it had a small defect. The seller took it back immediately, no questions asked.  They replaced it, and in addition, as a kind gesture the seller sent me a second "Baby's First Christmas" ornament" of a different style (Christmas stocking) for my new grandson. Both ornaments are very nice quality and the personalization was nicely done. Great experience and I highly recommend doing business with this seller!
