I ordered this on a whim since it was on sale and I instantly fell in love! I've been skeptical about buying a wrap carrier because I was scared that it wouldn't be supportive enough. But this wrap is very comfortable, stretchy & sturdy! I feel like my daughter is very secure in it. I can easily move around, bend over, etc while wearing her and I know she's not gonna fall out. Such a great product and perfect for baseball season! I can't wait to wear it to her first baseball game!
