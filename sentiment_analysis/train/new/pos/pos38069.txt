We have had these bumpers for the past 9 months….I was very resistant to purchasing these crib bumpers. Mainly for the cost and also because of the reviews that I have read surrounding the cleaning issues.We finally ordered these crib bumpers after a few failed “cheaper” solutions and one episode of a 10 month old climbing out of the crib.**** The other reviewers are right – you have to order 4 extra ones for the corner posts if you have thicker ones… just connect the two bumpers together.****  We have the Pottery Barn Larkin crib.They arrived in huge boxes and I threw them in the laundry.  First let me address the issue with the washing hassle:  If you wash them on delicate wash and put tennis balls in the dryer – you’ll be fine, they won’t bunch up.Second, let me address the issues with putting them on the actual crib- Yes at first it’s a pain, but once you get the hang of it you just wrap and zip up/or down…. Depending on how curious your child is in unzipping. My suggestion is have the zipper face sideways or out of the crib, the latter one will not look as neat but it beats your child “being quiet in the crib” while unzipping the bumpers one by one.  Once the bumpers are on- they are so fabulously functional! They are the best thing since sliced bread. They provide the face/head/butt against the rails sleepers by providing cushion while allowing air circulation.  They also work wonders for temper tantrums and crib thrashers.  They also take care of the space between the crib rails for the occasional arm/foot slip-through.  My only regret is that I was being cheap before and wasted so much money trying to find alternative bumpers. Next baby we will be putting these on from the beginning.
