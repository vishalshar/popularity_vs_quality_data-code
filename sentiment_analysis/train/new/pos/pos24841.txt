I love these. I bought them for storing home made baby food. I stacked them in the fridge to save space. Now I use them for storing a lot of various foods. They are perfect size for left over yoghurt. I also use them as snack cups for my daughter. They are easy to clean, don't stain and dishwasher safe. They also are durable.
