My son is 5 months old now and had pretty severe reflux.  Due to this, we used to go through about 15 bibs a day as they would get soaked with spit up.  The problem with this is that just about every bib we owned was being used each day (and washed each night), so within a month all of the bibs were stained and in poor condition and had to be replaced.  Some of them only lasted a week or two before looking horrible!  I was desperate to find bibs that would stay clean after constant washings and would still help keep him dry (as may of the bibs would soak through).  I ordered many types of bibs from amazon and other places, and these bibs are the best by far!  These bibs have two thick layers of terry cloth and are big, so they hold a lot of moisture.  They also wash wonderfully!  I use these bibs all the time and even use them when I feed him baby food (including carrots, squash, sweet potatoes, peas, etc.).  These bibs never stain!  I even have forgotten to wash one with sweet potatoes on it for a few days (with no stain treatment or anything) and when I washed it the next day, it came out spotless!  I couldn't believe it!  I took a few of these bibs to my sons daycare and they even commented on how well they were made and absorbed wetness and asked if we could bring a set for them to use on him at the daycare since they were better than the ones they provide!  We ordered two sets of these now, and after months of daily washings and use, not a single one is stained or shows signs of wear at all!  If your child spits up often or you have trouble finding bibs that don't stain easily, look no further!  These are the BEST BIBS EVER!
