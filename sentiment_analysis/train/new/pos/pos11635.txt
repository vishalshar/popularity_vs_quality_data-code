This is #1 on my list of must haves for new parents.  I don't know how I would have bathed by babies without it! So convenient and easy to use.  Easy to fold up and take on the go.  Easy to keep clean!  I do have a tip: if you want to bath in the kitchen sink (which I recommend because then you can use the extendable sprayer!), put a bowl into the sink and place the Puj on top.  That way it won't fall down too far into the sink.  I used an old salad spinner bucket, but anything will do.  Great baby shower gift as well!
