Here's the thing, no hands free pumping bra is perfect, but this one comes closer than most. You can change the straps to be a cross back (X pattern) or like a regular bra (parallel) which is quite convenient based on your outfit selection of the day. The material is soft and I like the cross over panels in the front that attempt to hide the panels beneath. I was a D pre-pregnancy and this fits great, I would suggest ordering your size based on that unless you experienced a very large change (2+ cup sizes).The cons: Like any hands-free pumping bra it's easy to see the panels underneath when wearing a tight shirt. I've even worn this under a cami with a built-in-bra to hide it and you can still see the outlines. You definitely need pads while wearing this also as THO is very prominent underneath.The pros: Hands free so I can actually get stuff done and not have those circular marks all over my arms! The material is soft and is stretchy enough to accommodate my boobs as they grow before pump time.
