I have a Baby Trend Nursery Center play yard. My two year old son sleeps in it often as we have had a lot of trouble getting him to sleep in his own room or bed. We wanted to transition him to consistently sleeping on his own (rather than with one foot in my back and the other punching my husband's gut) so I thought a softer mattress would be good. The mattress is perfect. It is not a coiled mattress, rather a thick piece of foam in a waterproof mattress case. The size and price are fantastic. I would say that it fits perfectly, but I suppose that if it is pressed completely against one side, there is a little over an inch gap in the width. But I would say this wouldn't matter as the mattress is going to settle in the center, it certainly isn't going to slide. I noticed a lot of people were concerned about the size being perfect, and I was as well. Great purchase!
