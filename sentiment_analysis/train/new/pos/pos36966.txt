When I was a kid I had a 1" wide 6-8" long light extender in my room. It was clear plastic and on the other side of the plastic was either Star Wars or DC Comics artwork (pretty sure the latter,) and it was great.Old house, high switches, short body, that needed to happen.My daughter was at a friend's house and his switches were all in reach for her. She was so empowered she went around turning things off and on screaming that she had done it. The look of triumph was in her eyes. I tried to help her out at my house by showing her she could get a stepstool and go into the dark rooms and switch the lights on herself, but she didn't like stepstools in the dark, and I can't blame her.I found these. She absolutely loves the ability she now has.As all of my lights are too high for a toddler, putting these on just the ones I want her to have access to seems to work well.One bit of warning - older houses where the light switch might have trimming underneath it will cause you to have to rig these. My bathroom has a bit of trim that leads into wainscoting right below the switch which means I can't have the lower screw in the unit. I also have another plate which causes some problems. All surmountable, but may degrade the quality of non-standard weird 1940's house switches. But that's your problem, not theirs.
