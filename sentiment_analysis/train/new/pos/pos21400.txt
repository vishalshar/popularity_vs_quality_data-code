My lil guy, 7 months old, loves Mam pacis.  These are no exception.  Dishwasher safe, I put them in the dishwasher rack I bought for small baby items such as this.  I've also boiled a pot of pacis on the stovetop and these have held up just fine.Once in a while I have noticed he will get some slobber into the mouth piece of these pacis.  If I shake the paci the slobber finds its way out, but that does kinda creep me out to some degree that they aren't waterproof.  Then again if slobber can get in, air can too and I don't expect to get a mold problem or anything similar so this is probably a moot point.Overall I would definitely buy again.
