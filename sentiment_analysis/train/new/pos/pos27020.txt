I have a graco side by side stroller.Like with most strollers, the canope on this stroller is almost useless. Why is it so hard for the companies to figure out what we Mom's really want? A functionable canope would be one thing for example. On most strollers they are a joke.So I bought this sunshade.Positive: folds up flat and easily;attaches easily (though you may have to fiddle a bit to find the best position);side pockets are a nice extra and help to weigh the shade down some as well ( and you can perhaps hide some goodies in there because they are really not easy to spot );it shelters from the side as well;Negative:Hello.. a slight wind and this thing bends backwards or moves sideways;When the sun comes from the front, while setting, you can't really pull it down far enough to protect your children.Living on an island we deal with wind all the time and so it is not as practical as I would like this shade to be.But still would recommend it over leaving the child just exposed.Perhaps if you have less wind to deal with you really will like this shade.I gave it a 4 star because it does protect my children and that is what matters.You deal with the negative points,but I wished it would have been designed for all weather. I don't see how you can attach a weight and still allow it to stand up correctly.The material is too thin for that.But I am open for ideas and suggestions.I don't have problems folding the stroller together while shade is attached. Perhaps that is just a matter of trying and see what you prefer and like.All in all it is worth the money and afford because your little ones deserver and need the proctection.Till the strollers are made with better canopes, we will have to rely on something like this.I also have the Peg Perego Aria stroller and had bought the single one for that one.Same issue, problems with wind but otherwise a nice protection.And yes you will have to fold it back when you put baby in.Perhaps that was the main concern of the designer. Easy acess to the baby.
