We've used a SwaddleMe (size S/M) since my son was just weeks old.  At two months though, he was already 23 1/2 inches long.  Although the S/M still fit around the chest, his legs were getting bunched up in it.  I ordered this SwaddleMe (size L) even though he was almost 2 lbs lighter than the product recommends.  The length is great, but as anticipated, he could get out of it easily since he's not yet 15 lbs.  So..... I sewed on a couple of 4 inch strips of Velcro to extend the wrapping closure area.  Now I can wrap him up tight enough so he can't wiggle out and his legs have plenty of room to grow.I gave 4 stars because it would be nice if the transition from the S/M size to Large was more seamless.  Ideally, by the time a baby outgrows one size (whether it be because of weight or length) they should be able to move into the next size.
