I initially reviewed this basket in 2010, now I'm rebuilding it for baby number two:The important bits:- The Oak color is darker than the Amazon photo. See my photos.- The circumference this stand allows is quite large, so standard moses baskets might not fit tightly. This is easily remedied by creating your own holes in the plastic belt. See my photos (there's a before and after picture with our Badger Basket Natural Moses Basket with Hood, Sage Gingham Bedding ).It's a solid stand that's easy to build. We didn't have any problems or worries about sturdiness with our first child, and will use it again.My original review:Although I haven't tested the stand with a baby yet, it's almost exactly what we were looking for. It's not hard to assemble (20 screws) although as other reviewers have mentioned, you need to be verify that all pieces face the right direction - the instructions don't emphasis this enough. If you don't you'll need to backtrack and re-build it. It took me about 15 minutes to assemble.I didn't have any problems with damaged or broken pieces, thankfully. I was careful not to tighten the screws too tight. With hand tightened screws the stand appears very sturdy. Two screws that attach the rocking base to the feet did not tighten, the just spun around. Since there are eight screws in total on the base, I don't think that's problematic. This was the only sign I saw that the quality slightly sub-par. I'm still willing to place my baby on the stand though, which says a lot.The moses basket we bought fits in the stand with about an inch and a half to spare. Even though it could slide around, I don't imagine that happening or being problematic if it happens. The plastic perimeter that holds the basket has screw holes, it is not adjustable. It would be easy to punch a couple extra holes in the plastic if you need to reduce the circumference though.Overall, it's sturdy, it holds the basket well, and for the price it's a good deal.
