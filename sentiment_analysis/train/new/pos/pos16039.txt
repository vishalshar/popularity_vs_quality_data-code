I've had a Moby wrap since my daughter was born in Dec. of '09. She was a very tiny baby and I loved that I could put her in it all snuggled up just like she used to be when I was still pregnant with her. Since then, I've carried her in it to the store, the mall, the Zoo, brother's t-ball games, Easter Egg hunts, you name it. She was being a fussy pants yesterday so I just put her in it and she was instantly calm. At almost 14 lbs, she's not that heavy, but carry her around for a while and your back will feel it! Not with the Moby. The weight is disributed so evenly you really feel so comfy carrying a baby around. There are so many holds. I've used almost all of them including the breastfeeding hold! I haven't used any of the holds for back carrying yet because she's not quite ready. I just used the sling carry yesterday at WalMart and loved how easy it was to get her in and out for a quick run in. Just put your Moby on before you leave the house and stick your baby in when you arrive at your destination. I recommend getting a neutral or dark color if you're gonna be out and about with it. I bought pink first And felt a little conspicuous in public. Then I bought black and I guess if I don't have her in it people just think it's some kind of new trend! I truly couldn't live without my Moby! It's a wonderful way to bond with your baby!
