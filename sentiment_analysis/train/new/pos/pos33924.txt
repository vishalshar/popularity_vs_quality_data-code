Not bad. I like being able to toggle the camera to see anywhere in the room. There are only two options on the zoom, so you can't really adjust it much. The pic is fairly blurry during the day, but clears up when the lights are out and it has a nice night vision pic. Doesn't have a far range, can lose signal when on the other side of our 1400 sg ft home. We have had a lot of fun with the microphone and communicating with the baby. The controls are hard to get used to, and a little frustrating to figure out (no instructions), but if you have a little electronic knowledge you should be fine. If you have a smart phone however, the control will be very annoying to figure out, but you'll get it. Overall, I have recommended this product to many people. For the price I think the minor critiques can be overlooked.
