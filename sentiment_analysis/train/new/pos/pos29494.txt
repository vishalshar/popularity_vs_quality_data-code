I bought these nightlights to put around my house because I just got a cat, she is black and I can't see where she is when I am walking to the bathroom.  I am afraid to step on her so these work perfectly.  I know I could just turn on a light in the rooms but then I can't get back to sleep! I like the fact that I can have them facing up or down.  Down works best for my needs. The bright white LED casts a large glow which I like, and being able to turn them on and off when I want is a plus.
