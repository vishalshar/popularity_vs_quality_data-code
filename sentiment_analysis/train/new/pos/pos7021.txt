We use this Babysuite all the time and it is very handy. It is holding up well which as much as it gets used is saying something. The  changing station works well if you get a mess on it all that is required is some soapy water and a cloth and then just let it dry. My son seems to like the stars a lot as well they keep him busy all the time. So I would recommend this to anyone with newborns or young children.
