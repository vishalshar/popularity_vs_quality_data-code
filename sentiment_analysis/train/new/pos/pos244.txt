Our newborn absolutely hated diaper changes. Until we discovered it was the cold wipes, so we love this thing, it's easy to maintain, it stores just enough and it's portable. The only annoying thing is that the light on the cover died, which frankly is important because it is the first indicator that the thing is working, or you wait for it to warm up which is no big deal, but an LED that functions for the life of the product is not much to ask for these days.Update:So the flip up wipe lid on our wipe warmer broke and it will not stay shut. I emailed Prince Lionheart about this problem and I must say the response was very fast. Within a few days they sent us a brand new unit. So for this I am adding another star, for a company that responds so quickly.
