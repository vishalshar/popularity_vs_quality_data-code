Even though my 3 month old daughter was large (95th percentile) with big hands, we had trouble finding toys she would grip and hold on to. This toy is one of her favorites. She can grab it, either by the large outer ring or  by hooking her fingers in one of the smaller rings, and it has many  interesting textures for her to chew on. She enjoys chewing on the soft  rubbery areas as well as the bigger red ball.The ring shape is also  useful for her at this stage. She's just figuring out the hand-to-mouth  coordination, and with straight toys she sometimes pokes herself in the  face with the toy when she's trying to get a part of it in her mouth. With  the shape of this toy, she is always successful at getting some part of it  into her mouth.
