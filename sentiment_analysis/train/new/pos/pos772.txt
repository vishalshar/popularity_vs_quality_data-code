My 22 month old son is cutting his 2 year molars and his fingers are raw from gnawing on them. I wasn't sure which molar teether would work best for him so I ordered 3 of the top rated teethers and here are my results after 2 months;KidGear The TeethifierMy son never took a pacifier as an infant so I wasn't sure this pacifier shaped teether would click with him. This is the softest teether in the bunch and has the rubbery consistency of a pacifier. The knobs are also the shortest of the bunch so he can't get both sides at the same time and he has to shove it in his mouth a little father to get the desired effect. He will take this from time to time but it has not been his favorite.Zoli Baby Bunny Teether - orangeThe white part of the teether is made from hard plastic and the orange textured knobs are soft covers over the hard plastic. I was concerned that the soft covers would pull off somehow but they are very secure and are not removable from my experience. My son can reach both sides of his mouth at the same time with very little effort. He seems to prefer the harder texture of this one to the soft Teethifier.CHEWY TUBES SUPER CHEW KNOBBYThis teether is a good mix of the Teethifier and the Zoli Bunny. It is made from a soft material but it is not as soft as the teethifier. The nubs are also more pronounced which I think my toddler appreciates for those stubborn molars. This is the only teether out of the 3 that doesn't allow him to hit both sides of his mouth at once, but that doesn't seem to bother him. He prefers this one the most before bed.Overall his favorite seems to switch between the Zoli and the Chew Knobby. He will take the Teethifier as a last resort if the other two are lost under the couch.
