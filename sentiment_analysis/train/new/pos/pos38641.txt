This is the best baby book I've come across for so many reasons.1) The pages are interchangeable/removable.  There was a holiday we don't celebrate, so instead of ripping out a page, I just removed it!2) The hand/footprint sections come with cards and an ink-free pad (the ink doesn't touch the baby)....so I took them to the hospital with us and the newborn nurses got the prints for us within minutes of our daughter's birth.3) I don't particularly care for girly stuff - she has gotten enough pink items as it is - and this is a perfectly gender neutral book in my mind.4) There are extra pages to create your own "firsts" and plenty of preprinted pages with all the usual suspects (first birthday, Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.This is such a great book and at an awesome price.  Pearhead makes other similar books (I did a TON of research this time as this is our second child - instead of just picking the one I thought was "cute", which, incidentally this is both!) so if you'd prefer a blue or pink book, they have other cover options with similar inside contents.
