The diaper pins are just what they should be.  There is a safety catch inside the cute duck.  It is a sturdy duck and the metal pin part is not flimsy.  I use them to make Diaper cakes, but when I raised my kids (in the 80's), I used "real" diapers with pins, and this product meets a good quality rating from me for baby safety.  The seller has options for colors, and they contacted me immediately to ask my preference, and then shipped them that same day.  I am happy I found this seller and these pins.
