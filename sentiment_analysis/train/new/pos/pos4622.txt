I ordered two of these ring o' links because my daughter and I both love this product.  My daughter simply loves playing with this.  Her favorite link is the black and white which she frequently uses as a teething ring.  This toy is perfect for on-the-go and it doesn't take up a lot of space in my diaper bag.  I can simply take this toy wherever we go and it'll keep my daughter entertained. I love the different textures and colors.  The best thing about this toy is that it is BPA free.  It states it on the packaging.  I was receiving conflicting reviews from moms who say that this is or this is not BPA free, so I contacted Sassy and received the following email from them:Thank you for your email.  The Ring O' Links has always been BPA-free.  Be assured we only use safe non-toxic materials. The safety of the children using/playing with our products is our primary concern, and all of our products meet and exceed all safety standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the American Society for Testing & Materials (ASTM).

I'll be purchasing more of these links as gifts for other moms!
