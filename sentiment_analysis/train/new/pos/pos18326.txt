My goal was to find a real mattress for the crib preferably organic, not the plastic wrapped firm pad that we have mostly seen. After reviewing many mattresses, I chose this mattress based on the organic materials, the coils, and that it wasn't overly firm.Conclusion:I am very impressed with the mattress! It has no off-gassing odor, the surface material is soft cotton, it has a more firm side for infant and less firm for toddler, but neither is overly firm. It is a very comfortable and supportive mattress.I did not find it easy to choose a crib mattress, so I want to share my complete satisfaction with others having a hard time deliberating over the decision.
