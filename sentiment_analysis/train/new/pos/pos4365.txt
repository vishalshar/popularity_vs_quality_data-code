Very durable. I have the blanket for almost 2 years now using it daily and machine washing it about 3 x weekly, in both cold and warm water. And yet the blanket is still like brand new! No sign of any damage. It's sewed very strongly and neatly. My daughter loves it. It's amazingly soft and nicely warm. No need for receiving blanket - this blanket is much softer and in the warm months that's all she needs. It keeps her body temperature about right. Best of all, it's organic,healthy and safe. Beautiful design, we love the ruffle hem. So soft and cozy. Definitely worth the money!!! Very happy with the purchase, it was a great investment. Too bad they don't make the same product in a larger size. My daughter used it from when she was a newborn, but will probably outgrew it soon :-(.
