I have a big stroller that came as a travel system with my infant carrier and while it's nice when your going somewhere for a long period of time I needed something smaller and less bulky for quick trips and for storage purposes. I wanted a stroller that was light weight but still sturdy enough to haul a diaper bag. Most Umbrella strollers while attractvly priced do not give you any storage space and tend to tip over if weight is added by the handles. This stroller was slightly more expensive but way more sturdy than a regular umbrella stroller and it has storage space which is awesome. The space is not very big but sufficiant. I put my heavy diaper bag on the handles and it did not tip over. The sunshade can cover any angle or direction which is nice. My daughter is 8 months old but she is the size of a 12 month old so I wanted something that would be comfortable for her and she seemed to fit nicely and seemed to be very comfortable. I think for the price which is reasonable this stroller is great. It folds up nicely but it's still very long once folded. The plus feature is nice if you are tall or your husband is tall like mine 6'2" he had no problem pushing the stroller.
