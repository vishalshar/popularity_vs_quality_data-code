I only write reviews when my purchase is an amazing product. And this is one of them!!! My 4 months old daughter has a lot of toys, but we do have 2 hippos she is specifically in love with. That is why when I saw this arch with a hippo like we have, I knew right away I needed to get it. What a great product! It fits on everything I have- stroller, bassinet, snuggle nest. I don't need it in the crib since we have a mobile there. I definitely recommend this arch, great quality, very colorful
