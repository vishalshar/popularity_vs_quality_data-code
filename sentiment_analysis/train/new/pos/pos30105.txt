Love, love love this!!  We love and keep this in the diaper bag next to the empty bottle, bottled water and pre-measured formula!  You never know when you'll end up stuck somewhere!  You could probably use a fork to mash stuff up, but if your son is a beast that wants you to shovel food in, nothing else will do.  Some things like noodles take a bit of convincing and re-mashing.  Unless they made it out of metal, I think you'd have to re-mash with any product.  When you're in a hurry, you're always good for forgetting the small stuff like a bottle, or spoon. Make sure you have this...
