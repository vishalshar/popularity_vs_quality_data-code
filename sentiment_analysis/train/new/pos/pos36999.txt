I have tried other manuel pumps and even the famed Medela Pump in Style and nothing worked on me.The Avent Isis is a great manuel pump and I was able to express more milk using this product than with using the electric Medela.  I was even pleased with the price since I paid $... for my Medela PiS.Let's just say I was amazed and overjoyed to find a product that worked for me since I considered myself a pumping failure!
