The aspirator works well but needs to come with directions since most aspirators don't have the valve system that this one does. Should the user close the vent valve or leave it open? How should it be turned? I have found that this aspirator works best when the user pumps the bulb rapidly, There should be clear directions since that's different from valueless aspirators--and there may be other differences I haven't found.
