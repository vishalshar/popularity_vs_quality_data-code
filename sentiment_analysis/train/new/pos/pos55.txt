This is a great infant insert. My daughter was very fussy when she was little but once I put her in this she would fall right to sleep. She loved being bundled up in this. It is easy to use and very soft. I would put her in her ergo with this insert for grocery shopping because she hated her car seat. This worked very well. It was worth the money. The only con was when I was in hot weather she would get sweaty in it. Other than that it is great!
