I will admit I have NOT tried all the choices in spoons that are meant for "new self-feeders" but I do believe these have worked great for teaching my 15-18 mo old how to feed himself.The food stays IN the spoon as the toddler lifts it to his mouth and because the "bowl" of the spoon is flexible - it makes it easier on him (kinder to his mouth and good for when he didn't yet know how to angle the spoon correctly).They wash up great in the top rack of the dishwasher, although its sometimes difficult to get the spoons to stay face down in the dishwasher basket. If they end up face up - they are filled with water when the dishwasher is done.The handles are nice and big to make it easy for a infant/toddler to hold onto. (skinny handles don't work for uncoordinated hands).The length of the spoon is nice - it's better to have short handles for a toddler just learning to feed himself.The only true "Con" (besides the face up dishwasher comment) - I wish there was a gender neutral choice. I don't particularly prefer pink myself and its a bit odd handing my son a pink spoon - but it doesn't really matter does it ?  :)
