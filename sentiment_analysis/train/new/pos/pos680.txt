Although the product is said to be for babies up to 30 pounds, my 3 months old is 13 pounds and is a bit too big for the bassinet. Since it is reclined, she used to wake up with her feet outside the bassinet after having slid during sleep. She still fits inside, but I would prefer the bassinet to be a bit larger. Also, the cover could have another button on the bottom part so that my baby's feet wouldn't escape (the buttons are only on the upper part).Meanwhile, it is very resistant and I love this colour.
