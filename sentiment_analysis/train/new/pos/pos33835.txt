Buttons vs. Best Bottoms reviewFirst things first:  Best Bottoms inserts are compatible with Buttons diapers!  LOVE this, because I prefer hemp inserts and Buttons have not made a hemp insert yet.  (Speaking of inserts, I prefer Best Bottoms inserts over Buttons inserts - the Buttons inserts bunch up more than Best Bottoms do.)Double gusset awesomeness.Buttons covers (2 layer PUL, just like Best Bottoms) are SO soft even though they are thicker and more durable than 1 layer PUL covers.  Best Bottoms are also 2 layer, but are much stiffer and noisier - if you pat baby's bottom with Best Bottoms on, it's loud, I know that sounds like a silly thing to rate a diaper on, but I much prefer my diaper options to be more discrete/quiet.Buttons covers are slightly stretchy, whereas Best Bottoms aren't for the most part, so I feel like I get a better fit with Buttons.Buttons covers are less bulky than Best Bottoms - this says a lot because Best Bottoms are some of the trimmest diaper systems out there!  Buttons is even trimmer, I think due to the fabric being just that much softer/moldable.Buttons covers seem to last longer than Best Bottoms.  I have a Best Bottoms cover that I purchased the exact same time as a Buttons cover - the elastic in the Best Bottoms cover has relaxed while the Buttons cover still looks like new.One of the hip snaps on one of my Buttons covers is starting to lose its snapping capability, however, my baby has an unusually trim waist and we've been using the same hip snap since she was 6wks old, she is now 8 months old.  I just use other snaps, so while slightly irritating, it's not that big of a deal at this point as I know we won't be using that snap much longer anyway.  I haven't contacted Buttons yet about possibly replacing the snap - I would like to replace it since I plan on selling these once she is potty trained.  On this same cover, there is also a small tear on the PUL on the inside of the diaper at a snap that holds an insert, this tear happened within a couple months of purchase.  Doesn't cause any leaks since this is a 2 layer PUL and the tear is basically under the snap - you can only see it when unsnapping an insert.  I do not have any tears in the PUL on the Best Bottoms diapers, so Best Bottoms PUL may be more durable.  (I still prefer Buttons and still consider them a 5 star cover.  My other Buttons covers are slightly newer, but have had no issues with them in the months I've used them and believe this is an isolated problem with just the one cover.)I have this in Pebble, Sweet Pea, Snow, Blueberry, Purple, Strawberry, Acres, Tangerine, Thicket, Cherry, Peony, Marina, Charming, and Banana Cream.We rarely have leaks.In addition to Buttons and Best Bottoms, I have a Rumparooz cover, a Lotus Bum cover, and fleece covers.  I also have fitteds (which I also like a lot), pocket diapers (my least favorite), tons of flats, some prefolds.  I always grab Buttons first.  Always.*** UPDATE ***My baby is 9 months old now and crawling all over the place.  She does get slightly irritated on the tops of her thighs from the PUL that is exposed to her skin and rubs there when she moves.  Once I realized this, I just started tucking that part of the "wing" in so the outer fabric is what rubs there, not the inside PUL.  Simple and does the trick.  Just wanted to mention this in case anyone else wanted a simple fix for this scenario.**** UPDATE AGAIN ****My baby is 15mo old and we still LOVE Buttons.  Pretty sure we are going to sell every other diaper we have and just stick with Buttons.Their customer service is phenomenal.  The slight tear in my Pebble cover eventually made the whole snap come out.  That same week I had ordered some new covers from them and one of the hip snaps popped off.  I sent a friendly email with a pic of the covers that the snaps had come off of and asked how to go about replacing them.  She right away emailed back and I had new replacement covers within 5 days - I didn't even have to send the ones with faulty snaps back!  That was a HUGE plus for me since I live out of town and getting to a post office is a pain.  LOVE Buttons!!!!!!!!*** UPDATE 04/22/16 ***3 years and 2 kids cloth diapering with Best Bottoms and Buttons Diapers.  I still love Buttons, but have recently begun having some delaminating/cracking PUL causing leaks on a handful of them which has me a bit disappointed.  Oddly enough, the ones that are delaminating are NOT the oldest/most used covers I have, but they all were ordered at the same time about 1.5 years ago.  They have all had the same care so I do not understand why it's happening.  I haven't contacted Buttons yet.  As for the covers I bought almost 3 years ago, the leg elastics are finally starting to stretch and I am having a local pro replace the elastics for a few bucks per diaper.  3 years before elastic stretched is really good considering it took only a few months for the Best Bottoms elastics to stretch.  I am almost exclusively using Buttons Hemp inserts still and have been working on selling all of my Best Bottoms inserts.If anyone is curious, at night, I was using a Best Bottoms hemp overnight with a Buttons hemp on top (in either Buttons or Best Bottoms cover) and sometimes a wool or fleece cover over that with great success.  Recently, I decided to try a Grovia O.N.E. for night time and I absolutely love them.  I plan on using Grovia O.N.E.s exclusively for nights from now on.  It's nice to have designated night vs day diapers too, as opposed to switching out inserts with the covers and having to remember which ones are night/day.  Silly sounding, but it just feels calmer to have them separate.
