My husband and I drive small cars (Honda Civic and Mazda 6), and were not looking forward to the gigantic car seats taking up the entire back seat once our daughter turned to facing the front. This car seat was the perfect choice for us. We've been using it since April of this year, and really have no complaints at all. It's compact enough that even with our daughter riding in the middle of the backseat, 2 other people can still ride in back with her comfortably.It was pretty easy to install (even in my husband's older Honda), and the car seat itself has a lot extra of padding (more so than a lot of other car seats I have seen on the market). The harness takes a little bit to get used to, but after fastening it the first 2 or 3 times, you should be able to expertly snap your baby in with no problem.The car seat does tilt a little high at the bottom, but it places our baby in a reclining position that she seems to enjoy.Overall, we love this carseat, so much so that we bought 2 for both of our cars....
