Bought this for our second son. Our first son has the exact same model, which we purchased from Costco back in 2012. I trust this model enough that I went ahead & bought second one. Plus, I wanted the boys to match.. keeps them from arguing about who's seat is who's.Dislike: It's bulky! I understand it's a carseat, but this thing is HUGE! Not ideal for sports cars. Wouldn't place this rear facing if you have a small car (anything smaller than a sedan), because it just won't fit properly. I waited until my children were at least one year old to sit them in these, front facing. I don't care if people say its safe as long as they're a certain weight they can sit front facing, I'll still wait until the kids are at least a year old. I drive a hatchback. Normally you can sit three people in the rear, with these two in the back you can maybe fit half a butt cheek in the center. The cupholder only goes on one side (left side), so whoever sits on the right side has a cupholder & the other doesn't. Buy a seat protector or place a blanket between the carseat and your car seat because it leaves ugly indentations on the chair. With any carseat, disassembling for cleaning is a nightmare, but that's with any carseat you buy. If it was easy to disassemble I'd question how much protection it would give my child.Like: Easy to adjust (as long as the kids aren't on the chair, I've read reviews about how its difficult to adjust.. it's not). It's bulky! I know I said I dislike this, but hey it's a carseat! It gives me some peace of mind knowing that the carseat isn't going to fall apart. Affordable! Easy to clean.Overall: I'd recommend this carseat. I chose this in particular because it's black & grey.. matches the interior of my car and it matches his big brother's carseat.
