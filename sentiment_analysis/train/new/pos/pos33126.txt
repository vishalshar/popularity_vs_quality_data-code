I studied safety issues obsessively before purchasing this car seat.  Plus, since we're now on seat #6 (various kids), convenience and comfort have become more important issues for us.  I have to say this seat was a breeze to install in our car, though we had to take of the headrest to get it to sit properly (Mazda5). My 6yo daughter likes it and says it's more comfortable than her other seat (Graco Turbo-something), and I can tell it fits her well. I like that the belt easily threads thru a shoulder clasp to keep it at the right level, and she can buckle herself without a problem. Compared to the Britax we got for the other seat, the Monterrey was FAR, FAR, FAR easier to install, and was about 2/3 of the price, but is a little less-well padded (though much better than the Graco-Turbo-something we also have).  I like both the Britax and the Monterrey and would purchase a Monterrey again without hesitation.
