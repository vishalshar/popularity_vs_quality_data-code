My daughter was born in the 70's and had the big red apple form FP. She just gave birth to twin boys who are getting these for Christmas. What a fun twist on a classic toy! The apple part is squishy and great for teething. Overall the toy is a bit heavy, and will work best with babies from 6 months up.
