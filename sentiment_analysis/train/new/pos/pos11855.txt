The Mom’s Collapsible Water Bottle is identical in shape and function to their Kid’s Collapsible Water Bottle-which I have previously reviewed. The difference is in the size and color. I love that cute picture of Mama and Baby together. Everyone knows breastfeeding Mama’s need to drink lots of water to help their body make the best milk for their babies. This water bottle helps you do it in style.  It has a pop-tab lid that closes tightly and doesn’t leak which is great, especially when you live with kids. I love the handy clip that comes attached (but is detachable) because you can clip it to almost anything- pockets, purse straps, stroller handles! This way your hands are free but you can still grab a drink when needed. My three year old really enjoyed this, too, because she loves when Mommy and her have “matching” things. Our matching water bottles were all the rave for the first week or so.*I was provided with this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review. I was not paid monetarily for this post.
