I am not a nursing/pregnant woman.  Instead, I am a retired woman, in my 60's, who spends a great deal of time sitting and doing needlework, crochet, embroidery and beading.  The chair I use is a fairly comfortable armchair with a hassock I can put my feet up on, but the back is not ergonomic.  I've struggled with piling pillows up to try to alleviate backaches, but this hasn't worked.  I've looked and looked for the right back support.  Most were too expensive or too big to fit my chair.  Then, I discovered the Back Buddy.  I received it a day before I expected it to arrive, which was nice.  It came in the late afternoon and I decided to use it while sitting in bed watching a movie.  After about two hours, I suddenly realized that the backache I had earlier was gone.  Amazing!  I've noticed that I almost have had to relearn how to sit correctly, but this pillow actually does that for you.  It sort of molds you into a good sitting posture without even realizing it.  I'm delighted and so impressed!  It was so much more affordable than most of the professionally made ergonomic back supports.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did not come with a removable cover.  It has a fairly cheap cotton cover that does not come off and you have to buy the removable covers separately and they are pricey.  I discovered that using a king size pillowcase and putting the Back Buddy in sideways works just fine.  It will protect it with something that is washable.  This is certainly worth every penny spent!Back Buddy Support Pillow
