I've never written a review for any baby toys before, but I'm going to make an exception for Jacques.  We call him Pierre the Peacock, because alliteration is more fun than consonance, but I digress.As far as our 5-month-old is concerned, Jacques is the greatest thing that has ever existed. Our son goes absolutely insane at the mere sight of Jacques. Even a month ago, when he was not such a grabby baby, he wanted to touch all parts of Jacques simultaneously.  With great intensity, he wants to stare at Jacques and never look away; he wants to squeak and scream and laugh at Jacques as loud as he can.  His love for Jacques is metaphysical.In fact, if it was possible to be a little too excited by a toy, Jacques might potentially fit that bill.  Sometimes our son is overwhelmed by his excitement for Jacques.  Jacques is baby cocaine.Our only complaint is that we wish Jacques was machine-washable. He fell on the garage floor and got very dirty, and now our son spends his days in a deep, Jacques-less, existential depression. C'est la vie...
