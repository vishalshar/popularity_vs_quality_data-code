My 5 mo old LOVES this toy.  His eyes were so big when he saw it for the first time. After breakfast, he spends about 30-45 minutes every morning playing with "Mr. Buzz" (as we call it).  Gives me time to get the dishes caught up and the kitchen cleaned...then we're off to the next adventure for the day.  This toy helps with fine motor skills.  The fact that this toy is suction cupped to the high chair is invaluable.  My little one is at the age where it is fun to throw everything on the floor.  This toy has been a life saver.
