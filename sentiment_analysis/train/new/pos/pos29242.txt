My baby is one week old, and these are my favorite nursing pads.  I'm not a heavy leaker, and it seems that the thickness of the pads creates enough pressure to keep me from leaking in between feedings.  They are somewhat crisp after washing, but I actually like this, as it seems they are nice and dry then (they are also fairly easy to reshape both after air drying and tumble drying).  They do show through your clothing if you are wearing a thin bra; wear a padded nursing bra, and this problem is taken care of.  Also, I love the seam in them for a contoured fit- much better than other options that are just a circle of fabric (these tend to bunch up around the edges and cause soreness on the side of a full breast).Highly recommend!
