I wasn't too sure about this sheet before I ordered it. I generally like simple and plain sheets for everything. I also thought they were a bit expensive (compared to brands like Chicco, etc. that you can snag at Target for about $15 for a 2 pack). But seeing as though these are the only sheets offered for this pack and play (also in pink) I bought them. I was blown away by how soft these were when I got them! I also found that in person the spotted design is not so bad - it's not nearly as loud as the pink (I have the pink at our summer home - let's just say the pink will stay there!) The sheets came in a nice zipper pouch and they fit the bassinet pad perfect. I think they have been super soft for my baby's head - she sleeps great on them! Overall, I was pleasantly surprised they are great quality (making the price point a little easier to swallow) - but I still think 4moms could come out with some more designs... or at least solid colors.
