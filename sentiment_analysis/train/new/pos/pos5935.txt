I adore this bag. I ordered this bag before looking at the reviews then cancelled the order thinking I had made a mistake and would be unhappy with my purchase. I looked at the reviews again and read the description again and decided to go for it. I got the bag earlier today and it's perfect. I have a very nice large expensive Timi and Leslie diaper bag and it kills my shoulders. I can only carry it when my husband is carrying out one year old, I can't carry my diaper bag and the baby. I needed something a bit smaller for travel and quick trips around town when I'm by myself and this bag is wonderful for that. I've already taken it out to the grocery store. The bag looks very easy to clean and has plent of space for your essentials. It's lightweight and easy to carry unlike my experience db. My advice is if you are on the fence go ahead and get it and I'm sure you will be happy but if not just return it.
