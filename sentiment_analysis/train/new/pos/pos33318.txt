Love it. Lightweight, easy to close and open. The handles are a good height. I'm about 5"6 and even with heels on its good. The shade is nice and big enough with the extension. The wheels and nice and thick and smooth, better than a lot of umbrella type strollers. The basket is useful for the first time for me on an umbrella stroller. Can't fit a large diaper back but a medium or small one fits great with extra room.  The seat is nicely padded and comes off easy. Haven't washed it yet but nice to know I can. My toddler is tall about 35" and 28lbs and she fits great in this stroller. Falls asleep comfortably as is without reclining. She's 3. I have up recline for lighter weight. It's more important for me at this stage of the game. I need that easy portability and slimmer profile. She walks more than she is in this stroller but it's still necessary. She will get tired or sleepy when out and it's good to know we have this with is for those moments and that she is comfortable too. I love the red color and would not hesitate to buy. No have had this stroller for a few months now and love it.  Even had a strap to carry it when folded. One thing, the front wheels to slightly touch the canopy when closed which can get it a little dirty but I'm careful with that and lay it so the wheels don't touch it or wipe the wheels a bit since I hate a dirty looking canopy. Other than that, which is just about all strollers, awesome.
