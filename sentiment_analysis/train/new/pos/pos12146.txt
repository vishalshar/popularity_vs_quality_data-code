I like this because a regular bumper does not fit in my baby's crib due to the front and back of the crib are not bars, but flat (It's from Ikea) and I specifically bought this because of another review someone had left who seemed to have bought the same crib as me. However, I do find that it's still a little long for her crib so I had to loop the sides around the final bar twice and tie. If I had a normal crib I'm sure it would have worked fine. Ikea should really invest in making crib bumpers for their awkward cribs, but that's another story. :)
