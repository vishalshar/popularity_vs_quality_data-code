After more than 5 years of daily use (for 2 kids), we are finally saying a bittersweet goodbye to this awesome highchair. This chair was one of my favorite pieces of baby gear, and I highly recommend it. Incredibly easy to clean and no nooks, crevices or excess padding for food and crumbs to hide in (I'm a neat freak and shudder at the sight of some of the filthy high chairs I've seen). It has a modern/minimalist look that I actually didn't mind having in my kitchen (no neon colors or kid cartoon graphics).
