I have recently started potty training my 3 year old son.  He is 41 pounds but very tall and thin, so I decided to order the size Large instead of the X-Large.  I am glad I did, as these seem to run big. If your child is husky or has chunky thighs, then I would order the recommended size. I use them over his cotton "big boy" underwear.  These pants do a good job of keeping his clothes dry.  The elastic is soft and not too tight around the waist and thighs but is secure enough not too leak.  When he has an accident, I stand him in the bathtub so it is easier to clean him up. Otherwise, you might have a mess on the floor.  Overall, I am satisfied with them and will continue to use them. I gave it four stars instead of five only because of the sizing.
