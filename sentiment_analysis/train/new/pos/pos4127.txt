These bibs are perfect for drool and spit up, though if the quantity is really big the clothes underneath can get wet.  Even so, I prefer these to plastic bibs because my baby likes to play with and chew on them, and the cotton is nice and soft.For feeding rice cereal or other messy solids I would recommend something a bit more substantial / waterproof.The color selection is such that there is always a good color for baby's outfit, and they are big enough that they should easily fit up until my (big) baby is 6 months old.  I do agree with other reviewers about the velcro in the washer/dryer - and will also add that you should be sure that the entire velcro is covered - if there's even a tiny bit that is left outside, something will latch on to it!
