We had a baby in 2014. I wanted a picture ornament for a baby picture of him, but couldn't stomach the high prices of the ornaments printed with "2014".  So, I bought this older one, and used a tiny paintbrush to cover the "2012" with white paint, and then painted "2014" in red on top of it.  Super cute!
