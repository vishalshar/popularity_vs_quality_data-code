I purchased these Philips Avent Variable flow nipples for my 9 month old daughter's night time bottle feedings. She would get up in the middle of the night hungry and would keeping crying for more milk. Plain (formula) milk wasn't keeping her tiny stomach filled through the night. So I purchased these nipples and started putting 1 teaspoon of baby cereal per 2 oz of formula (milk). She has since started sleeping through most of the night, only gets up once to ask for a bottle. I have been using these for about 2-3 months and haven't had any problems.
