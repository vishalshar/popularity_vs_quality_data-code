It's so simple really.The negative reviews focus almost exclusively on the size of the holes being too big...not restricting the flow of shirt soaking fluid enough.  Well...I kind of agree with that.  It would be nice to start with smaller holes -- and nicer still to be able to adjust the size of the holes as the wee one got better at drinking.The answer:  Buy at least two of these cups.I know...right now you are thinking I am an OXO executive dreaming up a way to make lemonade out of lemons.  But I'm not.It's quite simple.  You can easily fit TWO of the plastic baffles into one cup.  And trust me...they both fit snugly.  If you put the top insert with the tabs right over the center of the holes on the bottom one, you have effectively cut the flow of liquid by at least 75%.  And by adjusting the the placement of the top baffle...it can go from 75% to 50% to 25% and then to just one baffle.Still don't believe me...watch the video.OXO would be wise to sell these cups with two baffles...or at least sell the baffles separately.  I think it's a good quality and somewhat useful cup on it's own, which is why I am giving it 4 stars. But I think I made it more useful...in a way that would generate many more 5-star reviews.You're welcome OXO.
