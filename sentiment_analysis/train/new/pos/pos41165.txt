Bought a mini Dream on Me crib and needed a mattress. This is made for it so it fit snuggly and perfectly. My baby has been sleeping in a pack-n-play for 3 months while we were in transition from renting to moving into our custom built home and it wasn't cutting it. I am so glad I bought this mattress (and mini crib). He sleeps so much better, its the perfect amount of support with the perfect amount of comfort. Not too springy or hard at all. He is 13mths old and 27lbs. Wish I had bought these sooner.NOTE: These mattresses are NOT intended for pack-n-plays. Thus you have many complaints about them not fitting properly. These were made for the Dream on Me mini cribs. Please do your homework on sizing when ordering for pack-n-plays or other brand cribs. One size does NOT fit all. Its not a bad product, just buying the wrong product!
