My son received this at age 4 months as a baptism gift. It's adorable and in my opinion super soft.  He became attached to it when he was about one year old.  We bought a second one for daycare.  At some point he realized there were two and had to have both with him.  He is now six and a half and still loves his "Sheepies".  I have to say Sheepie sleeps with my son every night and has been taken all around the country on trips with us and therefore has been washed dozens, if not hundreds, of times.  We have never had an issue with the fabric falling off.  When I wash it I use the gentle cycle and regular detergent as well as one of those Tide Boost stain release packs.  While Sheepie is not bright white anymore, she looks just fine to us (see pics). In terms of her fur, Sheepie definitely looks raggedy at this point, and little tears in the silky fabric along the seams have had to be sewed by me (by hand, nothing too elaborate), but I think she's held up fabulously, considering the extremely high level of use she has gotten.  I now purchase one of these blankets for every baby gift I need to buy (although not the Sheep one, as that is our special one).  The giraffe and bear are very cute too. We joke that my son will bring Sheepie to college with him.  Only time will tell.
