We went through some bibs before I broke down and ordered this rather expensive one.  It's worth it, with a few things to consider.  First the pluses, we wash ours with the dishes so they don't need laundering.  We have 2 and wash them between meals... I need to get one more to make life easier.  They look cool.  They keep the kiddo clean.  Now the minuses, the piping and reverse side of the bib, including the part on the front of the pouch, are absorbent and do not dry quickly.  They can mildew if not washed and dried quickly.  The artwork can be scratched by scrubbing off dried food.  Still, the best bibs that I've been able to find except for Summer Infant Bibbity (those are the bomb).  I wish they would coat the entire thing and used some waterproof piping.  That would get a 5 star review from this mom.
