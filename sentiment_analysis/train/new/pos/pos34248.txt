This is the best onsie that my son has!  I've been a Superman fan all of my life and it's perfect.  My wife who is an infant teacher says the quality is better than most.  I believe it said it was for 6 months, but he fits in it perfectly (maybe a bit big) at three months and he's not a big baby.  It also shrinks a bit when washed of course.
