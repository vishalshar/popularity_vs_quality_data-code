I ordered this valance for my youngest daughter's room.  She absolutely loves Minnie Mouse and we had recently decorated her walls with Minnie Mouse Bowtique wall decals.  The valance looks great with her window and is so pretty!  It is amazing how one little item can really change/enhance the look of a room.  She was so excited when she saw it!
