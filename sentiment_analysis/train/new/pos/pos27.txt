Just got this product after 3 months but costumer service was very helpful and they did a lot to help. I only rated it 4 stars for the shipping time, but it is definitely worth it. It is super fuzzy and adorable! It will fit my friend as a 15 year old so it is not just for little kids. I don't know what others are saying about the two faces but this is perfect for my expectations! It is very good quality for $5! in this pic for size comparison I have a size 7 foot
