Well made, attractive colors and patterns and a cute bee to chew on. Reading previous reviews, I was a bit concerned about the bee on the ribbon having the potential to wrap around a baby's neck. I agree that this book should perhaps not be left in a crib with a child unattended. The ribbon does not seem long enough to wrap around a neck, but better not to take any chances. However, it is a fun book to read to our infant, she enjoys chewing on the little bee, and Daddy and sister both agreed the book was a worth while purchase. We also chose 2  Lamaze fabric books we are very pleased with (Forest and Firefly), and appreciate this Manhattan Toy book equally for its quality and engaging images.
