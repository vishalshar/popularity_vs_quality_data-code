Love it!. Really good quality and great amount of pockets for all those endless essentials. Impressed as i can also fit my things in there too! Only improvements would be to be able to make the rucksack straps a little shorter and another section inside to keep nappies away from everything else. Otherwise really please with it and the delivery.
