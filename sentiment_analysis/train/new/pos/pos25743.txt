I was a little nervous about ordering this cover at first because the specs are a hair above the standard pad that we typically buy. Luckily for me, I DID NOT buy a typical pad and this fit perfectly! If you use a standard changing pad, it may feel a bit large, but as we purchased the new 4 sided Summer Infant pad, it actually fit perfectly and was a great fit for the larger design. Overall, the material is super soft and looks great! I plan on buying another cover in a different cover to have as a back up!
