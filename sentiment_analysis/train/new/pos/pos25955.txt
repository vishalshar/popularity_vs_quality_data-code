Ideal for any child up to age 4 (dependent on size of course). I started with the infant size and was using the toddler size by 12 months. Roomy enough where you can add extra blanket inside of need be. And the Velco openings make it easy to fit any stroller. This is not the case of other stroller pads I have that don't fit every stroller I have. I also loved the zipper feature, as I was able to keep the fleece pad in the stroller all winter and only zip the top on when I needed it. Every stroller (from a jogger to a umbrella folded easily with the bottom pad left in place.
