I simply love these all in one diapers. I've been using them now for about 3 month and I love to show them off to all my friends or just anyone who will listen. They are super cute and you don't have to get your hands dirty unstuffing them before you throw them in the wash because they unstuff themselves without any problem every time.They are like a cross between an all in one and a pocket diaper, but the best of both worlds. The insert comes out in the wash, but remains attached and simply needs to be stuffed back in before putting it back on baby. This means that it gets cleaner and drys faster (I line dry mine indoors, takes overnight to dry completely) like a pocket diaper. But it eliminates the guesswork of a pocket diaper because the liner remains attached and simply needs to be restuffed back in.I own about 10 of these all in ones and about 10 of the blueberry deluxe snap diapers (some with the minky material). I love them all. These are a little trimmer and cuter and faster for changes than the pockets. The pockets are a little faster to line dry because I machine dry the inserts and only hang dry the covers (those take about 2 hrs to line dry indoors). Plus I think the pocket diapers hold a little more urine so I use them for the all night diaper.But if I could only pick one cloth diaper, these all in ones would be my first choice.
