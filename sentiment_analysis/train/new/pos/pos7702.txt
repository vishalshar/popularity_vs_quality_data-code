I bought this set for my grandson's "Pirate" nursery, everyone loves it! The colors are bright, sheets washed really well - no shrinkage. I like that the bumper is in 4 pieces, makes it much easier to tie. The wall border is 15 feet long which is not mentioned in the description, hopefully this will be updated. The only piece I didn't care for was the window valance. I found it too short (the window is very tall) and looked odd. I ended up adding some navy fabric to the bottom and navy curtain tabs to the top to give it some length, now it's perfect!
