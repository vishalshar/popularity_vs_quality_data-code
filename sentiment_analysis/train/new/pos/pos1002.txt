Update: my 13 month old has now figured out how to open these.Works fine with modifications for recessed outlets. I needed covers for 2 recessed outlets, since the little outlet plugs are nearly impossible to remove from them. Unfortunately the center portion and screw holes don't line up properly with recessed outlets, but that's nothing that a determined mom can't get around. I cut the center portion out using an old knife and a lighter to soften the plastic. I installed one just like this using the top screw only and putting command picture hanging tape on the bottom. The other one I hung exactly the same way, but first used my dremel to sand the cut area smooth.
