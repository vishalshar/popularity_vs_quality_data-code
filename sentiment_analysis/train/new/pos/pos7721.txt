In the process of trying to switch just about everything in my kitchen to stainless steel, I had been looking for a stainless steel sippy cup for a long time. I finally found this one and I love it! It is easy to clean with a bottle brush and is very durable.The biggest "problem" I had with it (which really isn't that much of a problem) was that it got very cold with cold drinks and my little one didn't want to hold it when it was so cold. It sweat a little, but not a whole lot, and the "nipple" is silicone -- so no BPA or plastic on this baby. I loved it for that. I loved that it didn't matter if there was rancid juice or milk in it, it would scrub clean and I felt like I was actually getting it clean -- the plastic sippies always retained a sort of smell to them even if I had washed them. And the bottle brushes would put tiny scratches on the inside, so those never lasted long. Plus, BPA.I do wish that you could buy these nipples somewhere other than online. My son chewed through his (which meant he was ready for a big boy cup, but still) and I needed more. I highly recommend buying some extra nipples when you buy this cup just so you have them on hand. You don't want to be left nipple-less in an emergency like I was! Overall a great buy and if I have another kid, I will be getting this ASAP and starting much earlier.
