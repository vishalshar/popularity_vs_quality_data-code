I love JJ Cole's bibs.Why?They last a lot longer than most others we've tried (the colors start to fade or the bib stains after a year)Durable - daily use and abuse from a child and it still keeps it's shapeNon-Absorbent so my son's shirt doesn't get wet if he spills juice down his bib!! (BONUS)The catch tray is just wide enough to catch whatever he drops/missesEasy to clean - soapy water, wipe, rinse, leave to dry (very quick dry)Adjustments of the sizing grows with my son - which saves us money b/c we didn't need to buy infant size and go up, we just used the large size and waited for my son to grow with itThe material is firm enough to lay flat (no wrinkles) on my son, but not so hard that it leaves red/chafing marks on his neck.Did I mention durable? We have rotated 3 of these bibs over the last 27 months and have only had to replace 2 during that time - only b/c of stains/discoloration and for my own aesthetics - not b/c the product fell apart. We have tried other bibs - they either were absorbent, wrinkled, or the plastic bits started to fall apart or left marks on my kid's neck.
