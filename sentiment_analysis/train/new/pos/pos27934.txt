After reading about the amount of radiation i was bombarding my children with by having WiFi monitors broadcasting, I decided to switch to old school analog. These are super basic and obviously I miss many of the more advanced functions of my video monitors. These are quirky and I have found that other devices in my house can cause static and even other things that are plugged in across the room. For example, if I unplug the apple charger across the room, it actually adds static. So after some experimenting i have landed in a good place where i don't have much static at all and can hear the children at night. The static is not a concern during the day since overall daytime ambiance is louder, therefore it can be plugged in or on batteries anywhere. The range is great. I live in the city, so there is no escaping wifi, nor do i want to as I love technology. I don't however need it broadcasting feet from my developing babies. if you are so inclined to look into the topic, google wiredchild website. Cheers!
