To be honest I was actually looking into this as a dog baggie holder but it is just too large for that. It measures about 5 inches tall and wide. Personally I hate the scent but I don't like lavender. I was just going to order different bags to put in it but haven't found any the right size without having to refold them. Smart on Munchkin's part, sucks for me. But I put it in my diaper bag for my kids and it has been good. The snap seems strong-although I haven't snapped it to anything. And when you pull out a bag only that bag comes out. No bags are partially out like it shows in the picture. So not good for what I was wanting to use it for but good for what it was designed for. Go figure right?
