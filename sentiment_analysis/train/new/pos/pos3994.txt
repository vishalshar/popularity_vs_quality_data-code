Amazing rocker/chair! My husband and I call this the "magic chair."  Both my son and daughter absolutely loved this chair. As soon as I would put them in it, they would fall asleep. I used this everywhere-- inside, outside,for travel.  My daughter is a restless sleeper, but as soon as I put her in it and gave it a few rocks with my foot she nods off to sleep. I cannot say enough.  It's very durable so you'll be able to keep your child in it for a while.  My daughter is 18 pounds and it still is very sturdy.
