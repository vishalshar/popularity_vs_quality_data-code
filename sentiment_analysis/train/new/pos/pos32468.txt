The Tiny Diner portable placemat is a rubber mat that includes a crumb/spill tray to bridge the gap between the table and your little one.  It secures to the table with suction cups that work with many surfaces.The mat is made of a high-quality material that should stand up to lots of use for years to come.  It cleans up easily either in the sink at home (I also called the manufacturer and found out that it's dishwasher-safe in the top rack) or else with wipes on the go.  It will protect your table at home from knicks and scratches from banging utensils and dropped cups.  It minimizes the mess all around with a lip on its border that trips minor spills and a deep tray that hangs over the edge of the table, protecting your baby's lap.  This last feature is a must-have during the independent phase of learning how to use forks and spoons.Away from home, it's a great way to let your child eat according to his or her home routine.  It also protects him or her from germs on the table.  The only drawback is in the transportation.  The mat is a little like a roadmap - you'll never get it folded back as nicely as when it first arrived.  As a result, it can take up a lot of space in a small daytime/afternoon diaper bag.Judging from other reviews, it seems that this is yet another in the long list of love-it-or-hate-it items that are subject to your child's tastes.  Based on our experience, the Tiny Diner is certainly worth a try for its low price - if you can get your toddler used to using it, it will become invaluable.PROS*  Traps all sort of crumbs and spills, including a tray between table and baby*  Protects your table from bumps and scratches*  Durable - I can't imagine it wearing out*  Easy to clean and maintainCONS*  Doesn't fold up very well
