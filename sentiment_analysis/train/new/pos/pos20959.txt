Love this powder. Came upon it at my baby shower. As a fist time Mom I had not a clue what to get and there is so much information online and opinions that I ended up more confused than when I started. I have a 20 month old who has been very active since he was concieved. This powder keeps him dry, prevents diaper rash. He got very sick for about a month with very watery stool, his poor little bottom would be very sensitive, I used this in combination with the cream and it made everything better while the doctors took their time figuring out what was wrong. I always have 3 bottles on hand; one for his room, one for mine and one in the baby bag. Can't be without it.
