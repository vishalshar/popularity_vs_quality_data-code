I really love this tray. It's a great addition to the seat.I know some reviews talked about how the tray wouldn't sit flush with the table. I found that of I put the tray on one arm and then loosened the other arm enough to adjust it a little, then re tightened it, the tray would be flush with no issues. The arms just need to be separated a tiny more bit for it to fit.The only issue I have with the tray is that, on our square table, there is a good size gap between the seat and table. When I had it on a round table that wasn't the case. The gap was much smaller because of the curve shaped.My 7m old drops a lot of food between him and the table because of the gap :/ other than that small issue, we love it and would reccomend it to anyone with this seat.
