My family LOVES this product! It is made of ceramic and has a chalkboard kind of paint on the plate. The chalk stick is actually made of a heavier kind of soapstone kind of chalk and not of some cheap school chalk. I would buy this as a gift for other young families too! We love the idea that this will be with our family for years to come and hopefully one day our kids will remember this fondly and look back at it with lots of love and fun times we have together over the holidays.
