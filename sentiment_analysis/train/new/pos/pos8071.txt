I bought this for my daughter who I wanted to dress up without all the heavy layers. It's a very cute outfit true to the picture. The outfit itself says 0-6m. My daughter wore it at 4 months, a week shy of turning 5 months. We found this outfit to run a little big (her outfit would come to her shoulder if she wiggled too much). Very roomy around all arms, legs and especially her belly! The beanie is cute and it actually fit! (My baby's head was in the 85+ percentile at the time which made outfits like these very difficult to buy) my only complaint is that the booties tend to fall off very easily but it is definitely not a deal breaker. This outfit was a huge hit with my friends, we all work in the healthcare industry. I would buy this outfit again.
