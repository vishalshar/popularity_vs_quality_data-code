Let me start by saying, that these days i literally don't go on road-trips without this pad in my car.As soon as my son turned 11 months and figured out he can just roll and walk-away, it became an everyday struggle to change his diapers. There were days where i would just try to make excuse for not changing his diaper..I know, sounds like bad mom!! But the fights and tears at every diaper change were just too much to handle. I had the changing pad with simple holder like every other pad in market, but it was not strong enough for my son. He would just roll to back and slide off. FINALLY i decided i really need something to stop this.Then came the lifesaver....PooPoose. To be honest, i would never spend this much money on a changing pad, but i was desperate. All in all, i 'm super happy with result....1st time my son struggled, but couldn't get out. And its soft enough, so it wasn't actually poking his skin, but was just holding him in place. As soon as he realized that he can not get out of it, he simply stopped struggling and started playing with toy in hand. Next time i put him there, i didn't even need to put the straps, he just lay there and played with toy...and finally, the evertime-fight ended!!! Now-a-days, i don't even need to add straps, but its good to know that its there if i needed extra hand.I used Babys Journey MeasureMe Changing Pad Cover - Jungle Friends for this changing pad. Just made cuts for straps and it fits perfectly.I do suggest that they should bundle extra replacement strap, or free changing pad cover with this product to make it complete package.But otherwise i am really happy with this purchase.**If you found this review at all helpful, please take a minute to let me know by clicking the button saying this review was helpful to you.
