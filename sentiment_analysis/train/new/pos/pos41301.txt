This thing seriously works! My baby was shrieking from pain. We used this and it helped to 'unplug' her and let out gas and poop that was causing a lot of pain. Instant relief. Be patient and wait 5-10 secs to hear anything. It does not work all the time but if your baby seems stuffed up, I would def try this
