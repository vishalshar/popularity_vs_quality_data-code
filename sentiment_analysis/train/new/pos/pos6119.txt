This replaced a Minnie Mouse branded nap mat we had bought our daughter about a year ago.  However, that minnie mouse nap mat had a cheap feel (felt smooth like vinyl rather than soft like fabric), wore out very quickly, and had a lack-luster pillow.By contrast, I wouldn't call this nap mat warm, but has a cozy softness.  The pillow is also plush enough that when my daughter lays on it, her head is visibly not on the floor (it may sound silly, but her head looked like it was on the floor with her old minnie mouse nap mat).  We've only had it for a few weeks so I can't comment on how it will hold up, but based on my initial impressions I'd expect it to hold up much better than our first attempt.
