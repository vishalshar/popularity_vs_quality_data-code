I just got these in the mail...they're really nice & I love them!  It's funny how other reviewers said they received pink for their boy, well, I have a girl and I received the blue/lime green, but that's okay, you can use blue/gree for a girl.  I thought I'd order another set since my little one is starting to feed herself and these are great for little fingers, however, when I went back on the price went up...SO, I shopped around and I found them on diapers.com for $3.99 - you will pay shipping, unless you have an order over $49, which is the only downfall...however I ordered another blue/green & 2 pink/orange and paid $19, including shipping...but even if you bought 2 on here and I got free shipping, that's only $3 cheaper...so I feel diapers.com is the better bet, even though you pay the shipping.  I love Amazon, don't get me wrong...but I think $8 for 1 set of these is outrageous!
