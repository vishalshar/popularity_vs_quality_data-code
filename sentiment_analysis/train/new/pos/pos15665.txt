I got this for my daughter when she was about 6 months old. She's now 18 months and we still use it for every shopping trip. I try to wash it every couple of weeks and I leave it in the car so we always have it. I love the thickness and that it fits all shopping carts. I've gotten so many compliments and questions about this cover in the grocery store. One of my favorite baby purchases!
