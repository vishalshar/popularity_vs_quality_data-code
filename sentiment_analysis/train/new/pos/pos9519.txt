I like these. I'm glad Amazon tells me what I ordered 4 years ago so I can get the same ones again (thank goodness they're still here!).I do not have children so cannot speak to their utility for babies. I use them for salad dressings (PERFECT size) and storage for small items, such as my dog's heartworm pill (we get the big one and split it).The lid can be tricky to secure onto the container, so care must be taken especially with liquids to put the lid on securely and correctly. Once the lid is on it is definitely air tight. I have not had any salad dressing spill and the second half of the heartworm pill smells as pungently awful as ever a month later. None of these have broken on me, I have just lost track of them over the years.
