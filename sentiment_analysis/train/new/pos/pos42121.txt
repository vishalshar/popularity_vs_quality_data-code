My son is two weeks old and my milk came in pretty quick and lately it has been really increasing, although pumpming is very tedious and take a lot of time, it well worth if for nutrional purposes for my son, however i do wish i had a two pump breast pump as oppose to the single. however this product is great I love it, it works very well and was well worth it for the price, I have to admit my expectations where low because of the other reviews and because it was so cheap but I was pleasantly suprised that it's performance and i would recommend it to anyone needing to purchase a pump on a budget.
