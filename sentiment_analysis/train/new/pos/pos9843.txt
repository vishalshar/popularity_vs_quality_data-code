we use this for my potty training 2 year old when we are out and about and the public toilets are too big for her small tush. the top "handles" have a grippy under neath to keep the seat in place, but I wish there were grippies on the lower parts as well because the handles end up being off the sit sometimes and then there is no way to keep it from slipping around. It folds up nicely and fits into a little clear, thick plastic bag that it comes in. I wanted something that would fit into our diaper bag and hold up my kid on public toilets and this seat does just that. It's not the most practical, but it works for us!
