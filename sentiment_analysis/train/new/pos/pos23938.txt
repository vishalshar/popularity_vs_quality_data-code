I bought this for my 12 year old nephew for Christmas. Imagine my surprise when instead of a "Hand Boiler" it arrived labeled as a "Love Thermometer." It seems odd to describe this as a fun scientific toy for kids, yet it comes in a completely inappropriate package. Sure, it is actually a fun scientific toy, but I'm going to have to find a different box to package it in before Christmas. And maybe I should locate and print out some directions too, because a thermodynamics lesson is no good if you don't know what's actually happening.The Hand Boiler/Love Thermometer/Whatever did arrive in good shape, and it seems to work just fine, so there is that, though.
