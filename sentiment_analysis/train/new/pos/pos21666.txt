Pros:- Easy to fill with a spoon or by pouring directly in- Easy to clean (you can use a bottle brush to be extra thorough)- Holds about double the amount store-bought, one-use pouches contain- My 2 1/2 isn't able to get the screw top open (not accidentally or on purpose) so there is no unexpected mess like reviewers have complained about in other reusable pouchesCons:- The material they are made of seems cheaper and less durable than I had expected (we've only had them for a month, so far they have held up).- The price (they will pay off in the long run, but given the quality of the materials, these didn't need to cost so much)- The screw top design makes it stiff at the top and it's hard for my son to get the final bit out, so there is some wasteOverall:Very worth it. I am happy to recommend these to friends, and I haven't seen another design nearly as good
