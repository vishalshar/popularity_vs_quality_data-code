It is so adorable and looks just like the photo! It seems very sturdy and is the perfect size plus a lil growing room for my daughter who is almost 11 months old.(I held it up to my chest and it provides decent coverage there too!) I bought this in preparation for her first birthday which is going to be cupcake themed. It's made of terry cloth so it should soak up any liquid just fine. Not sure if it would prevent liquid from going all the way through as it won't be tested for another month or so. I haven't washed it yet but I don't see that causing any issues as far as it holding up.
