After several evenings of non-stop crying and waking from naps early, we started putting our newborn in this bouncy seat and turning on the vibrator.  He no longer fusses and will sleep till we wake him.  We even use it during the night if we can't get him to go back to sleep in his crib.  He's too young for the dog attachment still.  The only problem we've had is the vibrator is sometimes louder than others, like something inside is loose.  We haven't found the cause yet; it only happens periodically.  I also wish it had a feature to make the seat rock/bounce on it's own as opposed to you doing it.  He's getting to where he likes both the vibrating and rocking.  But we have backup batteries just waiting since we can't live without it; we call it his little recliner.
