I just love this Carrier.  We used the smaller front/back carrier first at 3months and it was very nice as well but when you switched it to the back at closer a year it seemed uncomfortable to use.  So because we liked it so much we thought we would try this one and the price was nice as well.  It is very comfortable and our 14 month old son seemed content sitting in it for our hike. It also holds up to 40 lbs. [...].  This is a very nice carrier and at a great price...
