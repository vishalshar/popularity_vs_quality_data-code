We invested in a slightly larger 42" inch flatscreen with 3D capability. We find the 3D effects are better when we have it more at eye level than when we wall mounted it, so we have it on a free standing table rather than a specific stand. We also have a toddler who climbs, so all of our bookcases and such are anchored. With the multitude of cords and other paraphernalia associated with the various devices, we could not anchor the table in the same way, so we researched safety items like these. This was perfect for our needs, installed easily, and does exactly what we want it to. Since the table was neither expensive not in perfect shape, I'm not concerned with adding screw holes or other marks, but if you have a high end piece of furniture, be aware that this requires the appropriate installation in order to be fully safe.We still do what we can to limit our daughter from climbing on the tables and bookcases, but hopefully we never have to really test its capabilities!
