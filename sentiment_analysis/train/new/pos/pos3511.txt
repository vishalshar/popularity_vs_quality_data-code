We bought this originally when our first child was born. It served us well until he was too big to fit in the carrier. We hung onto as it and now that we have twin boys, we use it and the exact same one borrowed from a family member, to make life with them easier. We keep them under the seat in the car and so we always have an easy way to carry the babies if we need a quick trip somewhere or the stroller isn't practical. The quality is excellent and being able to face the baby in or out is nice. The material is comfortable to wear and the carrier can be adjusted a lot to fit well. These aren't the cheapest carriers available but you will get your money's worth.
