From previous reviews, I expected the tags to be ginormous, but they're actually just tiny.  Also, the tags all say Made in USA, so the "OMG THESE WERE MADE IN CHINA" reviews do not apply either. I don't bother to run mine through the dryer, I just take them out after the spin cycle and put them right in the wipes warmer (I got the Prince Lionheart Warmies Wipes Warmer ), so the "they get rough when you line dry them" reviews don't apply to me either.So, I like these cloths just fine and may buy more.  My baby has not yet arrived, so I've just been experimenting (or as my husband calls it, "playing"), but I will post an update as soon as I know how they fare against newborn poops.EDIT:  So, my little one arrived and I've been able to try these out with actual baby poo.  They did fine against both the sticky, nasty meconium and regular runny breast-fed newborn poo.Another EDIT:  My daughter is now almost 2 years old, and we still use these little wash cloths for all kinds of things, like washing little faces and hands and wiping up small spills.  I run them through the dryer now, since we don't use the wipe warmer any more (potty training!), but they are still holding up just fine.
