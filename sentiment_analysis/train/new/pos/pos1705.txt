This is a great pump!  I used this pump  several times a day for 7-9 months after BOTH of my daughters were born.  The thing is still going strong!  I never had an issue with loss of suction (a common complaint with pumps over time).  Never had a problem with milk backing up into the tubes.  The breast shields were comfortable.  The cooler and ice pack is very handy for keeping fresh milk cold on the go.  The shoulder bag is discrete yet handy for carrying extras like a nursing cover, bottle brush, wipes etc.
