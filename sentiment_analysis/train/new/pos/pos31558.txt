This is a really cute candle.  I chose to return it, but only because of my own stupidity.  I'm glad amazon has a good return policy! I didn't read the description and assumed that this was a candle that could go on a birthday cake.  I knew it would be bigger, but I guess I thought maybe it would be the size of a standard pillar candle.  This is not the case.  This thing is HUGE and VERY VERY thick around.  There's no way you can put this on a birthday cake.  If you know this purchasing the candle, then it's a good purchase because it IS really cute and a great idea.  It just wasn't what I was envisioning.  The return process was incredibly easy, as always and I would definitely purchase from this seller again! (reading the description all the way through first of course).
