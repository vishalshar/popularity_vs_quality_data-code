I really like this diaper set. I actually bought this because I hated almost all changing mats that came with all diaper bags. I wanted one that was washable, but also waterproof and wipe-able. This set has all of those. It has the neoprene smell, but once you wash it that goes away - and is hardly noticeable anyway. Unexpectedly, I also really like the handy bag that it comes with. It's perfect to carry just a few diapers and wipes when I don't want to carry the large one. I also use it for a mini wristlet for quick runs to the store or wherever when I am without the baby. Highly recommend.
