MY SON IS 5 MONTHS AND HAS NEVER REALLY TAKEN A PACI. HE LOVES THIS ONE! HE HAS ONLY BEGUN TEETHING AND HASN'T ACTUALLY CUT ANY YET,BUT HE PUTS EVERYTHING IN HIS MOUTH AND GETS FRUSTRATED WITH THE TYPICAL TEETHING RINGS AFTER A SHORT TIME .NOT THIS ONE. HE CAN TAKE IT IN AND OUT OF HIS MOUTH AS HE PLEASES TO LOOK AT IT (AS HE LIKES TO DO FREQUENTLY),AND ITS EASY TO HOLD ONTO! THIS TEETHER IS ONE PIECE WELL MADE. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!
