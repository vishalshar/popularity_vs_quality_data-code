I breastfeed exclusively and I always had such a hard time leaving the house with a bottle of breast milk along with the capability of making another bottle. I would put the bottle in a large cup with lid filled with ice. Then I would put my breast pump in a large zip lock bag with ice so I could keep using it and carry a spare bottle to fill. Each of those items were prone to spilling so I couldn't even put them in the diaper bag. When you go on long drives pumping is the only efficient way to feed a baby. Making a stop to feed is so time consuming, but I can pump while my husband or mother is driving and I can sit in the back seat and feed the bottle while someone is driving. This Playtex case is the perfect solution. I can fit two CLASSIC GLASS NURSER EVENFLO Size: 3X4 OZ and my Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump, 1-Count (not attached to the bottle) plus there is a zipper section in front for extra nipples, a pacifier, teething ring, etc... This pack keeps everything cold for a long time. I know it works for six hours and it was still very cold. It also provides a tight fit for my glass bottles so I don't have to worry about them banging around. It doesn't take up a lot of space in the feezer.
