I live in San Francisco and it's really scary to walk down a steep hill with my stroller in front of me, knowing that if I trip my baby could roll away. It was difficult to find one of these safety tethers sold separately from a stroller - a local retailer suggested I use a dog leash, but it was too long and looked sloppy. I like the slight stretchiness of this neoprene fabric - it's comfortable and easy to slip on and off my wrist (I only use it on steep hills). I am buying a second one for our other stroller.
