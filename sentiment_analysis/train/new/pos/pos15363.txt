These cups work well but to be fair you do have to ensure the lids are placed and threaded correctly.  If not then they can leak.  With two kids and a dad who has 1000 things to do I have learnt to check the lid is on correctly before passing it over for use.  Easier than cleaning on the mess if it leaks and I don't realize.Check your lids people!
