I was very happy with this bedding set from the second it arrived.  It comes beautifully packaged, and then when I opened it was better than the picture.  The colors are far more vibrant up close, and it is so soft that my daughter loves laying on it, and rubbing her hands across the fabric.  I'm amazed at how low the price is as I also have a very expensive set from Babies R Us and it is nowhere near the quality of this one (seams already falling apart) and its not as baby friendly as it is more rougher to touch.I will be returning to this company in the future to purchase my next set of bedding.
