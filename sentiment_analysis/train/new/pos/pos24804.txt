I bought two of these cribs, because i was expecting twins and my space was limited. before purchasing i did a lot of research and read tons of reviews of this crib and i felt like it would be a great purchase, and i was not disappointed. I love these cribs, they work perfect for us and our twin boys. My boys are now 8 months old and still sleep in their cribs. I have recommended this crib to close friends. All my relatives and friends who have seen our cribs love them, because they are smaller than regular cribs but save you room but also serve their purpose. it was hard to find bedding for the crib, but there are some on amazon, or you can do what we did, we bought regular size bedding sets and just did some adjustments to it by sowing it and trying to make it smaller and it works great. About the mattress, it does come with a very thin mattress so i had planned to buy a thicker one on amazon, but i been so busy since i've had the boys i kept putting it aside, and honestly until now my boys are 8 months and still sleep with the thin mattress and they seem to sleep just fine, but i do think i should order a thicker mattress now that they are getting bigger and heavier. i would absolutely recommend this crib. i have nothing negative to say about it. we love our mini cribs :)
