We purchased 2 of these seats: one for my car and one for my mother's car for my daughter. They are very sturdy and easy to install. They are durable and have lasted her through her whole life.We don't use the cupholder or the other small attachment for either seat. An infant doesn't need them and now that she's a toddler, I know she would rather play with them than use them for their intended purpose.My daughter loves her seat. It's comfy and she likes to fall asleep while in the car.I think the only complaint that I do have is that the top hole for the shoulder straps aren't higher for when she gets bigger. (My daughter is tall for her age.)I've seen several complaints about the buckle not being easy to open and it pinches. First, you don't want the buckle to be too easy to open so the kids can't open them while you are driving. When my son was younger and still in a seat like this, he could open the buckles by himself when he was 3. My daughter can't open these, which I'm thankful for.And when it comes to the pinching, make sure the child's fingers and other body parts are out of the way when it's being buckled. We, as adults know that when you put your finger in the way of a buckle, it's going to pinch. Babies, and toddlers, don't know better, and yes, infants wiggle. The parent buckling the child in should know to move the baby's extremities out of the way.I accidentally pinched my son in his seat - not this one (the buckle on his was MUCH smaller than the buckle on this seat) and he still got pinched. After that, I made sure that he was out of the way of the buckle when I pushed it the whole way in.
