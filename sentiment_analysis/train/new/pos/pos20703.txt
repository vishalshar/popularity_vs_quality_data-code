First of all due to the other reviews i hesitated for MONTHS about buying this. We are expecting our third child under three years old and i walk/jog everyday. With that being said, we JUST got it in the mail today and i LOVE it! I was so worried because the other reviews said that it was only for smaller infants. My 35lb 2.5 year old fits fine in the back.. her 30lb 1.5 year old brother fits just fine right beside her too. When the new baby comes my daughter will ride in the front.. but unless you are amazon sized children they'll be just fine. If your kids fit fine in a double then they'll be fine in this. Infact my daughter loves it so much she has been sitting in it, inside the house for the last hour. The wheels are NICE and it pushes great on the carpet. I can't wait to try it out tomorrow. The only thing i could see as being a space issue is if you are trying to put older kids with longer legs.. maybe a 5 year old would be cramped?
