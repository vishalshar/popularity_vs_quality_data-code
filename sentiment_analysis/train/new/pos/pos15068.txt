My daughter loves this seat. She's never complained about it being uncomfortable once, not even on long journeys. It boosts her up a suitable amount to bring the seat belt over the shoulder and has an adjustment loop to pull the belt to a snug fit. The seat easily moves between the grandparents car and mine without any hassle (no awkward clips or brackets etc.).The only downside is that the seat doesn't give the same level of lateral support as a true child seat and when the child is sleeping they can lean over the side of the seat and put the seat belt in a non-optimal position. So far it hasn't been an issue but it's something to watch out for.
