So far, so good.  Just got it today - straight from the fedex truck to my daughter for her 5th birthday.  She loves it a lot.  I had to write the review already because I wanted people to know how perfect it was for her size.  Note the picture... it is a shorter back chair than what I think some reviewers were thinking.  That's just the style of it, the seat + the arms are wider than the height..  However, my daughter who is plenty TALL for her age (easily wearing size 6 or 6x for length to give you an idea) does not look too big, especially when she kicks her feet up on the footstool.  The size is perfect.  There's plenty of room width wise in the seat, too.  I'm not saying you'd be able to fit 2 kid in it but there's a good 5-6 inches (just guessing, it could be more) of free space when she's in it.  I even had her 7 year old sister, also extra TALL for her age (as in, fits in size 8 pants around but has to wear a 10 for length), test it out so I could give a better review.  As expected, it hits her lower on the back, but there's still room in the seat to be comfortable.  When I ordered it, I had plans to replace the approx. 1" wooden feet with something a little longer (or higher, or whatever one says when talking about furniture feet) but I don't know now.  If I do, it won't be any time soon.  So, to sum it up... this was a great buy and a big hit for my little birthday girl.  If I can figure out how, I'll post a few pics so you can see how it looks with a kid her size.
