I absolutely adore this straw cup and I'm really bummed out that they're actually really hard to find. These cups are super easy to clean and you don't have to refeed the straws in some wonky way like the Munchkin flip top cups. The closure to these sippy cups is genius, you just slide the top part over the straw and it folds into the cup, nice and safe for a later date. No extra pieces to keep track of and no dirty straws. They seem to be extremely leak proof and an all around great straw cup.
