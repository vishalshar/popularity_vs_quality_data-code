The udder cover is my favorite when it comes to nursing cover-ups. The material is lightweight so you and baby don't get too hot. The strap makes it easy to slip off and on with one hand. The best part is the rigid neckline. It's wide enough so you can see baby, but not too wide that you feel exposed. I have several types of nursing covers, but I find that all I ever use is my udder cover. They also wash and dry well. It's the only nursing cover I recommend to expectant mamas.
