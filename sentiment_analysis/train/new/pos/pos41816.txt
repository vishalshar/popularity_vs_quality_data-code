My newborn is like most other newborns, in that she is both fascinated and soothed by music and light.  Well, good news for iPod (and most other MP3) owners, because this product offers both, and at an INCREDIBLE price.For $20 beans, you've got a very good (not Bose quality of course)crib-attachable speaker system which you can hook up an iPod to, AND it emits an alternating series of colored lights.I put a playlist for my daughter together with Baby Einstein songs, and Mozart and other classical pieces, and along with the lights, she's pretty much in baby-bliss when she's in the crib (assuming she's not hungry or in need of a diaper change).The cool thing is, unlike a crib CD player, you don't have to worry about changing CD's, because of the convenience of MP3 compression.Just make a large playlist for your child, plug it in, hit play, and worry no more.  It even has a timer, so that you don't kill the batteries.Speaking of batteries, that's another convenience.  No worries about dangerous wires hanging in and out of your baby's crib.This is a must-have, and the ONLY reason NOT to get one, is if you don't own an MP3 player of any kind.
