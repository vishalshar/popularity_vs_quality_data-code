I got this to put my husband's shirts in a separate location from the other laundry. It arrived promptly, unpacked easily (plastic envelope just unsnapped and the whole hamper slipped out of it). Cardboard base is covered in the same fabric and was difficult to find for a minute, but it was packed in the base and just fell into place at the bottom when I unfolded the hamper. Tall enough to keep the cats out of it. I don't know how it would do for kids toys tho as it appears to be cardboard covered with fabric and my kids were pretty rough on things, but it seems great for the lightweight use I plan and the price seemed reasonable. Well constructed.
