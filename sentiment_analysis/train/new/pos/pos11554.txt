The product title is strange, but the product arrived looking exactly as the picture shows.  There are 4x legwarmers, the colors are a mauvey-pink (not pastel girl pink), light forest green, a rich dark turquoise, and a light blue (again not a pastel boy blue, more of a light/steel blue).  The top half is knit and the bottom half is lacey.They don't yet fit well on my 1-mo. old (~ 9 lbs) but I'm not terribly surprised by that.  They ruche a lot, which isn't an issue, but the bands aren't big enough to stay on her tiny feet.  No big deal, I'm sure they will fit better in a couple of months.I assume the lacey part is meant to be closest to her feet, while the knit part keeps her thighs warm.  But, the band around the knit part is slightly smaller than the band around the lacey part, if that makes sense - and the lacey part is more stretchy, so I might end up having her wear them 'upside down' and give her ruffle legs (like a rufflebum, but legwarmer style, I guess!)The colors don't necessarily match all the baby clothes I have owing to the lack of the standard pastel-colors, but I do like that they are solid.  For the price, these are absolutely the best deal on legwarmers on Amazon.
