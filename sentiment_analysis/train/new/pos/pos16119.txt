LOVE that it keeps our son out of the dishwasher and oven(yes we used it for our oven, but we haven't been able to use the oven since he threw out the oven knob! one issue we had with it, we positioned it wrong, a little too tight, and after we waited 24 hours with it unlatched, I latched it, and the plastic came away from the sticker(sticker was still stuck to our wooden cabinets) I had to super glue it back together and it's holding, but I don't know how long, as out son seems to have figured out that he can just pull it from the bit that is curved.
