I purchased this item as a bike lock for my youngest- there was little reason for her to carry a big heavy lock around for a child's bike that is only ridden to the playground, but I did want something that would deter casual theft.A halfway decent pair of cable cutters would go through the cable on this lock in a matter of seconds. So this will not deter any serious thief. But it will stop somebody who happens by from walking off with whatever you have locked up, which is generally all you need anyway. It is also handy for locking up bike helmets, bags, or other accessories that are not exceptionally valuable but could be easily carried off.I didn't have any problem setting the combination- this is a great feature as I can set it to something easy for the kids to remember and even match it up with the other bike lock combinations. I will never buy a non-resettable combination lock again.Overall this is a decent lock for casual use. I do wish the cable was a bit longer, but other than that it works well for it's purpose.
