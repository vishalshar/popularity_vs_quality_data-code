I purchased this item as giving my daughter a bath was killing my knees and I was looking for a seat low enough that I wouldn't have to bend over too far to do so.My wife and I looked at several options, and decided on this item for the following reasons:1) Two heights.2) Internal storage for our daughter's bath toys.3) Future usability as a step stool for our daughter.The two heights are perfect! My wife prefers the lower height and I prefer the higher height. Both are stable. The design for the height adjustment is rather interesting, as all you need to do is rotate the lid 180 degrees. There are cut outs and contact points that enable this functionality. I have to say that this item has certainly improved the ease of bath time for our daughter for both my wife and I.It is worth noting that this item (as outlined on the packaging and on the plastic of the seat lid) that this should only be used as a step stool on the lowest setting.
