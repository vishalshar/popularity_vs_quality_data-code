I had already bought my own side by side twin stroller and car seats for my nephew twins.  It was just too much trouble taking them constantly out of his suv everytime my sister and I wanted to take them places. This bag I was not sure was going to do the trick but was pleasantly surpised!  It is perfect for putting in diapers and treats and sippy cups. It is not too big and bulky. Really happy with it. Very inexpensive too. Spent enough money on the other things and was happy to find this bag on Amazon. I also bought the car seats and stroller items on Amazon also. I intend to give a review of those items after using them tomorrow.
