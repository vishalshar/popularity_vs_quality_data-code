Being that this is a new product without any reviews I had to say something about it. We went out on a limb and ordered this pack and play for our son. It was easy to put together. Even just home from the hospital and sleep deprived I managed with some help from grandma.  The changer is the sturdiest I have seen on Gracos products and the fact that it is detachable has been a life saver. It is actually soft and very easy to wipe down.The wipe area keeps them moist so far and is part of the detachable area along with two little areas for diapers etc. The bassinet is spacious with the vibration under the pad instead of built into the music control with the added bonus of moving it around also. There is extra storage under the changer with dividers to toss in the extras so they are even handier. The only thing we haven't done is take it down. I am hoping that isn't a pain to do. Overall I am really glad we purchased this over any of the others we were looking at. We definitely are the hesitant to purchase without reading tons of reviews but my curiosity won out with this and am glad it did.
