This a review comparing Medi-Rub Foot Massager 2000 (this foot massager) Vs. MedMassager MMF06 MedMassager MMF06 11 Speed Foot Massager.Most foot massagers on the market kneed, rub or push your feet.  That just hurt me. I wanted  a massage machine that vibrates (or as many reviews have points out, it actually oscillates, not vibrates).  So, I looked at pretty much every foot massager on amazon, and I found this machine and the MedMassager.  I could not find any other machines that vibrate for the foot.So, I read the reviews for both. And both of them had good reviews. I then tried to figure out which machine is better.  I couldn't figure it out from the reviews or from google. So, I bought both machines. I figured I would bring one to my work and one at home.OK, here are my thoughts:SIZE:  Both of them are about the same height.  But, the Medi-rub is slightly higher, slightly wider and slightly longer. When I say slightly, I mean like one inch.LOOKS:  Both of them look almost the same. They look boring. But that is OK.  I don't think either have been updated for looks since they first came out.SOUND:  Both sounds have about the same level.  But, the Medi-rub sounds like a refrigerator hum and MedMassager sounds like punch, punch, punchCORD LENGTH:  Both of them are exactly the sameSPEEDS:  Medi-Rub has 2 and MedMassager has 11 -  This is why I thought MedMassager might be better.  But, see my comment below about feelFEEL:  Hands down the Medi-Rub works much better than MedMassager.  I thought the MedMassager would be better as it has 11 speeds. But, the oscillation, vibration or whatever the mechanics are feels much better on my feet when I use the Medi-rub. I only use the low setting.  I tried all 11 speeds on the MedMassager and I felt the intensity changing, but none of them felt particularly good on my feet as the Medi-Rub didBOTTOM LINE:  Either one is fine. But, the Medi-Rub is  better in feeling on my feet.PIC:  See my pic, comparing each massager (you can see one of my feet on each one)
