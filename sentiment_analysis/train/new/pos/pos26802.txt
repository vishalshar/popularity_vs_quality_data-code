I like this product because of the convenient snaps. It is so easy to just unsnap the insert rather than reaching between cloths into a wet or poopy diaper to remove the insert as some cloth diapers are designed. I have washed and used this on my child several times and I have very few issues with it. The snaps are durable. I would recommend a buyer to consider also using the other insert as described in the Product Description box as sometimes I would have leaks on the side of the diaper when he had those watery or larger feces. However since I can just snap this insert off and rinse the waterproof diaper, I was not complaining. I ended up using this during the day when my child was younger and at night when he was about 2 years old for the occasional accident. He made more accidents at night when he was younger than he does at 2 years old.
