I wish I had found this activity dog before registering for two from more popular brands.  Not only is the price on this toy way better than those popular brands, this toy is way more fun!  My daughter is 6 months old and loves this.  It appeals to her for so many reasons, but I have learned that anything with teething features is a must and these doggy teething ears are perfect.  She also loves pulling the doggy paws and just the other day she fell asleep holding the orange paw in her hand.  The orange fabric is kind of shiny metallic, too, so that's really different for her.  The other toys I have, an elephant and a peacock from those popular brands are so boring compared to this toy.  Only one has a teething feature and it's not even easily accessible to the baby...it's the elephant's necktie so it doesn't dangle or anything.  And the peacock just makes a crinkle sound and there's nothing to chew on it.  Like this doofy dog, it does have a squeaker feature, but my daughter is too young to be able to squeeze on her own to produce the sound.  Since this is pink, it's geared for girls, so if you need an activity toy for the car seat or stroller, get this for your little girl because it's so cute and fun.
