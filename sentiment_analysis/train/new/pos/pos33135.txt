I am thrilled with this product.  My toddler loves to tug at the oven handle, especially when it's on.  She's not been able to open it yet, but I really needed to do something.  It was super easy to install and has held tight while using the oven numerous times.  Essentially this product is a locking hinge.  It adheres to to the oven face and a tab locks in place in front of the oven door.  It's a brilliant idea.  I had tried some side locks but the way my oven is recessed I couldn't make those work.  I can't imagine a domestic oven that these wouldn't work with, maybe a double oven.In theory it's very easy for mom or dad to operate. That is, the theory.  I find that it's definitely a two-hand operation.  I have to open the oven door slightly to open or close the tab.  the oven handle gets in the way.  It's a little tricky, That's why I gave it four stars instead of five.  I suppose this could be seen as an extra-security feature.  I just have to use the oven light rather than opening the door to check my casseroles, pizza, and pasta dishes.I got the two pack, but one is definitely enough.  Each lock is about inches wide so I wouldn't have space to install two of them and over an inch tall.  I will keep the second one in case this one breaks or the adhesive fails.As it mentions on the packaging, this is a deterrent rather than an absolute lock.  Precocious or determined children will probably eventually find their ways past it.  You should still monitor your child's activities in the kitchen especially when the oven is turned on.
