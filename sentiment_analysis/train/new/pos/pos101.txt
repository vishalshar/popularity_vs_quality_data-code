I love buying products that do what it says its supposed to do.  It was pretty easy to assemble and it has kept my little one from falling off the bed.  The mesh is breathable so thats great.  The bars are metal, so she's bumped her head a few times.  Just buy the floatation devices you can swim with, cut it open, and put it over the metal bars as a cushion and presto, no more bumping head on the metal bar!
