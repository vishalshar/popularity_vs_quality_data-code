This set looks very cute! And it is nice purple color. The only thing is what I don't like so much is the material of set. It is not 100% cotton. So we don't use the sheet on the bed. But for this price you cannot await high quality and good material.I would recommend it to those who cannot invest much in bedding set.It looks very good :)
