I bought this monitor mainly because I wanted the walkie talkie feature and the two receivers to leave one on each floor of the house.  When I got it, I charged it up and  have been using it daily for over a month now and absolutely love it.  They hold the charge for what seems like forever (I've charged them twice in the past month even though I use them 3-4 hours every night) and the sound is so clear and perfect.  The walkie talkie is useful for my husband and I to talk to each other as well as talk to baby when she starts squirming.All in all, I'm extremely happy with the price and utility of the Tria and would highly recommend it to anyone who was as confused about buying a monitor as I was.  They seem to be really cheap and simple plastic objects but I wasn't willing to spend the extra money for an extravagant video monitor.  The only problem I could find is that there is no vibrate or lights only setting so if you want to monitor your baby during a conference call or something then this is not the way to go, but that's not what I needed so it's ideal for me.  Simple, easy to use and understand - I wish that all the baby products I have were as wonderful.  As for the buttons being too close to each other, they are labeled so you can read it before pressing it and I have not had a problem with that.  The slight beep before talking is just the way walkie talkies have always worked so that doesn't bother me either.Good luck finding the monitor that suits you, as I have found it in this one.
