This seems to be a secure seat, and our almost-5-year old is comfortable in it.  The buckling system is a bit inconvenient - you really have to get your head down there and put the strap in just right to get the side thingy snapped.  I wish our son could buckle himself in at this point, but this seat makes it too hard.  It's also not a seat you want to do air travel with, as it's unwieldy to carry around.  But, all in all I would say it's a good purchase.
