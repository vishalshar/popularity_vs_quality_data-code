I never leave positive reviews. That being said, holy sh*t, these things are a godsend!!! I have been terrrrrified for weeks to clip my newborns nails bc when she was a couple weeks old I accidentally clipped her fingertip off with the stupid bulky "safety first" clippers that came with her grooming kit. Lots of screaming, blood, and tears landed us in the emergency room. Not fun with a newborn baby especially as a first time parent. Traumatizing. I didn't clip her nails for so long, I left her with mittens and every time I took them off or they fell off she'd scratch herself up and bleed more. Finally I looked online, saw these, and ordered them thinking they looked just as dangerous and would never work but giving it a shot anyway bc I was desperate. Today I used them and I will NEVER use regular clippers again. These are amazing. Beautiful. Glorious. Hands down my favorite baby product. So easy and effective, I was completely comfortable using them to cut my daughters nails. If you've had trouble with regular baby clippers, buy these now!!!
