Our first son (now 4 years old) had trouble transitioning from bottle to cup when 1 years old. We purchased every cup there was spending a fortune! Once i purchased these for him he used them without any problems! It was like magic! Now, having twin boys, they have been using these since they were 15 months old (currently they are 18 months old and they were preemie is the only reason we stuck with the bottle until they were walking as they are delayed a few months on development and were only wearing 6-9 month clothing (which was big on them) when we started winging from bottle at 15 months old. At first they didn't want nothing to do with them, but i removed the handles to make it more like their bottles and it worked! So give that a try if you are having trouble (:
