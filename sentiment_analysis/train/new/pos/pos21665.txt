Not sure about a van full of kids, but it's perfect for me. I just loop the elastic over the passenger seatbelt latch (that belt snaps into) to keep it in one place either in front or in back, and it never tips over. It's about the size of a plastic jug of vinegar or bleach with the top handle portion cut off. Love it.
