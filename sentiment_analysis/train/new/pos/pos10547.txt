These diapers are a better fit, better absorbency, better everything for our newborn.  We liked this brand of diaper for our toddler and wanted to try when our secon child came.  The design of the diaper is what I like the best as they seem longer which allow for a much better fit.  And for our newborn, does not seem to imprint on his skin(as well make it red) like the Pampers Swaddler.Why I give it 4 stars:The downside to the size 1. The packaging is small in quantity and Babyganics is hard to consistently find on line.  They only distribute through BabiesRUs and now Target, but no plans to distribute consistently through a source like Diapers.com.  I was at our BabiesRUs store yesterday and- as usual- they had very little stock of all the sizes (although tons of size 3 for some reason).  This particular day no 1's and no 6's (which is what our 2.5 year old wears and this store is in a big city (Dallas).
