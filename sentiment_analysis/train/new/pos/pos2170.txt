I decided to purchase this playmat after seeing it in Parents magazine's Nov. 2009 issue ("54 Best Toys of the Year").  My daughter is 3 months old and loves playing with this!  The playmat is very colorful and visually stimulating, and the puffy toys (mommy, daddy, baby, cat, flower and sun) are of excellent quality.  I especially like that it has 3 "modes" - folded up into a 3D "dollhouse" (one side of the mat), unfolded it has different scenes on the other side of the mat, or with the sides folded up and rainbow going across the top so that she can kick and grab the toys.  There is always lots for her to look at, and the different toys make various sounds (the flower is crinkly, the cat jingles, the baby has a squeaker in it, etc.).  The baby, cat and flower are on different shapes of different colors, which will be great when she is old enough to start learning shapes, colors and simple words (like baby, cat and flower).  These 3 toys also have soft velcro on the back, and can attach to the outside of the "dollhouse".  The playmat folds up for easy storage and mobility.It may be a little on the pricey side, but in my opinion, it is worth it.  She will be able to play with this for many months:  the playmat with sides folded up from 0-4mos and for tummy time (there is also an unbreakable mirror that comes with the mat), the flat mat with scenes on either side once she is sitting up, and the dollhouse when she is 6mos+.  The different shapes, vibrant primary colors and simple yet visually stimulating design and excellent construction make this a great playmat and toy.  It is also unlike any others that I have seen in stores or online, so it makes for a great, unique gift.  Highly recommended!
