These ended up being kind of my sons first toys.  He loves the twisted ball, is has rings that move along the wires and little balls that make noise on the inside.  It's easy for him to get his little hands around, flexible and bright.  The elephant one's head moves back and forth when you shake it, and it is also easy to grab, with the ears made of a rubber like material that is softer and easier to teeth on.  The third piece is almost like a musical instrument, it looks like little cymbals.  It is harder to grab, but is fun to shake around.  These are incredible deals for only $10 a set.  We love them!
