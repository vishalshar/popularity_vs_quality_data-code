Received today! This is so adorable! If you can imagine its even cuter in person. It runs pretty large but I'm excited about that (more time for my baby, Kane Luciano, to wear) I cant wait to show off to my friends. I saw a lot of reviews about the hat being too small and it may be but as of now my 4 lb preemie is swimming in it. So, for 10-12lbs it could be small but For my baby I believe it'll fit up to at least 6 months maybe a year IDK for sure but We shall see. I will update in future when baby outgrows! SO PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE!
