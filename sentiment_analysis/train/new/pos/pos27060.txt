We live in Northern Alabama and summers are warm, but the air conditioning is cold.  I've battled to find the right weight sleep apparel for my kiddos and this sleep sack has been great.  It keeps them warm but not sweaty.No, I don't love that it's polyester, but it's light and washes/dries very quickly which is a huge plus.  The zipper is fine. The size runs large but that's OK.  I've been using a Large for my baby boy from 6-10 months (he's worn 18-24mos clothing during this time).  His feet stay tucked in it since he's not walking anyway.  At 10 months he's starting to stand and this is still big on him but he can move around wearing it.My 2yo daughter has one of these but it's pink (plus another fleece one by same maker - sizing the same).  It's XL and she's been wearing it at the same time as 2T-3T clothing.  It's still large on her and she has to hold up the extra material when she walks (see pic, she was 33.5" tall, 27lbs).  She figured it out though, so no biggie.The only other thing to note is the material pills (pic attached).  The one pictured has been washed at least 30 times, but it's been the same amount of pilling since wash #2 or 3.  Doesn't affect performance but it looks old and used more quickly than in actually is.  Regardless, these sleep sacks are worth it in warmer weather.  We've tried about 7 alternatives and this is the clear winner.
