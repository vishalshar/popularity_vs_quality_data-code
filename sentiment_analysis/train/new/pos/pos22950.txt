I love these cups and so does my kids. My son says they look like an adults travel mug more than a sippy cup. He feels like a big boy when drinking out of it. I also have the cups with spouts in just about every character so I love that this lid also fits on those cups. He loves he can have whatever character cup but with a big boy lid. My sister in law had to buy one for my nephew because he wanted one after he saw my sons! Great product.
