Got this in the mail after a Huggie's wipes wristlet broke in the diaper bag and soaked everything!  I wanted something cute but also durable.  This wipebox fit the bill.  It doesn't have a dispenser like the past wipes carrier I had, but I like that better since my 15-month old doesn't feel the need to continuously open it up just to take the wipes out one by one.  Keep in mind a whole bunch of wipes don't fit in this (I put in maybe 20 wipes at a time.), but I don't mind since the compactness of the case is more convenient to me than carrying many wipes.  I bought 3 of these (in different designs).  One for the wipes we use for the dogs paws, one for the diaper bag, and one for the bathroom.  I don't mind what to do when travelling b/c I would just bring a big ziplock with the extra wipes for the trip.  Love it and highly recommend!
