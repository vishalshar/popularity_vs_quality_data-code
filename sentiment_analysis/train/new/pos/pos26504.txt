Our daughter is quickly approaching the 18 month mark and has taken to sprawling out on the bed (we co-sleep).  Without the bed rail, we had to squeeze up against the far wall, to be certain that she wouldn't fall off the bed.  This rail works great so that she can sleep next to that and I'm not becoming one with the wall while sleeping.  There are two under the mattress anchors that are adjustable for a twin, full, or queen mattress.  We have a queen and no amount of leaning on the bed rail has managed to shift it.The only downside is that it isn't available in more print choices.
