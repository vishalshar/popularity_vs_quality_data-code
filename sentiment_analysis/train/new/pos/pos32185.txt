After returning a gracco petite glider, I decided to try another small swing from a different company.Likes:Super quiet: Sometimes I don't switch it off all the way and I don't notice that it still is onIt works!, which is always nice after another product doesn't6 speeds: the highest is a nice fast speed w/out being dangerous of courseMusic: Charming, whimical, and the speaker is clearAppearance: Soft fabric, cozyIt has a timer: 15, 30, 45 minSetup: Easy enough, you do need a screw driver, but that's it.Baby likes it!! He sleeps in it every morning,Size: doesn't take up a lot of room at allDislikes:Toy bar: Isn't adjustable enough, so if you keep it on you just have to mind the baby's headHarness: I found it hard to adjustPower dial: Clicks loudly to turn on and adjust speeds, and sometimes it gets left on the lowest speed b/c I didn't realise I didn't  click it all the way down to power off.I've had it for a couple of weeks. So far so good!Update: Even though it was everything I wanted in a swing my baby at 2months really didn't like to swing in it anymore. So it's in a closet now : ( Good thing my in-laws paid for it.
