I got an original latex pacifier at the hospital when my son was born, since then I have been looking for these everywhere.  I had to buy other kinds because I was desperate, but my son cannot suck very well so it was a waste of money.  I do not understand why MAM does not sell these pacifiers on their website. They have a whole page dedicated to natural latex and it's benefits, but you cannot get natural latex pacifiers anywhere.  Thanks to Amazon I finally got them.  I give this product four starts because I did no receive the model that I chose when I ordered, but it's not a big deal because I'm about effectiveness not looks.
