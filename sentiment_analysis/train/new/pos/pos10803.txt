Love these beads for baby.  This 3 month old enjoys looking at the beads and especially holding them. Each large bead and its shape give the baby a specific tactile, different nubby feel, in the palm of his hand---he really likes it.  There is enough "wing tips" for him to easily find for a mouth feel without frustrations.  The colors are bright and the eyes on the insects are very visible and clear.  The beads are strung with a heavy, white washable cord.  There is substance to these beads, without a heavy weight.  IF, I had to give a negative on this, it would be that when he holds up the beads the length sometimes slips under his 90 degree bent elbow and he can't pull out of that position on his own yet, he gets locked, and he tries very hard to pull the beads up to his face and it just won't reach. The beads are not too long and not too short, they are just right for this baby bear.
