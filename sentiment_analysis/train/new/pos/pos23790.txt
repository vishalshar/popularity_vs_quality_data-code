I love this stroller frame: One of my best baby purchases, which we've used countless times already! (My daughter is five weeks old.)I have the Graco Snugride car seat and did loads of research, but couldn't decide between the Graco or Kolcraft stoller frames. Ultimately, apart from the great price, I chose this Strolee because it folds up SO compactly. It even has a strap so you can sling it over your sholder when folded. The Strolee is perfect.It folds up really easily, and is super lightweight. When folded, you can lock it so that it doesn't spring open accidentally.I love that it's not big and bulky, and it handles really well. I've had no problems taking it shopping in downtown San Francisco. I also love that you can push it with one hand.Possibly the only negative is that the basket underneath isn't enormous, or that easy to get to. But I haven't found that to be a problem at all. The basket pulls down easily enough to put things in while the car seat is in place. (You can put things in the basket from the front or the back of the stroller.)If you're looking for a lightweight, easy-to-use stroller frame for your car seat (and c'mon, at this price) look no further.
