I received this night light about a week ago and am very happy with it.  It was a little hard getting used to the glow of the light (it seems more like a flourescent light), but it's not a big deal.My twins (15mos) were driving me crazy pulling our prior night light out the wall every day, and I was afraid they would break the bulb in their hand.  This night light seems very safe and they have only gotten it out of the wall once in the past week (our wall is not perfectly flat).I would recommend this light to anyone with a curious toddler with a low to the ground outlight.  This was just what I was looking for!
