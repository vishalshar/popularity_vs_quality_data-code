I wanted so badly to like this product! Everyone thought I was nuts buying it, and I kept telling them "babies love the bucket!" But the truth is, it is not ideal for bathing newborns. It was super hard and scary bathing my daughter in this, and absolutely required the help from my husband. Aside from it being scary for us, my babe hated it and screamed bloody murder every time we tried it. So after like 4 times bathing her, I put it away until she was 2 months old. This time it was a bit easier, and she was calm in the tub - but it was still hard to wash everything. The calmness was short-lived and she wailed the moment I put her in the tub...this went on for the next month. I finally gave up and bought a different bath. I will try this again at 6 months because I really believe she will eventually like it, darnit!Here are the good things about this tub:It uses very little water!Bathtime takes literally less than 5 minutes. The louder she screams, the faster I bathe her.UPDATE:My child is almost 5 months old, and I gave this a whirl again. She seems to really enjoy sitting in the bucket! It seems the older she gets the easier it is to use this thing...as she now holds her head up very well so I don't have to constantly hold it up.
