This is excellent for an "old school" mobile (read: not electronic). The reason I didn't give it five stars is that it comes with a very long cord/string for attachment - so long that it's really too long for most things, particularly in our baby's co-sleeper. There's a bead that may be intended to help adjust its length BUT there were no instructions and, sorry, but the last thing exhausted parents are going to do is diddle around with anything aggravating. Because of this, since our baby can now reach the mobile it is a safety hazard so even though she isn't even four months old yet, we must remove it (planning to use again either in her playspace or when she's in her crib). She has enjoyed it a good deal thus far, since the pieces are designed to be visible TO the laying baby. Instructions for adjusting length/height would make a big difference, though.
