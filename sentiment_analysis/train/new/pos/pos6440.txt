I love the case; it has not only done the job of protecting my electronic device, but it is a very attractive looking case that draws great attention to it's appearance.  The leather is real and the color of the case is a "true" purple.  I would recommend this case to anyone who has a 7" Lenovo tablet.  It fits in all the right places (where openings are needed, they are there) as well as being attractive.  One of the best buys I have made from Amazon!
