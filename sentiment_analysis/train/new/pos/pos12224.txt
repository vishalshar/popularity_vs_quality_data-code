So, I was nervous reading reviews and being new to cloth diapering that the sprayer would not be powerful enough to get all the poop and such off the diaper. Well, to my delight, I was totally wrong! This sprayer has some POWER to it.  My husband joked that he can't imagine how people could use it as a bidet, b/c the water pressure is enough to where it probably wouldn't feel so great for that use. It was easy enough to install, although it did lack detailed installation instructions. The directions were extremely basic and were written on the outside of the box, but there really wasn't much to that installation.  So, if you don't have someone around is at least somewhat handy person, you might want to recruit one -- it's well worth it. It took all of 5 minutes to install. Just check your connection on your toilet to make sure it's the right one, before you purchase it (a metal one, rather than plastic). I saw some reviews where their toilet didn't have the correct connector.  However, I have also read the connector is easy to change out/update for the "right" one at the local hardware store, that will work with the sprayer connection. Someone more hardware savvy than myself would know all about that, and again, this isn't rocket science--it's just replacing one connection with another to suit your needs. I would recommend this sprayer to ANYONE in cloth diapering.  So much cheaper than some of the other bigger name brand sprayers out there -- and overall seems to have way better reviews than any of them, too. So glad I went with this one!
