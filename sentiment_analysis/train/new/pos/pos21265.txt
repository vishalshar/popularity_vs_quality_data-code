Most of us buy straw cups because our little one isn't quite careful enough to handle a real cup but needs a faster flow than a sippy cup allows.  These are light weight, the seal around the straw is the best I've found from any straw cup, and they hold up in the dishwasher.  They're also the most spill resistant I've found yet.  Yes, if she throws it on the floor from her stroller or high chair it might burst open, and if she leaves it lying on its side, it will slowly drain.  But it doesn't leak at all when she just knocks it over or drops it from her own height by accident.  The seal between the cup and the lid could be a bit better (it doesn't leak when tipped upside down yet over time little droplets form around the base of the lid), and they've got to do something about the cups all sticking together when you first remove them from the packaging.  I wouldn't give an imperfect product five stars, but these straw cups are definitely the best we've found so far (and we've tried five brands now).
