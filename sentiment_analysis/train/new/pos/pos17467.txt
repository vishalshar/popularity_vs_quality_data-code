Let me just say that this system is amazing!I didnt start with the infant carseat however we purchased it for baby #2!The 1st thing I loved about it was it was super easy to put together!!!I didnt even need my husbands help!!!My baby is 10 months old and she loves it!I mean this is not an umbrella folding stroller,it takes up half my trunk in my honda accord but its worth every bit of space!!!!!!I luv that she sits up super straight and can see everything around her and can be turned any direction with ease!!!!!The canopy is amazing blocks the sun and provides a nice lil nest for sleeping fully reclined with the canopy all the way down,I mean this looks like a bassinet practically in this mode!!!I added a portable cup holder for a 2nd drink and a mesh storage pouch on the side and we r ready to rock and roll!The cargo pod has become my diaper bag,I like the bottle pockets on the ends u can just reach down when u need something and get stuff out if u do it right.I am not sure I would travel with this its pretty bulky.Buy it u will luv it!
