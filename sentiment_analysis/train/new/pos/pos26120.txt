FANTASTIC product!  I can't believe I owned the monitor without this cradle!  I love the way this holds the monitor upright rather than the angle it was when using the charger it came with.  Since using this cradle the battery life seems to have doubled for the time I can have it off the charger, so now I know it's getting the full charge it needs.  Also I am SUPER grateful that this came with an extra battery and that it chargers that battery while charging the monitor.  I haven't needed to use the battery yet but it's so good to know I have a back up when I need it and that the convince of it being charged already is there.  Love this product best purchase.  My only regret is I wish I bought It sooner.
