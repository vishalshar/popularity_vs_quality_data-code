After trying two other mirrors and hours of brainstorming as to how to install them on the seats of a Nissan Rogue (anyone who drives one will know what I am talking about) I came across this mirror and it couldn't get any more perfect, although perhaps if it were a bit bigger then it would truly be perfection. Price is right and it does the job, you can see baby, baby can see you, and it is able to be installed in ANY seat style of any car model. Recommended specially for those with a Nissan Rogue (I know, I already mentioned this, but it is really an issue with these!).
