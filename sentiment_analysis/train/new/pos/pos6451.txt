Had for 2 months, only used twice before it broke.Pulled 1 ft of the cable out and it got stuck.  The buttons were all stuck too.  Tried to put it back and see if it would loosen and come out all the way, but was unable to put it back or pull it out further. I  couldn't even use it as a 1 ft cable lock since the end of the cable wouldn't fit into the lock anymore because everything is stuck. It might have happened because my friend retracted it too fast, I don't know, but it shouldn't have happened.Edited 07/06/2014:I contacted Buggygear via their website asking about their warranty and they were kind enough to respond quickly and send a replacement.  They appeared to have forgotten to send it for awhile and when I contacted them again, they apologized and made sure to send it via 2-day post.  So far it works!  I use this to lock ski/snowboarding equipment in the winter, so I won't be able to test it out as much until then.  Buggygear does not appear to have a warranty plan in place as of the date of this review.  I am adding more stars to my initial rating.
