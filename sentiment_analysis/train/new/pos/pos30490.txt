I really like this edge protector. I didn't have trouble with it sticking like other people's reviews said. In fact I had a little trouble getting it off some of my smoother surfaces. But you can always remove any adhesive residue with alcohol and a razor blade scraper.I like that you can cut it to the size you need and it is very soft. I also like that there are multiple colors.
