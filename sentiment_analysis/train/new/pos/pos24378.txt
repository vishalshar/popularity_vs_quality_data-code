I purchased this blanket for my 8 month old daughter.  I looked all over for a cute lovey blanket and couldn't find any I liked in stores.  This was a bit more expensive than I wanted to pay, but it is very cute, it's unique with the flower shape and good quality. There are different textures in the fabric and ribbon and bright colors.  My daughter likes playing with it, but isn't overly attatched to it.
