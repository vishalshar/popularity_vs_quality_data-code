I love these! My daughter has decided that she will only eat fruit and crackers so squeeze pouches are the only way I can get her to eat anything else. I love that these are reuseable and I am able to make all her food. I have found that if the pouches are rinsed after use that they are very easy to clean. I did have on instance where the pouch was emptied but not rinsed for 24 hours and it was still quite simple to clean- just used a bottle brush and some soap. My 11 month daughter did struggle a bit at first with the size of the pouch as she was used to holding the smaller 3oz store bought pouches but she seems to have overcome this. I personally love the size since she was sucking down 2 of the 3oz pouches before we switched to ReSqueeze. I definitely will be recommending these to my friends. Easy, no leaks, cost savings, whole foods without the additives and better for the environment. Win all the way around!
