This is our second copy of this book.  We filled one with pictures of family members when my oldest daughter was a baby and she LOVED looking through the pictures and naming the people in the book.  So when it came time to have our second daughter we decided it was time to make another one.  (I actually took pictures and photoshopped names on top of the images before printing them out so it had some text as well as the images.)  The plastic is nice too because the pictures all slide in from the inside edge so you don't have to worry about baby drool  from the edges leaking in and ruining the pictures.  I definitely recommend this book for infants and as a baby shower gift.
