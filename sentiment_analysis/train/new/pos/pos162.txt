Wow, where do I begin about this product!I did a ton of research over a few months time period, looking for a 3 piece nursery set at a reasonable price in a dark wood.  Seemed everywhere I found a set I liked, it was either too expensive, or the company didn't have all 3 matching pieces in stock!  I checked the typical Babies R Us store and other baby stores, but just couldn't find a great buy.  We are on our last child and don't plan to re-use the set, so we didn't need a fancy one to last  several kids and 15 years.I read other reviews and have to agree with several points reviewers made...Stork Craft customer service is horrible.  Phone lines seem to be constantly busy, I have emailed them and got an automated reply, and have filled out a numerous missing part requests and got nothing!Their products are missing pieces and the directions are HORRIBLE!  Might as well not include any instructions on putting these items together as they are so confusing, have so many pieces, and don't have great detail.  My husband is very good at putting things together and had trouble with this furniture! We did find out shortly after getting it all assembled, that the crib had a recall!We've had this for about 6 months now, and seems to be holding up nicely so far.  It looks nice in the nursery, and didn't cost a fortune. The design is great - I love the drawer underneath, and the fact this is an all in one combo...so we will get to use it for several years.Depending on your needs, this may be a great buy, or a nightmare.
