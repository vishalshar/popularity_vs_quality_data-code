Everyone else will state that these are nifty little guys and do the trick keeping those diapers together under the cover, and are much safer looking than traditional diaper pins. I agree.Here's my extra advice: Start with this size 2/toddler size for the newborn. As soon as my baby hit about 11 lbs, the smallest size prefold (Osocozy size 1) was hard to fasten with the size 1 snappi. While others complained that the diaper was just too small, I decided that the Snappi just wasnt long enough to expand with the baby's quickly growing belly. Buying the size 2 Snappi worked and allows the prefold to last longer.So my advice: just start with the size 2 Snappi and don't even bother with the size 1.
