After trying out a few pillows from home that we already owned, I decided to purchase a pillow especially for my 20 month old. Our other pillows were too large or too full. I found that a lumbar pillow was just about the right size for her; however, it was hardly hypoallergenic and it was still a little too full. This is the perfect size for her, and she loves it. I find that when I check on her after a few hours of sleep, her head is still nestled on it, and she sleeps peacefully. It's not too full or too long. Very happy with it.
