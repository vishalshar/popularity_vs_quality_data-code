We loved these bottles a lot. Have tried almost every single bottle on the market. And these was one of three other brands that our baby doesn't not refuse to drink of. The secret I think of small and thin compact nipples goes with the bottle. We used it from 5 mounts till 10 mounts old. I personally like the design and how easy it was to wash these after using the other brand. It was a very good buy. Great product! Highly recommend
