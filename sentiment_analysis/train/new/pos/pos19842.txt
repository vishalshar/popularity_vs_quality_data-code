These sweet baby owl themed receiving blankets are a wonderful addition to your nursery. I swaddled my newborn in these, and when she outgrew that, they are still incredibly handy as burp cloths. The cozy flannel holds up for many, many washings. The grey and yellow color scheme is gender neutral so these make a great shower gift for an expecting mom who isn't sure of the gender yet.
