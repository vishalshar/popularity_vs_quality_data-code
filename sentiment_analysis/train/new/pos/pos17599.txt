We turned this mini crib into a sidecar crib even tho it is not a convertible.  I removed the one side and the two posts/legs where the casters attach, then hitched it to our platform bed. (Ikea Malm low profile).  It is the perfect height to prop on our bed, luckily. We are tying it secure with lashing straps which should be here tomorrow via Amazon Prime, of course.  I put a blanket underneath the 4 inch mattress (3 inch mattress plus the 1 inch pad that came with the crib) until we can come up with a better solution to keep the mattresses even.  Right now our mattress sits slightly higher than baby's which is fine too--it keeps her from rolling out.  We can easily put the crib back together when we have no need to side car but for now, this works so great for us. My almost 4 month old baby slept so well last night!
