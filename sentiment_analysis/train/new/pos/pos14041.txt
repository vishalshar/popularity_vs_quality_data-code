These replacement spouts work perfectly. Not sure why it has so many bad reviews. They came shipped in original packaging, 2 per pack. They were the exact spout shown above, and when placed in the lids, they do not leak. Purchased May 22, 2016. Not sure about other Nuby style cups, but they fit the 8oz Soft Tip sippies shown in the picture below.
