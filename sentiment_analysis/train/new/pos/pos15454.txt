Love these. Ordered two, one for my 3 year old and one for my 3 month old and they both love them. It's made of soft terry so it's basically a slobber mop for my 3 month old, but it's great. He chomps away on it and it doesn't get all grosse and slimy like some other soft teething toys. Also it's organic! Easy for small hands to grip, and it doesn't have to be Santa. I told my three old it's a gnome since we read a lot of stories with fairies and gnomes. They wash really well, they've both gone in the wash and dryer severalTimes and they are still soft and look great.
