This stroller is great for general use and very good for 'all terrain' use on trails with roots, logs, ruts and such.  It goes right over everything easily. I've only done a little bit of jogging with it, but it seems to work fine for that too. It also folds down to fit easily in the trunk of our car.  The only thing that I hate about it is that if you are not extremely careful, you lose skin, and sometimes flesh, when folding it up, as it tends to pinch.  I do not care for the lack of padding or a good place to put a water bottle and sippy cup, and the harness is kindof a pain to adjust properly, but these are relatively minor complaints considering how useful this stroller is.
