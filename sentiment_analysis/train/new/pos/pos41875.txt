I bought these after my two year old figured out that the cheaper plastic knob covers would pull apart and allow him access to anywhere.  I was concerned about his safety, not wanting him leaving the house when I wasn't looking (since he can unlock the door too!).These have been wonderful.  My two year old hasn't figured them out yet.  Pros:  more difficult to separate the two sides than the cheaper plastic kind, easier for me to turn the door knobs than with the cheaper plastic kind, keeps my child safe!Cons:  If your door locks on the handle, the cover for the lock can be cumbersome.I would purchase these again and would recommend these to anyone who needs to keep some places off limits to their young children.
