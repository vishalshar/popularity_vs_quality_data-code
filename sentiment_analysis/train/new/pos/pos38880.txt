Love love love it! After going through three different double stollers and 5 different single strollers I knew exactly what I wanted and didn't want in a stroller and this stroller is perfect! It glides, its comfy for the kids, the handle bar adjusts, the seats recline, the sunshade covers the whole front seat, the back seat has a sunshade, its not too heavy, its fits nicely in my trunk, its easy to fold and unfold, its not too wide or long... The list goes on..
