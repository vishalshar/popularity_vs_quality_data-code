We bought this crib sheet for last winter because someone suggested that maybe our then-3-month-old was waking up at night because she was cold. I don't really think that was why she was waking up because it still happened when we switched sheets, but the flannel was definitely warmer than our other crib sheets. During the winter we switch our bed sheets to flannel sheets, so why not use a flannel sheet for our baby?This is a good quality crib sheet, too, with straps at the corners to hold it on the mattress. The fabric has held up to many washes and has lasted through an entire winter. We even pulled it out again last week when it got a little colder again for a couple of nights.
