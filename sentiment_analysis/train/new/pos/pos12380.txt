This toy is great.  My grandson got this toy when he was seven months old.  He is totally "hypnotized" by all the colors and sounds the toy makes even after having it for a month.  It is his favorite toy.  He learned to crawl by going after this toy when it was just outside his reach.  He uses it for entertaining, wrestling, throwing, and any other thing that comes to his mind.  Don't even think about taking it away from your child  until he/she is ready to give it up (and that's not often!).  The Lamaze Push and Pull is stimulating for kids mentally and physically.
