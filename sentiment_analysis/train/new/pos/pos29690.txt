Our little granddaughter loves this!  We gave it to her just before her 1st birthday, and at 23 months old now, she still loves it!I do have 2 complaints, though, and I'm hoping the manufacturer will work with us to remedy the 2nd one:1) the rocker rungs might be too short/flat for a rigorously-rocking older child, as they could flip over backwards or forwards.2) the music seems to have worn out.  It will only play a second or two before quitting, more often than not.  Then it will work seemingly fine for awhile, before going back to quitting every few seconds.  It's frustrating for the wee one, who loves to rock and swing to the songs while she plays with it.
