I ordered 3 of these certificate holders and had them each engraved with the recipients baby's name. I expected them to be nice but these are truly gorgeous! What they neglected to add in the description (at least I missed it) is that there's soft beadwork around the edge of the holder an the ends of the holder. That adds to the elegance and couldn't have been a nicer surprise! The customer service was on point as they worked with me to help with fitting the names on the base. Although they ship from England and I am in the US, I highly recommend this seller. Fabulous experience!
