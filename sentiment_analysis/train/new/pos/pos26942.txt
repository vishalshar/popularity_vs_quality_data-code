I don't write a lot of reviews, mainly because I don't have time (and I forget) but we've been using this for about a week and love it. I got it to go on vacation. I have a two-year-old son about 35 pounds who will not sit still.I think my favorites things are (1.) the hard bottom seat and (2.) the storage inside the seat. I didn't even bring a diaper bag on this trip and I fit my wallet, a change of clothes, 6 diapers, a pack of wipes and 2 snack cracker bags (that was for a whole day walking around Savannah). Most of the time I carry wipes and some diapers and there is room to spare! You can even undo the Velcro inside so there is a little more room (that's how I fit my wallet in). The pocket is easy to get to also when you're carrying it.I like the option of the feet to raise it up. We haven't had to use it yet, but would if he was younger or smaller/shorter. I was worried about not having a 5-point harness, but my little one seems incredibly content with just the lap harness. He hadn't done any of his typical fidgeting or trying to stand up. I think he likes sitting at the table rather than the high hair (which usually has broken straps, if a restaurant has one at all).Cons? The only one was the thick carrying strap. It is adjustable but if it could be a little longer that'd be great. For all day carrying, I wore it shoulder to hip and it dug in a little towards the end of the day. But it didn't bounce around while walking, I barely noticed it was there.This has been one of my smartest Amazon purchase yet (and we buy a lot). Wish I had it for my 5 year old! My friend is having a baby, I think I might get one for the shower!
