My baby girl adores this, started reacting to it at about 3.5 months, now is 6 months old and still loves to look at herself.  The mirror is not rigid, so sometimes gives a funhouse-esque reflection.  I think the baby thinks this is funny, but I wanted to mention it because my mom was disappointed that it wasn't a proper reflection (I think she thinks it will mess up the baby's self-image haha.)The little attached toys (the bird and the monkey) are very attractive to my baby also, who always tries to grab on to them, but they are stuck on the mirror with what feels like supervelcro - it takes significant effort on my part to remove them so she can play with them.  On the bright side, this supervelcro they use is not the hook-y kind that can hurt little fingers (or little teeth) so I don't have to worry about that.  They are attached with a VERY short string though - I'm guessing this is for safety reasons but my baby isn't able to really play with the little attached toys which can be frustrating for her.  All these points taken into consideration, she LOVES this toy and so do I!
