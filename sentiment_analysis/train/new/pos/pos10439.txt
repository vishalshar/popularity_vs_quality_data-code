I bought this dresser to go with my Twinkle 3-in-1 Crib in Two Tone, Espresso and White. It turned out to be a beautiful dresser, but it took my husband about 4 hours to put it up (we didn't have a power drill). The side and drawer rails could have easily been pre-assembled. Actually, we thought that a lot of things could have been pre-assembled, but we understand that's not how it works these days due to storage and shipping costs!! Anyway, I wish it had been a little bit easier on my husband's hands, but I'm happy with the final result.
