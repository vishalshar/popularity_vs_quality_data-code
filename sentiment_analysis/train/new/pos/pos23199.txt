I search a long time for a crib bumper. First, I could not find a bumper size fit my Ikea crib. Most of the brand is shorter. 2nd, I want to buy a expensive bumper.  This product doesn't have a lot of review but the size fits and the price is attractive . So I want to give it a try.Surprised, the quality is very good and the bumper is thick enough. I love it. I highly recommend it.
