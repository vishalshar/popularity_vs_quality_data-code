I love this mirror! I purchased a monkey mirror exactly like this for my son when he was born and I purchased this one for my baby girl! It is PERFECT! Stop looking NOW for a mirror you will like for your newborn and get this one! NO KIDDING! The weighted back will fit over most any seat and stays put super well! I have tried other mirrors in different vehicles, so I do have some to compare this with and THIS THIS IS SERIOUSLY THE BEST ONE YOU WILL FIND. Hands down. And they are all super cute! The rounded mirror makes seeing right down into the newborn carrier WAY better than a lot of the others! I don't think you will be sorry for buying this for your own vehicle or to give as a shower gift! I definitely would! (especially considering I have already purchased this twice!)
