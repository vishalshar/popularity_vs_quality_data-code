I purchased the Inglesina 2012 trip 2 weeks ago and I must say I researched umbrella strollers for the last 4 months since my daughter was able to sit up straight and did not need the bulky travel system. I researched the larger known brands such as Uppababy, Britax and Maclaren. All of which were either missing something and overly priced.I discovered the Inglesina through research and reviews of their other stroller models. The 2012 Trip was the stroller that offered all of the options I wanted in an umbrella stroller.Pros-reclines! my daughter is able to lay almost completely flat!-compact-light weight.. although it weighs more compared to maclaren and uppababy i will carry the extra weight-large canopy with extra extend for more coverage-cup holder-belly bar.. great to hang toys-basket is easy to access-pocket on back is great for storing things such as phone-leg extension is great for those long days where my daughter needs a nap-rain cover included!-fabric is easy to clean!-peek window to see baby will canopy is extendedConsWell as of right now I cannot find any cons for this umbrella strollerI was only a little confused how to collapse the stroller and how to lower the leg extension but as with any new item takes time to get to know how it works.Although others complained that the material felt rough and that the weight.I truly think the material is great quality and you can feel the durability in this stroller, it is a real nice ride and I feel it did great on both smooth and rough terrain.All together I would say this stroller deserves 5 stars! If you are willing to spend the extra dollar, this sharp stroller is the one to buy. It is not the most popular name but this is true Italian quality!Also the Liquirizia color is AWESOME!!
