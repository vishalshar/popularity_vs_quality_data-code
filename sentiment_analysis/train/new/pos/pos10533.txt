We bought these after returning our initial purchase of Baby Banz Hearing Protector Earmuffs. The Baby Banz were way too tight for our 3-month old and extremely uncomfortable with no way to adjust the tension. We returned them and instead bought these Em's 4 Bubs which are secured with a soft stretchy headband that is adjustable. They stay in place, are very comfortable and well suited for younger babies.
