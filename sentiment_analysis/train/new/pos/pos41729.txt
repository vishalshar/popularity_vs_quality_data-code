We actually hooked two of these together, one on top of the other with 4 strips of wood on each leg to make bunk beds.  It was important to have the head and foot rails the same height.  It worked great!  And gave us alot of room in the room for play.  Bed is sturdy.  And the height worked well, it is close to what a crib height would be.
