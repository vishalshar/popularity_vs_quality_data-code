These baby bottles are a wonderful, classic toy.  Feeding dolls is one of my memories as a toddler and it's sweet to see our granddaughter enjoying this.  It's an extra attraction that the liquid looks like it's disappearing when the bottles are turned over.A classic!Buy two packs as these bottles seem to get lost easily (they roll under furniture, become stuck in sofa cushions, get tossed into the block box. We eventually find them but it's stressful to search for them when the dolls are hungry.
