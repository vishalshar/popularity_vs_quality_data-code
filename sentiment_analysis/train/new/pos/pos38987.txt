After purchasing multiple types of safety instruments for my cupboards, I finally found these and didn't have to buy any more. My son learned how to pull apart all the other ones, except this one. It is a little hard to open initally, but once you get the hang of it its pretty easy. We only have them on the places where we really can't have him touch things (glassware and chemicals) so it works for us.
