We bought this mattress for our son and are very pleased with it. We were looking for an organic, cotton mattress to fit the standard size crib we had and this one was just right. I love that the mattress has a waterproof surface so there's no need for a mattress protector. I liked that this mattress has springs/coils and was made in the USA. We've had no issues with it (crib sheets fit fine, son sleeps well, fit the crib). I too called customer service, to make sure there wasn't an "infant" side and a "toddler" side (or that one side was more firm than the other) and as other posters have said, the customer service was great. They assured me both sides of the mattress had the same firmness (which might be an issue if you are looking for a crib mattress with different firmness on each side). In my opinion the mattress is firm on both sides.  We plan on purchasing another one of these mattresses for our second child.
