With our first daughter we bought a Graco travel system, of course they have everything......a huge basket underneath, cup holders and other handy compartments. When I found out we were pregnant again and that I would need a double stroller I went to work researching. It ultimately came down to the Twin Savvy and the Aria Twin. After trying out both models I went with this Twin Savvy.What I LOVE about this stroller:*It is extremely light weight, infact it feels lighter than my single stroller from the travel system I have.*It's very easy to stear, with a 2 year old and newborn there is a huge weight difference. But this stears like a dream.*It folds up extremely small. It fold in half and then in half again, so it takes up less space than my old travel system stroller. And it also stands upright on it's own which is handy when I take it places.*The padding is very comfy for my girls, much more comfy than other strollers Ive seen.What I DIDNT like so much:*Smallish baskets underneath the seats: I was spoiled with my HUGE basket in the travel system. While my large diaper bag doesnt fit easily I do make it fit and with two baskets it's not that bad.*The straps are a little more time consuming than with other strollers. But once you do it once it becomes very fast.The pro's certainly outweighed the con's with this stroller. And while the price is pretty high I realize a stroller isnt something you want to skimp on.I was also able to save some money by buying the stoller on ebay, I paid about 150.00 less for a brand new one, and that included shipping. I was also able to get it in Diva Pink for my two girls.
