The cover fits our G-Lite very well.  We have a generic one-size-fits-all rain cover for our Chicco 22 car seat, and it is a real jumble getting it on the car seat and it doesn't really work particularly well.  This cover of course fits well, since it's designed for the stroller.  There are three pairs of velcro straps, which go at the top, center, and bottom of the stroller.  For the stroller bottom, you have the option of using grommets or the velcro straps.  For the G-Lite, it's best to use the velcro straps instead of the grommets.  You get a much better fit, without extreme stretching of the plastic.
