I bought this seat after watching a video about kyle miller on youtube. I would NEVER want anything to happen to my kids if I could prevent it, so though very pricey, we decided to invest in this seat. It is bulky, but very comfy and my son loves it. The cup holders on either side are also useful though not very user friendly. I do like that the one (which isn't user friendly) can be tucked away under the seat. We have a minivan and the one thing I don't like about this seat is that it can't be installed in the back seat as securely as the front seat. Now with baby number 2, we are looking at purchasing another britax - one for her age as soon as she outgrows the infant carrier. I most certainly won't go back to using my son's old graco seat that was so hard and uncomfy I don't even know how he managed to sit in it for 2 years!Another thing about the britax frontier versus other boosters - it's 5 point harness system goes up to 100lbs. No other car seat does that (I was going to get the sunshine kids radian 80 until I saw that). However if you want a seat that you want to use from infant to booster (60-80lbs) then the britax frontier or the sunshine kids radian 80 are good buys.4/9/2012 UPDATE: My son is now 6 and still using his Britax quite comfortably. I ended up buying a Sunshine kids Radian for my daughter, which she likes, however it has 2 major inconveniences that make the Britax a better buy:1. the cover is coming off the seat and needed to be stitched back into place2. no cupholders, which is fine when your child is younger, but not so fine as they get older and need a place to keep their drinks while in the car. She has to share one of the cupholders on my son's seat.
