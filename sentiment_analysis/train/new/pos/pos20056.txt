I got to try this toy at my brother's house. My brother gave it to my 6-mo old to keep him entertained while I was fixing his computer. My son loved it, and couldn't stop playing with it -- so many aspects to explore, and it was unlike any toy he'd had before. I had never seen it before, and I almost refused it because I was afraid that my brother wouldn't be able to machine-wash it after my son slobbered all over it. But I saw how interested my son was in the toy and I kept my reservation to myself and let him indulge.When I received it in the mail, my son had laser-focus on me as I unpacked the toy and he could hear that familiar crinkling. He hasn't put it down yet. And the best part is that it is MACHINE WASHABLE on a gentle setting. As a new mom, nothing is better than giving your child a soft toy that he adores and knowing that you can clean it periodically and make it like new again.10 stars -- from baby and mom!
