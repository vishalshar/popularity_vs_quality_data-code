I have to admit that this is the fourth tub I've purchased in the last 2 years. After two mediocre choices, my third tub was great. Recently, however, I found the need for a tub I could take on vacation and the Karibu folding tub definitely fit the bill! It is light-weight and fit very easily in the tightly packed car we drove to the beach. After use, we were able to fold it down and hang it to dry.The tub is compact and is a perfect size for my 21-month old. My son is about average height for his age and I think that we can easily use the tub for another year. But, because of the size and lack of additional support, I would recommend the tub primarily for infants and toddlers who can sit on their own. That being said, the tub's accordion-fold does allow half of the tub to be opened, and that low slope might also work with an older infant who's not yet sitting my himself. (Meaning, you can angle the tub so that water fills only the bottom, while keeping the infant's torso and head elevated and dry.)As for durability, I think the tub is pretty sturdy. The accordion folds are made of a, seemingly, durable yet somewhat flexible plastic. The legs, which fold down when not in use, are also sturdy, but I imagine that one could break the locking mechanism if not careful. Personally, I would not want to fold and unfold this bath every day, for fear of causing cracks or breaking the support legs.
