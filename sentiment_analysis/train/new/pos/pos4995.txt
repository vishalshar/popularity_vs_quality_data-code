I really liked this mirror for a lot of reasons. First, it's pretty simple-there aren't tons of tons all over it-it's just a pretty basic child-safe mirror that does what it's supposed to do, allow my child to see his reflection. The fabric patterns are bold and colorful and seem easy to clean as well, which is good. I also like that it has 2 pieces; the mirror detaches from the plush triangular base to allow you to strap it to your crib or elsewhere, which is also handy. Though the item description does say "colors may vary," (and I was hoping they would) I did get the colors shown in the picture--mostly purple, which is fine I guess. Also, this is by far the best price I have found. The image may be slightly distorted at times (depending on how close/far away you are to it or if it gets bent) but I feel like that's typical for "child safe," thin, plastic mirrors, so for the safety of my child I am willing to see passed that.
