Heard great things about a lot of Boon products from many friends, so I bought plate, bowl and spoon/fork for my little messy eater.  I'm satisfied with the product overall, especially with the suction part on the bottom of the plate and bowl, they work far better than most of the other so-called suction plate/bowls.  I must say these plates and bowls can stay ON the table much longer than other brand products.Nevertheless, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because even given all the good things above on all the table or most of the surfaces, the plates/bowls still can't stay too long on some surface.  E.g., the IKEA toddler table, which is very popular among families with toddlers.Overall, I would love to recommend the product!
