I am so impressed with this company! I ordered my son's toddler pillow and was happy with it, but it was a bit too fluffy/thick for him. The owner (Chris, I believe) asked about my satisfaction and I mentioned this to them. They actually sent me another pillow with less fill for my son right away! How awesome is that?!! They also sent a nice thank you/greeting card along with it. I am very happy with my purchase and beyond impressed with Little Sleepyhead's customer service. A++!
