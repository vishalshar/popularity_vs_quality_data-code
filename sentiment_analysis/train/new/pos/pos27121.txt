I have 2-1/2 year old twins.  We bought this when they were born.  I looked at all the twin strollers, and folded them, and tried carrying them and wheeling them about, etc.  Nothing could compare to this stroller.  It has turned out to be a great buying decision for us. It is truly lightweight (lighter than the Graco single stroller I used to use for my first child), and it folds up so compactly and stands on it's own when folded -- and it has lasted very well, with no problems.  The only thing I could wish for would be more storage space underneath, but I wouldn't trade any of the other features for that.  Great stroller for anyone who needs a double stroller
