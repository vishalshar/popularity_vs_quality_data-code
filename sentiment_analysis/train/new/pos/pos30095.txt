These are a great price and super convenient. Some people have said these are hard to clean. I'm not sure what their definition of "hard" is but, geeze, it doesn't get much easier. If I can't wipe it down, I put some soap in my hands, and wash the whole thing under water for about 15 seconds, mostly to clean the fabric piping people are concerned with then hang to dry. IT'S SERIOUSLY SO HARD.Now, this might blow your minds, but I'm going to give you a tipâ€”turn the pocket "inside out." This makes the pocket stick out to catch crumbs. It's not meant to do that as the prints are backwards then, but my kid can't read, so no biggie.
