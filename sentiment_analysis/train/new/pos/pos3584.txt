The gro-egg is a fantastic and brilliant temperature gauge to use for your baby room. We have been using one in our daughter's room for the last 3 years and needed to purchase another one for our newborn.  We can always determine if our child's room is too warm or too cold (especially during the winter) and if we need to intervene. Well worth the purchase.
