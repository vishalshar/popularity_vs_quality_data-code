These are exactly as described.  My only reservation is that they are not exactly the same dimensions as previous Munchkin plates that I've purchased via amazon.com. While the diameter is the same, the rim is slightly smaller so they don't stack perfectly with my other plates.  Also, the colors are not the same as shown in the picture.  It doesn't matter to me but I have kids that have specific preferences for the color of their plates.  (You know.  The 3yo *must* have a green plate....)
