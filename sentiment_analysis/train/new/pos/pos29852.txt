If i could give this a 10 start review  i would! I would recommed this to any mother or mother to be who is interested in formula feeding. Ive heard other mothers say that its not a big deal for them to heat up a bottle on the stove or to use other bottle warmers that take 3-5 minutes. But for both of my two children.. if they woke up to eat they wanted to eat NOW and would screm until they were fed. the middle of the night is not a time that i want to teach my child patience either. im tired, exhaused and want to feed my baby and get back to sleep ASAP! Being able to make a bottle in less than 20 seconds was a life saver! My baby wouldnt wake himself up as much from crying and wouldnt wake up his brother from screaming so long. it kept the water at a perfect temperature. This also acted as a very nice night light.
