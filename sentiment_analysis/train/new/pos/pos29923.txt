I have some very old down travel pillows and have been looking for pillow cases to update them.  I checked all the usual places (Macys & Linens & Things)  to no avail.  I googled a long time, not liking the "baby" pillow cases, with airplanes and other prints on them. I finally found SheetWorld.  I checked the reviews, some good, some not so. I was uncertain about the back opening, never having tried them. I ordered the pillow cases in 3 colors.  When I received them, I tried them and still uncertain of the back opening, until I actually used them. My pillows fit comfortably, not tight, easy in and out.  The fabric is good, not like silk, but comfortable; colors are good. In short, I am very happy with them and SheetWorld.
