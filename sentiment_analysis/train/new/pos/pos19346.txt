I bought these for my 9 month old daughter. She as at the point where she can sit by herself in the bathtub without support and I wanted something cute, girly, but nothing crazy for her to play with. This set was absolutely perfect and she was in love them right away. Of course, since she is teething, everything goes in her mouth and these are just the right size so I do not have to worry about her choking etc. They are super easy to clean and absolutely adorable. Each one has a small hole where water can be drawn into it and squirted out which is very entertaining to my little one. Just make sure to squeeze the water out after each bath and lay out to dry to decrease the chance of mold, bacteria growing inside them: just like most other bath toys. They come in a small, clear plastic pouch that zips closed and is great for storing them in-between baths. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a well priced, small set of bath toys for their little one.
