I love the Nuk bottles & cups! I have 4 kids and with the 1st 3 I used the Avent bottles. This last time around I decided to try a different brand of bottles b/c I had a lot of problems with the Avent bottles leaking. I choose the Nuk Orthodontic  brand b/c they are a similar style (I breastfed and bottle-fed) to the Avent and I never had any problems with nipple confusion.. plus they have a great selection of styles.Back to the cups- I think it's great that the bottles & cups are interchangeable! Now that my daughter is off of the bottle, I can still use these bottles with the cup nipple- this also made the transition from bottle to cup very smooth :)I highly recommend.. I do want to say that when my daughter was newborn the Nuk Ortho bottles didnt work (she was tiny)- the nipples were too big. We tried about 10 different brands- from the expensive Dr. Weiler to the cheapo store brand. But then by the time she was about 2-3 months we went back to the Nuk ortho.
