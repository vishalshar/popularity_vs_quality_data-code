I have tried several brands of nipples and these are by far the best.  My infant daughter would have to stop sucking and take big breaths when using other nipples.  With the Nuby nipples, she can feed and the air flows back into the bottle without her having to stop.  I can't find these in the store, so I always order them from Amazon.
