This is a relatively nice piece for the price.  It looks nice in our nursery, it is true white so it matches our Graco crib Graco Victoria Non Drop Side 5 In 1 Convertible Crib White, and is sturdy.  The drawers open/close smoothly, but I would have preferred the drawer bottoms to be made of wood rather than heavy cardboard / particle board material. The assembly wasnt as difficult for my husband as previous reviewers experienced.  There are a lot of pieces and it took some time but it wasnt that challenging.  My only complaint is the height of the piece - which is clearly stated so this is my own fault.  I'm about to become a first time mom and didnt realize a tall changing table with a thick changing pad might work for a very tall mom but not for me.  Also, this piece requires a smaller (30") changing pad instead of a standard 32" pad.  The LA Baby 4 sided 30" changing pad LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 30", Whitefits great.  I would purchase this again for the look & quality but probably not for the height
