Absolutely necessary for babies and little ones, it can work on adults too, but it is perfectly sized to fit in those little ears, and you get to know the temp in one second.  It is accurate in comparison to the larger adult ones used on children.  If there is barely a fever, it may not show up on this, but if it is bad, you will know it, when you need to know it!  Great shower/new baby gift.
