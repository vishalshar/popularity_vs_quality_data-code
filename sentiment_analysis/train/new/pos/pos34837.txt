Great choice for shopping cart/high chair cover.  It conveniently can be used as either one.  It's very simple to get on and off which helps when you're carrying a baby in one hand. It also folds into its own drawstring bag to carry it from place to place. It's not really big and bulky like some I've seen but it provides plenty of cushion from the metal shopping cart bars. Definitely worth the money.
