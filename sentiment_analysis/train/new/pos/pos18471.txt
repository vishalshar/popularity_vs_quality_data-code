So to start off, I need to say that I'm very picky about keeping my cars nice and so I want to do all I can to protect it from the abuse that kids can dish out.  That being said this mat is definitely worth looking at as I think it's done a good job of protecting the leather in my car.  Here are some pro's and con's:Pro's:+ Back is much taller than a lot of mats out there.  This provides more coverage as a lot of car seats have pretty sharp plastic edges on the backs of the seats too+ Padding is thick, but not too thick. It's just right for keeping out indentations and scratches, but not so thick that it might interfere with the child's car seat actually sitting down in the bucket of the seat.  I've used the prince lionheart mat also and it just does not work in my car.  The bottom part is way too stiff and while this is great for protection, I couldn't get it to sit correctly in my car's rear seat (the seats are a slightly "bucketed")+ The front flap is good for both storing some small toys, and also provides some extra protection from dirty shoes.  My son has a tendency to put his feet on the front part of the seat cushion and this at least gives some protection against dirt/salt/mud/scratches/etc.+ Back and bottom pads have a tackier rubber coating on the back so the mat won't slide around too much. One thing to note though is that if you have a lighter interior color the blackish/greyish coating could leave some marks.Con's:- Really just one,  the junction between the bottom and back of the mat doesn't leave too much room for a seat belt to stick out. if you plan on using the LATCH anchors, this isn't a problem but some if you are using the vehicle's seat belt (like with a booster seat) the pads could get in the way, making it slightly annoying to buckle the seat belt.Anyway, i think this gets the job done and is worth the money.
