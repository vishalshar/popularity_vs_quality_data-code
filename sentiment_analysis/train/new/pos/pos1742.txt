Can't really wear this with a sundress since the cord isn't very long, but it was really nice.  I used it like a belly band.  I would reccommend that the company add some of that sticky material to one end so you could use it like a belly band more effectively as you progress in pregnancy.  It wasn't  practical at all after I got very big, because it rolled down.
