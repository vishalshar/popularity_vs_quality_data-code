I have had many different bike trailer/ joggers. The last little one will be riding in this one for quite a few years so we needed one that will last with her and her bigger sister. LOve the drum brakes for walking jogging and skating! but the true selling point over the chariot style was that it fits through a standard exterior door. There is nothing quite as lame as having the sweet hearts fighting naps till the very end of the ride and then having to wake them up to bring them in to the house. That won't be a problem with this stroller! Just roll em right in the door and get on with it!
