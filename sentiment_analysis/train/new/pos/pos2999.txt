I have bought many photo albums since my 2 year old graddaughter was born and this is one of the best.The 100 acid-free, PVC-free, photo-safe pages do not 'crinkle' up like some others do.Plenty of space to write memories next to the photo.  This is the album I will continue to by.  After all it holds the photos of our precious granddaughter, so who wouldn't want the best!
