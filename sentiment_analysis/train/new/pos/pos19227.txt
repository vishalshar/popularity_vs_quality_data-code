Like many of the other reviewers, I have a door that constantly gets opened by my family... and then I have to yell at them: PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR.  After several years of this, I realized, hey my family is NOT going to learn. They will not change.  What did I learn in therapy? You can only change yourself.OFF TO AMAZONSo off I want to my therapist - Amazon.com - and realized that other people (for some reason, mainly men it seems), have had this problem (especially with basement doors), and voila - I found the 'Prime Line C11 Door Closer.'  I ordered it, and a few days later it arrived.INSTALLATIONI hate installing stuff, I really really hate it.  I am excellent with computers, home networking, Wi-Fi, SEO, Social Media, blogging, anything and everything computer.  But... to assemble something?  Yee gads!  No!With trepidation, I opened the instructions. They were not particularly easy, but I was able to follow them and with just a few screws installed the door.  Then I had to figure out how to tighten it, and set it.IT WORKEDThen, magically, it actually just worked!  My family, my marriage, my relationship with my kids is now SAVED - no more yelling: PLEASE close the door!
