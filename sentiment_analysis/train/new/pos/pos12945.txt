I really like the bag. It's very spacious and works super well as a book bag! It's very neat how you can carry it in multiple ways! The only thing that happened was that after 2 weeks, the little zipper thing fell off. I mean, I didn't really mind because of what I payed for the bag, but yeah. The zipper kind of gets stuck at times, but for the most part I like the bag! :D
