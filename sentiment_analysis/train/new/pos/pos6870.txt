I walk my three kids - ages 14 months, 3 and 5 - to school every day. My three-year-old can't quite handle the return trip after we've dropped off the five-year-old. I thought this style was a good solution to a child who's a little too old to want to be in a regular double stroller and it's a little shorter (from front to back). It's a little heavy, but comparable to any double stroller (or full-size single stroller). The handlebar is a bit higher than most strollers, which is a plus for me, since I find most of them too low. The review here had me worried because it said the seat for the older child didn't have a latch to stay in place, but it's much sturdier than that sounds. You really have to push it to make it move.I highly recommend this stroller to anyone with kids two years apart.
