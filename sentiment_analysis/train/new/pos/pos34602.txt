In my video review, I show all of the key features of this level P nipple, how it interchanges with a Medela bottle and even how it compares to a Medela Slow Flow and a Dr. Brown's Level 1 nipple.  Our newborn kept choking on the Medela because it was just too fast, but once we got the Dr. Brown's (we started with Level P, then moved to Level 1), problem solved!  I definitely recommend it, and if you aren't sure whether to get Dr. Brown's or whether Level P or Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 1 Standard Nipple or even Dr. Brown's 2 Natural Flow Level 2 Standard Nipple, perhaps this will help you and give you some assurance of how it works.
