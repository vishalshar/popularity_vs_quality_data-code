The belly bar has been a great addition to my Baby Jogger City Versa stroller. I needed something for my son to hold on to, and this was an easy install. It's not too thick, and also not too thin. It easily slides into the slots on the stroller for the attachment, and can be opened from either side to swivel out. The material on it is nice because it can easily be wiped down if it gets dirty. Great accessory for the stroller!
