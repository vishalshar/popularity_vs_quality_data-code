I have two sons that love their stuffed animals.  My older son already has the my first bear by Carter's that plays a lullaby for bedtime.  SO I found this one for my younger son and he loves it!  We had a snafoo 2 times where the knot came out and the cord retracted all the way into the bear and we couldn't use it, but the seller was great and got us a replacement dog right away.
