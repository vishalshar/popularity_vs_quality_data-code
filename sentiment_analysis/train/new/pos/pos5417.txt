These are my favorite cloth diapers. They are adjustable in the waist, height & leg opening. They have a pocket for inserts if you choose to use them that way (I lay the insert on the outside of the pocket). They were MUCH less expensive thru this shipper, however they took a couple weeks to reach me.
