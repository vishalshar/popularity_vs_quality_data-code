First I purchased Jeep Wrangler jogging stroller in green, had a problem with one of the wheels. Amazon CS was amazing as usual and they gave me a replacement. I went with Jeep Adventure. To me they look like two identical strollers except color, one is green and other is black.Good stroller for the price, moves well, rides smooth. It is not as nice as the strollers over $300.00 but it is a great buy if you are on the budget. It definitely is not light one or compact at all. It is my keep at home workout stroller. Always stays in my garage ready to go. I like that is it heavy and have some weight, that way it is rolling faster when I jog and it is more stable, can't roll over as easy. Big tires help with smooth ride for my baby as well. Overall good buy, if you are more picky than usual you may not like it. Unfortunately I like it, I don't love it... That is why I gave 4 stars, just those little details and overall look makes it a little more cheap looking and not as luxurious as I wanted to ....
