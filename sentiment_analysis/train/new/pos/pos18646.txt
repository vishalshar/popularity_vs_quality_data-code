Like many other Moms out there, I spent countless hours researching what convertible carseat will be best for my daughter. I am very pleased with this product. My daughter is very comfortable at almost 11 months and we plan on using this for a very long time. We weren't sure it was going to fit in our tiny 96 Hyundai, but rear facing, it fits just fine! We are in South Korea (due to military) for another 9 months and once we get back to the states, I know this carseat will work great in my Jeep Liberty. We didn't want to spend a ton of money for a carseat that wasn't going to fit, but it's definitely worth the money.My only complaint is that is doesn't fold or break down for easy traveling. We are flying home for a month and I am kind of dreading having to lug the seat all over the airport.
