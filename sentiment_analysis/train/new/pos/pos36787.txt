Got this since my son was born. I didn't really use the sling when he was an infant. I find it hard to put him on it and it didn't appear to support him too well as I feel like he would just fall off. The contour on the tub to support the baby was a nice feature for when he couldn't set up on his own but it wasn't really useful. There's nothing to really support the baby on it plus there were no padding/cushion down along this area so when I laid my son on it his back would turn red. The tub was perfect when he started to sit on his own. He is almost 2 and we still use it to this day. The space is getting a bit tight but it still works for now.
