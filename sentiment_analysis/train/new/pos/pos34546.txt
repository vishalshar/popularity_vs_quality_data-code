This potty seat was like the story "The 3 Little Bears" The first one I got was too hard. My 3 year old son said it hurt when he sat down because the seat was so hard.  The second seat I got had a splash guard that kept hurting him when he climbed up.  The 3rd potty seat we hit paydirt with this one.  It's soft,  has no splash guard so it is convenient for climbing up on and it is soft and doesn't hurt him when he sits for more than 5 minutes.  Great value.  Buy this with stickers and a step stool and you'll be happy.  Oh and by the way lil tip.  After 6 months of trying to potty train I gave up on the pull ups and sent straight underwear and it happened in 2 weeks...
