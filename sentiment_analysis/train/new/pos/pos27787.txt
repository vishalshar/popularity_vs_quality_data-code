Saw this in a specialty shop and became instantly mesmerized by the soothing music and rotating pictures (found it cheaper here online).  Baby loves it also, it keeps him occupied for a few minutes when I have to deal with big brother or change the laundry load.  The "bowl" attaches to the crib or can sit on the ground in its base.  Its lined with mirrors that create a kaleidoscope effect with the changeable disk in the center.  The 4 disks each plays its own song (2 soothing and 2 playful).  The disks are easy to change out and fit a storage container that sits on the rail of the crib.  We have thick rails on our baby's crib but didn't have any problem hanging the carrier or attaching the bowl.  Before we could put it on the crib, our 3-year old began playing with the pieces out of the box.  The pieces attach to the base, which has other moveable parts, and can fit and move around inside the bowl.  When the disc moves, so does anything in it, making some really neat visuals.  There is a cute lever on the side of the bowl that baby can use to start/stop the music show himself.  There are tiny lights in the bowl that can be turned on or off.  The sound can also be turned off and has 2 volume settings.  The only negative is that the motor that rotates the disk is kinda loud.  It probably doesn't bother a baby for whom white noise is soothing, but I myself would rather not hear it and it is definitely noticeable when the music is turned off.  Also, the lever that the baby can use to start/stop the movement of the disk needs to be pushed on twice to get it started.  Don't know if that is true for all models or just the one we got.  Overall we love it!  It is unique and looks as though it will be used for a long time in our house, as long as the motor lasts.
