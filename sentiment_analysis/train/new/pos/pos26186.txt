We bought 4 of these for my toddler grandson over a year ago and have been very pleased.  I bought them specifically because they were one of the few plates I could find that were BPA free AND dishwasher safe (top rack).  We use them all the time and they wash up wonderfully in the dishwasher.  After a year, no cracking, fading, peeling, etc. The grip on the bottom of the plates that keeps it from moving easily, works just as well as it did on day 1.  If I could change anything about them, it would be to not have all the drawings on the "food portion" of the plate.  Is a little hard to see the food real well.  But my grandson doesn't seem to mind at all.We also purchased the matching Avent bowls, and are just as happy with them.  But I bought them for a whole lot cheaper at Walmart.  Amazon's price seems quite high for both.
