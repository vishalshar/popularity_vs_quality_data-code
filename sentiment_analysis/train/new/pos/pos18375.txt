If you are a stay at home dad like I have been while I'm taking my family leave from work, you need one of these.  All you have to do is put the bottle in, add a little water and push the button.  About 90 seconds later you have a perfect temperature bottle for your little one.  Doesn't get any easier than that.Pros:-Cheap-Fast- Holds multiple sizes of bottles- no clean upCons:- Went two weeks without one.Side note:This machine produces HOT steam, so make sure it isn't directly under  your upper kitchen cabinets when in use.  That steam could damage the bottom of your cabinets if you allow it to condensate under them.
