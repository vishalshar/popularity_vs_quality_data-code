Not only is this a cute teether, it's functional as well. You can't tell in the picture but the nose is rubber and just the right size for little ones to chew on. It's easy to grip at multiple angles, has cute textured rings, and bright colors. My 8 month old daughter really likes this teether and it's easy for her to hold on. It also fits great in my diaper bag!
