I had a horrible fear of cutting my baby's itty bitty fingernails and this really helped because it's basically impossible to cut baby's skin or cut the nail down too far.  The little sander smooths out the nails great, but it's a bit of a struggle because my baby pulls her hands away when I use it.  I tried doing it when she was sleeping and I can generally get through one hand before she wakes up with the vibration and noise :)
