I have two of these for both of my rear facing children. They are soft & light weight, so they are less of a projectile issue if they were to break free during an accident. I used to have a diono mirror (which I did like) but I hadn't realized until recently just how dangerous that one is. It's hard & much heavier than this one, and it could have easily broken off during an accident (plastic clips are NOT meant to withstand crash forces) or my rear facing child's seat could have rebounded up into it.I do feel much better being able to see my children, since my older son occasionally tries to unclip himself and my younger son makes choking noises pretty regularly and I don't feel comfortable not knowing whether or not he is in fact choking or just making sounds.I can see them very clearly when the mirror is positioned properly, but it does occasionally get bumped and knocked off kilter, but that's going to happen no matter what mirror I use.
