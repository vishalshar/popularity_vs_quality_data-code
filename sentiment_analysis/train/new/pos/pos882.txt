i was looking for an organizer for my uppababy g-lite deluxe stroller but didn't like that most kinds hung down the back and kind of 'flapped' around bc they only attached by straps at the top of the bag. this also would also tend to tip a stroller or throw off its balance if the child is not seated.  from a description i saw for this bag, i thought it was only meant to be used on the side of the stroller, but it fits great up near the handles as well.  roomy enough to  hold a couple diapers, wipes, wallet, cell phone, etc.  just wish the drink holders were a little bigger and maybe insulated or made of neoprene.
