I have had a few of the Wiggly giggler toy over the years. I use it in my line of work with parents and little children, including babies.It has a great sound and i have enjoyed using/playing with it too.It has had a great deal of being banged against walls and floors. Thrown onto cement and wooden floors without being damaged.Each time I bought more was because the toy went, what we call in Australia, 'walk-about', meaning it went missing. probably all live in homes where it is greatly loved and played with! I had  experienced a one time only when a Wiggly Giggler was returned. It had been 'lifted' by a light-fingered Toddler.As we all know Toddlers have one rule only: See it, want it and its MINE!
