My son and daughter-in-law are quite particular about what goes into their 10-month-old's tummy and I'm all behind that, so more often than not, I make him something from scratch for lunch when he and his mommy pop in.  I'd been using my little Cuisinart Mini-Prep-Processor to grind everything up, but it wasn't quite going the distance and left lots of chunks bigger than he could cope with. I read the reviews of the KidCo BabySteps Basic Natural Feeding System and decided to buy one, even though I tend to be something of a penny pincher when I think I can get away with it. Now I wish I'd had this from the start. It really purees everything from bananas to chicken and clean-up is dead easy since the motor is in the top and never gets near the food. I could have done without the freezer trays, since we make all his food fresh and don't use a microwave on his food as we would have to do to warm it over, but I was so delighted with how easy this was to use and how well it works that I got another one for my daughter-in-law and she's delighted, too.
