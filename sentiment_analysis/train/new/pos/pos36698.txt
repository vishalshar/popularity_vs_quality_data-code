I have these Neat seat potty toppers, the Summer Infant keep me clean and the Potty Cover, disposable seat cover. Of all three, this is my 2nd favorite. They are better than the Summer Infant Keep me Clean as they provide sticky tabs at three angles which seems to be better for sealing to the toilet seat. The price of these definately bet teh Potty Cover brand, but the Potty Cover seat covers provide ULTIMATE cover, they also seem to stay in place without any sticky tabs. Nevertheless, I will alternate between these and the Potty Cover brand. For areas where you dare too have to use the bathroom, you can't go wrong with the Potty Cover, but for everyday use and areas where you just desire toilet seat protection, these will suffice.
