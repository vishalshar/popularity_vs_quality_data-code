and he gave me a small sample of this polishing cloth. I have a Pandora Bracelet and it is wonderful for that - which this jeweler recommended and on my wedding rings - goodness it is amazing how well they clean them, even when I don't think they need it. I've bought several packages of these and will continue to keep them around.
