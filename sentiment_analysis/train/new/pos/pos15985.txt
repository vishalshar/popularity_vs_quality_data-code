I bought the toy bungee to keep the toys from getting thrown out of the stroller.  It has saved us many times.  I use it on Sofie a lot, but it works on pretty much any toy I have tried so far.  I also use it a lot at restaurants so her toys stay off the floor.  My daughter is just starting to use sippy cups, so I'm sure it will get a lot more use.  I'm actually getting a second one so I don't have to keep moving it.
