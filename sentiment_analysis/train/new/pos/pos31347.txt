We gave this toy to my son when he was 7 months old.  At that point he giggled with delight when the bells rang and the voices played but did not place the shapes into the slots himself.  Now that he is older he is enjoying matching the colors, shapes, and animals to those on the ark itself.  The battery has lasted months, the ark is well made, and the voices are easily understood.  He loves his Ark and pulls it along behind him (it has a handle to which he added a strap) laughing.
