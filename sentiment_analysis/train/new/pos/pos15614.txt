Good product! Glad to have an alternate solution to storage bags! Whoever said "don't cry over spilt milk" must have never breastfed! I like the larger storage bottles better but these work out just fine. I was worried when I read how someone struggled to put the lids on so I tested it out first thing by filling it with water and dropping it on the ground. Didn't have any problems! Sure you do want to pay attention as to not miss thread them and perhaps wiggle it around to make sure the lid is on well but it does just fine. The biggest complaint I have is to how easy it is to over fill it because you may not be aware that it is overfilled until the cap is on and the milk is running over. Overall I'm happy with these things. Don't have an Avent bottle to test out the compatibility but to be honest, I don't even want to try.
