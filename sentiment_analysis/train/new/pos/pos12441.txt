Lots of toy attachments.  Good quality.  My infant loves the lights.  I wish the elephant pillow wasn't slippery, it slips out form under my baby's head often.  I also really wish you could use the light/spin function WITHOUT the music but alas you have to have the music on if you want to use the other functions.  Overall a much superior product to Infantino brand.
