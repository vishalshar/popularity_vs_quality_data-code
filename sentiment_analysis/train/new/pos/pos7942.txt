I love this car seat! Weget compliments on it everytime we go out with it. We have the Combi stroller as well and it's been great. My son fits very well in the seat and usually nods off straight away. The release from the base was very hard to pull at first, but after a few weeks it has gotten much better! I would buy this seat again.
