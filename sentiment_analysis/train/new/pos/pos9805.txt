this photo album is of excellent quality and will last a very long time. it's really very sweet and would make a lovely gift. it comes in a very nice box all ready for gift giving. i wasn't aware it isn't a full sized album, but no worries. holds many pics with an area in which to make comments. there are no pages with cute drawings or pages in which you can record baby's special milestones, it's just a nice photo album. I would purchase it again.
