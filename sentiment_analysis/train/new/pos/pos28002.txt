My daughter has had this toy since she was born. She didn't really start snuggling with it until she was a couple months old of course, but now, as a 3.5 year old she doesn't go anywhere without it. She loves the antennas. At night she rubs them against her face to go to sleep. We've had to purchase about 6 or 7 because of how much she wears out the antennas. Once they aren't plush and go flat (from her constant squeezing of them) then she needs a new one. We still have all of them though for keepsakes :)
