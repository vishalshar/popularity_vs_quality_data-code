Shipping was decent. The price was right on this cute, short yet wide sized bottle with nipple that is soft and breast like. I didn't get a chance to use it unfortunately. The insert says to boil 5 min before initial use to sterilize. I did this and the plastic then looked very hazy or filmy with whitish streaks and spots running through it. I thought it could be something on the plastic but could not scrub it off. After messing with it for a while I decided to boil again to see if it would come off/clear up but then I got busy elsewhere - forgot about it and melted the plastic. Nipple seemed great but the bottle part gave me some trouble (the melting was obviously my fault but the plastic obviously had some issues to begin with) so I rated 4 stars because of that.
