We purchased this diaper pail to replace a Diaper Genie that broke. We liked the idea of being able to have something other than plain white. In addition, we were starting to get frustrated with the smell from the DG. The quality of the Diaper Dekor is very good, and we have no complaints there. However, the main reason we spent the extra money for the Dekor was in hopes of reducing the smell that came from the old pail. Unfortunately, the smell still remains...That being said, the great news is that this pail is MUCH easier to swap out the bag. So, unlike the Diaper Genie (which I dreaded replacing the bag on), if the Diaper Dekor starts to smell, I can throw out the bag, even if there are only a few diapers.In summary, if I had to purchase a pail again, I would do the Dekor again, primarily because of the ease of swapping the bag using the convenient door at the bottom, and because of the variety of colors.
