I bought this to replace a wristlet I'd been carrying for several years -- I needed to change, because my old one worked with my iPhone 4 but not with my new iPhone 5s. This Petunia Pickle Bottom wristlet has been a great upgrade. It's nice and classy looking, goes with everything, my phone (with case on) fits in the phone pocket easily and doesn't fall out even with lots of jostling and bumping. Inside the zipper are card pockets that I've been able to use to keep two credit/debit cards, my drivers license, and insurance card, with a pocket behind them that I keep my business cards in. There's an interior zipper pocket on the other side that is too tight to use for much, but I do stash checks in there when I need to deposit them. There's a clear pocket on the outside to put an ID or something in -- I don't use it for my license (too visible), but it is a great place to put my bus pass, since this way it works without me having to take it out or open anything up.Oh, and I found a cheap black S-biner hook and clipped it on to the same loop the wristlet goes on, and I use that to clip it on to my belt if I'm out and about somewhere I don't want to have the wristlet on or in my hand. In a pinch, I can also fit it in my jeans pockets, albeit in a very bulky way.
