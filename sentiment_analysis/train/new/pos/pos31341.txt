I love the thermos funtainers, and they have lasted over 2 yrs in near perfect condition.  We've even given the thermos bottles to other kids as gifts.  I do prefer the newer style with the handle now that my son is older (though that might be a 'breakable part in future) but this particular one is still awesome:  does not leak, does not sweat, easy to assemble, keeps the cold liquid cold for at least 8 hrs... I don't push it to the 12 hr mark.The only cautions:-if you use the blue painter tape to label, place it only on the plastic cap; avoid putting tape on the metal body because the tape will take off some of the painted decoration.-It is heavy so take care to teach kiddies not to drop them on little toes!
