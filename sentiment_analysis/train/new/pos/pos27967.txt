I saw this and thought it might work as storage for my exercise ball/ fitness ball/ balance ball in my workout room (some people use these as birth balls or for sitting on in front of desks, etc).I guess it's a little tacky but it does work! At first it wasn't working, then I put the middle hook about 10" lower than the outside hooks.I should've put the outside hooks higher to begin with. I might go ahead and redo it so the outside hooks are right by the ceiling, it may look better that way.It's a much cheaper solution for these balls than the other ones I've seen (like those corner pipes). I also tried putting a couple of extra pillows in it when the ball was not in there (room is also used as a guestroom) and that worked too. An extra blanket or two would also work (if no pillows or balls are in it!) it's a nice storage net & I love to have things off the floor (& don't have much room for shelves.)
