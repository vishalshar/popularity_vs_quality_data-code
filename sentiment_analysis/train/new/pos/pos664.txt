The color is a true red!  This pocket diaper has been great.  The pocket opening is especially big, and a lot of different types of inserts can be added.  I got these to use as overnight diapers.  The first time I used them, they leaked right out the leg.  I contacted their customer service and they were amazing.  They helped me problem shoot possible problems.  I was new to cloth and turns out I didn't have a great fit and that caused leaks.  They even sent me a few samples of their new inserts to try out for my heavy wetter.  We were using disposables with an additional disposable insert and would still get occasional leaks.  Using the Hero and their new inserts gave us leak free nights.  Great diaper for an amazing price.We've used these for about 7 months and the inner fleece is starting to have issues and the elastics are getting relaxed which makes getting a good fit more difficult.  The fit issue has caused a few leaks, but we've used these as our only overnight diapers for months.  They've been washed and worn in those 7 months almost every day (Never used a dryer for them).  So even though they're showing signs of wear, it's from heavy duty use and they're still in ok shape. I'd still recommend them.  In a regular diaper stash, they wouldn't be used as heavily as I've used mine.
