I really like that this cream has a very mild fragrance (it says fragrance free but actually has a very light, natural scent).  I wish it was a little bit thicker for winter use, but it does seem to be helping keep the rough patches at bay on my 9-month-old.  I would recommend this product and would buy it again.
