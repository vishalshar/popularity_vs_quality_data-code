My wide and I are quite satisfied with this product... it frees up our time when the baby needs to be soothed. Music is a bit unorthodox but the nature sounds are effective. The speed and volume controls are a good improvement over the older models. I would recommend a plug-in unit unless you expect frequent power outages. It saves lots of battery costs.
