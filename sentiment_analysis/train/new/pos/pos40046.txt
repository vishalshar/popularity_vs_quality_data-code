Great and convinient to use. Like other comments the latch does not close properly after almost a year of use. After I run it a second time per day I just put a mug on top and it works just fine. Not that big of a deal because it beats having to put in a pot and boil. I keep on my contertop and i use on bottles every other day. If it wasn't so convinient I probably would sanitize as often. All sizes of bottles fit in this one vs other brands. It fits pump parts really well. You can put small parts in basket. If you use the right amount of water it will be dry after each cycle. I do make sure I dry bottom plate and keep open for a few hours after use, this helps completely dry on the inside. I believe this helps maintain it clean and expands the lifetime of the unit. Others seem to complain about having to do so but to me it just seems like routine maintanence. Only take a few seconds to wipe down, I dont understand why people would complain about that. I find it to be one of the most convinient things I have especially because I have twins and I have A LOT of bottles to maintain clean. Over all I would strongly recommend and would purchase again.
