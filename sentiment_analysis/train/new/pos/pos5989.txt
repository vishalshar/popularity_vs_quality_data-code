I wish I found this line of toys when my child was younger.  These are all so sweet, they're perfect for teething babies and my little guy loves carrying these in the car with him.  The organic cotton is durable but very soft, and can be machine washed.  These are perfect baby shower gifts too.  Now that I've seen how much my child loves them, I've bought them for so many friends.
