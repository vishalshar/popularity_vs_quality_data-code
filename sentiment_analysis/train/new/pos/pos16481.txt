I purchased this item because I got a really good deal on it and I needed to buy a swing and a highchair, so I thought......perfect this will do the trick and I couldn`t resist the price. I bought it for 100 dlls and got 30dlls off because I opened an amazon credit card which was great. So60dlls was a great price¡¡¡ What can I say about the product.......It's functional. It says it's a 4 in 1 system but you basically will get more use out of 2 things the highchair and the swing. The other two are infant and toddler chairs.......my baby is 5 months old but I never used the infant chair so I probably won't use the toddler chair either. The swing works great,it swings in one direction as opposed to others that swing from front to back and side to side, has no music ,though you can't ask much more for the price ........so I`m happy. I gave it 5 stars because you get what you pay for and it works, but if I would have had more money I would have probably just bought the swing and the highchair separately or as a 2 in 1 combo with a better swing. Like I said it`s functional it assembles easy and the change from swing to highchair and to the infant and toddler chairs is fairly easy, but I don't consider this the best product out there if you can afford to buy them separately I`d say you`re better off. If you are thinking it`s a space saver.......well not really because the extra parts you don`t use clutter up in your house. All in all...........my child is happy so I 'm happy.
