Great for storing my daughters water toys. Suction cups work awesome for less permanent option. I bring the "whale" along when we travel and it works well in hotel tubs also. I've never had a problem with it being knocked down. The scoop fits quite securely in the support/base. We keep ours on the back, outside ledge, sitting between the curtain and the liner. That way the liner protects it from constantly getting showered on (soap, etc) and it's not visible from the outside either. I could see it being knocked off if it was on the side wall, right next to you.
