The books are good quality, and the baby likes to look at them and puts them in his mouth. The simple images make it easy to come up with new stories for the baby each time we "read" them. They are also easy to wash and wipe. There are three pages in the fish and colors book, so 6 images total per book, and two pages in the Truck book.I am giving this product 4 stars due to the inaccurate information in the product description. It says "fun textures and squeakers", when there is actually only one squeaker in the Truck book, and only one tactile page with the shiny fish (a bit of shiny plastic). The rest of the pages are just plain drawings.The package does not state whether they are BPA free. I had to go and check that on the manufacturer's website.Otherwise, they are great to take places due to their small size and ease of cleaning.
