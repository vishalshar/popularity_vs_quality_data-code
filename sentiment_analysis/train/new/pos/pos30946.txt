My son always sleeps off within minutes when ever he is strapped onto this seat, that says a lot about the comfortability of the seat.Regarding the safety aspect, it looks well built and solid. I once took the seat out from the car for readjustment and strapped my son to it, I was pleased to see that even when I picked him up in the air with the seat and turned him with his front facing down, he was held firmly in place and did not look like he was going to fall off anytime soon.My advice, for very young children under 1 year or so, always use the seat facing back. In the unfortunate event of a head on collision, they usually will be better protected; this is because children within this age range usually have dispropotionately bigger heads compare to their bodies and their neck muscles are not yet strong enough to support the head in such cases. The product advises that the seat be faced back for children under 20lbs and for a very good reason.
