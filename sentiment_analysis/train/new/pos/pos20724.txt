I got this toy for my 6 month old daughter & she loves it! When we first got it, she mainly liked me to hold it by her feet so she could stomp on it since she knew how to use her feet better than her hands at the time. But now that shes almost 7 months, she likes playing it with her feet & hands! Cutest thing ever! The only thing I would have liked to see different is the fact that the speaker is on the bottom. This makes the volume low when its on the bed, floor etc. It would have been better if they put it on the side. But other than that, great toy.
