With a 3 year old and 12 month old twins, our family had to choose between a minivan and our first home. We chose the house, but were left wondering how much longer we'd be able to cram everyone into our 2007 Honda Accord, as it was pretty stuffed already and the twins would outgrow their baby cars eats quickly.  Satefy 1st to the rescue!  They fit! I have been searching for months and finally decided to try these, as the price was reasonable and they are advertised as compact.  They are comfortable for both my smaller and bigger toddlers and everyone is much happier.  We are very satisfied with this seat!
