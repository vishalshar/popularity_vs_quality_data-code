Love this night light ! The  settings work really great  . It is easy to use and made very well. We use it in our bathroom at night and on the red setting it is just right for low light. The green and the blue are also nice if you want more light in your room. The color changing is nice and the color changes makes the whole room nice and colorful.  This is the right night light for any room . We are thinking about buying another one for our kitchen. Thanks for a nice night light . The one we have been looking for.  Update : We bought another one of these for our kitchen we really love the choice of colors & the night lights do not get hot. I never realized how warm the night lights we were using get against the walls where they are plugged in . Not a good thing these stay cool no matter how long they are on. :) We just love these we bought the Monkey and the Hippo !  :) You will love these !
