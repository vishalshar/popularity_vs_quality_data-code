This highchair was very easy to put together, is very sturdy and wheels around smoothly over tile and area rugs. The legs fold up easily if you need to do that. It also has the tray cover that pops off but we haven't had any need to do that yet. We just wipe it down with antibacterial wipes or warm soapy water. Whoever looked at it and assumed that it was difficult to put together was wrong. It was so easy to put together, moreso than I would have ever guessed. Our little fellow is 5 1/2 months now and it has been so good for him as he is still learning to sit up unassisted. The straps hold him in safely and the seat reclines which was really handy as he learned to hold his head up better and better. I would recommend this high chair to new parents. And no, it's not cheaply made or cheap looking like I have seen others comment about. It is adorable! I also have the matching pack n play and travel system from Target.
