OH so much nicer than having to constantly remove the icky training seat.  I promise you, it's worth it!!!!  Now your little one can have his or her own little seat handy at any moment.  Seriously -- you need this.  Didn't have it for potty training kid #1; truly appreciated it with kid #2!  The kids' seat is made of hard, molded plastic, just like the regular toilet seat, rather than a foam padded seat like many of the training seats. This means it's easy to wipe off and clean!  The foam seats get gross and have seams where *anything* can get into the foam...ick!  This seat is comfortable for adults and toddlers alike, and is so much more hygienic.
