I used it whereever I went with my second child and this is much comfortable to wear it for extended periods of time unlike the other slings that start to bite into the shoulder and we start wanting to get the baby off the sling. With this sling I was able to roam the entire mall with my baby in it and never felt the pain on the shoulder. I lent it to my friend after I was done with it. Its the best buy.
