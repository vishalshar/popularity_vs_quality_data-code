My wife loves these things, used them on both children.  Simple way to keep some simple information in a very easily accessible place.  If its 3am and you don't have the time to pull out your phone or forgot where it is or any other thing, this is nice b/c its right there on your wrist easy to use.  She never had any issue with the markers snapping off like other people did though.
