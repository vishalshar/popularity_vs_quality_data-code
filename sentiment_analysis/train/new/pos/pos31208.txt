In general, I find the fabric for the Brest Friend covers to be a bit rough (especially for soft baby head) and they make my baby sweaty... and don't get me started on putting these things on! It's like wrestling an alligator. It's a great pillow though (I've recommended it to so many friends) and it's convenient to have two covers in case of spills, leaks, you know what I mean... Mod Pod is a fun, subtle design that does not scream "baby!", so I like it.
