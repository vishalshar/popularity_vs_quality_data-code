I was hoping to find an all natural organic toddler pillow for my youngest but this is the closest I could get with it still being WASHABLE. Flame retardants and other chemicals in sleeping products really seem unsafe to me, so even though this has synthetic material it was good to see they have purposefully excluded these things. We made the mistake of ordering two (at different times) organic cotton based pillows for my older daughter. It sounds fine to spot clean until they pee or puke all over it. Then it HAS to be washed for Pete's sake! I have not washed this Calla pillow yet but I am very happy with it so far. My younger daughter just turned two and has a very big head... This just fits her and she loves it.
