This was a perfect fit for our tub, FINALLY! I have been hunting all over for a spout cover to work with our shower diverter because it is almost all the way at the back of the spout and finally here is something that works! It has a slot that you can open up and than slide over till it gets past the diverter! It inflated super easy and was very easy to just slip on over the spout. We have an older tub with an older spout and there is no way to change the spout with out damaging the tile around it so we could not just put in a new spout. I am VERY happy with this product and if like some other posters have mentioned it deflates than I will surely buy another one! I recommend this to everyone!
