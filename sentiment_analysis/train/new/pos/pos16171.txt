Using cloth diapers is probably the best baby related decision that we've made, and Swaddlebees are our favorites.  These diapers are cute and fit well.  We used disposables for the first couple of weeks until our baby could fit into these, and there were constant leaks.  Our baby is a heavy wetter and with the disposable diapers he would wet through the diaper, his outfit, his swaddling blanket, and his bedsheets.  There was so much laundry!  With these diapers we have had hardly any leaks in four months.  Every couple days we just throw them in the wash and hang to dry.  We never have to go to the store for diapers.  We have tried both the snaps and the velcro and we were suprised that we prefered the snaps.  The velcro is extremely strong, but that sometimes makes it difficult to use and you have to be careful when you wash them so the velcro is attached and won't snag.  Our baby has never had diaper rash, there are no chemicals, and it is cheaper than using disposables.  Highly, highly recommend giving these diapers a try.  Babysitters and grandparents love them as well!
