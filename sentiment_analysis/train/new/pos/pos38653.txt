I am really impressed with the Nook Sleep Pebble Lite mattress. This mattress is lightweight with dual air layers which allow a child or adult who is laying face down to still be able to breath. We had highly rated mattress before and my son just couldn't get comfortable on the bed but once we got this he was able to sleep on it and still does!I did not find a chemical smell as others have mentioned and I have two of them.
