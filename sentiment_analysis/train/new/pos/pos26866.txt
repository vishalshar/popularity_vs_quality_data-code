These little cups are just as good as any other stacking cups. My son loves them! They also have the different size holes in the bottoms for bath time! Also comes with a pooh bear toy, which is a nice size and can't fit in babys mouth. My 7 month old loves these cups, and even though he hasn't mastered stacking and nesting them he loves banging them together and taking them out of the nesting position! Very pretty colors, too. :) Very good nesting cups for a good price! Nesting cups are easily found, but don't spend lots of money on them, after all they're just cups - and these are great!
