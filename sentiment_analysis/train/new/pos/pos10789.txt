We originally got the Baby Einstein Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym for our son. He absolutely loved playing with it, so we ordered this gym to leave at his grandparents' house. The Baby Einstein gyms have larger play mats than their competitors and have great toys. We think our little boy likes the Baby Einstein Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym better as it does appear to be a little bit more interesting, but we feel that this is very compatible for the discounted price. If it was just as exciting as its counterpart, it would have gotten 5 stars, but he still loves it! There are lots of great Baby Einstein toys that you can purchase to supplement, or add on any other brand of toys! One complaint I noticed in other reviews before I purchased this is that the stickers came off... If you are like me and insist on washing everything thoroughly before your child plays with it, I can see how that happened. I think the stickers would come off if you left that particular toy sitting in water. I would just keep an eye on the two circles that have stickers, and if it starts to look like they're coming off, we're just going to remove them and let him keep playing with the toy!
