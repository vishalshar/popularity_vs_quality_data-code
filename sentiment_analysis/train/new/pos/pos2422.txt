My daughter loves her "owie pack," when a kiss isn't enough.  At first I put it in the freezer, which crystallized the gel inside, but I found it was too cold for her to manage, even wrapped in a cloth.  And given the number of head bonks per day a toddler gets, it was more efficient to keep it in the fridge.  Plenty cold enough, and for the 5 seconds it takes to deal with an injury before a toddler to get distracted onto the next life-threatening activity, it's great.
