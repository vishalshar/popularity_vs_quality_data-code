I just purchased some ChooMee Sip'n Soft Tops from Amazon to include with a baby gift. My daughter was a tester mom for this product and she and my granddaughter (7 mos) we're so happy with it. It solved so many problems. For baby, softening the spout for her sensitive gums and holding it by herself, which made her beam with pride. For mommy, a solution for those hectic moments, and best of all, no more messes like before when the food got squeezed out too fast or the pouch was dropped, (the little valve that controls the flow is amazing). I often baby sit for her and I'm so impressed with the quality of this product. She has several now, including the original which has been used and washed for months. Kudos to the folks who put so much thought and effort into creating a product that addressed all the issues of these popular food pouches. Only wish these had been around when my own were babies.
