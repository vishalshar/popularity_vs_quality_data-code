I absolutely loved this wedge in the 2nd trimester.  I would constantly wake up with sore side muscles from the weight of my baby belly pulling in the night.  This wedge helped add some support and I slept much much better.  For the 2nd trimester, I give it 5 stars.However, I am now in the eighth month, and my belly is large enough that most of it rests on the mattress when I sleep on my sides.  The wedge is now too thick and firm for comfort and I have not used it in the past few weeks.  Something that might make it better would be if there were 2 wedges inside the cover to make the thickness adjustable.Overall a great pregnancy pillow for the early stages of pregnancy and when I had a smaller belly bump, but not so great once my belly grew larger.
