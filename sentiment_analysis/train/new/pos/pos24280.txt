I recently received this, bought it off of Amazon, I had fallen in love with it when I found it online at walmart but it was to expensive and when I checked Amazon I immediately ordered it, when I put everything together, it was beautiful, I LOVE THE PRINT AND THE FABRIC and everything about it! Love that singe of the prints are embroiderd, took me forever to find something as pretty as this, i'm having a baby girl and for some reason I don't like baby stuff like Dora pooh and animations on my Babys stuff i'm more of a cute classic stuff for my daughter and this bedding set was perfect! I also bought the mobile it was so easy to set up everything looks beautiful!!!! Especially on a white crib! :)
