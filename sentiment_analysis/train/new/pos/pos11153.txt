My five-year-old kid adores these things. He thinks they're fantastic, definitely five stars. I'm giving them only four because while you can indeed run them through the dishwasher, that does not actually wash out the mold that quickly forms inside them -- to get that out you need a little brush, some bleach water, and rather a lot of patience. But at least you can do that if you're up for it -- with most bath toys it's simply impossible. They are well-made and durable, with thick material and deep color highlights (not thinly painted on such that they rub off quickly). They were stiff and hard to put together or squeeze (for squirting) at first, but "broke in" after five or six baths.
