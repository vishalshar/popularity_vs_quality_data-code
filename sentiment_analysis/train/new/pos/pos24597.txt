This is our second natural mat mattress.  The first one we bought was the one with only coir filling (coco mat) which was really just designed for infants which I didn't totally realize when I bought, so with baby #2 on the way our 15-month old is getting this one and we'll save the coco mat for the baby.  (The coco mat is still in like-new shape so I felt confident buying another $$ mattress from this company).  The latex mattress is much softer (coco mat is very firm).  My 15-month old is sleeping wonderfully on the latex and slept wonderfully on the coco mat as well.I bought these over naturepedic because these have no waterproof barrier except the wool.  And I LOVE wool!  I just cover it with a carters cotton flannel pad and that's all we need.  No plastics, no chemical flame retardants.  This is a very expensive mattress but I'm glad we bought it.I took a picture of the latex foam immediately after arrival, it's much lighter and speckled gray (added charcoal) than the pic from another reviewer.
