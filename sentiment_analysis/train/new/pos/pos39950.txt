This is a great product - easy to pressure mount - gate works great (and silent) although you do have to pull it closed if you want it latched - it is lower than some, so less obtrusive - but I was expecting a dark walnut or mahogany finish and it is actually painted black - it was almost a deal breaker because it did not match any photo I had seen and was not what I expected when purchasing this expensive gate - but we decided it worked with our decor anyway and might even be better than a missmatched wood tone - overall we love it as an attractive and more permanent solution for our pet area.
