I really like these plates. They have been a great multi-purpose plate for my toddler son. I like that the sections are a variety of sizes, so that I can section out his meals. He isn't big enough to handle a dipping sauce yet, but I like the fact that there is a little section that I can put sauce for him when he's ready.  The plates are sturdy and do well in the dishwasher. We haven't had any issues with fading or scratching. We've liked them so much that we've ordered several sets of plates. My only--and somewhat minor--complaint is that these don't stack very well. Since they have a stabilizer on the bottom, they don't nest into one another and they end up taking up quite a bit of space in the cabinet.  Again, this is a minor issue, but if you don't have a lot of space, it's something to consider. Overall, we've been very pleased and have placed additional orders to get more of these plates. We've ordered several times and always end up with the pink/yellow set, which is not an issue with us, but I know some people have color preferences.
