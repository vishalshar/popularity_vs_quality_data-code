I love this bed set.  I did not know that the bottom of the comforter and sheet would be fitted, and it was a nice surprise!  It helps it stay on the bed pretty well.  The comforter isn't super soft, but it's nice regardless.  I think after a little usage it will soften up.  My daughter likes the colors.  And to note, the pillow case fits a regular sized pillow.  At first for some reason I thought it would fit a small toddler sized pillow, but it is just an average sized pillow case.
