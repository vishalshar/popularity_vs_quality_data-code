My wife and I have 3 children ages 3 and under so we've got baby monitors all over the house.  We've used I think in total 5 differet models from 4 different manufacturers including Fisher-Price, Graco, Summer, and Sony.  We've used both audio/video and audio only.  This Fisher-Price model is by far the best we've used.- Range.  We have approximately 1500 sqft on the floor where we sleep.  Our bedroom is on the opposite end of the floor as the youngest baby's room.  Other receives either didn't pickup at all or when they did they were full of static and background noise so much so that there was a continual hissing of static that we had to constantly endure.  This receiver can be set at a very low volume so that background noises are almost silent but the baby can still be easily heard.- Rechargable.  With the other monitor receivers it was a hassle to move from room to room.  You have to unplug the receiver and find somewhere else to plug it in.  One of the other models did offer a battery backup but we didn't use it for fear of going through batteries all the time.  This receiver has a built in rechargable battery.  Unplug it and take it with you.  When you're done plug it back in and it charges and is ready for the next use.We're very pleased not only with the quality but also with the price.  Amazon's price was nearly $30 less than Babies R Us.
