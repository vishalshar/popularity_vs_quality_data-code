i gave it 4 stars because i jus wish it was a bit bigger so that i could put the pacifier with the nipple cover and the clip in together but that was the mistake i made i should have bought the skip hop pouch instead of the egg so i could put the nipple cover and the clip in the pouch but other than that it works great holds 2 pacifiers they slot in easy and pull right out jus as fast for a screaming baby.i love it and it works ok for what i need right now.
