After searching for 2 years for a sippy cup my special needs son would accept we finally found this cup at a local store. He drinks out of it without a problem, although we did remove the inner straw. We can finally throw away his nuby stage 3 cups, which would leak after several days use due to my son chewing on the tips. The first years cup has a neat design and keeps the milk cooler longer than a traditional cup. I have ordered two more of these from Amazon as my local store is out of stock.
