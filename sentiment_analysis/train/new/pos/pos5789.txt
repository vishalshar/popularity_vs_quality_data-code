With codeless phones leaving 49MHz and toy walkie talkies being phased out, 49MHz is still a neat license-free affordable alternative out there for remote monitoring. Any scanner radios can tune to the FREQ's 1 and 2, 49.870MHz and 49.850MHz. Just keep in mind that anyone else with a scanner radio can monitor these as well. Still, these have their use. The transmitter has an audio AGC circuit built-in, giving decent audio quality that doesn't over, or under, modulate. Retransmit around the house and yard an on-line talk show stream. ((The audio quality is a bit harsh for music though.). Put the transmitter out in a barn, storage area, or garage. Intruders looking for cameras may not be looking for microphones. Put the transmitter by your landline phone, or use this as it was intended for, as an actual baby monitor. This limit of uses are only limited to your ingenuity.
