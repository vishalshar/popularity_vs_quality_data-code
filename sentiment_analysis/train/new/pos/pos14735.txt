These are just what I was needing! My two year old boy is into EVERYthing! He kept going into the bathroom and flushing things down the toilet. He flushed a paci and the next week proceeded to flush a toddler toothbrush and told the toothbrush to "go get" his paci. We have had to redo the pipes now twice and decided we needed a permanent fix to this toilet obsession. They fit our knobs perfect. Sometimes it does take me a time or two to get the door open though. My teens both got one for their doors too, to keep little brother out. They actually can't really open them and take them off most of the time to get in their rooms. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Love them! I will probably get some more for the other doors.
