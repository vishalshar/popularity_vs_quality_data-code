Wow!  I don't have babies so I'm not using these to clean diapers as many of the reviewers do. I used them so far to 1) clean work out clothes and 2) clean towels. My experiences were both great.For the workout clothes, I wanted to "see" it work so I soaked a few shirts and a few shorts in the sink with about a quarter of the packet. The water was a disgusting murky brown/gray after just a few minutes. I then washed them with the rest of the packet (plus my regular detergent) and a few other work out items in the wash (cold water). They all came out perfect. There was no color transfer or loss, the musty smell was gone, and the material felt a little different (in a good, clean way). Both the soaked and non-soaked items came out the same.For the towels, I had some that had that smell that comes from not letting them dry fully. You know that smell that never goes away??  I was going to toss them but figured I would try this stuff first - and you know what?!  It worked!  I used warm water with a full packet and laundry detergent. I chose the extra rinse cycle. My towels came out without that smell, had no color transfer and no loss of absorbency.I highly recommend this item.
