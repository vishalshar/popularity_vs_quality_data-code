I really like the Gripper Sipper to use with my grandkids. The cups are easy for their little hands to hold on to and not drop. I was a little concerned about trying to wash the inside out, but my dish cloths slides down in it without any problems, then I just turn it around and around until it gets the bottom clean. Of course you can use a bottle brush and I will be easier and faster.The lids are a single piece and you do not have to worry about an inner seal. The colors are bright green and blue, they say boy colors, but my grand daughters love the colors. I haven't noticed any leaking, except when the two year old turns it upside down and shakes it like crazy. Then some liquid does shake out.Note: I have used these for over a year now and they are still doing great and not leaking.
