This product is great, my 11 month old has a fascination with opening and closing doors and we haven't had any problems.  The one concern I have for them is if you use them on doors that need to be closed and they need to be put on and removed at least once a day they stretch out and aren't stuck as tightly on the door.  They do stay on but I can see in the future that being a problem thats why I only gave 4 stars.
