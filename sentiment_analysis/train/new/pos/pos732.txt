I searched for a colorful mobile with the characters that face downward so my baby could see them!  It annoys me how most mobiles are made for babies, yet the mobile characters face outward for the parents to see.  This was perfect...and I love the classical music played.  Quality of sound is good. There are two volume controls which I like. Also, there is a sound activated feature so that when your baby cries for more than 8 seconds, the mobile turns on.  Not too effective on my young baby, but I could see where that feature might calm an older baby who cries.  My baby loves the mobile and smiles at the creatures as they move around. Very easy to set up.  Would definitely recommend.  The only thing better would be to have it remote controlled, which lost it one star. Still a great item!
