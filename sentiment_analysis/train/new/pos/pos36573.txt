Our 6 month old will not fall asleep in our arms and needs to be put down to go to sleep, so needless to say, we were worried about how our 5 hour cross country flight would turn out...  We got this bed and it was AMAZING!  It is SUPER flight and has a strap to carry around easily.  It unfolds and lays out in seconds without messing with anything.  The sheet removes so that you can wash it.  We put this at our feet on the flight and although it wasn't too comfortable for us since we weren't able to put our feet down, she sleep for 2+ hours on each flight.  She also played in the little space when she got too wiggly on our laps.  It was incredible!  We heard screaming babies all around us and were so thankful that we had this little bed!  We also used it as a changing table while traveling when we couldn't find a good place to change her or when we were out and about.  We carried it with us everywhere we went and used it all the time.  I am not sure if I would be comfortable using it for night sleep, but for naps and on the go diaper changes and especially the flight, it was a miracle!
