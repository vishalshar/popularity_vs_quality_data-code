Super absorbent! We have a heavy wetter (eight weeks old) and these keep the moisture off of him and don't leak. They are also quick to air dry after washing and are softer than most prefolds against baby's skin. :They also fit inside our Flip and Thirsties covers really well. They are a bit bulky, so don't buy them if you're looking for slim and sleek, but they get the job done. We love these!
