I tried a couple of other shopping cart covers before I found this one. This shopping cart cover is amazing. It fully covers the cart seating area and velcros all around so that it cannot be removed by the baby. It leaves ZERO exposed parts of the shopping cart. My son was able to pull off the previous cart covers, and we were in constant battle to keep him from touching the icky shopping carts. Our problem has been solved thanks to the Babe Ease! I was debating between this cart cover and a very expensive one that had built in pillows on the sides for a nap. I try to plan my shopping around nap times, but sometimes it just doesn't happen that way! A simple solution I came up with was I use a very small pillow (that I keep folded in the cover in my trunk) so that he can rest his head.  He now actually enjoys napping in the cart, and the moving cart seems to be a soothing feeling for him at the same time! This cover is a thick fabric, has nice toy loops, very nice and deep side pockets that I use for cell phone, keys, coupons, sippy cup, snacks, etc. (very nice to have the option not to drag your purse around) and the cherry on top are the bright fun colors for a girl or boy.  One improvement that could be made is that it is very easy to lose the lap belt, and if we were going for perfection, I wish it was cushiony.  Btw, this cover will fit all carts, including the gigantic ones at warehouse stores.  Don't waste money trying others that don't get the job done, unless you are going to go for that really high end one (close to $100), which didn't make financial sense to me.  All in all, my shopping trips have turned from a stressful, negative experience to fun because my son actually likes his comfy play area now!
