We love this. The design is cute and the color too. Material is water/leakage resistant. Easy to wash. Changing pad stays in place because of the sticky like material on the bottom corners. I don't know what it is called but it helps to keep the changing pad in place especially when your little one is actively kicking. It also has this drawing of a ruler on one side, we love this because we can measure our little ones height and track his progress. This is a better product than other changing covers out there. We tried other but they don't have the sticky material pn the bottom. This cover is thicker too. 5 star for one of the smartest buys we did from Amazon.
