These things are great for cords on blinds! We used them when our daughters were little and now we are using them again ten years later for our son. They are so simple and easy to use, it's amazing that every baby retailer isn't carrying them. Thank goodness for amazon!We like these better than the kind that you have to wind the string around the hook that attach to the molding because you still have full use of the blind even though the excess is in the plastic cap. Great product!
