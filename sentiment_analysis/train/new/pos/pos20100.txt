i would give this a 5 star review except for the smell. it smells like a tire shop or something...but for the price, cuteness (pictures don't do these things justice! they are adorable!!), and the good construction (looks high quality to me) it deserves a positive review. also, shipping time was really impressive, arrived way before the estimated time frame.***for those who own one of these backpacks...anyone have luck getting rid of the smell? I've tried a couple things with no luck (hung on a clothesline in the sun for week hoping that would air it out) and putting fabric softeners in them...maybe febreeze would work? any suggestion is appreciated...thanks :)
