this chair is the perfect size for my 1 year old daughter. we bought it for her birthday...i was a little worried about putting the rockers on the bottom, but she loves to rock in it. you do have the option of keeping the rockers off, but with the way the chair is made in the back, it doesn't sit completely flat on the ground. it'll move to the back right or back left...if enough weight is put on it, it could tip, but it probably wouldn't happen with a small child that size. my daughter loves to sit in her chair and loves that she can get in and out all by herself. the only thing i was a little disappointed in was that the color in the picture looks a little more hot pink, but is more of a bubblegum pink. it's still cute, just not exactly the color i was expecting. over all, i'm very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone with a toddler.
