This stroller meets the needs of our two boys wonderfully. Baby can lay flat in the back while our toddler sits up front and enjoys the view. I'm very happy with the deep cupholders (even tall water bottles stay in place) and the huge basket that lowers for easy access (this was a little stiff and hard to lower at first, but with use becomes a bit easier).  The seatbelts are easily changed from 3 to 5 point harness.  Big wheels make taking curbs a breeze while giving the little ones a smooth ride. I also love the easy one-hand latch on the back of the seats for reclining.  I'm 5'3" and my husband is 6' yet we both can push this stroller with ease due to the design of the handlebar.  The Graco Snugride carseat fits in the front or back; we use it on the back seat, but it is very snug and a bit difficult to lift out.  The cons: it is a large, standard-sized double stroller weighing in at 40 lbs.  Do not be deceived by the pictures as I was which give it the appearance of a smaller tandem.  Some reviews state that it will not fold if the front canopy is attached.  This is not exactly true.  It will fold but it does push against the backseat enough to "bend" the backseat which seems to be a bit flimsy. The front seat is sturdier, as it should be since it holds the heavier child.  Yet when feeling the backseat that the younger child would lean against, it almost feels like cardboard.  So in order not to "bend" the backseat any further I do take off the front canopy (which is very simple and stores easily in the basket when folded) to collapse the stroller.  Not a huge deal to me, but may bother some.  The main con is that this fabric easily snags (I have the platinum color).Overall, this double stroller meets our needs, is loaded with conveniences for parents and is a smooth, comfortable ride for the little ones.  Easy to fold, easy assembly, easy to use.
