I bought my son the Froggy and Monkey blankets when he was first born. Since then I've added an additional froggy blanket for back up and just ordered TWO more. One for the house in case of emergencies and one for the car. These blankets are so incredibly soft and very warm. They was well and retain their original softness. If you are looking for a baby blankey, these are the best I've ever seen. I have three boys and all three boys got different types of blankies. My youngest son got these and he can't go to bed without his blankey right there with him. We've got other high piled blankets and they never retained their incredible softness for as long as these have.The colors are still bright and the patterns are still very well perserved. I would have to recommend these blankets to any parents looking for baby blankets or blankets for their toddlers. I really can't say enough good things about how soft and snuggly these are. I even like cuddling these blankets on occasion, they're so soft!
