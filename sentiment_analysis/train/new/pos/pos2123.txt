Well, the heading says it all.  My 16 mos. old son loves it, he is not afraid of putting his hand in - he figured out quickly that there are crackers/cheerios inside. He actually likes to pull them out and share with us - very kind of him.  He can hold it upside down and no cheerios fall out.The rubber "teeth" are *a little bit* stiff silicon but my son does not mind it.  It helps to prolong the process of eating snacks -- it takes an effort and time for him to eat all the snacks. We used it at home and in the car.The hands twist around; the top and bottom of the body twists around but stays together - - it is not a removable lid; there are no removable parts as far as I can tell.Great $5 spent.**** Update - apparently it is  a two piece item - it was dropped down very hard on the floor and came apart - not broken, not cracked, but we now know that it comes apart -- which is probably good if I ever decide to wash it.  It was easy to snap the two pieces together and it is still in daily use.  The eyes are starting to fade.
