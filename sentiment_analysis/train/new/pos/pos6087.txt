I am a new Father and lack the experience of many great mums out there .. but after reading reviews I decided to purchase newborn and one size diapers.My daughter was born pre-mature and was barely 3 kilo's or i think 4.5-6 pounds. At first the newborn diapers fit her perfectly, sadly even only after a week or two, they are a bit tight on her. Maybe that's normal I am not sure.The one size are great and really adjustable... no fitting issues.My baby girl has been gaining weight very steadily since arriving home about 300 grams to 1.5 pounds every week and has already grown 3-5 cm in length. In the month she has nearly doubled in weight.Besides the fit, I have not had one spill, the cover is really made well, easy to wash and dry and looks good too and this is a Daddy doing this..I failed to read the special washing instructions and just threw them into the washer/drier .. Yes my wife was a bit upset I didn't pay attention.but alas they all survived ... and still look great.Easy to use, easy to replace the insert, and easy to clean up if needed .. I just blast it with the shower head for quick n easy cleaning.My girl also tends to pee a lot ... using disposables she can fill those up quickly between feedings ...and the clothe diapers have held up.I would recommend just buying the one size versions they have, unless your child is really really small ... my girl is still able to use the newborns size but it does leave an imprint on her legs and belly.. yes, I have adjusted the settings to its largest capacity.**NOTE**I have purchased other cloth diapers and have already experienced leaks ..especially when she is on her side, but not with the Rumparooz.Also the material of the cover for Rumparooz, protects leaking through... the no name covers soak through ....and leak on the sides....To sum up , when I have diaper duty, I am glad I got Rumparooz.....from 6 pm to 4 am, diaper duty is a breeze even half asleep.
