This gate is pretty good. It has kept my baby safe for the past few months. However, it does come apart pretty easily. I suppose I may just not have the spokes pushed down on the way but I put some good force behind them and they still arn't all all the way down. The door to the pen is very functional and easy to use and my son likes the toys. However, as another viewer pointed out, I do foresee my son figuring out that he can fit his foot in between the gate holes and probably climb out. I would say this is a good gate for ages 3-12months. Beyond that, your baby will prob either figure out how to climb out or figure out how to take the thing apart.
