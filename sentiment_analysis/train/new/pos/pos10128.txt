We bought this nap mat for our 2.5 yo son to use with a Regalo cot on a couple of out-of-town trips. Our son "needs" a blanket on top of him to sleep, so we were looking for something that would fit that need, but also not be too heavy and hot (and also that would stay put on him while he tossed and turned).Our son loves his new nap mat and we are pleased with its quality. The blanket part is soft and has a nice fleecy feel to it without being too heavy. We've washed it several times due to various accidents of the toddler variety and so far, it's held up well to washing. The design is cute and we like that there's a built-in pillow attached to the rest of the mat although I wish the pillow could be washed too. Overall, we like this mat a lot!
