I have to confess that I had my reservations about this product because some very bad reviews. My main concern was about some people saying the babies tend to roll to the center, since the playard tended to sag. It occurred to me that if it happened, maybe I could reinforce the middle section. So I purchased it, having in mind that probably it would need some minor improvement.Well, I received it, assembled it in five minutes and made some tests with a pair of dumbbells, leaving them for two days with their nights and nothing happened, so I felt relieved. I repeated the test three times in a month until I was satisfied.Now my babies are 4 months and they still love their bassinets, even when they already have a more spacious crib, we have noticed that they sleep better when they are in their bassinets. Of course, I never needed to improve or reinforce anything.I can't speak for those who say that the playard sags, but mine has worked perfectly even now, when my girls are 8 lbs. each.
