Use these bottles with my purely yours ameda pump. I like these because they are so easy to use- screw on the top, stick in the fridge, take out circular insert on the cap and put in nipple and you're good to go. No extra pieces to wash. I wish they came with lids, and I wish they made them in 8oz size. But dr. Browns bottles fit on ameda pumps, and fit the ameda bottle caps so we just use those for bigger bottle feedings. Also like that they are bpa free, but I'm sure there's more environmental friendly bottles on the market
