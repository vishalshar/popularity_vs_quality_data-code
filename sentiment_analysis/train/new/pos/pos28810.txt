My mother-in-law brought me an Evenflo carseat with base and the stroller to go with it from a friend of hers who had a baby and no longer needed it.  After a bit of research to find out what base I needed for my other vehicle, I chose this one.  I had no problems getting it installed in an '03 Murano and a '98 Dodge Neon and I'm 37 weeks pregnant.  It took me about 10 minutes getting it set up in both vehicles together. I am happy with this product.
