This is Actually amazing at keeping your child warm when the weather is bad. It is completely clear in the front so the baby can see out and you can see in. It is super easy to use and put on/take off. There are also small areas in the side that allow for plenty of air flow. We out a blanket over our son and he is really warm, doesn't even need a hat most of the time. Allows us to be out and about in the cold. a must have!!
