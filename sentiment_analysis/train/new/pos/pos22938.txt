Bought several others of these and I'll admit I was disappointed that it wasn't availble at this time to get another one for my granddaughter. However its a great container for carrying juices and the like, no leaks as it seals well. Its taken to school so its taken some punishment with very few dents and dings. Thermos always make great product as far as I'm concerned.
