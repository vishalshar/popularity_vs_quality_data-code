It takes up space, and I won't lie about it.  It doesn't collapse like the other ones, but it's certainly much more sturdy.  We have friends that have the Rainforest Jumperoo.  Nevertheless, we have the space and we can easily put our son into this jumperoo and we can have dinner or any other meal without our son getting cranky or needy - he'll quietly and independently play in it for sometimes up to an hour.  I purchased this jumperoo when he turned 4 months and has been jumping in it every day since then (he's now 6 months old), I guess he isn't tired of it yet.  The best part of it, is that it gets our son enough excercise where he'll jump and tire himself out before bedtime.  THIS IS THE BEST use to get your baby to BED!  Our son gets a lot of exercise and has very strong legs from all the jumping (very muscular legs), and not only crawls at 6 months, but is lifting himself to the standing up position while holding onto everything.  We do understand this could just be that our son is very quick in his development, but I am certain that the exercise has helped him develop stronger legs.He loves the rotating toys and once spent an hour starring at it while making the balls rotate.  We purposedly never showed him how the toys work, and I think he finds them much more interesting as he figures them out -- cognitive development.  Now that he's 6 months, we only put him in the jumper whenever he isn't tired enough for bed, or when mommy and daddy need to eat.  We have, however, bough a different toy that allows a little more movement (walking exercise) to supplement with this one, since our son wants to walk already.Good luck!!  This is the best and most useful toy I've purchased so far into the 6 months we've had our son.  Although it takes most babies a "warming up" period with any toy, our son got right into this toy as soon as we took it out of the box.  It's one of the best purchases we've made for him.
