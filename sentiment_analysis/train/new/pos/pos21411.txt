I purchased 2 of these booster seats form my twin grandsons who are 8. The first time they used them they were involved in a major traffic accident with a drunk driver. The van they were in was totaled. Both boys walked away from the accident uninjured. The seat kept the seat belt properly positioned that even while sleeping they were safe and sound.The boys said they were also very comfortable. Since each one was involved in and accident the seats have to be replaced. I am buying these again!Definitely recommend.
