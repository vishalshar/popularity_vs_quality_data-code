I love these!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because two different times the plastic clips that hold the part where the baby butt goes broke so they were unusable.  I called the company both times and they sent me a brand new one both times.  All I wanted was replacement clips but apparently that's not something they have but a brand new one was perfectly ok with me.  That's great customer service there!  I would purchase from them in a heartbeat just by how well I was treated.  These are such a space saver and easy to clean!  I recommend them to everyone who is looking for a space saving highchair!
