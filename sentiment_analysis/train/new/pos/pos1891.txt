Love these blankets!!! They are soft and great looking...My only problem with them was that they were way too small/short...they're great for summer, though...You can't possibly swaddle a newborn in these, unless he/she is 5 lbs maybe...Our boy was 9 lbs and we only used them for when we were covering him up or when we were changing him outside of our home over those portable/travel plastic changing pads...They're good, but it depends on the purpose you're trying to use them for.
