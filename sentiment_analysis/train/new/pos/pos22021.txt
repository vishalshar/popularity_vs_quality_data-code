This is the only pacifier my son will take.  We tried several other brands and sizes, and even though he's a big 5 month old, he gags on any nipples in the 6-18 month size.  The nipple on these pacifiers is flat and wide.  There is no bulb on the tip, nor is it like the nipple on a bottle.  There is no area to indicate whether you'd like boy, girl, or neutral styles, so if that matters, I'd caution you against purchasing online.
