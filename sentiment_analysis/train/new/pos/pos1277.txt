I bought one for my older son about 6 months ago and  I liked it enough to get one for my second son, because they share a room!I like the fact that it is solid and not a character.  I also love that it has gathered corners so it stays on the bed.  The only downfall is that when you wash it pills.  You must wash it by itself only!!
