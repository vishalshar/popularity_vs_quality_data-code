We have a 5 month old that just started rolling but prefers to sleep swaddled.  She's a snuggle bug.  So, I thought this would be a great item so she could feel snuggly, but free to roll and have her hands if she needed to.  Overall the product is great, but we had to swaddle her on the second night of using it because she just wouldn't sleep with her arms able to flail around and wake her up.  She sleeps within arms reach ;), so it's not an issue.  I feel confident that she'll grow into liking it very soon.Complaint: The zipper at the shoulder does stick out weird.  It has a snap to help close the flap that covers the zipper, but it should have a second snap to keep it flat.  Other than that, I'm happy with it.
