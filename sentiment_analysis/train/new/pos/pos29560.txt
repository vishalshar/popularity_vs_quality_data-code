Fits Potette Plus perfectly!  I was skeptical buying these liners because there were reviews that these did not fit the Potette potty, but I read a response that they were redesigned so I figured I would give it a try.  You do not have to put the liner over the rim so the child is sitting on the plastic.  Pull the handles as if you were closing the bag up, loop the handles around the legs, and then open the bag back up.  I put a folded paper towel into it to soak up the pee.
