My friend's daughter has one of these blankets (well, it's a cheap made in China version) and she just loves to play with the different textured tags. How could I not purchase a Baby Jack Blanket for my own Baby Jack? I might like this blanket, but my son has no interest in it and hasn't since we purchased it at age 3 months. He is now 1 year and the blanket looks like new because he has played with it so little. I love it though and enjoy the textures myself as one side is satiny smooth and the other a soft minky fabric. It is nicely made and large enough to use as a small cover for a little baby. Though my son doesn't seem intrigued by this item, I would purchase again as a gift. Nice item!
