I'll start with this: I wouldn't have wanted to use this bottle for my daughter when she was still breastfeeding, because it makes getting milk from a bottle WAY too easy!  When she stopped nursing, though, she and I were both getting frustrated with how slow other bottles were (even with fast-flow nipples) and how the nipples would collapse on themselves.  All the parts of this bottle took a little getting used to (I forgot to put in the bottom gasket once and in my sleepy state couldn't figure out why milk was draining all over the counter - not so bad when it's cow's milk, but when it's your own that you've worked so hard for, you learn really quick!).  Once we got past that minor hurdle, these bottles have been absolutely fabulous.  We have tried so many different kinds of bottles, and this is the only one I've found that truly allows the milk to flow without the need for occasional breaks to let air in through the nipple (we vented most of the others by unscrewing the cap just slightly, but of course this can lead to leaks).  The bend in the top is an added bonus - slightly easier on the wrist holding it.  Not that I want my daughter to guzzle her milk, but with the other bottles it seemed to take an eternity to get all the milk out - even when she was trying really hard.  I definitely recommend these to non-nursing moms.  Just don't forget the gasket!
