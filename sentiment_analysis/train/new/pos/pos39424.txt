Just as described.  They fit perfectly in my Toyata Highlander.  They do have a piece you have to wrap around the seat, which I've seen others complain about, but how else are they supposed to stay in place?  They work for my 6 and 4 year old boys, keeping their snacks and toys off the floors.  They can reach them but they are in boosters and use regular seat belts.  One would not be able to reach the items inside if they were in a harnessed carseat.
