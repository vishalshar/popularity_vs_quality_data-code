THis crib was a little to much to put together but what isnt these days. After set up was complete it was soooo beautiful I even started to cry! THe crib is very heavy and sturdy exaclty what one should be looking for when purchasing baby furniture its a little up there with the price but in my oppnion well worth it I purchased this crib in white and the color is rich and the paint is soft even the wood has great texture If i love this in white i could only imagine how beautiful it is in even darker color. any matress will do I chose the serta night star extra firm and this matress is longer and bit bigger then most but when i put it in the crib there were no gaps for liitle fingers to get caught and the extra height makes it easy for mommy to reach her little one. They truly r the perfect pair the matress and crib r great and I LOVE IT!
