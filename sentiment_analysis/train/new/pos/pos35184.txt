I bought this duo for 2 grandsons, aged 6 months and 18 months.  My thinking was, the Sophie Teether for the infant, and the real giraffe for the bigger one who always wants what the the little guy has.  What has happened, is that they both prefer the original Sophie.  It is adorable, soft, easily manuevered.....and it squeaks.  I suggest buying 2 Sophies - you'll be happy and so will the kids!
