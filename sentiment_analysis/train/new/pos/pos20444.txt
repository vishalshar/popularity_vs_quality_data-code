I have had this in my 2 year old daughter's bedroom for about a year now.Things to keep in mind:-This dresser cost me $299 and shipped for free to Hawaii! OF COURSE THE MATERIALS ARE NOT TOP NOTCH! You would have to pay twice the amount for great quality materials.-Contrary to what I was expecting for quality, I was actually presently surprised with how sturdy it is and how it appears to look much more expensive than it actually is.-I have paid similar amounts for other dressers and they have not held up nearly as well as this one.-Assembly was easy for me, but I have probably put together every piece of furniture in my home.-I am not concerned with this tipping over and my daughter easily opens and closes the bottom drawers.-It fits all of her clothes with room to spare. It is the perfect size for a toddler/small child.-AND I really love the design.I'm currently looking for a dresser/changer for my son's bedroom that is similar to this quality and price and I have not found anything that comes close.
