So far so good! I have been using these safety catches for 3 weeks now and they have worked out perfect. My 1 year old can no longer get into the garbage/cleaning supply cabinet under the sink.This product was very easy to install. I did not even need to install the catch pieces that come with it, just the long latches. The way my cabinets are set up (see photos) the long latch latches on to the inner part of my cabinets. I can make then adjustable by installing them higher up for a more tighter fit and smaller opening. I don't think they are cheaply made and they would take a pretty decent amount of force before breaking inmy opinion.These are doing exactly what I needed them too. I am very happy with my purchase!
