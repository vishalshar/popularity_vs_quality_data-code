This bedding set worked perfectly in our nursery and went great with current decor.  My child loved looking at and patting the animals on the bumper pad and sheet. The comforter is nice and soft, but embroidery did come loose in a couple of places, but posed no danger to child. Diaper stacker held up well, also.
