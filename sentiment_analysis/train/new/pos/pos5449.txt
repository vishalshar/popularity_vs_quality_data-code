This is the second brand of reusable panty liners I've bought. I love these so much! I use them every day whether I'm on or off my period. I've been using the Diva cup for 2 months now and between the cup and these panty liners, I feel super safe from spills, and I'm not having to throw anything away! The only thing that surprised me when I got these was that they have a waterproof layer. What a pleasant surprise! Another thing I like about them is that they're easy to wash. When I take one off, I rinse it in cold water immediately, toss it into a mesh lingerie bag, and on laundry day I can just throw the whole thing into the washing machine and then pin them up to dry! They do stain easily, being that they're white, so I'm still pondering how to get blood stains out safely, but overall I'm completely satisfied with this product! The brand I bought before these was GladRags. I don't recommend those at all. This brand doesn't slide like GladRags does, they maintain their shape unlike GladRags, and they're even longer and wider than GladRags. They seem to be more durable too. I'm totally happy with these. My search is over.UPDATE********* Don't ever use fabric softener on these!!! NEVER!! They still work, but they don't stay put as well as they used to.
