These are great for covering diaper changing pads, public changing tables, protecting your couch if you change your baby there or when visiting a friend, protecting the bouncer, johnny jump up and other cloth seat toys, the car seat when potty training... They wash over and over and stay intact if you follow the care instructions. So much easier to toss a pad in the wash than to clean a couch, etc. I like this size best, but they do have a smaller size available as well. Also, this fits a Summer Infant Bassinet Pad (I'm using it with my Graco Travel Lite Crib) with about an inch left around the sides, so it covers the important places. Its just a waterproof barrier pad, not the kind that add padding or thickness and not a mattress cover that has elastic around the edges or is fitted. Its completely flat. Just wanted to make that clear to the new mamas out there. All the baby products out there can be overwhelming sometimes!
