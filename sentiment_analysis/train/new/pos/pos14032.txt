I have been using these storage containers for a few months now and I have to say that I really love them. They store 4 oz of homemade baby food and really offer a airtight seal. I can easily stack them in the fridge or freezer and so far, have held up pretty well. The inner silicone ring can be removed for proper washing as well. While this is micorwave and dishwasher safe, I choose to hand wash them and microwave the containers sparingly to extend the life of the product. When freezing baby food, I only store 3.5oz or so to allow room for the food to expand while freezing. So far, I've had no issues with leaking or the container or lid cracking when dropped.I love that you have to lock the lid in place, so you know it's sealed securely, but yet it's easy to open too. Yonger children will have no problem opening these containers on thier own, so they are great to send along with snacks/lunch for smaller school aged children, but it's up to your kids to make sure these containers make it back home! I purchase a BUNCH of sets at about 55% off, so I really got my money's worth. These containers are great and even better if you get them on sale! Innobaby is a great company and they really stand behind their products, so if there is ever an issue, don't hesitate to call them directly. A friend had one of her lids crack and they immediately replaced it with no issue. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing the Innobaby Square Food Storage Container, they are well made and are sized to store baby food, on the go snacks/meals, and are perfectly sized for kids who still eat "kid sized lunches" for school.
