I love these sippy cups. The only problem that I have with them is that sometimes when my daughter drops it (or throws it), the lid loosens and half the water spills out. Other than that, these are great! They are very customizable. You can take off the flip lid if your child doesn't know how to work it yet, you can take off the clip and replace it with handles or don't put anything on them. You can switch spouts if your child prefers a different one Avent makes. They are very easy to clean by hand too (we live in an apartment without a dishwasher).
