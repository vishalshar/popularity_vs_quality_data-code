It is as the other reveiws said slow it takes about 20 min to heat the bottle not to big of a problem my son eats on a schedual so I know when to start heating the bottle. every one needs to remember it's drawing power from a 12v power sourse so it or any other portable heater can only do so much with that amount of power. That said I would love to have one that heats a bottle in a min or two and the saftey switch on the bottom was really not an issue I just use a pen at the bottom of the bottle to keep the switch down. I didn't want to give the item a 3 star rating although I thought about it but I expected it to be slow when I ordered it and it will heat the bottle we use plastic bottles I don't know if glass ones would heat faster or not.
