First, I have to say the other reviews for this snack tray about being a permanent fixture or that it's too hard to take off are totally false.  Either they got an incompatible tray or they got one not made by BOB.  The one I just bought/received from Amazon is made by and for the BOB, and it attaches and detaches in a couple of seconds.  It's as simple as pushing the release button on the side.  I can even release one side so the whole tray swivels out of the way.Regarding its height, it's about chest high for my son, who is 2 and about average height.  Not as low as other strollers, but it doesn't appear to bother my son.  He can see right over it easily.  He actually loves having the snack tray to hold onto also.You can leave the snack tray in place when folding up the stroller.  It neatly tucks in there, although the stroller is not quite as compact as without the tray.  It appears to add a couple of inches to the height of the folded up stroller.
