Starting from the beginning, it's a lightweight nylon bag. Don't expect too much in terms of protection. It will prevent stains and scuffs, but won't protect from major hits or damage.The fit is rather tight, so getting the stroller inside can be a pain. If you still need the baby carrier, you're going to have to remove the car seat receivers, or it won't close. What I've done is just put them in the stroller's zippered bag. Once you have it inside, you can fit a couple things in the bag, like the stroller organizer or rain cover.It comes with a carrying strap to hang off your shoulder, but sadly it doesn't have a cushion and the strap is relatively thin, so it's not very comfortable.Taking this into account, it's a decent option to protect your stroller if you have to check it at the airport.
