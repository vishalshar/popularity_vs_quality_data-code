I have been searching for a narrow booster seat that would fit in my Mercedes C350.  The Graco booster was the narrowest I could find and it was still very, very tight.  When I pulled out the Compass booster, it was very wide, but the back portion is narrow.  It fits perfectly in my car with extra space for buckling!  The kids also love them, they are good for napping.
