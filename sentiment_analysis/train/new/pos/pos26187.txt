Our four-month old is finally starting to like this toy though he's been on it for over a month for short periods of time. Today he made a full circle, smiled the whole way, and was proud of himself. I really like that he feels comfortable on it, can touch down his hands and feet, and is off of the ground for tummy time. We have put the platform in various places to make him turn more. The mat beneath the platform is not very interactive for our little guy. I still recommend it.
