These cups are THE BEST for my girls. I have three girls and all have used these cups as they are learning to drink water from a cup. I just recently purchased two more of these for my six month old. She can already grab the handles and bring the cup to her mouth. The spout is just the right size for her to understand that water comes out of the cup while not dumping a whole bunch down her front. It also does not seem to take too much coordination for her to suck the water out.  As your kids get older you will want different cups though as these seem to be too small/not the right flow for an older child (say over a year).The cup is durable (can be thrown!). I don't know about dishwasher safe as we don't have one...but it's super easy to take apart and clean by hand (which I do several times a day!).Great cups- will buy them every time we need more!
