My grandson loves this toy. The only thing I have a problem with/question about is it he length of the pull cord. In the picture it shows a walking toddler pulling the penguin when in reality the pull string is about 11 inches so a walking child can not stand and pull the toy! It's much too short!Perhaps an after market thought was a choking/ strangulation hazard?
