we love this in our house. We bought this when our son was around 4 months old, he is now 8 months. When we first got it we had to use pillows under his feet as he was too short. I did read a number of reviews that had said this was the case.it wasn't long before he grew into it and he loves playing it in even now at 8 months old, he just goes crazy fun times in it. We weren't sure what the point of the horse was as it doesn't move and the pigs don't do anything either, but baby loves them. He loves trying to find the horses face and pulling at the pigs.The music while super annoying to me, only because it's so catchy I stop myself many times during the day signing along to it, even when it's turned off. Sad I know. our sons loves the music and goes his most bonkers when the music is playing. We often Skype with family who are over seas and often have to put baby in here to entertain him, and family just laugh at him and can sit and watch him for what feels like ages as he completely bottoms out the jumper.I've had to remove the seat cover to wash after several accidents and it washes really easily, no running dies, dries quickly and is easy to remove and put back on.The buttons under the veggies are a bit of a non starter really as you really have to push the shapes down to get them to do anything, but who cares, one less sound it makes and baby spends more time chewing on them than anything else.we are about to move this up to height number three so I feel we have had a good run with this, it provides us with a good break, as he is starting to learn how to walk and it gives our backs a rest but keeps baby happy as he is still standing and able to flap around like a chicken and have fun
