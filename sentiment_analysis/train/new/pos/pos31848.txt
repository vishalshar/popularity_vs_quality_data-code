This parrot is cleverly designed and well made.  My two cats seem to recognize it as a bird but otherwise they're not impressed.  I'm waiting for tomorrow morning at 4:30 a.m. when they meow loud and long to wake me, and get their meows right back.  Will update this if anything interesting happens.  Meanwhile, the bird was easy to assemble and shuts itself off after a while, which is good to conserve the battery.  Good value for the money.
