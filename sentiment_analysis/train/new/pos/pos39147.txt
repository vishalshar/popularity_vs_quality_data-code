I get compliments on this diaper bag all the time! I bought this diaper bag on Amazon, while I was in Germany, based solely on its description. I am so glad I did!ProsIt is well organized.It is not too big, nor is it too small for everyday use. However, I would not recommend this for packing many things for an extended trip.It may be used as a backpack. If you use an infant carrier, you will definitely appreciate this feature. It is very uncomfortable to use a shoulder strap while carrying your baby.The backpack straps may be conveniently stored in the back zipper compartment.The backpack straps are lightly padded.The backpack straps are adjustable. I am only 4'11'', at 110 pounds, while my husband is 6'1'' at 170 pounds. Neither of us has any problem adjusting the straps to fit properly.The shoulder strap is removable.The shoulder strap is lightly padded.It comes with easy-to-use stroller straps.The design is simple and the colors are pleasing, without being too girly.It comes with a changing pad, which I have found to be indispensable.The changing pad has a pocket that you may use to store wipes and diapers. It makes it easy to change my daughter's diaper while we're out, without having to take the whole diaper bag to the rest room.ConsThe stroller straps broke after only 3 months of use.The shoulder strap is not long enough for most people to be able to use across their bodies (It is barely long enough for me at only 4'11'').The bottle pockets do not keep bottles warm or cold for very long (maybe 2 hours).
