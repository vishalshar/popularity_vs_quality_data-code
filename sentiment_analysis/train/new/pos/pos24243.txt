This is the best seat we have owned. I have 3 kids and have tried many! The bottom comes with foam pads that don't scratch up the toilet seat like our last potty seat did. Nothing looks worse than a white toilet seat with lots of grey streaks on it. People were afraid to sit down! It also doesn't have a high lip in the front. My poor boys would get hurt when getting off of the other seats that have a high cup in the front.  Ouch!
