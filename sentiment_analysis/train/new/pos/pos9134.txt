I'll just get straight to the point:Pros:The bugs actually face DOWN towards the baby!  How many mobiles have the animals looking toward the wall so they LOOK cute when you walk in?  WAY too many.  This one actually looks entertaining from baby's point of view.  This was my main reason for choosing this one.  There are many other butterfly themed mobiles that are cheaper, but they don't do anything from baby's POV.It has a stopper on it.  Sometimes this is the last thing my daughter wants. So when I wind it up and she's too upset, there's a stopper on it so everything stops.The mobile is high!  So now we can leave it in a little longer before worrying about her pulling it down.Cons:We have a wide bar crib so that might be why, so it didn't install very well.  My husband had to maneuver it a little bit but it is firmly attached to her crib now so he figured something out.This is the only mobile I've owned, but the music seems a little short.  It goes pretty fast and doesn't last long.All in all I WOULD RECOMMEND this product.  The three of us love it.
