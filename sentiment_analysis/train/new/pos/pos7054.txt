This is exactly what we needed and works well the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is how "flimsy" for lack of a better word the plastic lock/lever is. I have 2 small boys and so far it has held up fine however it bends quite a bit and as they tug on it I fear it will eventually snap.Now that being said I have it installed much higher than most people would (I assume.) It is about 6 inches from the top of the door. I did this so it wasn't an eyesore or right at eye level. I believe if installed more central it would likely not do that because the force would be more localized vs the way I have it but then it becomes an eye sore. However because the force of the door being opened by the boys ages 4.5 & 1.5 (when locked) they get it open a few centimeters and then the latch gives a bit. If it was made of a sturdier material I don't believe this would happen. Time will tell how long it will give before snapping..
