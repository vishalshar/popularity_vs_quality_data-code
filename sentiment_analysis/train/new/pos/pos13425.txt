I bought this changing mat as part of a gift basket for a friend's baby shower, and now that we've all seen the product, we're convinced this is a must-have for all new parents. All future baby shower gifts from me will include this genius changing mat!Here's why: 1) the size:- lightweight- rolls up super small, soft & flexible- when opened up, it's the perfect size -- can use at all stages, from baby to toddler- perfect for travel- easily fits into even small purses2) the construction:- well-made- features a nice snap closure rather than a flimsy tie or elastic that wears out easily- waterproof, so it's easily cleaned (especially helpful when traveling or on the go)- cute prints, stylish3) bonus points:- great price (so well-priced that it makes sense to buy more than one so you always have one on-hand -- at home and on the go)- super fast shipping, well-packaged- made in the USA!- supporting small business is a very good thingI would recommend this product to any parent, especially if you're not into lugging around a bulky changing pad. For parents on the go, this is a must-have. Also makes a great gift! Can't recommend this enough. Two thumbs up.
