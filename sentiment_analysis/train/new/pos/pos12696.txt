Even though this level nipple is labeled for 3+ months of age, we moved our daughter up at about two months as she seemed to be straining a lot with the Level 1 nipple (she was sucking so hard she'd suck the nipple in on itself). It took exactly one feeding for her to get used to the new level and everything is just fine.We have had no problems with these nipples. We mainly hand-wash them (only because we don't run the dishwasher often enough to include the bottles as often as we'd need them) but they do go through the dishwasher about once a week. We also don't use any type of sanitizer--I outgrew that need about three weeks after my first baby and this one is number two. :)The only thing that I don't love is that the Level number is written on the bottom ring of the nipple so it's impossible to see unless the nipple is completely out of the ring and bottle. After using the Avent nipples where 1) the holes on the nipple correspond to the Level (one hole, two holes, three holes) and 2) the Level number is on the side of the nipple (so you can easily see it while it's in the ring and bottle), it was a surprise and took some getting used to that the hole was just bigger (instead of there being two holes). That said, it isn't enough to knock the rating down any because once you make the transition to a new Level nipple and get rid of the old Levels, you really don't need to look at which nipple you have in your hand.P.S. I find it hard to believe the other review that says these nipples tore. I know there are always odd things that can happen with any product, but to me that just seems very unlikely during normal use.
