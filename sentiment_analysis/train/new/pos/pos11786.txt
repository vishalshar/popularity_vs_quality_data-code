This jumper has been a lifesaver for my husband and I.  Our daughter started trying to jump and climb on us around four months and she was so strong that she was wearing us out and leaving bruises with her little toes digging into our skin while she jumped on us.  lol  So we purchased this jumper and she is in love with it!  She loves the little piano, and she loves spinning the little cluster of flowers.  She stays busy playing and jumping in this thing for an hour or more at a time.  One of the best purchases that we have made as new parents.  It easily adjusts as she gets taller.  The only drawback is that the seat is a little stiff so she cannot really spin herself around without her help.  This problem will take care of itself as she gets older.  She is six months now and is still exploring everything on it.  It also has places where you can hang other toys which we have done so she won't become bored with it.  Excellent for any parent!
