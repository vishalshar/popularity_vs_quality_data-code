i rated this toy 5 stars because it was both inexpensive AND engaging (not a very frequent find, i am learning).i must admit one of the main reasons i bought this toy was because other reviewers said it was "too" quiet (sign me up!).  yes, the weather guy was...repetitive.  but he really wasn't very loud so the annoyance factor was little to nil.  plus, we had this toy for about a month before it stopped working sound-wise (i should note that it was used OFTEN; the buttons were not lacking in the attention arena), and it's still getting use for its visual properties alone (our daughter is now almost 6 months old but still shows interest when we present it to her as an "alternative" to Mommy and Daddy's remote control).so yeah, this product does the job for a while and continues to be a pretty good visual toy on its own without the sound features once the batteries die out.  can't really ask for more for four bucks!
