I love this diaper bag because of all of the compartments.  Within the main compartment there are two pockets to hold diapers, bibs, clothes, or wipes (at least that's what we use it for) and the outside has multiple pocket possibilities as well.  We can carry just about everything we need or could want to have with us when we go out with our little one.  I like to be prepared, so we have usually have in the bag: 4 diapers, a container of wipes, a bib or two, Infant Tylenol, Mylicon, a change of clothes, a bottle, formula in a small dispenser, baby food, a spoon or two, insurance cards, a booklet from the pediatrician, immunization records, & my wallet, chapstick, and cell phone.  My husband teases that ew could go camping with what I carry in my purse, but I always have whatever it is that he needs...  I also really like the zippered bag included for dirty/wet clothes--nothing else get contaminated and it's easy to wipe out.  The padded changing mat with zippered pockets is great too.  I keep diaper cream in one of the pockets (they unfold so baby doesn't lay on them when being changed).
