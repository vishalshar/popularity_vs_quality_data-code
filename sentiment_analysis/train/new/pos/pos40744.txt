We're not anti-disposables nor are we pro-cloth.Disposable diapers are expensive and can be rough on the child's bottom, but cloth diapers can be high maintenance. We've chosen to use disposables when we're on the go, but try cloth diapers when we're at home.These are great because when the baby is quite young, it doesn't leak all the way throughâ€”the cloth inserts absorb well. They offer 2 inserts per diaper.The cloth is very soft and delicate on the baby's bottom.Once they're soiled, I recommend you clean and soak them before washing, and wash them right away, otherwise they are more likely to get stained.They maintain well as long as you take care of them. They worked well for our boy till he outgrew them, and we plan on using them for our next child.
