OK, not only am I happy cause it's Hello Kitty, but it has two different types of teethers on it, pretty pastel colors, cute story line, and each page of the book has a different sensory activity your baby can play with.  One page has a squirrel where the tail actually is a piece of fabric that comes out of the book and your child can feel and move around. Another page has a picture of Hello Kitty's friends where there is a picture of one character and then a small mirror (of course signaling that your baby is Hello Kitty's friend too).  Another picture has a tree where it's made out of a different shimmery and silky material to catch the eye of your little angel.One thing to note, this book is VERY CRINKLY!  It is LOUD.  Like, even just brushing your hand across it will crinkle a lot.  At first my little girl was too young and hated many noises so she couldn't play with this.  But now she LOVES it and every time she hears it her head perks up in the direction of the sound and she gets really excited to play with her book.The fabric is easy to wipe clean and the teethers are different textures.  The green one is thinner and more plyable.  It has lines across it and is much easier for a smaller baby to maneuver.  The dark pink is much thicker and harder in texture.  It has big raised circles on it and would probably be better for a bigger baby.  Because of the versatility I think this book will last a very long time for my little girl :)
