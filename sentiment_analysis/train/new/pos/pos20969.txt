The Zippy Absorbent bibs are quality bibs that do not soak through easily. What's really nice about them, besides their looks, is that they have a fleece backing that does not let liquid through even when the front of the bib is totally saturated with spit up and drool. These bibs are also bigger than Zippy's regular bibs and are more useful for feedings and keeping outfits clean. My son is now 4 months old and big for his age so these will probably work for a while especially since there are two snaps spaced out on the bandana. Much cuter than a regular bib, soft, and washes well.
