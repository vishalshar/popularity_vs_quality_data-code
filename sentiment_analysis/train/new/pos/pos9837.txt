This is quite the adorable and useful little comb/brush/mirror set for baby's bureau. The design is clever with the comb and brush set up as the ears on the head of the bunny mirror. The tail of the bunny serves as the mirror's handle and the "ears" fit perfectly in the bunny's head.  The colors are very appealing and add to the overall cuteness.  The brush and comb are both very soft for baby's fine scalp.  It is as useful as it is cute.Once our baby grew into a toddler the set has become essential to grooming the dollies.We have since purchased this same set as a baby-shower gift and was just as well received by the gift recipient as it had been by us.
