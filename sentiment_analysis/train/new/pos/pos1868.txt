These containers are great for the homemade baby food I made for my munchkin. It holds the perfect amount. It comes with a small marker so that you can write in the square label space what the food is. They don't give you much space but I was able to write Spaghetti with the marker and it fit perfect. You can write on the cups anywhere really but the space they provide is sunken in for whatever reason. If you don't let the words sit for a few min then they will be easily wiped off. They always came off in the dishwasher so it wasn't like they were stuck on there but I have accidently erased some of the labels before they made it to the fridge or the freezer. These cups come with lids so they can be stacked. They almost lock onto each other so they wont fall over. it made it convienient in my freezer to keep them together if I didn't have them on the tray they came with or if they were stacked two high like the picture shows. At first I thought that the lids didn't stay on very well at all but you can pop them on then give them a turn and they will lock on. The turn is they key. I would definitely recommend this product!
