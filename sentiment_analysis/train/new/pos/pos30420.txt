Im not sure why the description says that these are reversible but they most certainly are not. The Sherpa soft material is only on the one side so I am not sure what they would expect to be on the inside. Also, I was surprised to see that a ivory colored set of strap covers arrived. I saw blue in the picture and there was not an option to choose color so I assumed that blue would arrive. Besides the color and the fact that they are not reversible, I am happy with them. They are soft and the velcro is strong and holds them in place very well. My son's neck is protected from the straps and he seems to find them comfortable.
