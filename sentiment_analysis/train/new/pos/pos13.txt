This set it so nice!  While it's difficult to imagine by just looking at the pictures, the way the bowl is molded it's very easy to scoop little baby mouthfuls out, keep everything in a nice pile and not make a mushy mess of everything.  I'm not spending time scraping food into piles I can scoop with the spoon - the design keeps everything all scraped on it's own.  Again, hard to describe, but EONS ahead traditional bowl/spoon sets.The spoons themselves (I received 2 spoons with one bowl) are so nice - they have a bit of a curve that's perfect for holding the food and listing up into baby's mouth.  They are my favorite baby spoons as well.Ours has stood up to being dropped on hardwood floors, dishwashing and microwaving with no problems.This won't stay on the table by itself if your baby knows how to (or accidently) slides it across the table.  Most babies won't be able to pick it up though, because of the way it's molded.  Our little one is 10 months and we don't give him this bowl as he will slide it right off the table.  I saw so many mixed reviews on the suction bowls I originally bought this, and wile it won't stay put on it's own, it doesn't claim to.  I'm happy with the purchase.We will be buying a few more, as I'm always bummed when it's time to feed baby and my favorite bowl/spoons are already in the dishwasher!
