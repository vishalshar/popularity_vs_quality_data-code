My 5 y/o granddaughter was struggling with her first belt.  I remembered the cool belts I had for my kids when they were young...made of elastic and had a magnetic 'buckle.'  I looked on Amazon and found this product which has a different type of buckle.  She can now handle her belt alone and I know she'll be much more comfortable wearing the belt when she goes to school as she won't have to ask for help.  The belt is very simple, but well-designed.  It is adjustable so it will fit her for years to come.  The purple paisley is very cute as well.  The price seemed a bit steep to me, but I knew it would be worth it and it is.  It solves the problems we were having and I know she'll be able to use it for years.  I highly recommend this belt for youngsters.
