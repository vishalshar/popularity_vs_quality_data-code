I just received this cot and it looks really well-made and sturdy.  Easy to set up, and I really like the detachable sleeping bag concept.  However, I noticed on the other models that don't include the sleeping bag, they do include a fitted sheet instead.  I've searched all over the web trying to find a fitted sheet specifically for this cot, but I can't find a site where Regalo sells them separately.  It would be nice to have for use when my little one doesn't need the sleeping bag (which he will likely slide off when sitting on...it's pretty slippery!).  He's a messy little guy, and if he gets the cot itself dirty, it's going to be a pain to wash the attached canvas instead of just throwing a cot sheet in the washer.  On the bright side, the dimensions of the cot are 48 x 26, and most standard crib sheets are in the neighborhood of 52 x 27, so at least a fitted crib sheet will be a decent solution in the mean time.
