My grandson is almost completely satisfied with this purchase. Now that we have had it for a few weeks, I have noticed that he gets a little aggravated when the jungle sounds automically turn off. If only you could determine the length of time that the noise/music lasts. My only other negative is that it is battery operated...I should have paid better attention when researching. As I said, it has only been a matter of weeks and I am already replacing the batteries, four D-cells (and it is not as if he is even in the swing daily, only when he visits). I sincerly wish that I would have selected a swing with a plug-in adaptor. With all of that said, he LOVES his swing. His favorite part of the swing is the rotating mobile. It absolutely mesmerizes him. The second favorite, is the noise/music player, of course. My favorite thing is watching how much he enjoys swinging in it!
