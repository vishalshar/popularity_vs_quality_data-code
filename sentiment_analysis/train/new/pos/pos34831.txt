I ordered the Autumn by mistake when I meant to order Chocolate, so while I'm not sure I can use it for what I planned, I can't mark my review down for my mistake.  The fabric feels of good, semi-heavy quality for a scarf and has a slight crinkle to it that adds to the feeling of quality.  The colors blend/fade well into one another and are far less like stripes than the picture might imply. It's well worth every penny of the $14.  I threw it in the dryer straight out of the package for a few minutes with a wet curtain and that worked perfectly to knock out the creases.  I love the colors I got, they just don't go well with the room I bought them for... I'm keeping it anyway and trying to find another place to use it!
