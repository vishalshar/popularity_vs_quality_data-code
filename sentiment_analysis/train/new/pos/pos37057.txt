I started tummy time immediately with my infant, per recommendations in Baby 411, 4th Edition: Clear Answers & Smart Advice For Your Baby's First Year (Baby 411: Clear Answers and Smart Advice for Your Baby's First Year) . In fact, we just went to her 2-month checkup and the pediatrician was highly impressed. She stated that our little girl has the neck strength of a 4 month old.I purchased this product because I wanted to add variety to our tummy time routine and I have to say that the baby loves this one. The cute little animals on the front catch her eye and she's delighted to be on her tummy.  There's nice colorful pictures on the other side, which helps her visual acuity. The mirror does have a "funhouse" mirror effect if you look at it from different angles, but I think she can see herself fine. It also sits up very nicely on any surface and seems to have a very easy way to connect to cribs.I'll definitely start giving this product as a gift.
