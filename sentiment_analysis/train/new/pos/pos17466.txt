I really went back & forth if I wanted to spend the amount money or not on a car seat for a tall 4 year old or just go with the Britax Booster. My gut told me go for it because there is no price you can put on your child's safety! She is a little wiggle worm who kept exhausting every reason to lean out of her booster and reach around the car for things. I could not stand seeing the back of her booster moving forward with her and the side's pulling off the car seat every time. I knew if a little moving would break her Graco car seat down then I did not even want to imagine what would happen in an accident! Having my husband observe this he was completely on board for this seat!We cannot afford a big safe SUV so for us driving a Camry this was a must! I cannot express to you enough that this Car Seat is Amazing!!! Like I said, we have a tall 4 year old who will actually be 5 this summer...the straps fit perfectly, they do not bother her! She is secure, and she sits well back into the car seat. It truly positions them and aligns exactly how they are supposed to be! Leaving her entire body protected, especially her torso to her head! She sleeps so much better in this car seat!We bought the Portabello, with living in Florida we were hoping this would hold the least amount of heat...we were shocked how there was actually no heat at all. The Portabello is really soft and almost like a micro suede.It was easy to install, and sits so snug there is no way it will budge. I could not be more happy with our choice to ensure our little one's safety.
