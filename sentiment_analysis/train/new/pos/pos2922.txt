I picked this up because I prefer the Amazon Elements Baby Wipes abd they only come in a soft bag so I needed something a little more durable for on the go.There are endless baby wipes cases on the market but I opted for this model specifically because I trust the Skip Hop brand.This container features what they call a Quick-draw button. It easily slides open and shut with one hand for dispensing and storing.There is a Grab-strap on one end which conveniently snaps onto any stroller or bag.After a few days of repeated use i can teat that so far this definitely dispenses wipes neatly, one at a time. It also closes with a ‘click’ to keep wipes moist.One of the major selling points for ne was the translucent case because it lets you see when your wipes are low, allowing you to refill.To fill simply open the case from side and insert your refillable wipes. I can fit about 40-50 wipes easily at a time. Overfilling will affect the dispensing function so be sure its not too full.To open just slide the quick-draw button to access your wipes. To close simply slide the same quick-draw button closed and press firmly until a soft 'click' is heard.The button does snap off, if that happens for some reason, just pop it back on with the button indent facing the asterisk.
