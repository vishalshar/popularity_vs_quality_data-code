The design is really cute and I actually purchased this bouncer because of the great colours and not because it is cheap. I would say that there are sturdier models out there but nevertheless this bouncer is sturdy enough for daily use and works just fine. One thing i don't like is the way the middle toy is fixed on the carrier, a 5-month-old baby can rip it off at any time - the strap should be harder to rip off. Apart from that I am very content with this product and I can really recommend it.
