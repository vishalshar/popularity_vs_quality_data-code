The majority of the reviews of this product are for the older version, which did indeed have some fairly major design issues with the sippy lid and its silicone insert, however the both of those items have been redesigned to address those issues.The first issue most noticed with the old version was that the silicone insert would detatch itself from the lid very easily when the cup was dropped or even slammed hard onto the counter / high-chair / table.  The second issue was that the silicone insert did not completely inhibit the flow of liquid from the cup, resulting in little puddles being left anywhere the cup was allowed to remain on its side for too long.After three weeks of daily use with the new version, there's not been a single incident where the insert has fallen out, no matter how many times the cup has been accidentally "dropped" (read: flung with force).  There have not been any issues with leakage with the new version either, though I will give it several more weeks of constant use before I consider that problem truly resolved.Having owned both versions of this product, I will say that I both would not have recommended the previous version AND would have no hesitations recommending this version.That said, I must also express my disappointment with OXO for not offering the updated lid and insert for sale separately, because I suspect many people out there would rather spend $3-4 on a new lid/insert than $8 to buy the whole thing over again.
