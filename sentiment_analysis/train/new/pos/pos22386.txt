UPDATED REVIEW(7/7/2015)==========================Its just been 6 months since i started using this stroller, and its basket is already starting to tear apart. Please not that though i do use this buggy everyday, but basket was the least used part of the stroller for me. I usually use mommy hooks to hang diaper bags and grocery. Deducting 1 star for the quality.February 11, 2015==============I searched for weeks when i wanted to buy a new stroller. We already have Graco travel system, but when there were times that i had to handle stroller alone without my hubby's help, like dropping Baby to daycare, grocery, shopping etc...It was impossible for me to lift 26 pounds stroller and put that in Trunk everytime. I searched a lot. My main requirements were :1) Lightweight2) Small to fold since most strollers take all of Trunk space(Thats where Most of Umbrella strollers lacked for me, as even when folded straight the lengthwise size was big in Trunk. And carrying it over shoulder such a lengthy stroller is awkward). In fact it folds so compact that we went to a restaurant where baby strollers were not allowed(weird!!!), anyways, we said no problem. we folded the stroller and tucked it under table. Everyone was looking at how we were able to tuck that big stroller under the two-person table and still sit comfortably.!! Cool right!!3) In Price-range: My budget was around $150, but when i saw its feature, i was ready to shell more bucks out of my pocket, specially when similar stroller in other named-company is almost costs $400. Compared to that, its specially reasonable. Though added weather covers would have been nice touch.I found this stroller by Luck while googling. Mostly you see G-Luxe and McLaren strollers when mentioned about lightweight. This stroller was not in many blogs, which is surprising cos i found it better than those. This is my everyday stroller now. I don't even think twice while getting this one out.Along with above reasons i mentioned why i chose this, following were bonus for me that i didn't expect:1) Good basket size. Since its open from front for basket access, you can put a lot if you keep the leg-seat upright.2) Can attach to any car-seat. Now this is something hardly any umbrella stroller can even provide you with. I was so impressed with this feature, that i regret buying my heavy-travel system. I could have bought a good lightweight infant-seat, and this stroller instead.3) Smooth Maneuverability, just like any full size stroller.Its one hand fold is not a deal-breaker for me, but it would have been nice since on many occasions, its only me carrying our babe with no extra hand to hold him. But as i said, not a deal breaker for me for the features it has.Since i have been using it almost daily, there are somethings i found missing too. But since i loved this stroller so much and wanted to keep it, i found work-around for each of them:1) The back cover is fully net. Now its good in summers, but not in winters or windy weather. My workaround, just cut a black cloth from your old T-shirt or in my case, i had a suit-cover in black that was just lying there. I cut it in same size and attached it with net to cover it. Problem solved.2) Canopy is not enough to cover my son from sun, or allow him to nap in less-light. For that i bought a Canopy extender. Now its up to you how high you wana go with Canopy extender. I found a very good and stylish extender, that literally extends all the way down, so that he is completely sheltered from light when he is napping. The extender has net in front-middle too, in case you wana cover him like from drizzle or something, but want him to peek outside still.Here is the link to the extender http://www.oliveandoliver.com/shop.html#!/SimpleShade-Stroll-v2-Sport-Edition-Black/p/28262148/category=4190122 . Again, its upto you how high you wana go with extenders. On AMazon you can get cheaper ones too. But i loved this one, it was totally worth it. Not only it has nice shape and design, its waterproof and extends all the way down. My Son, who is a terrible napper, would sleep for 1-2 hrs when i extend the extender all way down so that there is no light to distract him. Money worth spent.3) It doesn't have cup/snack holder. For that i got a super light stroller organizer that working very well with this stroller. You can find my review for that stroller organizer at:https://www.amazon.com/review/R2HK2C0LFAOFD3/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm4) Its missing peek-a-boo window. For this, i'm not able to find any workaround. There is the net in back that i can open and check on him, but the velcro is so loud that it wakes up my baby everytime.**If you found this review at all helpful, please take a minute to let me know by clicking the button saying this review was helpful to you.
