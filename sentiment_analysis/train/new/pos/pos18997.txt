This is a great little bassinet for the money. The bedding is pretty and the bottom part is classic looking. I also love that top turns into a portable Moses basket so you have a travel bed and the bottom can later be used as a toy box. However, one thing people need to know is this thing is REALLY hard to put together and ours came with a screw that had a factory defect so we had to find an identical one to replace it, but f you have the patience and time to assemble it correctly and your parts have no flaws, it's a good buy for the money you spend. When little girl gets here in the next couple of weeks we're sure it's going to be a great thing to have for the first few months. My son was in his for almost 7 months.
