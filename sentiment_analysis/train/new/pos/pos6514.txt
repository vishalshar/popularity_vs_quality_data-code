At first when it arrived, I was surprised by how large each piece of this mobile is (though I shouldn't have been, as the measurements are right there stated on the description), and I was afraid they may be too big and gaudy.  But the longer they hung there, the more I fell in love with them.  They are delicate looking, and something that truly seems like a baby would enjoy looking up at, as they are bigger.  Also, I think because they are bigger, they would be less likely to really whip around and get tangled up if there were a breeze blowing around them (like a fan or open window).Another point I'd like to add is that the company who sold them through amazon, butterfly craze, was wonderful.  The first mobile I received had a few of the sequins and beads missing, and I had filled out a return/exchange label to amazon.  The company sent me a new one with no defects, without any prompting.  What a pleasant surprise!
