I bought two of these covers (one in ecru, one in blue) before my daughter was born, and we've used them for six months now. They are still just as soft and plush as when we first got it. The star/moon pattern is subtle, but makes me happy when I look at it. It's gotten all sorts of diaper contents onto it and all come off nicely in the wash, even with the light color.We have a Summer Infant 4-Sided Changing Pad, and it's a little tight getting it on properly, but not too bad. And once it's on it stays put until I want to take it off!
