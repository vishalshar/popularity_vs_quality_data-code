These bottles are great! I used to use the Avent bottles, but after this whole BPA scare I decided to put them aside and try different bottles just to be on the safe side. I purchased these along with a couple others just to see what my daughter would like the best. She was really used to, and seemed to like, the wide Avent nipples so I wanted to see if I couldn't get something similar to make the transition to different bottles easier. After about a month worth of use, these are definitely her favorites! The nipple is wider, like the Avent, and soft, and she seems to really like the shape of the nipple. And now that I have weaned her to formula the wide mouth of the bottle makes it easy for me to mix the powder formula in the bottle. Some of the other glass bottles I have tried have a narrower mouth and when making a bottle in a rush to feed a crying baby the narrow mouth makes for a mess with powder everywhere. I also like the vented bottom. I strongly believe that this has cut down on my daughter's gassiness. She doesn't seem as burpy after eating from one of these bottles as she does after eating from one of the glass ones that don't have the vented bottom. These bottles are also easy to clean. They come apart easily and all parts can be put in the dishwasher. Overall I strongly recommend this bottle to any mother! Wonderful!!!
