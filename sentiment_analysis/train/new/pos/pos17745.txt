My daughter loves this.  It's nice and big, firmly stuffed, and tolerates being squished, thrown, pulled at and drooled on well!  It gives her another animal to explore Rather than just another teddy bear from the shelf.  She brings this and her turtle most places, but we can no longer bring it to story time at the library as the other baby's and tots want them!An excellent buy!
