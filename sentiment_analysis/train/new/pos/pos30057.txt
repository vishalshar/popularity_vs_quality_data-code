We live in a small apartment. I put off getting a high chair till my son was 18 months. I was worried that he would be too big, too old,or just plain hate being confined. I didn't want to spend loads of money on something my son was going to hate. I also didn't want to buy a total piece of junk. I read the reviews and thought why not for 30 bucks I really couldn't go wrong. I am kicking myself for not buying this sooner!!! This is the best little high chair! I can pick it up with one finger yet my 18 month old son who is in the 97% for height and 75% for weight can rock in it back and fourth right to left and it doesn't move! Super easy to clean! Its simple! Some people complained about the slop of the seat, it just isn't a problem here. My son LOVES his new chair in fact we cant get him out of it without him crying he will gladly sit there for two hours (he is a very slow eater!) Total must have for small spaces or on the go parents.
