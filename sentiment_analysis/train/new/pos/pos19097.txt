These are very simple to apply to the wall and it's easy to tell which parts of the image have been transferred and which parts need more rubbing. I've had them on the wall in my daughters' room for about 18 months and they look great. I've even cleaned over a couple of them with a magic eraser and it didn't ruin it at all. I like that the dragonflies are light colored and that the wings are clear in spots. It keeps them very subtle while still being something everyone comments on.
