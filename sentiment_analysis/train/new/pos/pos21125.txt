I never swaddled my two older kids. But with my youngest - it's the only way she will sleep. She has kicked and wormed her way out of every swaddle - so I opted for the big guns and purchased this. She in instantly content and it's the only way I've been able to keep her arms contained - literally instant smiles and sighs from her as I begin to wrap her. And almost instant sleep. I put her down drowsy and she goes off to sleep happily on her own. I grant you it looks a little medieval but it works and she sleeps happily.
