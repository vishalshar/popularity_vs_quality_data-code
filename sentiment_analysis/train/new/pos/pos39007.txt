Butchers wife here...We have tried several swaddling products including the larger muslin blankets, swaddling blankets, as well as the precut swaddles. Our son is 11 weeks old now and almost ready to sleep swaddle free. Here is my run down of the product:Pros:-provides the option of arms swaddle or unswaddled and the snaps are strong enough there is no risk of the baby opening the arm holes;-allows the baby some movement and mobility but still gives the baby the coddled feeling;-the bottom up and top down zipper allows for easy diaper changes in the middle of the night (the others with velcro scare my child when opening no matter how gentle we were with velcro)-the material is the perfect weight to go over a light sleeper and keep baby comfortable;-stretches with the baby and allows the childs arms to be at his/her side or on their chest;-safe - does not ride up or come unswaddled leaving bulky material near your childs face (our experience was the "blankets" or pre-cut swaddle products put the childs arms at their side and the child can lift up their arms which makes the material ride up around their neck.)Cons:-allows for some movement(if your child needs its arms glued to its sides then this is not the product for you)-price- you should always have more than one on hand just in case of a middle of the night diaper leak but the price is a little high to have more than one or two.
