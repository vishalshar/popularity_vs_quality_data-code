UPDATE:I was contacted by Nini to replace the items I had trouble with.  They came through with wonderful replacements that work amazing!!  Hint, they now sew at the clips which makes it so much tougher!  I've been using them with sippy cups and toys in the car and I'm in love :)Original Review:I really liked the idea of this, but it ended up coming apart after I used it a couple of times.  The problem that I can see is that the area where the silicone loops over the clip is just fused instead of fastened with some kind of material.  I exchanged it with Amazon and they were great and immediately sent me a new one.  The second one was apart on both hooks when I took it out of the package before ever using it.  If I could have gotten my money back for it because it was broken, but been able to keep it somehow, I would have just taken some thread and wrapped it around and around the two pieces of silicone tightly and added a little super glue or something to hold the thread.  I wanted so much to love this product because I was in such desperate need of something like this because my son just throws everything when he decides he doesn't want to play or drink anymore, but unfortunately it was not functional for me.  I ended up just returning the second one and getting my money back.  If this company could come up with a new and improved version, I would definitely try it again.
