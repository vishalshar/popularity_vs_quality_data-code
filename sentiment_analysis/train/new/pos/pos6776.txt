This toy has become a hand-me down in our house. My children love it and the toy is durable enough to withstand 4 children playing with it. I have hung it on carseats and let the kids play with it in the floor. Even as I write this, it is hanging on a play pen that my youngest daughter crawls around in every day. The different textures and sounds this little cat makes keeps the kiddos entertained. Lamaze has earned my respect and future business. I would not hesitate to buy from this company again.
