My daughter will only take this pacifer - and it has to be the clear nipple!!I have checked every store and can no longer find them anywhere.. We are running low on our supply at home and I have been worried that we have some rough bedtimes ahead without her beloved "nukie".  I am so glad I am atleast able to find them on Amazon!She is almost 2, so we will eventually have to wean her off of them, but for now they are her comfort and these are the only ones she will take!
