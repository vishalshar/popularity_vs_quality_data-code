the best part about this carseat is that it reclines.  My baby was way to big for her infant carseat, so i bought her this booster, it has all the straps to support her, i just reclined it so she doesnt have to hold her head up for long periods of time.  now that shes growing i can slowly position it more in a sitting pose.  Also great quality, great color, for girl or boy!  Also one more thing:) insead of re threading the straps when they grow, this one has it in a way to just pull a bar from the back and the whole head piece and straps and all go more higher, such a time saver.  I can adjust it in 30 seconds.
