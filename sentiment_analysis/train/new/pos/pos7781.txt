First of all be bought this car seat (from a different vendor) because of its compact design to fit in our truck access cab which it did perfectly and was a piece of cake to fly with as well. It is a little time consuming to install just like any other car seat but no more difficult and we had no problems using the anchor system  design in my truck to use a 3 point system or just the 1 anchor on the top back and to weave the seat belt through the back to secure the bottom. As per other users statements I had no problems with the straps getting tangled or frayed and once adjusted correctly for height I had no problems getting the straps to tighten or loosen with a quick release system.  Just keep in mind this is designed as a compact seat so it may lack a few of those extra features others have (we have that luxury one in the SUV)Any way here is my point ... me and my 2 year old daughter survived a horrible rear end crash today when someone hit us going about 40mph when I was at a dead stop and totaled both vehicles.  She barely flinched. No bruises, cuts no scrapes and no pain what so ever and not one tear in her eye...even Checked out by 2 EMTs and also went to the ER with no problems.So do I love this chair?  Hell yes! It saved my daughter's life.Is it perfect for you? Maybe, maybe not.But what ever you end up buying please make sure it's installed correctly along with your child! It may have to save your child's life some day too.
