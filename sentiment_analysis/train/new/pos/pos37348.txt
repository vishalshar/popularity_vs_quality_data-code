I really love this changing table. You CANNOT beat the price, and the style is so cute and classic. I used Pottery Barn Kids Sabrina baskets, size small in white; I found that it was possible to fit three on the top and three on the bottom, but I ended up using just two on the top (leaving some space for odds and ends that didn't work well in the basket, like wipes placed between them) and one on the bottom (leaving space for folded Aden & Anais swaddle blankets, which I reached for constantly). The pad it comes with hit the trash pretty quickly - it's really thin - but it was easy for me to find a compatible pad (with sides that curve up) and cover (I swear by the white terry Burt's Bees cover available at Target - it shows everything, which I love - I WANT to know when it's dirty!). Having this changing table separate from my dresser allowed me to put other things on the dresser (lamp, frames) and have everything an arm-length away. It has a small footprint, which is nice for a small space. I have been very happy with this product.
