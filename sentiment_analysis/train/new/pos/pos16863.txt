I wish I had bought this mobile sooner. I got it when our baby was about a month old and she loved it from day 1. It has never even slipped from its place in our crib, much less fallen. I think how well it fits would probably depend on the style of crib and how it's installed. It really helped make her room and it helped me distract and entertain her in those early days when nothing I had would do so. It doesn't even have to be playing for it to entertain her. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars b/c it does only play about a minute (max) but hey, that's long enough for a quick trip to wash your hands or something.
