We were looking for a lighter-weight sleep sack to fit our 20 month old (34 in), and this was one of the few that was long enough, even after washing and drying.  We love the heavier weight Baby Deedee, so we thought we'd give this one a try.  It is super soft and fits our son well.  The only con is that it is double-layer jersey, so on warm days, it is a little too heavy even over just shorts and a t-shirt.
