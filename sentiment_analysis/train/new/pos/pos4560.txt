We love to carry our twin infants around in their Baby Bjorn carriers.  We actually also own ERGObaby Organic Baby Carrier, Green River Rock carriers, but for now we prefer the Bjorn to the Ergo Baby carriers because our boys can face out and see the world.The boys are also teething right now.  Everything goes into their mouths - and when walking around in the Baby Born carriers, they love to drool on the carrier, eat the carrier, suck the carrier, etc.  The front of the carrier is constantly in their mouths.These bibs provide a great solution.  As others have noted, they are essentially small, expensive washcloths.  But they're also custom-formed and sewn to fit nicely on the Bjorn carrier.  They fit perfectly after washing, are easy to install and remove, and much easier to wash (and especially dry) than the whole carrier.These are definitely worth the cost.  We'd buy them again in a minute.  So far, they have proven durable through washing, and keep the carrier nice and tidy - should the babies spit up, only the bib needs washing.
