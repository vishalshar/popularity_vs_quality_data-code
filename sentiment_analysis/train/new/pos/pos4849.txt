Works great for regular grocery store carts. Yes, they usually have buckles but this is easier to adjust, and solves the problem if they are missing or broken.  However, it doesn't work for what I originally bought it for: to help keep my daughter strapped into adult chairs while eating at friend's homes. I've tried this with various chairs and most are too wide to work. Disappointing, but our high chair can come off the stand and go with us for trips, so not the end of the world. It fits in her diaper bag, so smaller than the cart cover we got at her baby shower, and therefore more likely we'll take it with us and use it.  The Velcro is somewhat annoying in that it is hard to store; it doesn't strap together in a way that allows for folding so it can't be stored strapped together.  That is fine but makes the Velcro catch on things in her bag.  All in all, not a bad purchase, but I was hoping it would work for something else.
