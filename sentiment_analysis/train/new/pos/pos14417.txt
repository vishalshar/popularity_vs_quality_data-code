I bought and used these with my FuzziBunz diapers. They were a little bit cheaper than some of the other brands, so I figured I would try them and see. Wow...clean up is GREAT!! My son poops, I pull the liner away from his butt (it does stick there), and take it to the toilet to flush it. There is hardly any leftover poop on my cloth diaper and the pee goes right through. No more toilet swishing, which is great news for me!! The only reason I did give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the liner is quite large width ways, so it needs to be folded, but not in half, because then it wouldn't cover the whole diaper. So that is a little anoying to get it folded just right, but it's really only a few extra seconds. I started lining all of my clean diapers when I fold them and put them into the changing table this way it's ready to go when I need it. And the second reason is because the liner sticks to the baby after they have pooped, so you really can't wait too long before changing them. So when my son poops overnight and the liner has been stuck to his butt for a number of hours, his poor behind is a little red once I change him. It's never been real bad, and I've heard most liners do stick, so maybe it is just a small price to pay for the ease of clean-up. I say if you're using them and changing the diaper as soon, or soon after, they've pooped, it wouldn't be a problem with rashes at all. It could just be my kid though too; he has very sensitive skin, which is why I started using cloth to begin with.
