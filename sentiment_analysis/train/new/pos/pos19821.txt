We've been using this system for about 2 months. It works great. I gave it 4 stars because sometimes the screen blinks & scares me for a minute. It never actually goes out so might be a signal glitch or something. The sound & picture are very clear. I can actually see her breathing at night the picture is that sharp. I know friends whose moniters are very fuzzy. We turned off the VOX feature because when it would activate it made a very annoying loud beep sound. If the display came on because baby coughed (but she went right back to sleep so there was no sound for 7 minutes) it would BEEP!!! and we were awake again. Ugh annoying. The display is very bright so we keep it face down but you can still hear if she makes any noise. Overiding the VOX feature might effect the battery life but we keep it plugged in all night and it has enough charge to do about 4 hours of naps during the day. Great system, Great price
