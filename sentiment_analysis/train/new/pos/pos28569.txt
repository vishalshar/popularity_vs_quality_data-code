I was expecting underwear but these are actually training pants! They have extra padding in the front in case my son goes a little. They are costly for underwear but completely worth it. My 2 1/2 year old also loves the way they feel and the stripe pattern.  He is so excited to wear these.  I can't wait for the owl pattern to arrive!
