I have a diaper addiction... LOL  I think we have everything on the market and use many different brands.  Many are good, some are terrible but AppleCheeks are awesome!  These inserts are amazing.  Combined with the covers by the same manufacturer, they create a very dependable, trim diaper system.  Love them!
