This diaper is fantastic! I prepped it by washing 4 times (no dry cycle in between) and used the insert it comes with plus another baby kicks Joey Bunz Hemp insert. I used a Sweat Pea cover on top and and a thin stay dry fleece lined as well. When my 2 year old heavy wetter woke up there were no leaks and the diaper wasn't wet all the way through like most fitted diapers. Usually it's wet on the entire inside of the cover but not with this one! If you have a heavy wetter you have to try this diaper-I'm excited that my baby doesn't have to sleep in a pee soaked diaper anymore.This diaper is also soft,dries way quicker than my Kissaluv fitted and my THX fitted. This one also fits so much better and the snaps being on the sides seems much less restricting if you have a tummy sleeper. Try it. Try it. Try it.
