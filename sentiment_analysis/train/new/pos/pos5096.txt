I was given one of these pumps from someone who couldn't use it. The first three months I used it only occasionally when I wanted a bottle to leave for a babysitter, then I was using it every morning to build a stash. When I returned to work at 5m I bought a second one for $30, figuring if the pumps could not hold up to the heavy use I would have wasted $30 trying to save $200... well my son is now 9m old and I am still using the pumps! I pump three times a day with them using battery power and they do just fine. I know they are probably louder and slower than the more expensive pumps, but they are cheap and so easy to take care of! I am glad not to mess with tubing etc. When the one really does die, which is likely soon, I will happily buy a third. I will have spent $60-70 overall instead of $200+ for a dual professional grade pump and not had to deal with the part replacement and cleaning of the fancier pumps.
