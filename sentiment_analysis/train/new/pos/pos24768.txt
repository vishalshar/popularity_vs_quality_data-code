This product is so worth the money!!  Least of all, it saved me laundry because with baby #1 - before Milk-Saver - I went through a lot of shirts and burp cloths soiled from leaking milk from the non-nursing breast while nursing on the other side.  Most of all, I collected so much milk in the first 4 weeks without once hooking myself up to a breastpump (see photo), and I prevented that same milk from just being washed away!It is important to note that you should not feed this milk to your baby without mixing it with pumped milk, as this milk is mostly foremilk (the less fatty, more watery, less nutritious milk), but it will do in a pinch and it is still breastmilk!I read a review that stated this product was harmful to evening out milk production in the early stages of breastfeeding, but I found that it helped me manage my engorgement and nurse my baby more effectively, getting us off a nipple shield much more quickly than with baby #1.  My breasts were simply too engorged and too large for my newborn's mouth, so I had to start on a nipple shield after a day or two.  With baby #1, I would have to wake early and pump off for about 5 minutes to relieve engorgement for the first several weeks, which is a practice that can hinder milk production adjustment and create a vicious cycle of engorgement, but there was just no other way.  With baby #2, after a couple of weeks the engorgement was only too bad on my higher-producing side, so I would nurse on my lower-producing side first in the morning (which is good to do anyway in order to level out a slower-producing side).  With the Milk-Saver in my over-producing side, I would massage the lumps while nursing the other side, collecting the milk and relieving a lot of the pressure from engorgement so that my babe could then nurse on that side when she finished with lower-producing side.  Successful nursing without a shield and without pumping within just a few weeks (I was on a shield for over a month with baby #1).  And, what's more, I had milk saved up, too!My reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because this product costs WAY too much for the simple item that it is, especially considering that it is only useful for the first few months (during the engorgement/leakage stage).
