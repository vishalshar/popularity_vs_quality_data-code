I got this for about six dollars per roll with free 2 day prime shipping and couldn't be more pleased.  It is actual Con-tact brand, which matters for durability and adhesive quality.Anyways, as you can imagine, squee-jee-ing the stuff on without major bubbles or wrinkles is a feat.  It took me a few hours to do the counter tops BUT it was well worth it since I'm in a rental house I love (but cannot change the tacky yellow counters.)  The final product is quite handsome, considering the total cost for all the counters was under 20 bucks.  It looks like faux granite-- definitely not like the real stuff, but also not like 40 year old scratched counters with stickers slapped on top, which is essentially what it is.  :)The sink is easy to cut around, for what it's worth-- some tutorials online suggest cutting it perfectly to fit.  That would drive me crazy.  I cut out a hole for the sink, but a very rough one-- and then used a common steak knife to cut the precise edges once the stuff was already stuck on evenly.  Overlapping bits peeled right off the sink.  Trust me, the stuff has some give/stretchiness (not unlike a tee shirt) so you don't really want to measure things until it's already down.For air bubbles, try poking them with a tack or sewing needle and decompressing slowly.  For wrinkles, try slicing and overlapping the pieces.  The almost imperceptible line is WAY better than a grime-catching wrinkle.. or worse: tearing the thing up in frustration.Good luck, you won't regret this weekday morning renovation!  :)
