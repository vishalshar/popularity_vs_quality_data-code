This is a soft jersey knit blanket. I've been using it since my son was a newborn. It's lightweight and soft against his skin. We use it to cover him when he's in the stroller or in the carseat. We like it because it's not bulky and is just enough to keep our son sung and not too sweaty. Our son won't give up this blanket so in the winter we put a heavier blanket over it to keep him warm. It's not for cold weather.I have the blue striped blanket. It's a Dr Seuss brand but it doesn't have Dr Seuss on it. I didn't match the Dr Seuss theme in my son's room but it was soft so I kept it. I guess I could've selected the red blanket which would've matched better.This is a great summer/spring blanket or just something soft for baby to hold on to.
