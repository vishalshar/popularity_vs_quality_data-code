When purchasing this product, keep in mind that you're buying a set of balls. They are round, they roll, they have little trinkets inside that move in fun ways - spinning, clunking around, shifting, etc.They are not an overly interactive toy, other than the part where they are balls and they roll.  If you're looking for something with the potential for major interaction and advanced play, do not buy a set of balls.The above is mostly in response to the reviews that seem to be implying the toys are not as advertised. I'm afraid that, well, they're balls. They do what balls do.The face lights up and has ears - my 9 month old absolutely loves this one and has learned to bang it against things (loudly!) to get it to turn on.  He also has quite a bit of fun chasing the others around as they roll off in different directions.They're great for grasping - they do indeed fit perfectly into little hands, and my little one seems to really enjoy how easily he can pass them from hand to hand. The textured color part on them is also nice for sensory input, and the colors are bright.So! If you want a set of balls, buy these. They're quite nice for what they are. :)
