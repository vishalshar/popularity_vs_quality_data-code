Many of the poor reviews here are from reviewers who bought the incorrect product!What these are: fleece diaper liners, to be used as a wicking layer only in a cloth diaper.  They do not provide absorbency- that layer (an insert or doubler or prefold, etc.) is separate.  These fleece liners help keep baby skin feeling dry, by wicking moisture away from skin and towards the absorbency layers.Even though these are liners, I don't think they are supposed to be used to protect the diaper from rash cream or to catch poop, like a disposable liner.  They are just called liners because they are meant to go right up against baby's skin.If you are using covers with prefolds or fitteds, you might find that a fleece layer on top can help baby feel a little drier for longer.However, these aren't great primarily because they're not very big.  They're about 3" wide and maybe 8" long.  That is just big enough to cover exactly the genital area of my 12-month-old baby, so moisture is wicked from that area, but there's no coverage for the rest of the damp diaper area, especially overnight.  If used with prefolds during day use with a mobile baby, I doubt they'd stay in place.I am still using them in overnight diapers to provide just a little extra feeling of dryness, I hope.  If I wanted more, I'd probably go to the fabric store and make them myself to get the size right.
