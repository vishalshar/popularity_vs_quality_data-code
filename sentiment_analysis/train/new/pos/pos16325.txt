I love these training pants. I ordered the 18 month size because my daughter is small for her age.  It is pretty much impossible to find 18 month training pants or underwear in stores. They fit her perfectly.  They are very soft and come in cute patterns.  They are more absorbent than regular underwear, but since they aren't waterproof, you do have to change them right away. The "accident" usually stays contained to the panties when my daughter is standing up, but if she is sitting down when it happens, whatever she is sitting on would get wet too ( they are not diapers).  Overall, they are exactly what I was expecting.
