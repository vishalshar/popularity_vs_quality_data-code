I have a subaru outback and this fits the window very nicely! I love how the part that clips over the window is adjustable for the curvature of the window and the 3 suction cups keep it nice and secure. It has been on the window for a month now in the winter and they suction cups have help perfectly! Also, if you have a little one that likes to pull the bottom part off it won't automatically roll up since you need to push the button on the top part to roll it up :) Love it!
