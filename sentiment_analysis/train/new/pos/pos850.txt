My son spits up a lot and in massive quantities so I was desperate to find a bib that was absorbent but wouldn't soak through immediately and these bibs did the trick. They are a little stiff, but I think that's because there is something in between the front and back that prevents liquid from soaking through. Give it a wash and it becomes a little more pliable. The velcro on these is also super nice. It's not scratchy at all like regular velcro so it won't hurt your babies skin and not loud either so I can take it off him without the velcro waking him up. Would definitely buy more of these!
