Ok, I admit it.  I had absolutely no idea what 'marquisette' was when I ordered this.  I just wanted a nice light (non-flannel) blanket to swaddle our newest little one due late this spring.For those who are wondering about this fabric:  From the product description, I was expecting something gauze-like, but now that I have received the blanket, I don't think that description is exactly right.  Although the fabric is very light and breathable and will be great for swaddling in the summer, it is more dense than gauze- closer to muslin.  It also has a slight sheen to it, which makes it almost look like a poly or poly blend fabric.  But the blanket is made of cotton, so I think that the sheen means that the fibers are more tightly woven- a good thing..... I just wasn't expecting it to be so smooth.I love the design and colors on this product, and the size is great-  Although my primary purpose for this is swaddling, I'm sure I will be using it as a nursing cover and even as a cover over our stroller/infant seat to keep the sun off him.So, although the fabric is different than I imagined, I will probably be ordering one or two more of these.  I just wish they had a few more 'funky' designs in non-traditional colors.  I am SO tired of the limited brown or light blue options out there for baby boys.Update:  I pre-washed the blanket in anticipation of my little one's arrival and although it still looks and feels very nice, some of the stiffness to the fabric is gone, as is the sheen.  I can see now why they described the fabric as gauze-like; it is much softer and looser after washing.  The design still looks great- did not fade or bleed, and I still think that this blanket will be an excellent purchase for my summer baby.
