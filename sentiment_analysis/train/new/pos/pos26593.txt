My little girl came 4 weeks early, no luck with breast feeding like I had planned, so I had to pump 20 minutes 8-10 a day. I started out holding the pumps (terrible) then used a pumping bra (strapless, zipped up the front, required taking all my clothes off in the middle of the night so it was freezing cold) which was a little better because at least I had my hands, but I knew I needed something else. I ordered this tank top and have only taken it off once each day to wash it. It's great. I wear it constantly so I no longer have "deep freeze" period of derobing, putting on the bra, shivering away until pumping is over. With the tank, I just leave my bath robe on, pop on the pump, and away we go. The tank holds the pumps in place well (just make sure no fabric is stuck under the horn part of the pump). I did have to watch the video in order to get the pump inserted into the shirt correctly, but now it's a piece of cake.Also, this tank is perfect for breast feeding too, which I'm slowly adding as my baby grows stronger. I know this tank top will be used a lot, even when pumping is over.Note on sizing: I'm 5 foot 6 inches, 130 -135 post-birth, 125 pre-birth. I usually wear a 34D, but with the milk probably a size or two more. I ordered the medium. The built in bra is a little snug, but perfectly fine. The tube part around my stomach is a little loose, but that's okay, I'm not exactly going out to the club in this thing... Size works good for me.Care: Machine wash and machine dry - can't beat it.
