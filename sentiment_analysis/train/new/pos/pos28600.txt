I bought this for my daughter's first birthday which was 15 months ago.  I'm back on Amazon today to buy a couple more cartridges for it.  I have to say that this is the toy that she always comes back to when the other toys lose their appeal.  The sounds are a QUALITY sound, not cheap sounding like the imitations that are now on the market.  No matter the ages of the kids in the house, this is the toy that they play with.  I can see this toy lasting for years in our family.  Even mom and dad get involved playing with it and can't put it down.  I love to get my daughter toys that will last, and toys that are educational and this is one that fits both categories.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to enhance their child's imagination and creativity.
