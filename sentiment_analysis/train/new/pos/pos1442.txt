Cheaply made, but works very well and looks very cute. As you can see in the photos, some have ragged edges.Good amount of resistance when opening/closing, and not overly bendable.Some of them are fairly dull, but I haven't found one so far that's too dull to use, though a few has had bent tips.Most the tips rest well within the heads/fasteners, but some sit inside pretty shallowly which would make me weary of using those ones on something that might be hurt if they were to slip free.Overall, most of them seem great for use, and the few that fall short aren't enough to deter away from the value of getting this many for such a low price.
