I was looking for blocks without paint and in simple sizes as a beginner set for my 6 month old. I was also hoping to get a set from Germany, where many of the toys that I have seen on my visits there are well-made and hand-crafted. I loved playing with blocks all through my childhood and I was looking forward to introducing that play to my son.This set is perfect -- the blocks good sizes for small hands, lightweight so that they won't hurt when they tumble, nicely designed to fit into the little box they are packaged in.The company's website at http://www.creablocks.de/ says that the blocks are made from untreated beech wood and that all surfaces are sanded and perfectly smooth. That was the case. I like that the company has pictures on the website of the blocks' production and final sanding before they get packaged (and indeed, there was a fine dust on the blocks that I wiped off before our first play).I definitely recommend this product. Although the price is a little high, I know that this will be a product that we play with for many, many years. I look forward to getting this company's castle set when my son is older.
