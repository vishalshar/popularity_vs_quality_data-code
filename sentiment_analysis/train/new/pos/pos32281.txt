Fantastic product.  Don't believe the shipping timeline, yes the product comes from England but it was at my doorstep in under 10 days.  We currently live in a one bedroom apartment and have a few more months before we move into our new house.  The baby now has his own "room" in our dining room.  We had to get him out of our bedroom b/c every time I moved he woke up and wanted me to pick him up.  After setting up the Canopy over a pack n play and putting a noise machine next to it the baby is now going down at 630 or 7 and we can still use feel free to move around the apartment, talk and watch TV.  Everyone is much happier.  I'm also planning on taking this along over the weekend when we go are planning a trip and will be staying overnight in a hotel room.  Great product!!!!
