We recently moved my Father-in-law, who has Dementia and Parkinson's, in with us and purchased this video monitor for his bedroom.  It's a good deal for the money. The Infrared Night Vision allows you see video even if the room is dark, the image is in black/white all the time, not color as the photo leads you to believe, but that's not an issue for us. And, I really like the "talk back" feature, it works like a Walkie-Talkie, and it's great for telling him to stay put until we get there to help him, and prevent a fall.If I could change one thing about it, I would like for the 'parent' monitor's video to stay on longer when used with battery power (the video goes black, but the sound stays) he makes lots of noises while he sleeps, so we know when he's making these noises, he's actually sleeping, it's when all goes quiet that we have to worry, and being able to 'see' him gives us 100% confidence that he's okay.We have paired this video monitor with a Bed Alarm & Long Term Sensor Pad from "Smart Caregiver" , and together they have been the best things we've invested in since his move in!I would recommend this Motorola MBP26-B Monitor for any caregiver.
