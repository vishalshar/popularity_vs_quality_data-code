we love this playard, Eddie Bauer! It is adorable and a very timeless look. The bassinet is very large and the changing table is adequate for midnight changes. 120%  recommended. while it wasn't the easiest thing to put together, once done, it's been wonderful. our newborn slept in it for the first couple of weeks and we use it daily as a changing station. we haven't tried to travel with it yet, but i anticipate folding it back up to be somewhat difficult given the trouble we had putting it together. my favorite part of this is the music/vibration/nightlight piece that comes with it. it attaches to the wall of the playard and provides gentle vibrat  ion that our baby LOVED. it also happens to attach to our carseat and we have used it in his crib as well. this piece alone is worth the price, so when you get it all, even better!! Resume: Solid construction and flip away changer super convenient! Excellent price
