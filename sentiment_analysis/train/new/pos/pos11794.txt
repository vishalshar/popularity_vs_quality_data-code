This diaper fit my almost-7lb newborn right away. Trim and of course cute! She's now almost 4 weeks and while it still fits great, I have to change her more frequently due to the absorbancy change. (about every 2hours). So this isn't a complete dealbreaker, but if you're a busy mom of multiples, need a going out/daycare diaper or overnight, I suggest investing in the BumGenius 4.0***UPDATE: I ventured into using inserts and doublers recently (Hemp only because this is not a pocket diaper) and discovered that a good hemp insert on top will extend the wear time of this diaper. Woo! This would be a great idea for parents who want to extend the life of this diaper especially if it still fits their baby and you don't feel like you wasted your money on the diaper AND because there is strong likelihood that this may be one of the few diapers that actually fit your baby from day one (such was the case with our baby).  I know some reviews say "don't waste your money, just get an AIO', but I can't agree. AIOs were enormous on my almost 7lb newborn, so it's worth a shot to invest in 1 or 2 or these and rotate maybe with some prefolds especially if cloth diapering from day 1 is important to you. My favorite hemp insert is BabyKicks. Hope this helps.
