Very soft and cuddly. Has a bell? or something that makes it jingle... I received one at my baby shower 3 years ago and my daughter has used it/never left her side since she could decide what she wants and it is still in great condition. I ordered this one as a back-up just in case she loses hers, but the original one is now 3+years into being used and seems are still holding strong, no ripping or tearing as of yet.
