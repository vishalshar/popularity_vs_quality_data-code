I don't understand why this gate has had so many bad reviews.  We have several, for our many stairways, and absolutely love them.  The installation does take a little while but that's the case with pretty much any hardware mounted gate.  One thing I've noticed is that you MUST tighten the bolts with a wrench.  If you try to do it by hand, they WILL come loose and that will compromise the function of the gate.  It is also very important to use the lock on top.  This prevents the gate from being "forced" open.  The other thing I love is the alarm feature!  It gives peace of mind, just in case somebody forgets to lock the top and a little one does get it open.  To my knowledge, there is no other gate out there with an alarm.  Just use the gate as the instructions say and it is wonderful!!
