I would say the best thing about these bottles is they do seem to really help with gas, however the drawback is the nipples are very slow! I know that that is the idea, however even our pediatrician said that we should get a faster nipple at her first checkup! Overall I am very happy with the bottles and I would recommend the product. I would definitely prefer a longer feedings than a crying uncomfortable baby!
