I purchased this bedding set after reading many reviews.  Although several were negative in that the purchaser was not pleased with the quality of the set, I thought so what, my lo will not use it very long and the smile this would bring to his face is worth it.  I find the quality of 5 bedding very nice. The sheets are light and soft and the quilt is adorable with different yo gabba gabba visuals on either side. Also very soft, both washed well and I dried on low. The shape or feel was not lost as well.  This was not eligible for prime but I ordered on Thursday night and it arrived on the following Monday.  Great service from an independent retailer. I would definitely order from them again.  Great product, exactly what I wanted. My son loves it. Great service also.
