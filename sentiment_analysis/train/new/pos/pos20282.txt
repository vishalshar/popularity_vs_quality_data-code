I loved this diaper bag! I loved that it matched my theme, zebra and hot pink! And, absolutely loved that it could be wiped off if needed. The bottom wasn't cloth so it didn't get dirty if set down and if it did, it was very easily washed off. I wish it were a little bit larger, but was perfect for running to the store where I didn't need to pack so much. [Maybe a few diapers, wipes, outfit, formula and a bottle - with small necessities in the pockets. Definitely perfect for all of you zebra lovers like myself!
