We tried the tab and hook kind, where you push down the tab to disengage it from the hook, but those still allow your kid (and you) to get your finger smashed in the drawer, and kids figure them out pretty quick. Even the small gap needed to get your finger in to depress the tab is like a mile wide gap for small hands.  Installing them is a bear, with lots of trial and error, and usually no templates to help you. They also tend to collect grime, and they break or loosen up a lot over time.  These are great!  The doors/drawers remain firmly shut until the magnetic lock is disengaged with the "key".  The directions are good, and they include a sticky template for each lock.  I will say that you need to read the instructions and make sure how your hardware is supposed to be lined up. I screwed up the first one I ever did, which was more me hurrying and screwing up some spacial relations as far as what direction things needed to be in than bad instructions.  After that the rest (we have quite a few of these installed) went smoothly.The sticky templates are especially helpful making sure everything is where it's supposed to be. If you have thick doors (we have really thick, hardwood cabinet doors) they have extender slugs that effectively lengthen the magnetic catch.  Even if you have to have a handyman install these they're well worth it!  One note: It does take some trial and error to get the hang of what spot you have to pass the "key" over to disengage the lock. But you get the hang of it quickly.
