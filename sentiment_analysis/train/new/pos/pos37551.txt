My 9 month old grew out of the Bumbo early. This is a perfect replacement. There is plenty of room for her chubby little legs. I use it on the table (not strapped to a chair). It didn't take her long to figure out that she could throw her head back and use her heels to scoot herself backwards, so I put the whole chair on a piece of grip liner and fixed that problem. I take this everywhere. Very lightweight. Would definitely recommend for someone looking for something to take the place of a Bumbo.
