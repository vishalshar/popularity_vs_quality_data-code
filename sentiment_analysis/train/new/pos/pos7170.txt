I've tried Luna pads, Glad Rags, and now these. These are the ones to get. They're cheaper (at least when I was price comparing ... no promos), come with a wet bag, wash out better, offer more protection, and will last longer.The PUL fabric is very nice. It will protect better than just flannel alone will and it will hold up longer. The white fuzzy material just feels nicer than flannel too, and even though it's white it almost all washes out and so far a little stain remover has actually kept them white! I used to get darker colored flannel and it's frankly just also nice to glance and see what's going on.I've got another review on Glad Rags on Amazon where I get all into the snaps. These are plastic but they're bigger than the tiny ones on the Luna pads. They're about the same size as the Glad Rags.
