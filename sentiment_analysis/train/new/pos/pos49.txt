I wish I had bought this for my daughter sooner. As soon as she was able to hold her head up well (at about 2 months), she no longer wanted to sit in her bouncy seat. Eventually I purchased this seat and she loved it. I could use it anywhere and she was able to sit and watch me work. It truly was like an extra set of hands. My daughter had no trouble fitting into it and she is consistently in the 97th percentile in height/weight, and she still fits and loves sitting in it, now that she is 7 months old. The seat is very stable; however, within the last month or so, as my daughter has become more mobile, she is able to tip it over. The newer (flex) model that allows you to attach the seat to a chair would probably be more useful. We also have taken this out to restaurants with us as she fits better in this than in the highchairs they have...plus I am more comfortable knowing that it is clean!
