I purchased this bassinet for our first baby because I knew that I wanted to breastfeed and wouldn't want to walk to the other side of the house to get the baby at all hours of the morning.  I also know that my husband and I can be hard and restless sleepers so the idea of having the baby in the bed with us wasn't appealing.  This option provided the best solution to both issues.The mini bassinet takes up just the right amount of room.  I will say that you won't be able to use it once your baby gets to be a certain length because it is a bit small (and by this I mean probably not after 6 months old or so), but as we intend to move him into a crib as soon as he can sleep through the night, I don't foresee the size being an issue.  We have a tempurpedic bed so we required the leg extensions in order to raise the bassinet to the appropriate height, but I am easily able to keep an eye on my son as we sleep, and to grab him as soon as he starts fussing.  My son does not seem to mind the hardness of the mattress, and sleeps like a champ.The only difficulty I have had so far is finding the plush sheet set that has generally been recommended to go with the bassinet and had to break down and buy them from Arm's Reach for a bit more than I was looking to spend.
