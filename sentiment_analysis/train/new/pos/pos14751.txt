Before my son was born, we bought a big jogger stroller.  I liked the jogger, but a few months back we found ourselves in need of a smaller, lighter stroller for a vacation involving trips on planes, trains and the subway.  I selected this one because of the other reviews and because I liked the color. (The orange is really easy to spot in the middle of a bunch of other dark strollers or on a crowded street, and the brown matched my diaper bag.)  Well, we LOVE this stroller.  Compared to the jogger, which we thought was just fine before, well- there is no comparison.  This stroller is much easier to handle, fold, carry, turn, etc.  At about 11 pounds, it weighed less than my baby did the first time we used it.  It is so easy to fold and unfold one-handed and is a breeze to carry.  It is quite well cushioned for being so lightweight. My son seems very comfortable in it.  The basket is HUGE- much bigger than the bigger stroller, go figure.  The sun canopy is gigantic- again, so much better than our other stroller.The best feature of the stroller is one which I did not even know that it had when I bought it.  The harness actually detaches from the shoulder blade area of the stroller so that your little one can sit up straight and look around while still being safely strapped in.  My son loves to sit up, scoot towards the front of the seat, and bounce himself while we stroll.  He is so happy riding in this.My only improvement suggestion would be the way in which the plastic handle is molded.  As it is, the seam is right at your fingertips, which is a little bothersome.Overall, we are very glad we chose this one and I'm sure it doesn't need to be said that the big jogger stroller now spends most of its time folded in the corner of out garage.
