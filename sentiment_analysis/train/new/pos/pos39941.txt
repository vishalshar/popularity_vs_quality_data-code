Mounted these rear facing red LEDs on my stroller.  Very bright and takes a bit of effort to push the button to turn the lights on/off - which is a good thing.  They don't turn on easily when you accidentally bump into something.  I would buy these for any strollers, bikes, and anything else that you may use at night for safe visibility.  My only request would be to make a set of these LEDs in white with black housing to be used as forward facing stroller headlights / path illumination.  I had to buy another brand of push button LEDs front lights but they turn on too easily each time I grab the stroller to unfold/fold it.04/08/2015 - Update.  One of these lights will turn ON, but won't turn off after pressing the on/off button.  I have to remove the battery to get it to stop blinking (which means removing it from the stroller).  So now I am left with 1 working rear flashing red LED light on my stroller.  Lowering my rating for 4 stars- as they are good when they are working.  Not sure if the manufacturer will replace my bad one.
