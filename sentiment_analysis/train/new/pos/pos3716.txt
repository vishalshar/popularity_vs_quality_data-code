My little one isn't here yet. But I got my set in and it is beautiful. It's so soft and seems well made. It shipped super fast. I will do an update after she has used it a while.Update:We have had it for a year now. Other than some expected stains on the fitted sheet it is holding up very well. I wash and dry the sheet and comforter often and they are worn in but standing strong. No loose threads and no shrinkage. Honestly i wish they made this in a bigger size for when she outgrows the blanket.
