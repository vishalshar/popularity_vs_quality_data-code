Great blanket for babies. Very soft and very well made. My son got attached to this and cries every time its in the washer. Had to buy a spare one for insurance in case we lose the original in the future. Hard to find this particular design as it has been discontinued. I had to use "Google-fu" search powers to finally find one on amazon for much more than what it originally sold for. Based on how much my kid likes this "blankie," and how hard it is to find, you'd think this blanket would be worth on lot on the black market. Buy low, hoard it, and then sell high!
