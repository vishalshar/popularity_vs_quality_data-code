We used this warmer from our son's birth to about 6 months in his room hung over the side of the crib for those wee-hour-of-morning changes.  The organizer pockets on this warmer were extremely helpful for these times as well since everything you need is right there!  We never bought a separate changing station for his room either. We simply bought a waterproof pad and placed it under his touche for diaper changes. We figured the less we moved him, the less we would disturb him, and the easier time he would have going back to sleep.  By 6 months we sold our diaper warmer w/ organizer since our son was sticking his fingers through the crib and digging through the items on the side pockets, and we couldn't find anywhere else to hang it.  Besides this, he was sleeping through the night and cold wipes no longer disturbed him.We learned to turn the wipes warmer on just before he went to bed and then shut it off when he awoke.  Prior to this, we had problems with it drying out the wipes when left on permanently, but I've been told that almost all wipes warmer dry wipes out.  To solve this problem, you can either turn the warmer off during the day or pour some water over the wipes.  Either way, I recommend this gadget,  especially for newborns!
