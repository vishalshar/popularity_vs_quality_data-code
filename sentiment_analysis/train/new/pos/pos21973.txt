From the birth if my first child I knew a bouncy seat was an emparative piece of equipment in my arsenal so it was easy to know I needed mother one for baby number two.  The vibration feature is nice to calm a gassy tummy or just general grumpiness for those babies who are overly tired..  The fun little toys keep him occupied while I wash bottles or fold laundry, or even take a shower. And at six weeks old the monkey sound made him smile.  At 8 weeks old he's discovering he has hands and reaches out to touch the penguin... I'm sure I will be able to enjoy the benefits of this bouncy seat for another month or two before he grows out of it.  The toy attachments can be removed for easy access for removing baby from the seat and but I wish they were easier to remove - but not so troublesome to outweigh the benefits of having this product.
