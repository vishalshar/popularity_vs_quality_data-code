I looked at a lot of gates and chose this one for it's features and style. After I received it, I was not disappointed. It is a very nice looking gate that you don't mind leaving up and the latch works very well using one hand. I also like the fact that the extensions are included; with many other gates there is an extra charge. In fact, I liked the first gate I got so much that I ordered another one a few days later. Installation was also very easy. One qualification I will make is that I am only using this as a dog barrier for two large labs, so I can't comment on how it might work for children (although I see no reason it wouldn't be just fine)
