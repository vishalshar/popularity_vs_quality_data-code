I love my Pliko! It started with the infant seat, then the Aria (didn't match though, but still a great stroller!), and now we have the Pliko.A few things I love about this stroller are the* wheels- They are huge and the suspension is great!* size- this stroller is very narrow. It's perfect for shopping and navigating through the racks.* ease- It's not extremely easy to push this stroller with one hand, but it is possible.* basket- It's big enough to hold my purse and various baby items.* recline- The seat reclines to almost completely flat. Personally, I prefere the slight incline. It's great for babies with reflux.* child tray- The child tray has a cup holder, but the best thing is that it is completely removable for "discrete" diaper changes.* pattern- The pattern totally gender nuetral. It's also ver easy to keep clean.** I also love how the car sear locks into the stroller. It feels very sturdy.A few things that could be improved are* instructions- They are not very helpful, it's almost a trial and error experience.* footrest- I have yet to learn how to adjust it.* The canopy is far from see throughThis stroller has met all of my needs. I can not wait to use it on the next baby- when there is one.  Not only am I comfortable using it, but my daughter is comfortable riding/sleeping in it! It is definetly worth the money, which is why I don't understand how it could possibly have a rating under five stars.
