First and foremost, the soap dispenser doesn't work, and I can't even get the smaller nipple brush to come out of the handle.  I don't care!  I don't know if it's just me, but I could not get bottles clean.  I breast feed and use the Medela bottles that came with my pump.  There was always a film left on them.  I don't know if it was from the breast milk, or because of the type of plastic of the bottles or what.  A regular bristle brush would not get it all out.  I was having to squeeze a washcloth down into the bottle and then use force to get them clean.This brush works amazingly well!  I couldn't believe that it gets all of the film out of the bottles.  It's annoying that the soap dispenser gets water in it, and then that's going everywhere, but I don't care, because my bottles are actually getting clean without me spending a great deal of time on them.  If only they made a nipple brush, because all my bottle nipples get cloudy, too.Edit: I recently ordered a couple more, and the design has changed. They listened to the complaints. The end of the handle is now flat, so you can stand it upright. And the bottle brush now is a seperate piece that screws in to the bottom. Still love it, still would give it five stars.
