This is our second WubbaNub we have ordered, and we absolutely love them, and so does our daughter! We bought the white lamb before she was born 5 weeks ago, hoping it would keep the pacifier in her mouth when she laid on her back. Unfortunately she's a tummy sleeper, so that thought is out the window, but it does hold up great in the car seat and swing, so that is a bonus. My little girl loves to nap with the animal close by.We ordered this one a few weeks ago and were excited when it came... unfortunately, this pacifier is for 3 months +. It's harder and bigger than the one on the lamb paci, and her regular soothie ones. It would be awesome if this was mentioned on the packaging or in the details when you're looking at this. It would also be great if you could choose the size (0-3 month or 3 month +) for the pacifier.Other than that, we really love these things!
