We are in the middle of moving from one house to another, and the only baby spoons I could get my hands on struck me as too big for my 4 month old. He transitioned into feeding like a total champ, but still I felt the spoons were too big for his tiny mouth. He'd just lick and lick repeatedly, but I couldn't actually get it into his mouth. I saw these and felt they'd be the right solution. Boy, was I right. (Trust your motherly instincts ladies.) These were like an answered prayer. The bowl is miniscule and solved our problem. The first feeding with these, and all subsequent feedings, went so much smoother since I didn't have to struggle to get the food into his itty bitty lips. There are times when only the right tool will do for a job. This is one of those times. As other reviewers have noted: You can still pile one heck of a mound of food onto these, which equates to using them for a much longer period. But in the beginning, you'll be glad you've got these on hand.
