I got this car seat for my 9 month old and I love it. I still sit him rear facing and was kinda worried about him being comfortable he in this seat. We make out of state trip every month and the trip is hard enough on him as it is, so him being comfortable and safe was my main concerns. We waited for this to come Saturday before we headed on our out of state trip, it came at 5pm. This car seat was easy to install and it did not make him sit straight up with it being rear facing. He was easy to get in and out of the seat, and was snapped in very secured. He does seem to get sweaty  but I solved that problem with just putting a t-shirt on him. Once we got North he stayed warm (with more clothing on of course) and comfortable. I would recommend this car seat to anyone. This car seat also has a cup holder which is very nice. I went with Evenflo because I trust the brand. He will be able to use this car seat until he is ready for booster seat. I am updating my review because I have been using the car seat front facing. I posted a picture and as you can see my guy is very comfortable and happy in his seat.
