This was a tough call making this purchase because we already had a stroller organizer that came with our stroller so we really didn't want to spend more money on another one.  But is my wife ever glad we did because this one makes our other organizer look like it was designed by people that don't even have kids.  This one is absolutely the perfect size and weight and it has the ideal configuration of compartments and various storage areas.  I mention weight because we were at a picnic this summer and our friend's stroller literally tipped over because of their packed diaper bag that was on the handles of their stroller.  And their baby was in the stroller!  But they caught the stroller as it was tipping thank goodness.  That is why the real beauty of this organizer is that with this product you don't even need a diaper bag.  And this organizer goes on an off your stroller like greased lightning (if you are a Rocky fan you will get that joke) because it just attaches using very sturdy velcro straps.  So easy!  I'm not really sure if you can imagine how nice it is to have the perfect organizer but for us this was definitely the right decision.  Every time we use our stroller which is pretty much every day we are glad we got it.  Although I think there might be cheaper ones out there if you don't mind skimping a bit.  I know a lot of people are on a budget and so are we.  But our old organizer is now in the landfill.  Sorry mother earth!  I will plant a tree I swear.
