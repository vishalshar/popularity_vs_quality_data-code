This fits perfectly over our Duallie. The snug fit means that the large clear "window" is easy for my littles to see through so they enjoy walks/jogs when it's raining. The snug fit and waterproof fabric also means that they (and the stroller) stay nice and dry even in a downpour. The only problem that I've found has nothing to do with the design-- in a heavy (think monsoon) rain, it can get loud in there so I tend not to go out if the rain is too hard.The stitching is sturdy and the fabric is high quality. It has withstood rain and snow for nearly 3 years now, and looks amazing. I leave it outside under a roof to drip mostly dry, then bring it in overnight--it dries very quickly this way. It rolls nicely into a ball and fits in the under carriage holder on the BOB. All in all, this is a great product.
