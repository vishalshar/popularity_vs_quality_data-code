This new cord solved the problem we had with our monitor. Our monitor would not hold a charge, even when plugged in. We thought the A/C port had gone bad, as it had in our previous Summer Infant monitor. I tried a rechargeable battery but it would not hold all night. Then I started looking around on Amazon and saw reviews stating people had fraying cords that affected their charge. Our cord was not frayed but at around $8, I had to try and see if a new cord would work for us (rather than shelling out $90 for a new monitor). Happy to say it did!
