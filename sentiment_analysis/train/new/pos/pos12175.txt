Please, please take this to the hospital with you- you'll thank me later. We did, but it stayed in the suitcase for 2 days because we were SO "out of it" dealing with my c-section,, etc. We  had been keeping notes -on loose sheets of paper- of baby's feedings and diaper output (so crucial those first few days). We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control. I carry it around the house with baby, and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby's needs and patterns. Can't recommend enough!
