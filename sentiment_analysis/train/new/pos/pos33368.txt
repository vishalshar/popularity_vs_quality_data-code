I love my moby wrap. Its the first baby carrier I've had that doesnt cause my back to ache. It's so nice to be able to wear my youngest when out and about because it so much to try to carrier the youngest in his car seat carrier and keep my hold my two year old's hand so he doesn't run off. It didn't take long to get used to how to wrap him and YouTube has tons of videos on different wrapping methods which is so nice. The only thing is that it get very warm so often we could not wear is for very long in the summer because my son and I would just get too hot. But with this cooler weather it's perfect for hands free baby time and keeping him snuggly and warm.
