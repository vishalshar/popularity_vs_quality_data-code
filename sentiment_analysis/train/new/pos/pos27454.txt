I ordered these for my bathroom doors as my  2.5 year old is currently obsessed with the toilet and throwing things in it! They are easy enough as far as snapping on the door knob, BUT my toddler has discovered how to open the door with them on so while the idea of them was great, the end result is that shes smarter than I thought she was lol.
