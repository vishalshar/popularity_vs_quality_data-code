I bought this set as something to take with me and be able to easily store in the fridge. Since my son is only 4 months, we are just starting solid foods, and everything is runny, so I wanted something that wouldn't leak every where. I have traveled with this container a few times now, and have not had any leaking (I do keep it stored flat in my cooler bag, with his bottles on top). I did try gently tipping it sideways and up-side-down and didn't have any oatmeal or mango puree leaking (unlike with several other items I tried). The set I received was all blue with an orange spoon(and not blue/green), but since I have a boy, it didn't really matter to me. The compartments probably hold 3-4oz each side (I only put about 1.5-2 oz in each side, and it was just about half full) so it is perfect for just starting to taste solid foods. The spoon is very rubbery, which is perfect for my son to hold and chew on, however I don't use it for feeding (I prefer the Gerber spoons, personally), my son really likes it though.I plan on buying several more for us to use. They are great to feed from at home, or take on the go as well.I am not sure if the bowl is microwave safe or not (I can't remember if it was on the package or not), but I have heated it for 10-15 seconds with out any issues (just to take the chill off when getting out of the fridge).[...]
