This product was ordered with ease of use in mind. It definitely is easy to use after assembly. The engineering is simple and everything clicks well together. It would be a 5-star if it wasn't as heavy but its slight heaviness would also equal sturdy construction.It has wonderful features such as being able to reverse the handle to make the large wheels in front when the road is bumpy or off-road. You can also remove the smaller wheels as well and glide over sand better if you go on beaches and such.Clicking the bassinet and baby seat is a breeze as both just simply "pop-off" with a slight touch of buttons on the sides.Sturdy construction definitely gives 100% peace of mind and its ability to fold-up and be stored is also a major PLUS.Another cool feature is the way you can swivel the handle so the baby can easily join you at the dinner table without the use of a baby-seat at a restaurant.All in all, a great product and would definitely recommend.p.s. You should also buy the Bugaboo Transport if you frequently travel on planes! It is a must along with the Cup-Holder.-AmazonPro ReviewsEst. Since 2003
