I bought this along time ago now, because it came with a book suitable for putting pictures in. We have family all over the country and in other countries so I wanted something baby safe that my son could look at.The other books were really nice too. The cloth book and fuzzy bits in it, and the other two plastic books were bright and colorful.I loved that the plastic books were drool resistant and the cloth book was easy to clean with hot soapy water- because babys are messy!The books are a good size, easy for little hands to hold and move.My son is now four years old and we still have the photo album book. his sister used the other three books, But now prefers paper and board books.
