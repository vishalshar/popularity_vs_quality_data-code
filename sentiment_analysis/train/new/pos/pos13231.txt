I loved my thirsty all in ones until they started to stink and I couldn't strip them properly due to being an all in 1.  He quickly grew out of the size ones and instead of replacing with the next size I decided to go to the one size pockets.  I'm glad I did.  They are very absorbent and have contained several nasty breast fed blow outs (you know the ones where he hasn't gone in several days and they lets it all out at once).  I can separate the inserts and wash them much better than the all in 1.  The hemp insert is much more absorbent and combined with the microfiber actually makes a good night time diaper.  Plus the sitter really doesn't mind using these diapers as compared to the fitteds with covers.
