Looks great and good quality! Comes with hardware to secure it to the wall so it won't be tipped over on a little one once they start climbing/pulling themselves up. It takes awhile to put together with all the pieces and drawers (60-90mins). Looks great with Graco Charleston Convertible Crib - different brand but pattern matches almost exactly!
