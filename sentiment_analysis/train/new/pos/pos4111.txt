I work full time, and so pumping for the next year will be a ways of life for me. As time-consumingly painful as this may be, it's pretty important for the health of my baby and for me. So, I will do it, but I look for ways to be as efficient as possible as I don't have a lot of time to do this at work, and the faster I get done at work, the sooner I get home to my little ones and not needing to pump! The Medela pumps are the best, I think, and I've tried several pumps. I purchased extra parts because I really don't have time to wash them in between uses during a given day, and they need to be cleaned, so I just buy extras.  You wouldn't really need to buy extra tubing, but unfortunately, every once in a while, you can get a little condensation or if you are clumsy and tip over the bottle, milk, in the tubing.  The tubing then needs to be sterilized if it's actual milk in there, and that requires boiling it.  To dry it out, you need to pour alcohol in it, and that can be a bit of a trick.  I find that that may take a few days to dry out, so I have an extra tubing set to use during that time.  I find the tubing is a good length.I've used Medela Advanced and Freestyle as well as Ameda electric pumps, and the Tommee Tippee hand pump. The medela brand works great, and I appreciate the ability it gives to get pumping done quickly so my day moves faster. I'd recommend these to anyone, with the caveat that these do NOT work in the Medela Freestyle pump and that I actually wouldn't recommend that pump unless it's absolutely necessary to be able to walk around while pumping as the hands-free bustier can be used with any pump and frees up your hands, and I find the Freestyle is much less powerful.
