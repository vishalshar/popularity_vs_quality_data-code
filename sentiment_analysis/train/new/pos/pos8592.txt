If you're going to pump daily, or pump while travelling, and are considering some DIY option involving hair ties or an old sports bra, please respect yourself and just get this bra. It is a snap to throw on over a regular nursing bra with the flaps down. It holds the flanges on so securely that you can hand-express, fold laundry, collate papers, or whatever it is you have to do while pumping without them moving an inch. I have used three times a day, five days a week, for about seven months. It still looks brand-new and works great. When I found myself pumping in a McDonald's bathroom somewhere in Ohio, wearing the Pump in Style on my back and trying not to touch anything, I realized that I in no way regretted spending the money on this bra.I ordered the zip-in panels to get the best fit. They are free, so that's nice, but I wish they just shipped with the product automatically.
