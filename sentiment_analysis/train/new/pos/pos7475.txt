This set could probably also be used by a 2 year old and could certainly be used by any child up to pre-teens, but 3-5 seems to me the perfect age for this. That's when kids are transitioning away from from the "baby" cutlery and this set is just the perfect size- also extremely well made, pretty, durable, etc. Recommend very highly.
