I was surprised by how much I liked these. I have mostly bumgenius and blueberry pocket diapers. I was looking for some cheaper alternatives since I have a 3 month old and 2 year old in diapers. They go through diapers quickly. I decided to give these a try and I am glad I did. They are cute, soft, and absorb pee and poop well. I did not use the liners that came with them though so I don't know how good those are. I bought charcoal bamboo 5 layer liners that I use with these that work fantastic. I mostly use these for my 3 month old but also the 2 year old here and there. They have worked great for both.
