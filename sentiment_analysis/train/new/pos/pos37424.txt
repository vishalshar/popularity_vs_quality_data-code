I love this set- the sheets and pillow case are the best! 100% cotton and they wash so well. We bought the extra sheet with the vehicles on it and highly recommend that as well. The blanket is a good size but will admit that it pills after a few washes. My son loves it but I am a bit annoyed with how quickly it has deteriorated. No big deal it still is a great design and I can use other blankets if necessary. One thing I love is the elastic at the bottom of the "flat sheet" Keeps the sheet in place as it hook around the bottom of the mattress.
