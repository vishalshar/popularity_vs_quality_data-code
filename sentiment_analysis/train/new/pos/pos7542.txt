Most of the sippy cups in the market has a valve built inside the straw.  This is the way to make the sippy cups spill resistant.  I found that those cups are hard to drink from, even for myself as an adult.  My kid prefers to drink from straw that is free flowing - just like how a straw supposed to be.So, if you want a sippy cup that does not have a valve straw.  This is it.
