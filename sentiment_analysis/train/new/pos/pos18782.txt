As some people mentioned it's not perfectly straight, which means the branch leans toward the little house and the bird looks like a crashing airplane...The bird can be fixed with a few stitches. I consider the hanging branch as natural...It fits our Babyletto crib perfectly and with a few feltstickers it's also a scratch free attachment.The pause button shifts down very easy, so I guess we have to fix it with glue or tape, no need for it anyway with a lullaby that's only playing for as long as a few minutes. I don't understand why they put it there in the first place.Check it out in a store first, so that you know what you're getting and if you like the SkipHopTreetop Friends Theme this is a really cute addition.
