Dream blanket... It is very nice, but there seems to be a bit of hype about this blanket! I really like A&A products, and this is a really quality product, but it's still just a blanket.  It's heavy, which I like as a "warm" blanket for winter life in SoCal, but it's definitely not quite as soft and cuddly as I expected, based on all the rave reviews.  I have a "stroller blanket" (by Aiden for Aiden and Anais) that is extremely soft and is actually our go-to cuddle blanket. It's the perfect weight, and I'd actually recommend it over the dream blanket.Would I buy again... Hmm, yes I think so... Especially for a nice gift. But, if the stroller blanket came in more cute prints like the dream blanket does, I'd honestly recommend the stroller blanket over this one.
