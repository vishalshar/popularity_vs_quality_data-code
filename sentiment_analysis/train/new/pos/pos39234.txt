Rating it highly because the product went on well, came with the right tools to make the application easy, and it seems like an extremely high quality product. And the screen remains extremely responsive and quick to the touch. The protector came between two glossy sheets, each with a sticker saying "Front" and "Back", clearly marked and color coded. It comes with a cleaning cloth, a small plastic rectangle & three stickers to remove dust and fibers from the screen. First you wipe off the screen, then use the stickers to remove debris. Then you remove the "Back" and apply, removing further as you go along from the bottom up. I found that fibers and particles got stuck to the sticky side of the protector itself. So I used the attached sticker to not only remove debris from the screen, but also from the back of the protector. The glossy "back" sheet kept getting stuck to the sticker, and this made the application a little challenging.Have to reduce this by at least 1 star because the matte finish deteriorates the beautiful screen to make everything look grainy and like it is a high-iso, low light camera image. Now, I didn't realize that I was ordering the matte finish version, and this was my fault. But I really can't imagine who in their right vision would be able to tolerate the graininess introduced by this finish. So for me this was a waste of $7, and I will be re-ordering a pack of the glossy finish. Anyone in St. Louis who wants the remaining 2 matte finish screens for a few bucks, please let me know.
