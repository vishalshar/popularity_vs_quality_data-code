I actually bought this as part of our potty training system for our 3 year old along with the Pourty Flexi-Fit Toilet Trainer, White/Blue and the Carex Health Brands Toilet Support Rail. The toilet seats in our house are kind of high and my son was having a difficult time transitioning from a stand alone potty to and actual toilet until I put together all 3 to make our 'super big boy potty' contraption. He took to it right away. The stool is stable and secure and has a good amount of surface area for him to rest his feet on. Would recommend
