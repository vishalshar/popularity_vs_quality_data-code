I bought this potty for my daughter, who is currently too young to use it, but at this price I thought I should get one now and save it until she's bigger. It looks very sturdy, and I was able to use it as a stool to reach high shelves. It supports the weight of an adult, so a small child should have no problem using to reach the bathroom sink. The lid clicks into place, which is a nice feature as you wouldn't want it to pop open all the time. The bucket portion of the seat is removable, which should make it easy to clean out and then replace. I think that it will work great and blend in with our bathroom decor.
