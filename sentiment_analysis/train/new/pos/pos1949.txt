My daughter's chubby legs would get stuck between the crib slats often. This totally fixed that problem. I installed the crib shield a littlte different than the instructions. I weaved the crib shield between each of the slats and attached the ties to the top rail. A little more work but i like the way it looks and stays in place better.
