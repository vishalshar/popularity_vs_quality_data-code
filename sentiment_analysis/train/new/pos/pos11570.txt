After reading other reviews on this infant sweater, I bought the 6 month size for my 2 month old, hoping it would fit.  He will be wearing it next week on his blessing day.  He is in the 12-13 pound range, and is just growing out of clothes that say "0-3" months.  So now he is officially in the "3-6" month range.  This sweater fits him perfectly today, it was very snug pulling it over his head, with the two shoulder buttons unbuttoned.  There is NO WAY it will fit him in a few weeks.  He is wearing his first "3-6" month outfit, and it is baggy on him.  This sweater is in no way baggy on him.  The length is perfect.  I would venture to say that it would have fit him fine even a month ago (when he was 1 month old)!So, this outfit is perfect for what I need it for.  I'm telling you this, so you know what size to buy for your baby.The outfit itself seems to be made very well, and very high quality.  It even comes with a cute matching hanger!  The top of the crotch doesn't have a button, there are three buttons up each leg, but not a center crotch button, so it tend to leave a gaping hole.  Just be sure to wear a white onesie under the sweater.I love it, it is cute, and in a good price range, in my opinion.
