I chose this rating due to the fact the product could be a bit better. It is operated straight off batteries and no plug in cord. But it is small and a nice shape to put in small places. I dis like the fact it runs straight off Batteries that isnt good on the pocket book. But I can finally take my sons mobile and replace it with something better. It does illuminate the whole room at night when completely dark. The sound settings are awesome I just set it at bed time and forget about it. Plus this is a neat little night light that My son can have forever and since it lights up the whole room and gives off calming sounds and soothing musical sounds for a nice sleep I think this will be something that is kept for years to come! I would recommend this to anyone who has an infant/Child Ages 0-6 Years of age!
