I purchased these from E-Retail Shops.  They did not come in Ameda packaging but instead in a clear plastic with no identifying marks.  After I called I was told that they are bought in bulk and sterilely repackaged.  This should be made clear on the website when purchasing.  I will be returning them and buying them from another seller.Followup:  I mailed back the diaphragms to E Retail Shops (and am waiting for a refund).  I then bought them from Healthcheck Systems, which is an authorized Ameda dealer as listed on their website.  The diaphragms came in the Ameda packaging as pictured in the product image.  I am much happier.
