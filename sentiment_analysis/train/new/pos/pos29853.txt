I bought this product while taking care of my dad. He needs help in the middle of the night and can't walk. This is great for the price. We haven't used it wireless though. I've read reviews about the quality of sound being poor but I haven't experienced that. I hear him calling my name while I'm asleep - it serves its purpose well.
