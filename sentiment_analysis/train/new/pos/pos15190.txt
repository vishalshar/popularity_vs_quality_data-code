Great for what I needed it for! We have a city select double stroller by baby jogger for all day excursions, but living in NYC, I found I needed something really small and light I could use on the subway. This works great for short trips to music class, play groups, museums, etc. It's VERY small when folded (smaller than my uppababy g-lite) and can easily be unfolded or folded with one hand. I have a 15 month old and 3 year old. Both children weigh about 26-28 lbs each and this actually pushes really easily on rough NYC sidewalks despite there being almost 60lbs of weight in it. The only down side is that the handles are short and I have to lean over when I push (and I'm only 5 ft 4. My husband has to bend basically in half to push it! It's comfortable, my kids love it, it fits through doors and elevators, and easily fits their 7 AM enfant winter stroller muffs.
