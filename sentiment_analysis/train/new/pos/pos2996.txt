We're very happy with this chair for several reasons. First, Harry, our baby boy likes it. I keep it handy in the back of my car with his strollers-I use it at restaurants (some of them have both lame and dirty high chairs-often times the strap buckles don't work), we use it at Auntie and Uncle's house all the time-we just pull him right up to the kitchen counter or the dinner table and bam! He's hanging with all of us! We primarily bought it for our trip to England because it's lightweight and has a little integrated packing pouch and it's well made of nylon which is super durable. It got great reviews too which helped. One note to be aware of: there is a lot of GUM under tables-take a peek before you attach the chair in public places. Like I said, it's a must have if you have a baby. Enjoy!
