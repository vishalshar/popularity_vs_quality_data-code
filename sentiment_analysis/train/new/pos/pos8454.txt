I love the way that this highchair is made -*  easy to clean*  easy to travel with*  converts to a booster seat*  adjustable height*  cover for the food tray to keep it cleanI love the entertainment tray.  It definitely helps keep they baby entertained while the rest of the family eats.The reason I only gave 4 stars:  The only thing that I think Fisher Price should have had done differently was to make the seat reclinable so that it could be used by an infant learning to sit in a high chair.
