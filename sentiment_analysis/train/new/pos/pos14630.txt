We absolutely love these pacifiers. When my daughter was born, the hospital gave us a soothie pacifier to use in between nursing sessions. Unfortunately they are easily lost, like any pacifier. We were given our first WubbaNub from a family member and it was instant love. My daughter was just learning to grab and loved holding onto her binky. They get dirty quickly when you have a crawling baby, they so easy to wash! They dry fairly quickly as well. We ordered the duck so that she had something to cuddle at night in case she woke up without wanting to nurse. She's now 15 months old and both of our Wubbanubs have held up. I recommend these to any friends with infants. I also recommend buying more than one design, it lessens the chance of them being partial to only one animal, which can cause upset if ever lost or damaged. Will be ordering more soon, love having them in cars just in case we forget to pack one in the diaper bag.
