I had purchased this for my son several years ago when he was about 5 mo. Had a hard timing finding it for my 4 mo niece, but finally found it in Amazon. When the baby presess the keyboard of the piano, the chicken covers her face with her wings and playfully says peekaboo and some music follows. You may set it to mute if the sounds become too annoying - I woke up many times during the night when I heard through the monitor that my baby was playing with it. It is a delightful toy, very sweet and babies love it. My niece could not take her eyes off it when I gave it to her. The toy encourages kicking (in preparation for crawling) and teaches cause and effect.Absolutely recommended.
