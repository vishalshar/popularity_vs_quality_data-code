We had a very difficult time trying to get our breastfed daughter to take a bottle.  After literally trying 10 to 15 different types of bottles, she finally took to the Breastflow and has never looked back.  I think the fact that it mimics compression and suction motions of the breast made it seem more natural for her.  Also, with other bottles, even the slowest flow ones, she would choke or put her tongue back to prevent the drips of milk from going down her throat.  This also meant that she was not latching on the bottle nipple to suck. Starting out I had to lay her in a breast feeding position on her side to get her to take a bottle, and with other bottles that meant that they would either drip or the milk would not fill the nipple for her to get to it.  With the breastflow, it worked just great!  The shape of the nipple also helped her, because I could kind of squeeze it and shape it to get her to latch, just like at the breast.  Now she has no trouble switching back and forth from breast to bottle between home and daycare.Initially when I used the bottle it leaked terribly, but after reading other reviews, I found that the blue inner nipple had a slight gap and was not sealing properly.  Once we pushed it in and sealed it correctly and tightened the lid tight, we have not had any more issues.  I would highly recommend this bottle for breastfed babies, particularly those having difficulty getting used to a bottle.
