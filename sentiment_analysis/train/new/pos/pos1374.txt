I am going to give this four stars. This newer model of this stroller is an improvement over the prior model.  It fits my Chicco Keyfit 30 car seats perfectly, like it was made for them! They sit with the line one the car seat level to the ground as if installed in the car; so fairly upright. My Britax B-Safe 35 Elite car seat fit as well, but not as great. The biggest improvement comes in the form of design. I like the stadium seating, though I wished it were reversed with the lowest seat closest to the handle bar. I also appreciate that this model cradles the seats and has adjustable support under the seat. The basket is also improved and larger. It is helpful that it has two cup holders and a storage compartment on the handle bar. I do wish the compartment was a bit bigger so it could hold my iPhone. The stroller folds easily, is fairly light, but not overly compact. The new metal frame is sleeker and more appealing in design compared to previous model. It turns okay and pushes pretty well. They are very basic wheels. I would say this is a great bet to buy if you are expecting twins and a good value!
