These are cute....but very bulky.  The handle is much larger than I expected - in that it juts out on either side much more than anticipated based on the images.  My cabinets are already crammed full of things & having this wide bulky thing in there just isn't worth it to me.However it does seem to be a nifty thing for kids who like handles (which most tots do - they love being able to tote little things around with handles it seems!).  And the lid is just like the other spill-proof snack containers I've seen.
