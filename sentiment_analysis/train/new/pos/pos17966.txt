We really like this product because it allows you to make a bottle with one hand and it makes measuring powdered formula more accurate.  We often make an odd number of ounces (3, 5, etc) and with the scoops you have to estimate that extra ounce or use a whole other scoop and waste an ounce.  This measures by 1 ounce so it accurately measures even the odd number of ounces.The couple things we didn't like about this product are that while it works with tall bottles, the Dr Brown bottles are even taller, so they don't quite fit.  We made a stand for the product so that they will fit.  Also, you have to be careful where the bottle is placed so that powder doesn't miss going into the bottle.  Also if you use a speciality formula (we use Enfamil AR), you have to check their website to see which adapter to use for measurement.Overall, we are very glad we have this product and would buy it again.
