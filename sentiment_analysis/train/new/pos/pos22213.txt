These seem to be from a medical supplier, hence the lack of official Medela packaging (the same kind that came with my Medela pump through the insurance company - just in sealed plastic bags)  Markings are on the side, but raised only, not in ink.  Still, to a momma who needs lots of bottles, these were just fine.  No complaints, good value, and no different than my "pretty" Medela bottles.
