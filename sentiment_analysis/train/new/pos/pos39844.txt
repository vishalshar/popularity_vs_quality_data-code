Very nice trailer. Here are some pros & cons:Pros:Very easy to pull, doesn't tip over If bike tips overProtects children from flying debrisEasy to see for driversKids love it ðŸ˜ŠMuch better than most I've seen in this price rangeCons:Not enough space in the back (can't put a backpack in the space)I wish there were zippers instead of the VelcroGoing backwards around one side is tricky because the tire of the bike gets stuck on the connection part of the trailerI don't like the straps, they seem a little unsafeIt had a strong plastic smell when we first got it
