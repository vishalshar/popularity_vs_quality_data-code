His favorite place to be! Much easier to adjust height than models where springs are adjusted, this has easy settings on legs, for our fast growing boy. He loves the toys on this, and as another reviewer noted, this can hold more favorite toys in the nets on sides. Push down green arms to help baby legs keep from getting twisted behind as they turn to new toys. Awesome toy, we bought two one for upstairs and down.Update: baby is now 1 yr, this is still his favorite toy. I honestly don't know what we would have done without it!We took the clip on toys from the mat he outgrew along with other clip toys and added to the green arms. They dangle down to just the right height now that he is taller. Keeps the jumper full of changing fun! Fisher-price could be making more money if they realized they could sell add ons!We read and play music even while he is in it. He likes to fiddle with his hands while listening to books. Easy for my parents to play with him as they can sit at chair and be on his level vs. the floor that is hard for them.He now jumps to the beat as we play music :). Great development toy, his fine motor skills at his nine month check up were off the charts! No doubt this toy helped with that!
