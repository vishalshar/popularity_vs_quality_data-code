A friend gave us our first one, and we quickly bought a 2nd for our old van without locking seatbelts. Before we got this, both my husband and I needed 30 minutes at a minimum to install our daughter's car seat. The Mighty Tite takes all of the constant readjustments out of the picture. I couldn't live without this product...or I could, but moving our car seat would return to the nightmare it once was.
