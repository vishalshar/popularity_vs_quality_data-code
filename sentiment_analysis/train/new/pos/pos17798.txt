we all usually feed our babies before we leave home, i use bottled water and put a bottle in the warmer before i leave home, it takes a while to heat that way it is ready  for me when i am ready for it. if i leave it to long it gets a little too warm i just adjust how much cold water to add so it isnt too hot.  after the bottle is heated it keeps it warm for a long time and i can generally get 3 bottles out of one bottle of bottle water. I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing and am so glad i did purchase it.  I will buy another one when this one quits working it is defiantley worth the price you just have to think outside the box.  I especially like that since i heat the water seperately i dont feel like i am wasting any formula by premixing large bottles that have to sit to cool and then get to old before i can use them.
