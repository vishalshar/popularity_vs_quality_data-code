I have two and use them multiple times a day for the past 2 years. On my second baby now and they are still going strong. This has been one the most useful baby items in my house. I sterilize anything heat safe from bottles, collars, nipples, spoons, bowls, plates, baby food containers, pacifiers, heat safe silicone teethers, toys, etc.Take it out of the box, rinse it, plug it in, and it's ready to go. This has a huge chamber--large capacity. Double-decker shelf that is removable for easy loading and unloading. Just flip the switch to "on" when loaded. It turns off automatically. The heating element is not exposed. The bottom of the chamber is smooth so it is easy to clean and maintain. No burning, no rusting.To operate, you must put enough water inside. The lid comes with a built in cup for you to measure water. It snaps on and off. Fill it to the line (about 100 mililiters or 3 ounces) and just pour the water into the sterilizer. I recommend using filtered/distilled water especially if you live somewhere that has hard water. You don't want it to crust up and calcify inside. Also keep it clean by unplugging and washing it once a week. It's nice looking and doesn't take up much counter space at all.And note that this sterilizer does no have a drying function. When it is done sterilizing, everything inside is wet. As a tip, when I don't use the full load of sterilized dishes inside after 4-6 hours, I will just add more water and run it again. I run my sterilizers 1 or 2 times a day, throughout the day, and add more stuff as I go. Its is easy and convenient.If you have a baby, you will need this.
