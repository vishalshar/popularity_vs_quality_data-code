My husband and I are both very busy parents, with full time jobs and freelancing careers, so it's hard to make time to research every single baby product that our little guy needs.  I frequent the Consumer Reports websites for suggestions, and this was their winner for safety, price and ease of assembly.  Ding ding ding!  It's most reasonably priced here on Amazon, but you can find it under $100 almost anywhere.  even I, the mechanically challenged one in the family, was able to dump out all the parts and put it together in under 20 minutes between errands.  All durable plastic with no sharp edges for baby or parents.Most importantly?  Our son adores it. We call it the BattleBug because he beats the living crap out of it and slings drool everywhere, and it endures!  We also have a very small home, and this can easily be pushes aside like a large end table when not in use.  You can also adjust the seat position so it can grow along with your little one and they won't be halfway out of it when they hit a growth spurt.  Highly recommended!
