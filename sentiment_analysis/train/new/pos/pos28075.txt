Given the mixed reviews, I decided to test this before using. When I took this out of the package, I sprinkled a few drops of water on it... and sure enough they beaded up and rolled right off.  This didn't surprise me - I always wash towels at least once before using or they don't absorb anything.  So, I washed this according to the instructions and it seemed significantly more absorbent after washing.  It has not been tested by a toddler pee incident yet... but I bet it will perform better having been washed.  The overall design is great and it fits my two very different car seats equally well.  I will circle back once the true test has been passed (or failed)....UPDATE: I washed this a second time because of squashed Cheerios and sundry other sticky spots, and then we finally had a full-on pee accident.  This worked GREAT!  It held all the liquid with literally about 2 drops making it onto the car seat cover. We stopped pretty much right away and changed clothes, etc. - I was impressed by how much this absorbed.  I will not leave home without it!!
