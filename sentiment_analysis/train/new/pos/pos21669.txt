We had this shipped to my daughter's home.  She is very mechanically inclined and did the assembly.  It seemed to be easy enough.  My wife and I were the first to set it up for use and fold it up again.  We were a little puzzled for a while.  The photos are gray and black.  Line drawings would have been easier to understand.The tires have tubes requiring inflation with a pump.  That will require some regular attention many young mothers may not be prepared to do, even though I am sure tires with tubes provide the best ride.  The unit is heavy and will require some upper body strength to handle when getting it in and out of a car.  It does have a lot of nice features.
