I bought these for my 15 month old grandson because I know how much he likes these at his home and I wanted him to have them at my house, when he visits. I also bought three sets for friends who have grandchildren. I haven't quite figured out the allure of them, but my grandson plays with these the entire time he's in the bath and no other toy can hold his interest. He fills a cup, watches it drain, fills it again, watches it drain, (repeat indefinitely until he moves on to the next sized cup.) I've tried regular measuring cups as a substitute, but he likes these best.A few other reviewers mentioned dangerously sharp edges. They must have received a very bad manufacturing batch, but I'm grateful they reported it. I carefully checked each cup in each set and all have rounded edges that could not cut. If a child fell on them they could be bruised, but they would not be cut by a sharp plastic edge. However, the frightening experiences reported in the other reviews have made me even more vigilant, which is the value of sharing information in reviews. My precious treasure :-)  is worth any amount of reading, researching and effort, to protect him from injuries that are avoidable.
