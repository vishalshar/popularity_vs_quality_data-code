I really didn't want to get an exersaucer for my home since they are so large and usually hideous but my daughter loves the one at her daycare and we really needed something that she could stand in as she was getting extremely bored with her bounce chair and swing.  After looking at about 30 exersaucers this was the one I chose because it was also a jumper, was the best looking one for the price, and had decent reviews.  It was relatively easy to put together and took my husband about twenty minutes to assemble it.  I was surprised at how much cuter each of the toys were in person.  My daughter loves playing with each and every one of them.  As for the negative remarks, here is what I discovered... My daughter is 6 months old and is relatively tall for her age (98th percentile).  The lowest setting is perfect for her and I am happy it will have some longevity with the 2 other height settings.  She can reach every toy and plays with all of them.  The noises and music are not awful and there is an option to put the sound effects on a lower volume setting.  The only reason I gave this product a 4 is that I agree with what some other people said about the jumper noise... it does make a loud thumping noise when she jumps, especially when she really starts going!  I can see how this could become annoying over time.  All in all, I am really happy with this exersaucer and the most important thing is that my daughter loves it!
