The other positive reviews are absolutely right; this set is a steal, and even more adorable in person!  The stitched designs and embellishments are gorgeous, and all of the coordinating pieces create an instant nursery theme that looks magazine-perfect, even if you have no design skills!  We didn't much care that it wasn't 100% cotton; I think that it feels great to the touch, and am pretty sure our newborn won't object.  We have had a blast creating a frog-themed nursery around this bedding set; hope you do too!
