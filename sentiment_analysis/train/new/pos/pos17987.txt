This is an awesome bath toy for kids AND the supervising parent alike. It's actually really challenging! The baby chews on all the pieces, my toddler wears the rings like bracelets and uses them as a "boat" for her rubber duckie (another fabulous PVC/BPA free bath toy from Rich Frog). Then I play the actual game to curb my boredom. It is pleasantly challenging because the rings bounce off most of the time.,  I love that it's a challenge and not so mindless for me. A winning toy for sure... I'm giving these for baby birthdays!
