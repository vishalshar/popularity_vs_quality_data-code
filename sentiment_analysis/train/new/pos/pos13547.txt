This is a great mattress. It is not very heavy but it is sturdy. I noticed that it did become a little less 'stiff' over the first year (for this reason I took one star), but nothing that I felt made it anything other than a firm mattress still and never worried me. We have had it for almost 2 years and my daughter loves her crib. She's has started to jump in her crib and always stands in the same spot when she gets up, but I haven't seen the mattress have any affects from it yet. This does NOT have a pillowy top at all, but it also doesn't crinkle like plastic. With just a fitted sheet it's a very sleek top, but I prefer this for the infant period. After that we bought a mattress pad. I have had no problems fitting sheets on here, I usually buy PBK but have bought from BRU as well. Our crib does have a mesh support system, so not as sturdy as slats, but I've seen no effect on this mattress. I do take the mattress out of the crib to put sheets on as it's not a bendy mattress, but where it's not heavy I can easily do this (even 7 months pregnant). I will be buying this again for the next baby.
