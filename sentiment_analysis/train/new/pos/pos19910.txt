My wife and I purchased this play mat for our 3 month old daughter, Maggie, and she absolutely loves it.  Previously, Maggie would need to be constantly held, but now she will happily spend over an hour or more kicking and playing on this gym.  Also, her hand-eye coordination has improved dramatically.  I have included a short video of her playing on this gym for the first time.  Highly recommended!!
