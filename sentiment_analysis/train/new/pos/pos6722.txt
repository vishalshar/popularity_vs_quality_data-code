I am one of those minimalist "we don't need this - we can get by without buying a swing" type of moms . . . and realized I was an idiot for thinking that when my firstborn turned out to be SO fussy for the first several months of her life. Regardless, I never did break down and buy one until now with our second child. Due to having a small home, we first purchased a portable near-the-ground swing from a local baby retailer - It was awful, and we took it back within 24 hours. I just couldn't bear the thought of bringing another large item into our home, especially one that was hideous and played obnoxious music :) After searching Amazon and checking out product reviews quite thoroughly, we decided to give this one a try. We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it. Easy to move around the house (from living room during the day to our bedroom at night), plays calm beautiful music, is simple in design and easy to operate, and the projection screen images are adorable. I agree with other reviews - this swing is MUCH cuter in person. I wasn't sure about the seat pattern, but it's really cute! Our 6-week old is easily calmed by being in this swing, and he loves to look at the projected images already. We had friends over recently who tried their baby in this swing while they were here, and they were very impressed. Although they have a different swing, they said their baby had never really seemed content in it. He was perfectly happy within a minute or 2 of being in our swing. I am confident this is one of the best baby swing options out there right now, especially considering the cost of so many of them! I know at some point I will probably be annoyed that this swing only runs on batteries, but at this point I honestly have no complaints whatsoever.
