I was very pleased with this product. I read the reviews carefully, and eyed the dimensions.Personally I sometimes feel a limited connection with some moms, because most have their own home and more space for things. I live in a small apartment, where space is precious. It's what I would call cozy, but potentially messy if not kept organized. So you can imagine my anxiety about going the cloth diaper route!This pail helped alleviate a lot of that anxiety. I love the handle so I can easily carry it from spot to spot, even out to the coin operated laundry and not feel awkward. It IS in the smaller range of things, so be sure you pull out a ruler and understand the dimensions.. however, I never understood the big, bulky trash cans passed off as diaper cans anyway, and my logic was, the bigger the can, the more likely I would be to allow cloth diapers to pile up for an unecessary amount of time and then have to fish them out. This perfect little pail doesn't draw unecessary attention to itself either, and I don't feel like I have to devote a large amount of space to it. It can fit right in my bathroom, next to the toilet if I chose.Would most definitely recommed to a cloth diapering mom who intends to do her loads fairly regularly (probably not as accomodating for moms who are going to wait every few days though or may not have a lot of time). As I said, read the dimensions and decide how often you intend to use cloth diapers and how many. I myself will be using the starting recommended of 24, and will be using disposables occasionally when out, plus since I am a stay at home mother, I will have a little more leeway with getting laundry done than some.Hope this helps. :)
