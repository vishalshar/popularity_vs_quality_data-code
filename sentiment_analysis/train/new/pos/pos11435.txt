By far my daughter's favorite toy for the last several months. She loves the fabric knots at the top of the head. And I think because it is lightweight it is much better than some of the other teether/rattles I've given her. At 6 months old this is still her favorite toy, and it has worn very well. It's also very easy to wash in soapy water since it's mostly solid surfaces and no crevices for water to be trapped in.
