I got this as an organizational device for my car because for work I spend a lot of time in it and I do all my morning routines and night time routines in my car, so all of that stuff needs to be with me (face cleansing wipes, makeup remover wipes, medicine, vitamins, protein shakes, deodorant, perfume, hair spray, brush, comb, hair ties and bobby pins, makeup pouch, gum, two water bottles, and more). It is just like in the picture and the size of all the pockets is great. If you're getting this for a child to keep things to do in the backseat, I would say this has more than enough room for many options for the child to pick from. Coloring books or comics, snacks, beverages, hand held game systems, there's that awesome tissue box holder, if you have a baby there is definitely room for all the stuff from your diaper bag, and if you're using it for something like I am it works great too. It seems durable so far and I have no complaints.
