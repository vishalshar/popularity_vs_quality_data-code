The ceiling light show can't be beat for relaxing baby on her way to sleep.  It gives a baby something interesting and relaxing to focus on in the dark until she falls asleep and never fails us.  Even when fussy, we just turn on the baby's "birds" and she relaxes right away.  I wish the unit would play longer than just 8 minutes, though most of the time it is long enough.  With three different volumes, the lowest is best for sleeping and I can barely hear it.  The birds are also interesting to look at during the daytime for my baby.  This product is a winner and my 4 month-old loves it and has enjoyed it since she was 1 month old!  I don't even want to imagine what bedtime would be like without this product!Update: My 4 month old is now 2 and a half years old and I have a 13 month old.  I now own 2 of the Flutterby Dreams.  Both girls turn these on by themselves.  If they happen to wake in the dark, the birds will be turned on and they go back to sleep all with no parental assistance required which means I get uninterrupted sleep.  Best baby /toddler product ever!
