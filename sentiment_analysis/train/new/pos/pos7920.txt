After destroying a previous wipe warmer from Prince Lionheart due to the bottom turning brown and finally bubbling up and starting to smell horrible like burning plastic, I decided to invest in this pillowcase holder for my next wipe warmer so that I didn't have to purchase a new wipe warmer again and worry about a fire hazard. Though I'm resentful at having to pay such a ridiculous price for a little piece of plastic that should frankly have been included with the original unit in order to make it functional, I have to say that I would purchase this again. It's the missing piece that your Prince Lionheart wipe warmer should have arrived with, and for safety and functionality purposes, you will want to purchase one.
