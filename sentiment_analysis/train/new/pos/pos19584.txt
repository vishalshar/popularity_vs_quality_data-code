These diapers have double gussets and with double inserts you can keep even the heaviest wetter dry through the night, my son has BG diapers and I change him every two hours and they still leak and these Alva's only need one change through the night. Liked them enough to order 12 more. Just be sure to use PayPal if ordering through Alva's website(cheaper) because the encryption isn't safe enough there
