I love the smell of this wipe!  It is a soothing, relaxing and natural scent.  They wipes are easy to tear so I would only use half a wipe after I pumped at work and the package lasts twice as long.  I have sesitive skin and I did not have a reaction to this.  This was my favorite breast feeding/pumping product.  I have also used it to wipe my baby's face once or twice after meals.  Since it is food grade and gentle enough to use on my breast it would be just fine to use to wipe my daughter's skin.  There is no harsh chemical smell and it does not leave a sticky residue on your skin.  A must have for all nursing moms!
