Every single time we use our Hold-On Handles someone stops me to ask where to get one, or what exactly it is, or what a great idea it is, etc. etc. Every time. These things are genius! My two oldest (who are both 4 and have used for about a year now) love that they can walk independently not have to be in the cart or in the stroller or wherever else I had to stash them. I love that they are MUCH less likely to wander away or get lost because as soon as someone drops the handle it either hits the cart and alerts me or when I clip it to my Lillebaby carrier the handle hits my leg to let me know someone has let go. So much win going on here! I bought the additional handle so both girls get their own. SO WORTH IT! I highly recommend them.
