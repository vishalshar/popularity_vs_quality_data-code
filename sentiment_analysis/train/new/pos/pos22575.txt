This cover worked great to replace the original pad for the Graco high chair my daughter had.  It made the chair look new, whereas before it was looking rather sad.  Her chair had a bar between the legs, and this cover has an opening for that--an opening that might not be appreciated for a chair style without that bar since there would be a very obvious round opening on the seat. That hole in such a seat could be explained as an allowance for air to escape, but it would be nice if it weren't there for those chairs that don't need it.  There are also openings in the back to allow straps to come through--though my daughter's only had one strap, this pad allows for different position of either the strap or a harness; and, for the openings that are not needed for the straps, the edges of the strap openings come together so you don't realize they're there until you look closely.  It is fabric, but easily wipes down.  Because it is a generic-sized cover, the oversized high chair seat at first appeared to be too tall in the back--and the bar between the seat was a challenge because at first it seemed like there was no way to get the crossbar off to allow the cover to be postiioned appropriately. However, the back had an elasticized pocket-type slip cover that worked great, and we eventually figured out the crossbar.  Once it all came together, the chair looks as if it could be used for quite some time.  This replacement seat looks good and saved the cost of buying an equivalent new high chair.  I think the price could have come down a bit and the manufacturer could still have made money, and I think the versatility of the neutral-colored cover to accommodate either straps or harnesses should have been more clear in the original description;  otherwise, I think it is a great cover that meets the purpose for which it was intended.
