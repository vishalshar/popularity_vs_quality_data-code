These works fine as the original.  My son had destroyed my original ones that I had and I spent so much as I bought new nuk bottles. Now with my daughter,  I came across these replacements and what a bargain.  I took all my bottles out as I had so many and replaced. If I only knew,  that's what I should have done . Just buy a bottle and this replacement and should have saved a lot. I have 2 kids and I noticed my son bites them when he gets a hold of the bottle from the sister.  The food thing is that I have lot and I make sure he don't play with his sister's bottle.
