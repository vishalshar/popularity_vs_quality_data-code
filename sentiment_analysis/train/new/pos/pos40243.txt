This is so cute! I bought this as a baby shower gift for a friend. I have one of these for each of my children and I love them! They are so cute to put your child's pictures in and see how much they've changed in their first year. When delivered, this was very carefully packaged with bubble wrap all around to prevent any damage. The only thing I would change in this product would be to make the circle frames a little but bigger. But it is still so adorable.
