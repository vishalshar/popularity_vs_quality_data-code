My wife is going through her first pregnancy and comfort during sleep was a huge issue. She tried multiple pillows and nothing really worked so I decided to purchase the "Boppy Slipcovered Body Pillow" as a surprise gift. The pillow arrived super fast (I love being a prime member) with no issues with packaging. My wife wasn't expecting anything in the mail so when she saw the big box she was very excited. She tried out the pillow and fell asleep within 10 minutes! This is a must for all of you lovely ladies out there that are expecting.
