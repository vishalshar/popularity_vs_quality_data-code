This product is amazing!  I wish I had thought of this myself.  For such a small investment I can now avoid buying the overpriced applesauce squeeze packets and yogurt tubes and buy these products in larger quantity and fill these pouches instead - all for a much cheaper price.  If only these had been around when my children were babies and we were pureeing our own baby food.The packets are easy to clean-just take the cap off, open the top and run water through the pouch, then stick it in the dishwasher.  If you pour the water in through the opening on the top the water comes out the open spout on the side. If you clean them shortly after use that is all you will need to do.  If you leave the contents in a little longer then you can always use a small brush (bottle brush) to clean it out more rigorously before putting them in the dishwasher.I will say that my kids have a tendency to bite on the round opening/spout on the side (we're working on this) so then I have to bite it back in to place so I can fit the cap back on.  Not a big deal if your kids don't do this.The only slightly negative thing I can say about this product is that the top opening (interlocking zipper seal similar to Ziploc bags) is hard to pull apart after the pouch has been sucked on and my husband pulled too hard one time and the seal ripped.  This was after having the product for only a few days.  But I still love this product so much that I just bought some more and am now a little more careful when opening them.  Plus, the customer service was great.  When I told them about the rip in one of the bags they promptly offered to send me a 4 pack of replacement pouches.  So despite the issue I had, I still give this product 5 stars as my issue was rectified immediately.
