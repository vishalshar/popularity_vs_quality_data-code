I am a mother of 8 and have already tried the JJ cole car seat cover, the elastic broke and the Velcro came off. I was looking into this one for some time and finally got it, I love it so much, it is big for those bulky car seats, dark for nap time, and stylish, I have gotten so many compliments it is crazy. The largest benefit is that no one comes up to me trying to touch my baby, it keeps the privacy factor going. I love this cover and would buy tons more for friends if they were having any children.
