Got this when our baby was nearly 6 mo old and love it!  We use it 3-4 times a day and she seems to be comfortable in it. We have taken it on vacation with us and it wasnt too hard to get in and out of our mini van and didnt take up alot of room all folded up.  I only wish that when folded it stood up on its own, if it does I havent been able to get it to balance right but most of the time we have it out.  This is my first high chair so Im not sure how it compares to others in how much room it takes up when in use, it seems to take up alot of room when we have it out but it rolls very easy so its just a matter of finding a place to put it out of the way.  We dont use the recline option much now but at first we used it alot, made giving a bottle alot easier, the movement was truly one handed.  Love the removable trays, we keep one w/ toys on and and take it off to eat, shes not quite to the mess making stage so I'm not sure how bad this is going to be to clean, I clean the seam on the tray every couple days w/ an old toothbrush and hot water, she never fails to get something on her hand and grab that edge.  The removable trays dont fit in our washer but they aren't hard to clean in the sink.  For now I dont remove the tray often as baby is small enough she can be put in and taken out w/o removing it, the few times I have had to take it off it took a minute to get the tray back on.  The pommel attached to the tray is a bit annoying but it looks like alot of others are going the same way, for now I dont really keep anything on it that would require me to have it lay flat if I did take it off.  Overall we love this chair.
