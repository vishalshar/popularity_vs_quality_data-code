When we first received this toy my husband was very concerned about the hands being a choking hazard, which I had also seen in other reviews. Though they seemed very sturdy I cut off the little ball hands and we have not had a problem. Our twins love this toy and at about 6 and 7 months it was their favorite. It actually encouraged them to crawl since it is constantly rolling away from them on the hard wood floors. At almost 9 months they still play with it pretty regularly.
