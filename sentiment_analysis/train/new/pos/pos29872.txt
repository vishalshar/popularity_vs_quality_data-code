I first purchased these two summers ago for our Disney trip, to put on our 2 and 4 year old boys, in case they ran off into the crowd and also to note that one of my sons is allergic to nuts, and they worked perfectly. They were easy to apply and stayed on for 2 days, which was longer than I had expected with the multiple applications of sunscreen, going in and out of pools, waterslides, baths, etc. I purchased more last summer for our trip to Sesame place because they worked so well.  Both at Disney and Sesame parents kept stopping me and asking where I bought them.
