I purchased this bag for our upcoming trip to Europe. Last time we traveled, our stroller was sent to carousel a few times. It came all dirty and the recline  buckle wasn't working anymore so we decided this time we will protect our expensive Bumbleride Flite stroller. Bumbleride doesn't make their own umbrella stroller bags. I almost bought RoverGear Bag because it had very good reviews. It looked like it would fit most strollers and I wanted something that wouldn't be too big and bulky for our umbrella stroller. So i went ahead with this one even though I was not sure about the right sizing because the sizing that amazon has for this product doesn't make sense to me. I decided I will buy this if it's too small i will return it and buy something else. I usually don't do that but I am glad I gave this bag a shot. I have to tell though, this product is different from the picture. It's well made, one side is bigger to fit the front wheels, easy to put the stroller in and out,well padded in all sides. It might be a new G-series travel bag which is a little bigger and with two zippers. It's not snug as the other reviews mention, it's just the perfect size or maybe it's perfect for my Bumblerdie Flite only. It has two yellow carry straps, i wish it had a shoulder strap too but it's ok beacuse I can unzip it a little bit and use my stroller's shoulder strap. I will post sometime pictures and sizing for this product and also update my review after our trip.
