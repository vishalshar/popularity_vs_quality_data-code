Love the Orbit Baby system! The way that the bassinet sits on the rocker means that baby's head is lower than its body though, so I end up not using it as a rocker, instead just prop it up and put it in the corner of the room as a second bed closer by than baby's room. But using the bassinet on the stroller base is fabulous when out and about for long periods of time, baby can have a proper sleep. The bassinet is roomier than lots of others that I've seen with other strollers, so we ended up using it for about 5 months.
