I bought this and the PottyMD version at the same time to alternate almost daily.  I prefer this one.  It washes well and is working well. I like the wings that help it stay in place.  Images show the back side of the cover which is woven-like - I was skeptical of how it could possibly be waterproof but it seems to do its job. One reviewer claims that it is vinyl on the underside but has not answered my question as to how they know that. I don't know, maybe it is. But it looks like fabric. The other version I have IS vinyl which immediately melted and became totally ruined. Over 1/5 years later on this one and it looks like new.***Update*** 1/30/16Still being regularly used and look like new. Washes very well. Not causing sweating issues or anything that I'm aware of. Still 5 stars for me!
