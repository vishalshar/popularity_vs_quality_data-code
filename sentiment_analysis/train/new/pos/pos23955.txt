This matches our Graco crib perfectly and looks great in the nursery especially for the price. Though the directions were not very good and made my husband very frustrated. It took him multiple try's to get specific pieces in the right spot they are all labeled with the same letter so you think they are all the same. Overall once we got it figured out it only took a few hours to put together and it seems sturdy enough that I am not worried about it breaking over the years.
