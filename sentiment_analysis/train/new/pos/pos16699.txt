Our son is now two and we still find yourself grabbing this wrap when he falls asleep and we are on the go.It can be a little tricky at first so I'd recommend using it when you have someone with you to assist, then after a while you get the hang of it and can wrap your baby while holding them yourself.There are a few different wrap positions you can do which is great to change it up and switch sides to give your back relief.The straps are very comfortable as it's really wide and does not place pressure on one specific point.Out of the many wraps that we purchased and tried, this one was our favorite.
