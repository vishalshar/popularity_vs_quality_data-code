Bought these for my 2 month old. Purchased these because I wanted an all-natural, BPA/PVC/pthalate-free pacifier since baby has this in his mouth. There's no dyes in this one, like the green ones they used to give out at hospitals, and they are softer so they don't leave pacifier marks on baby's nose. This one also has the dip on the edge so you don't feel like it's going to cover baby's nose. No rubbery smell, which I wondered about before purchasing this. Also, all one piece. The handle is also part of the pacifier, seems to be holding up well and not breaking anywhere. So far, we are liking these.
