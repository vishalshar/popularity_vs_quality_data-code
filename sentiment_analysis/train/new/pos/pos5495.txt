this is the best sippy cup ever. My son made a very easy transition to drinking from a regular cup (and not tipping it too far/down his front) thanks to the tilted inside that allowed him to get a feel for what it is really like to tip a glass forward to drink from. The lid is not completely spill-proof, but it also doesn't just gush water if it falls over. It allows for teachable moments of, "when the cup tips over, we need to stand it back up so it won't spill". Probably won't work best if you have a child who will throw it on the floor when finished drinking or when bored or when it's Tuesday at 10:24am.
