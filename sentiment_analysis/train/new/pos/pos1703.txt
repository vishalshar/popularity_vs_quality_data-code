These did end up looking great on my baby girls wall but it says they are stickers & they are not. More like wall tattoos that cannot be removed. Not the easiest to transfer onto a walk BUT they do look awesome (like they are painted on) & the end result was worth the beginning pains. Plus they can be painted over
