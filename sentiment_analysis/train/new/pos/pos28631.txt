I love this product-  much cheaper than buying disposable, one use squeeze foods...  Only one design issue I wish was different-  the larger hole where you put the food in has a flip lid which you just pop open.  The problem is that when it is full and the screw top lid is closed, if you squeeze the pouch, the larger lid pops open and you have quite a mess to clean up.  If you can avoid this issue, this is a very worthwhile investment.  (If only the larger lid screwed on also..)
