I'm a new mom and this was one of the first products I chose without a family/close friend's suggestion. MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE IT! I pop in frozen cubes of her favorite homemade purees and leave the house. 2-3 hours later she is ready for her meal and after a quick shake of the "bottle" to mix it she's eating. I feed with one hand and use the other to battle my 7 month old's hands from playing with her food. Easy to wash and hasn't leaked at all in the month we've had it. 3 things to be aware of:1. Spoon cover is small, I always worry I will lose it when I take it off.2. Squirt with caution, a little pressure is all you need. We made a mess till we got the hang of it.3. Purees have to be a smooth consistency. If it's too watery the food/liquid may separate and you will be either squirting liquid or shooting food from it.We get compliments on it whenever we use it. I've already purchased a spare and another for a gift. Worth the $10 if you make your own purees and want to feed on the go.
