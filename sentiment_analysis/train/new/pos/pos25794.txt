I'd like to address a few of the negative reviews. First, those of you stating this is not a 4-in-1 crib because it doesn't include the bed rails - this is normal for a 4-in-1 crib. 99% of them do NOT come with the metal rails to convert this into a bed. The purpose of cribs being 4-in-1 are that you may buy the simple double-size frame of your choice, and the back rail of your crib was made to fit most of those as a headboard. This crib allows the sides to be used as a headboard AND footboard - many 4-in-1 cribs only can be used as a headboard.Also, most convertible cribs do not come with a guardrail when turning into a toddler bed, which would actually be a 3-in-1 crib and you would buy a guard rail if needed. Some cribs even have one that match the crib, you just buy it separate. THIS crib comes with a toddler rail to replace the front side of the crib, making it much easier (and cheaper) than most convertibles.This crib does not come with hardware covers, which is fine by me - hardware covers are a choking hazard. If it really bothers you, dab some paint on the ends of the bolts.I had no problem reading and following the instructions and putting the crib together by myself within 20 minutes, and I am a short woman. It was very easy - the important thing to remember is to insert ALL of the bolds and tighten them ONLY enough to start to thread. This will solve any problems you have trying to line things up. Once EVERYTHING is assembled, go back and tighten everything. I did this and had zero issues with alignment of the holes, and the crib, while lightweight enough for me to move around, is extremely sturdy and stable.We got this crib in white and it arrived well packaged and without a scratch. We purchased the Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams Crib Mattress, White to go with this, and it has a VERY snug fit! Perfect.
