From about six-ish months on, both of my children have enjoyed this toy on the floor and tied to their cribs.The younger one is now eight months old and has finally gotten the hang of sliding the bee to make the disc spin, which he does over and over wit glee.  He also loves the gears and spinner with beads.  We end up using it as more of a floor toy than a crib toy with him (it was the opposite with the older one).I wish there were more simple mechanical manipulative toys like this (and this: Playskool Busy Poppin' Pals).Bottom line: Manipulative fun without batteries, for five- to nine-month-olds.
