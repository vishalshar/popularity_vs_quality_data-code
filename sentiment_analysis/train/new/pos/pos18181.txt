This is high quality silicone.  And this is by far the best deal for them that I've seen.  EVERYONE who sees my daughter wearing it compliments her and asks me where I got it.  They have no idea that this is a "special" necklace for a "special" need.  Also, it is has drastically helped my daughter stop mouthing everything.  (She craves oral stimulation.)  This is the best, discreet solution  we could have ever stumbled upon.  LOVE IT and would HIGHLY recommend it.
