Who even knew that a 10 week old could even "play"? We have a number of toys for our baby that are supposedly for newborns and up, but really our baby has had no interest in these toys.Pros:- Easy to put together- Hanging toys are actually cute, brightly colored and could be used apart from the gym.- Turtle's feet make a crinkly sound that the baby responds to.- The poles have high contrast black and white that infants eyes are drawn to.- The poles are very lightweight and flexible so that the baby can kick them, which causes the hanging toys to move.- Lightweight and easy to move.Cons:- Not machine washable.- Putting balls into turtle's head is a bit time consuming since you really can only put one in at a time.I haven't set up the ball pit, but already the gym has exceeded my expectations. My baby really seems to enjoy the gym. It also looks much better than in the picture.Update: After 5 1/2 months, my baby is still playing with the gym. I also use the hanging toys apart from the gym. They are convenient as stroller toys and at my diaper station. She can't sit up on her own yet so I haven't set up the ball pit.Update: At 7 1/2 months we've converted it to the ball pit, though we haven't put the balls in yet. I was concerned that there was no information on the materials of the balls. Sometimes ball pit balls can be made of PVC. I contacted the company and they told me the balls are made of  LDPE (low density Polyethylene). As far as I know, LDPE is considered a safe material for babies so soon the baby will have a ball pit. Currently it serves as a kind of toy box. I still put her in the pit with all her toys and she's pretty happy in there.
