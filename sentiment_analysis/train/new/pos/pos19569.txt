Absolutely beautiful! Perfect for either a baby boy or girl's 1st Christmas because it has both blue and pink decorations on a egg shell background with gold accents. I bought  this as part of a a baby shower gift and placed it on the outside of the gift it self as part of the presentation. It received many ooh's and ahh's from the mother to be and guests. I highly recommend this ornament for baby's 1st Christmas. Nice keepsake box included.
