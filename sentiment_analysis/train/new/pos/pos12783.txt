We use Thirsties Diaper covers, and this is pretty much the same product, but as a bag. I've tried a few bags for dirty diapers. Here are the things I like about this one:- it's waterproof and reliable- it can be washed in hot water (by comparison, Skip Hop and Itzy Ritzy are cold wash only)- the single layer is simple to wash and deal with- it dries quickly (Skip Hop's wet/dry bag also line dries quickly, but Itzy Ritzy's does not)- the snap strap is very sturdy and makes it easy to pack (Skip Hop's was not reliable and would unsnap when the bag got heavy, and eventually the webbing of the strap itself came apart. Itzy Ritzy Medium had no strap)There are 2 things I think could improve. Since this is a wet bag only, there's no outside pocket. I found that Skip Hop's mesh zippered pocket on their wet/dry bag was useful and it would be nice to have that option on this bag too. (Planet Wise has both a wet and wet/dry bag option, but the outer pocket of their wet/dry bag is cotton, and I preferred the mesh pocket of Skip Hop.)The other issue I have, and this has only become more noticeable recently as my baby has become a toddler and eats more solids, is that the bag is definitely stinky and has absorbed odors by the end of the day. Our day care is understanding, but I feel kind of bad sometimes. It'd be nice if it contained the smell better.
