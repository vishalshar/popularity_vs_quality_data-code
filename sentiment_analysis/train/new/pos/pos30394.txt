I loved this wrap for my newborn, but now that she's becoming an active baby I am preferring other carriers. For the newborn stage this was perfect. It's simple to put on and use, no wraps, ties or buckles to fiddle with past the first sizing. It cradles baby nicely and feels secure, though I always kept one arm around the baby. It's also great to breastfeed while wearing. Plus it's simply a beautiful print to wear.
