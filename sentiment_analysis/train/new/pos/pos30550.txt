This is the best stroller accessory bag out there. We have a BabyJogger City Mini GT. The parent tray from Baby Jogger looked ok - but was expensive (three times the cost of this one). I am extremely impressed with how well made this is. The fabric is thick and the stitching is strong. The quality of this product made me start looking into other J.L. Childress items.
