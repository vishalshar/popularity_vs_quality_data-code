If I had saved the cabinet latches that I removed when my kids grew out of the need for these, I never would have found these GREAT latches! I had already purchased another type of safety latch at a local store, but had not yet installed them because they seemed unnecessarily complicated. No big deal, but they had actual metal springs on the bendable prongs and it seemed to me that simple flexible plastic would do, like the ones I had taken down years ago. (I think I actually did save them, but do you think I can find them now?). Anyway, in the search for an alternative, I came across these and, wow! - am I glad I did. Once you re-install safety latches, you find all over again just how annoying it is to open a cabinet or drawer only to have it come to a sudden stop and you think - "Oh, yeah. Those %#@* safety latches!"  It takes weeks or months to re-learn the smooth opening action with the safety latch push integrated into the motion. But now we don't have to!  When the Grandkids (just one so far but we're keeping our fingers crossed) are coming over we "turn on" the latches and when they leave we just rotate them 90 degrees and can enjoy smooth, uninterrupted cabinet and drawer opening until their next visit. Life is bliss!
