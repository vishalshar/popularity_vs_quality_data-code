I for one is not a big fan of harness backpacks. To me it seems to be having your child in a leash, but nothing can be said wrong about the purchase of this product. I love my son with all my heart but he can definitely be a handful especially for my wife who is at home with him while I am away at work overseas. She treaded very carefully on asking me about buying this backpack because she new how I felt about them. I of course couldnt say no to her lol and went along with the idea. Needless to say it was a good decision and purchase. There is enough room in the Eddie Bauer backpack to store everything my son can carry to keep him entertain and the added security of knowing he cannot go too far without my wife not being able to hold on to him. I recently purchased it so I am not sure how long we will have it, however, Eddie Bauer is known for their durability; i would say I would having this backpack for my son for a while before I have to buy another one.
