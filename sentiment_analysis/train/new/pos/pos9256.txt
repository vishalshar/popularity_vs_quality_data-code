Love those little guys for storing snacks for my little ones or little food items around the kitchen. I especially buy them for my baby meals that I freeze. I make my babies soups and freeze them in those perfect 8 oz containers. Perfect portion for my kiddies. Containers hold up really well, after about 2 years of usage they are still in great shape especially considering the fact that they are "disposable" ... I keep buying them over and over again as my family grows. I also bought few more packages that I leave at the grandparents house when grandma makes soups so she can freeze it as well. Very inexpensive, great quality and cute too!
