I bought these edge guards to stick to our sharp fireplace brick facade after seeing them installed at a friend's house. The pads are nice, thick foam, and they feel soft and don't look too bad (imo).The included 3M double-sided tape works great if you're sticking these pads to a hard, non-porous surface like glass, wood, or tile. But if, like me, you try sticking the tape to brick, the tape doesn't hold up too well.I've been able to mount the edge guards using the following method:  1. Screw masonry screws through a piece of velcro into some grout, every 6" or so.  2. Stick a piece of velcro along the edge guard's inside.  3. Stick the edge guards to the screwed-in velcro strips.I'm using a small masonry screw, and the holes that remain are pretty small, so I can patch them up when my children are old enough to not bang their heads on the fireplace corners. But to do this, you need some extra screws, some industrial-strength velcro, and a hammer drill.Ease of installation gets 2/5 stars, but in every other regard, these edge guards are pretty good.
