I love these bibs! They are one size fits all and they will fit my son, now 4 months, for a long time. They have a waterproof backing which is ideal because he has been drooling like crazy as he cuts teeth. He goes through so many bibs in a day, and this lessens the amount of cotton bibs that he soaks straight through to his onesie. These are a definite must for every baby!
