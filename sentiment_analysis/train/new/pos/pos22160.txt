It has a tendency to spill. If you close it completely tight, due to air pressure the liquid will start to seep out of the straw. However, there is a way to tighten it just right so that this doesn't happen. Just don't over tighten the lid.My baby who was teething started to chew off the top of the straw and parts of the straw were being swallowed? b/c its one of those closed bite to open tops. So I bought some replacement straws and cut of the top of the straw. Problem solved, my baby doesn't chew the straw anymore.I recommend this product due to the overall design and functionality. Having tried many other types of sippy cups my baby preferred this one the most. My baby is a bit on the small side she is 45% in weight for her age.This item is far from perfect however. You need to check the inner rim when washing, as well as between the straw and the lid. Also this has known issues with leaking when the cap is overtightened.Overall despite these flaws, its very durable and well designed. My baby has thrown this thing very hard many times on concrete during walks and its gotten narry a scratch. Very tough despite not looking it. :)
