We've used Born Free bottles and nipples since we first gave my daughter a bottle at 2 weeks old and they are wonderful. I was breastfeeding and pumping to give her bottles at daycare until she was 9 months old and decided to quit pumping and continue to nurse her in the mornings and evenings until she was a year old. Once the frozen breastmilk ran out a couple of weeks later, I decided to bump her up to level 3 nipples since formula is thicker. After two times of not being there for her early morning feeding (she didn't wake up before I left for work) she wouldn't nurse in the morning anymore and the same thing happened a couple of weeks later with the evening feeding. By 10 months old, she was done nursing. These nipples have such a higher rate of flow, she's able to down a 6 ounce bottle in under 5 minutes if she's really hungry and that's just not possible with nursing. She's incredibly healthy and happy and the nipples work wonderfully, obviously. It's just a warning, that if you are dead set on nursing until your baby is 12 months or older, you might want to hold off on moving up from level 2 nipples. Happy feeding!
