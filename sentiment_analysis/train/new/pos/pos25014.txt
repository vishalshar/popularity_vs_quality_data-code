I noticed most of the "helpful" reviews for this are from a few years ago and seems that the design may have changed so hopefully my newer video review, showing how it looks and works, will be a bit more accurate and answer most of your questions.  I didn't see any of the issues with quality or durability, but if I do, I'll update this.  So far, I find this brush very useful and still lasts after a few months of use.
