READ THIS, WAIT BEFORE RETURNING!! We bought this walker for our 10mo old who is in the 99th percentile for height.  As everyone else said it's way too tall for her, she couldn't even touch the ground if trying to stand.  But after reading reviews on other sites, we discovered the height is fixable! If you flip it over and take out the four screws for the height adjustment plate, you can simply cut in another notch right in front of the other existing notches with an exacto-knife.  Screw them back in and Presto!!  Super easy fix, takes five minutes!!  Hope this helps
