We love this chair. Just know that this chair isn't black/gray. It's a dark brownish color with brown straps. I thought it was black/gray. That's my fault. The color name should have given me a hint it wasn't just black.My complaints are:1) It seems cheaply made. It doesn't bother me, but some people might want to know that.2) it's hard to push down the handles and pull the back legs back when setting up the chair for the baby to sit in. (We keep it folded when not in use.)What I love:1) NO FABRIC to wash between meals!!! It's wonderful!!2) Comfortable for baby to sit in.3) This thing adjusts to go up high or down low so we can push him into our table to eat with us when he's older.4) The tray insert is easily taken out and fits into a dishwasher!!!
