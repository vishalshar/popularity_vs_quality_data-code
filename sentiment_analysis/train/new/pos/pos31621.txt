A great toy! It's obvious that my 7-month-old granddaughter is just at the beginning of her ability to enjoy it. It's like an African rain stick, except it's clear so you can see the colored beads moving through the tube. It's 8" long by 2" in diameter, just right for a baby. The first thing she did was shake it. It makes a great rattle. Then she started to watch the beads. I think as she gets older there will be more bead-watching and less shaking. This cost more than I usually spend on a single toy, but it's worth it.
