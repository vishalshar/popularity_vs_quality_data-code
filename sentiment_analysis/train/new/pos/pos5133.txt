This cup is the go-to cup for my daughter and the other two kids in her playgroup (ages 1 to 1.5yrs).  They have all been using the cups for the last few months, and all seem to be able to use them quite easily.  My daughter took to these much better than sippy cups.You do have to put the cap on quite tight sometimes to make sure that they don't leak.  And I would recommend getting the replacement straws with the cleaning instrument (or maybe using a pipe cleaner?), and taking the straw completely off the cup each time you wash it.  Otherwise it is easy for mold to grow in the part of the straw that is near where it attaches to the cup.  But if you clean there, it is a great cup!
