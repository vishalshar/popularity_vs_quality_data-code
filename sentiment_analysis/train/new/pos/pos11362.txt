I've had a hard time finding placemats online for my very picky eater (21 mos old). The various alphabet and number Crocodile Creek placemats are really pretty and make eating a lot more fun for my daughter. We practice counting and letters and naming animals and naming colors during meals. I put pieces of chicken or pasta on the various animals and it helps her to want to eat them! So the placemat is worth its weight in gold to me. The problem is that the color scratches off somewhat easily (I had read in other reviews that this would happen). We've only had them a few weeks and it's pretty noticeable. But until I find something this good that is more durable, I would probably just buy more of these.
