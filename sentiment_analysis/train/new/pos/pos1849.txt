We enjoy the yellow glow of this night light. I wish I had thought of it prior to our daughter's birth! It is nice to be able to see her when she is sleeping without us in our room during naps or before we get to bed (3 months) and also when we are sleeping in there with her just to be able to see that the covers aren't near her face. The glow is nice like a dim light but chose an outlet not directly near your eyes as it can be distracting while you sleep if light bothers you (like me). I put it in our bathroom and leave the door open enough to have the light but also enough to cover the source. As far as the flickering goes, mine rarely flickers, even when the morning sun comes into the room, no flickering, it just stays on. If it is not plugged in completely then it will flicker. Good choice for a night light, and will be good for her room when she is older and sleeping by herself.
