Baby really likes the music and watching the animals.  Mom does not like the tent design that the animals are attached to.  It's a suffocation hazard if it should ever fall.  We are planning on cutting out most of the tent material as there are no lights directly above the crib that the tent is blocking and the lack of tent will not affect baby's enjoyment.  Also, the music is quite loud and since it is just a wind up, there is no volume adjustment.  We actually chose this specifically because it was a wind up and therefore no batteries, but I wish it wasn't quite so loud.  Again, baby doesn't mind the volume, but in the middle of the night, it really gives mom a headache.
