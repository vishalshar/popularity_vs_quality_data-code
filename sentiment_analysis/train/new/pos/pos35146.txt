This is a lifesaver literally! My daughter loves to eat and last time I gave her watermelon she almost choked on it! I tried to find something that would prevent it from happening again and I am glad I found this product! This product has a mesh cloth where you put the food and that mesh cloth helps the baby to just suck on the food and not choke. It also has a round handle with rubber grip. It's just right for their little hands so the food doesn't slip out of tier hands. My daughter enjoys eating whole food without me worrying of her choking. I love this product! It's good quality and the mesh cloth doesn't get big holes easily. I would recommend it!
