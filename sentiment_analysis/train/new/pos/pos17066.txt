We love the onsie! My 18 month old was Wonder Women for Halloween this past year along with the rest of the family being super heros. She has continued to wear it with leggings and skirts. She is tiny so I bought a 12 month size and it fit her better than the 18 month would have. It was a little spendy but easier for me to buy this then fine a plain red once and make myself.
