Contrary to many earlier reviews, this cup has not been leaky at all for me! I keep it as a water bottle in the diaper bag and it has not leaked yet and the lid stays on fine. I've gotten tons of comments about how cool looking it is. My son can hold it easily and loves to just play with it, which is actually great because many times I'm trying to keep him entertained while we're out and about!At 11 months, my son drinks well from a sippy cup, but has a hard time with drinking from this spout. I think it would be challenging to clean (I only use it for water) so I don't think I'd serve juice or milk from it. This cup works fine for my needs, but has a couple design issues which is why I only gave it 4 stars.
