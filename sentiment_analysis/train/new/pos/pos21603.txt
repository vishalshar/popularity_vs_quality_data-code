We have been using this monitor for about 4 months now and have found it to be reliable. If you can, it is preferable to plug it in because it drains batteries pretty quickly. I agree with other reviews that it is sensitive. We can hear our son moving a lot, but that doesn't bother me. I would rather hear more than not enough.We also get some static but it seems like we get it when there is nothing between the base and the receiver. For examle, if our son's door is closed, there is no issue. If we go in to check on him, we usually turn the receiver off or down because there is interference.It is an inexpensive monitor and none of the cons are a big deal for me. For the price and features, I would recommend it.
