This six pack of Boudreaux's is the best deal out there! I was also pleasantly surprised to find it was the big (4oz) tunes, not the small ones, and the expiration date was over a year and a half away! Recently, as my 16month old tries more and more kinds of foods, we've had a greater need for diaper rash cream. This one is easily applied, and doesn't have a horribly medicinal or overwhelming smell. If I notice any redness or rash starting, I apply some BBP, and that's the end of the story. One of the things I appreciate the most is that I haven't had any issues using it with my cloth diapers. We're never without this stuff anymore - I keep a tube in her room, in her diaper bag, and even a spare in the car, so the multipack is perfect.
