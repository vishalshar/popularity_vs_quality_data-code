My favorite thing about this product is the size. It is big enough to hold absolutely everything I need it to hold and then some without being the size of a suitcase like most other diaper bags. It really seems like it was designed with mothers in mind because of the convenient extra pockets and manageable size.I read some reviews about the strap breaking, which has not happened to me of course because I just barely got it, but I pulled on the end of the strap that they were talking about to see and I can see how it could be a problem because the threading there is visible and doesn't appear to be incredibly sturdy. However, I don't think that mine will break because it seems sturdy enough to handle what I need it for. I imagine that some of these bags are worse than others in this area.There are only two things I could complain about (other than the potentially weak strap). The adjustable strap does not adjust to be long enough to carry messenger-style and I would like it to be a little more gender neutral. The navy, blue, and red looks very boyish and I have a little girl. Still, I did not plan to wear it messenger style anyway (just think it would be nice to have the option) and the gender neutrality thing is not all that big of a deal to me.Overall, I really like this bag. I will post some pictures so you can see for yourself. (I noticed this product was lacking in good images)
