I bought this bedding set and accessories over two years ago, and after numerous washes and being dragged around the house, it still looks great.  The fabric is sturdy and never faded, and it looks even prettier in person than in the picture.  My daughter likes it so much that I'm going to use the fabric to make a quilt to fit her "big girl" bed.  The only negative about this set was the dust ruffle.  It was more of a sheer than cotton/twill like the rest of the bedding.  However, it made it through two years without any tears or snags.  Also, a caution for those who are going to purchase an extra valance.  If you have two windows or an over-sized window and need two valances, beware.  The dye lots can vary quite a bit between each valance.
