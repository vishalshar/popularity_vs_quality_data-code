Love that this mirror is adjustable. The fire department recommended against the type of mirror that sits directly in front of the baby as it is a safety hazard. This one is great because I can attach it to the seat next to the baby and still see her. Makes it easier for her to see me too, which has kept her calmer on a lot of car trips. The mirror attaches easily and securely with two straps.
