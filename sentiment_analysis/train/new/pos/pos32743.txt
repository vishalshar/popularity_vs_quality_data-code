The picture depicts the waste basket very accurately. The colors are just as seen in the picture. It's very pretty. Make sure to line the waste basket with a plastic bag/trash bag so as not to discolor the trash can. We've had it for 16 months and it looks just as it did when we first got it. It complements the colors in my baby's room perfectly! A very decorative piece. I have it strategically placed so everyone can see it. The only con is that all the trash is visible (tempting the baby to play with the trash), but then again, that's what one gets with an open waste basket (therefore no starts taken off for that).
