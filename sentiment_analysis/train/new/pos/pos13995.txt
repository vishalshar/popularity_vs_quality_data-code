I purchased this sleep suit after a gleaming recommendation from a friend.  I had high hopes for the suit to work as my son was up every 1-2 hours for 6 months.  I read reviews and the overall consensus was very positive.  Unfortunately the suit was not a big hit with my son.  He never liked to be swaddled and I think for him, the suit felt too restrictive just as the swaddle was too restrictive for him from the day he was born.  I contacted the company to return the item and they did give me a full refund.  I do appreciate their customer service and I would purchase from them again, just not this sleep suit.
