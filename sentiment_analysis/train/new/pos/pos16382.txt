I purchased this because I wanted something to match our little girl's bedroom and something that also had lights that would shine on the ceiling. The lights on the ceiling are nice, but not as extensive as I thought they might be. I don't quite understand why there is a pink "skirt" around the top of the mobile- we removed it so our daughter could see the lights on the ceiling. The remote is very nice. The music is good, but it just repeats the same song over and over again until you manually switch it- it would be nice if it cycled through the songs, I think. The mobile runs for about 10 minutes, then fades in and out for about a minute before it turns off, which I think is genius.
