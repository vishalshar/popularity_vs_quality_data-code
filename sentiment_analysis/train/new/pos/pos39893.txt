Because our home has composite tile floors on which our toddler knocked his head a number of times to our great distress, we decided to purchase two (2) different-style head protectors (in case one didn't work well, odds were that the other would likely suffice).The soft cloth helmet, which I am now rating, cost approximately $15 USD (if my recollection serves me), while the other cost approximately $52 USD.Although the less expensive unit looks amusingly like a diaper on our son's head -- compared to the other, more expensive and stylish "motorcyle officer" type helmet -- through many hours in action and countless knocks minimized, we conclude that both helmets serve their purpose equally well.Beside price, the only effective difference we note is that the less expensive model offers better ventilation / cooling properties than does the more expensive one. This is important to us to preclude overheating of our little man's yet immature cooling system.We very much like both models, however for both price and functionality, we find that the less expensive unit offers the superior value.
