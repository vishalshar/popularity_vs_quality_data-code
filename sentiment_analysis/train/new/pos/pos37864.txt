The bundleme is a must for any mom. It works so well! It really does eliminate the need for coats or even jackets. The first time I used it I thought my daughter might get a little chilly on the top half so I put a jacket on her. As soon as I was indoors and took her out of the bundleme I saw that she was too warm. She was actually sweating. Ever since then I use it without anything else and she stays very warm and cozy. We have lots of snow and cold winters where I live and the bundleme original was perfect. No more fussing with a blanket that gets kicked off the moment your baby is in the back seat of the car. The top piece also has the option to zip all the way off so if it's the only part that needs washed you don't have to take the straps out of the bottom piece. You can also unzip both sides to keep from over heating your baby if you'll be indoors for a short period of time. I think that every mom should have one and I would definitely buy one again.
