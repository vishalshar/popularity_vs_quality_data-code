I was rather disappointed to find that the whale will not fit my spigot, so I decided (since not finding any reviews with measurement reports) that I would relay measurements (my spigot is 9-1/4" circumference, which is just too big):The internal-clearance measurement of the whale (from the strap slots) is right at 5".The strap (directly inside of the whale) is just over 2-3/4".I don't believe a spigot measuring in excess of 7-3/4" (total circumference) will accommodate this whale.I hope this helps to prevent anyone from making the same mistake that I did!
