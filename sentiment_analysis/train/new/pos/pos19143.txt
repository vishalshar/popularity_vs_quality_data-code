We've tried probably 5 or 6 different kinds of sunshades, and this has been the last stop on our search.  The suction cups didn't want to work again after I pulled them off the first time, but I don't even bother with them anymore.  The metal inner framework of the shade is bendable and springy enough that I can just pop it right into the window frame and it doesn't move.  This also makes it easier to move it all the way to the right or left of the window depending on how the sun is coming in, since it's not as wide as the window.  It also doesn't weigh anything, unlike the pull down shades that would really hurt a kid if the suction cups came loose after hitting a pot hole or a bump, so even if this were to ever fall while driving it would be inconsequential.  Come to think of it, I may as well just snip those suction cups right off...
