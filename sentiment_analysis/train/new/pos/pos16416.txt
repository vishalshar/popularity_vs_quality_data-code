I think that this mirror is wonderful.  I can't imagine not being able to see my baby in the car now that I have it.  It's large and easy to install.  It does occasional get misalligned it you hit a big bump in the road but it is so easy to adjust and so large that it isn't a problem for me at all.  My son loves looking at himself in the mirror too.  The remote's clip does not allow installation on my visor but this too isn't a problem for me.  The lights aren't really bright enough to be seen during the day but are great at night when my son can't see himself in the mirror or look out the window.  The animals come into view in a soothing and captivating sequence.  I don't use the music often but relative to other toys, the music is no more or less annoying.  I do think that the lights tend to eat battery time but I expected as much.  I looked at other products and believe that this one is the best one available from BabiesRUs.
