I purchased an extra base for my son's daycare provider to install in her van.  It gives me a lot of peace of mind to know that my son is as safe as can be when riding in the car.  Also, my daycare provider appreciates the ease of just clicking him in and out without having to thread the seatbelt through the seat every time.
