We bought this for our first daughter and absolutely love it! One of the key reasons we got this vs other high chairs was the idea that it grows with your child. For that reason, I personally wanted to see good quality and build so that it could last as long as my child needed it. Stokke definitely delivered. A bonus, that I never thought to consider before owning the product, is that it is really easy to clean. After plenty of messy meals, that is more important than I realized!
