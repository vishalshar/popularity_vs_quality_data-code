This set is so cute!  I bought them for my daughters' room and they are perfect!  The comforter and the top sheet have fitted bottoms which keep it on at night (especially if your kids move when they sleep like mine do).  I've been thrilled with this purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat!  My oldest daughter had a comforter that was really thick and would never stay on.  This one is a bit lighter but it's perfect for my daughters who tend to get super hot when they sleep.
