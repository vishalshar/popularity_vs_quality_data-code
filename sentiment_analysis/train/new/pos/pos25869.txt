I just received this bag....if you can still get it, I highly recommend it. It was out of stock for awhile. I then contacted the Kalencom Corp directly and was told it was no longer made but is still available in some Babies R Us stores. In any case, Amazon e-mailed me when it was available again. So, don't wait too long if you are thinking of getting this bag.The bag is very stylish looking! Nobody would think it was a diaper bag and yet it has so many good sized compartments on the outside. You cannot tell from the picture but each end of the  diaper bag has a bottle/sippy cup holder. The side that is shown in the picture has a little pocket. The other side that is not shown, has 2 large pockets. Great for accessabilty. The inside has two large pouches that are perfect for holding diapers. Holds up to 6 diapers and cream comfortably. The change pad included is good and doesn't take up much room in the bag. There is also a clear bag for storing snacks or whatever you'd like. The rest of the bag's interior is just open. I would have liked a zipper pocket on the inside but it will still suit my needs without. Oh, and anyone would look at this bag and think it was leather. It is really nice and looks easy to wipe down.I highly recommend it. I havent' seen any this nice in the stores.
