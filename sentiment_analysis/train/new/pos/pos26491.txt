I've had this stroller now about a month.  I really love the colors and its super cute.  I would recommend this to anyone but there are a few things I don't like about it, so I want to share them so new consumers considering this one will know about it.  First this stroller is one inch narrower then your standard umbrella stroller.  It does fit a bit tighter, and my daughter is 15 months old, but a pretty petite little girl, and still I notice the difference.  She doesn't seem to lay back in this one, she seems to sit up and hold herself up.  This one does sit higher than the standard kind, and they don''t slouch into it either.  I do wish it was a bit wider, because in winter with a heavy coat she would be smooshed(sp?).  The other dislike is that the canopy touches the wheels when it's closed.  I already have dirty marks on the inside of the canopy, I'm not sure if it will come clean either.  Plus you can see it from the front.  That is what bothers me most.  Overall I am really happy with this stroller.  My favorites, are the cargo bags on this side.  I'm able to fit a travel container of wipes and a diaper or two, her sippy cup and snacks.  That is really nice!  Also I like the "shocks" in the wheels, it makes the ride smoother.  The part you can pull up for warmer weather I haven't used yet, but I'm sure its nice.  I am also able to push this stroller with only one hand, and the stroller itself is a little bit taller than a standard, so it should help with people a littler taller (I'm only 5'3).  Oh and I like the fact that it reclines, although my daughter doesn't use it at all, and I like the cup holder too.  Well I hope this review has been helpful!!
