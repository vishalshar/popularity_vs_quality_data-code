I was one of those Moms that probably read all of the sippy straw cup reviews on every cup offered.  Not to mention we tried at least 6 different brands of straw cups.  And while we thought each time we'd found, "the one", there was always an eventual flaw.  Parents...this is THE ONE.  Look no further.  I assure you that if you close this correctly (listen for the "click"), this cup will NOT leak.  This was professionally tested by an active 2-year-old boy. ;)  We also tested to see if it was difficult to get water out through the straw (as this often frustrates kids with cups that claim not to leak), but the water flow was just right.  My son has turned these upside down and shaken them, chucked them half way across the room, etc. - no water leaking out.  Have I made myself clear?  Haha.  We bought 6 of these and threw all our other cups away.  One note: we use these only for water.  For milk we use the Take n' Toss cups.  This is because I feel that with any of the straw cups with gaskets, and parts, you never get all the milk residue out.  Ick.  The Take n' Toss cups are best for milk because you know they're cleaned out.  But we only let our son use those supervised because he can easily tip them upside down and get milk running out the straw, etc.  Hope that helps out!
