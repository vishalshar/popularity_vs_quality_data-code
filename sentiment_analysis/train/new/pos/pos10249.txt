The other reviewer may not have reviewed the correct item as I have these double-sided wipes, and the logo is on the fleece (whiter) side just as pictured.  They do tend to curl just a little, but because these are double-sided with cotton on one side, fleece on the other, the thickness prevents them from curling too much.  They are the softest wipes.  We use them primarily for wiping the mouth after the baby is done eating food, but we wet them first.  The cotton side wipes up any food effectively, and the fleece side wipes up the wetness since that side stays dry.  The fleece side is so soft that we also use them to wipe the baby's runny nose when she is sick.  Beats using tissues and napkins any day, even for myself.Update:  I had been looking for something to wipe my eye makeup off at night.  I looked at Q-tips and cotton balls, but they cost too much to keep buying and they also fray.  I looked at reusable cloth makeup wipes, but wasn't sure if they would be soft enough for the delicate skin around the eyes.  It hit me one day that I could just use these FuzziBunz wipes!  I don't use an eye makeup remover because of the chemicals, and vaseline was just too greasy.  Perfect solution: unscented lotion.  The kind I use is with simple, truly natural ingredients (Poofy Organics).  I wet the towel, put the lotion on the fleece side, and wipe!  It works wonderfully.Another update - 2014:  I bought this set again to add to my stash, only to realize that the cotton is no longer organic.  You can really tell the difference in absorption level.  The new non-organic cotton takes so many washes before it's absorbent.  I even verified it with FuzziBunz that the cotton is no longer organic because the quality difference puzzled me after the purchase.  I don't understand why they stopped making it in organic cotton.  In conclusion, I would say that they are soft, but only after numerous washes, literally.
