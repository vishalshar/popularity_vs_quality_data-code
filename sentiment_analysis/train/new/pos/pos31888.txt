Other reviews mention this product is too large for a newborn.  It is.  For newborn photos though, fit doesn't really matter.  i ordered this thinking it was a very decent price, especially with free shipping.  Lost in translation, is that you get the set:  the hat and the diaper cover, so it's a fantastic price.  These are made individually and the one i received does not look exactly like in the product photo--it has white mixed into the braids and ear tufts instead of yellow and the beak is orange.  The crafter also put a pink pom-pom puff on the back of the diaper cover (owls don't have bunny tails silly) but it was easily removed without damaging the piece.  The estimated shipping date was nearly a month (it shipped from Singapore to WA state) but i received it in eleven days.  The overall quality is good and the price is phenomenal.
