We purchased this seat for our son who is due December 24th, it arrived very promptly and I am beyond pleased. It is by far the most comfortable and padded car seat I have ever felt. It beats the comfort level of Britax and Chicco which are very high dollar brands. I love the level indicator on the side as i've always had a hard time making sure I get the correct recline level, this feature eliminates that worry. I also like how the handle has a small circle that will show green when it is locked and in place for carrying or will show red when it isn't locked. I sat our 13 month old son in this and he could easily be riding in this if we wanted him to! He is 29in and 23lb and looked very comfortable in the seat. I am very happy about this as it makes me realize this was a great investment since our new little one will be able to use the seat until he's well over a year old!
