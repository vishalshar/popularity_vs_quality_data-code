I am a diaper bag snob. When my daughter was first born I thought, "A bag is a bag" and then I quickly realized how important having the right diaper bag is (to me at least). Subsequently I became obsessed with all things Ju Ju Be and Petunia Pickle Bottom. I have owned and resold many different bags and loved them all along the way, so I know my stuff pretty good. I dismissed the Skip Hop bags I saw because I considered them to be a step down in features/quality. When I saw another mom with this bag I knew I had to give Skip Hop a try. I'm very glad I did.Pros:10 out of 10 for appearance. Gold hardware, folded handles, just gorgeous.Huge bottle pockets (I think they're insulated, not sure)Cell phone pocket (It's not felt lined, but hey)Built in stroller clips (money and time saver)Bonus pocket in handle can fit a notebook or tablet without taking up space in the bag.Two ways to carry, handles (it's tricky to get them over your shoulder one handed though) and a messenger strap that can be tucked away when not in use.Metal feet on the bottom to keep it out of yucky situationsIt's nice and big. We cloth diaper and I still have plenty of room to spare. It could easily accommodate multiple children.Cons:The polyester material making up the majority of the bag is not my favorite, it doesn't take away from the appearance of the bag but makes it feel a little cheap.I wish there was a button or magnetic closure for the change pad pocketI also wish there was a key fob to organize my keys, once you get used to having one in your bag it's hard to go backThe interior organization pocket situation is good, not great, they really could have stuck a few more in there.Price, because of the issues I have with the materials used and lack of special features I think this bag should cost about $20-$30 less than it's listed for. (I paid $100)Overall I think this is a great bag and I will have to give Skip Hop more consideration in the future.
