I really like this stroller! I looked around for a long time to find what I wanted, and this looked the best for my budget. A lot of the reviews complained about the weight, and it is a little heavy. However, the way it folds makes it possible to tilt it a little and push it like a moving dolly, so I only have to lift it into the car and not carry it. Once folded, it fits perfectly in my Subaru Forester. The tires came inflated, though I did have to pump them a little using a hand-operated bike pump, which only took 5 minutes. It was easy to assemble, I did it myself in about 15 minutes so if you are assembly savvy it would take less time. The colors are great, and the materials are good quality. My daughter loves to ride in it! She is only 14 months, but my sister has the same model and her three year old rides perfectly with much longer legs. I also love that the storage compartment on the handle has a closeable section so items won't fall out. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the shade canopy. For some reason, mine does not stay fully extended. It doesn't fold up completely, just a few inches, but it bugs me. I have only used it for walking so far, and I'm afraid I will have to tether it somehow when I am running. I have another Graco stroller that does not have this problem, so it might just be a defect in mine. It would not keep me from buying this stroller again, but it is something to consider. Overall, I love the stroller and would recommend it!
