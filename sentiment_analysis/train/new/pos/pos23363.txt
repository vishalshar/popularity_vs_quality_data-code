Nice brightly colored bowls, handy size. Sticky bottom keeps them put when baby's trying to get a spoon in, and they're a nice height so that he can see whats in them and get to the food easily. Grippy bottom also allows him to bang the edge without them flipping like a bowl would. HOWEVER my 1 year old has no problem picking them up. Awkwardakly shaped bottom means they take up a lot of storage space.
