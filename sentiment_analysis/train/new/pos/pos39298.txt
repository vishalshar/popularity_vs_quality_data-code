My ten-month-old daughter refused to use her toddler tub, so we decided one night to use the regular bath.  *Big mistake.*  she tried walking and slipped all over.  When we tried to take her out and abort the bath, she started screaming, as she loves bath time.  This mat, combined with a faucet cover, has made all the difference.  The mat is the full length of the bath, and our daughter has not slipped once.  It has made bath time fun and safe.  As a bonus, she now has such a good time in the bath, she actually sits in it sometimes, rather than trying to walk.The one thing I would note, as previous reviews have, is that it's absolutely critical to dry out the mat after each use, or otherwise it will get moldy.
