This is the perfect size to cover the mattress of the hotel crib. We always bring a play yard with us when we travel, but we prefer hotel cribs when available since it's more convenient to use theirs. However, the hotels we've been to have never supplied a crib sheet for the mattress. This one fits perfectly and has been a must-have travel accessory for us.We have also used this on three different play yards (one from Baby Trend, one newer Graco, one older Graco) and it fit all three perfectly. The Baby Trend had really thin padding so you could feel the seams between boards, but this sheet added just enough cushion to make it comfortable for our kid.As for durability, we have had zero issues. I throw it in with the rest of my laundry (except towels) and have had no problems whatsoever.
