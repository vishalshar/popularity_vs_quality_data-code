This is a nice stroller toy. I really like that it has chimes. Many of the other stroller toys I have for my daughter have bells and the chimes are much nicer to my ears! The owl design is cute and exactly as pictured. That is really all there is to this toy - there is no motion, no lights, etc. if you are looking for a simple plush stroller toy with a nice sound, then this is the toy for you.
