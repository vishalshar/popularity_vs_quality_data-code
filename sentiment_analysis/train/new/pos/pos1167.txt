Bought this for my daughter who outgrew her Britax Roundabout car seat. Though you can get cheaper boosters I decided to stick with the Britax brand and pay a little more for the quality.Some notable features:  - Both the back and seat covers can be removed and machine washed.  - Good fabric and padding more substantial than budget boosters. Important for those long car trips.  - SGL (L = Latch) model has latch which prevents seat from moving. I recently bought a second Parkway but the SG model w/o latch since the middle seat doesn't have available latch anchors. Will update if it makes a difference or not.  - Has SecureGuard clip to prevent child from going under the seat belt. It sits comfortably between child's legs and slides over the lap belt essentially making it a three point lap belt.  - Daughter loves Tango color and the two cup holders. She lets her younger brother use the spare one.  - Seat back was easily assembled and can be removed when child outgrows it.  - Seat back can recline to same angle as my car's back seat since one of my concerns was how my daughter would sleep comfortably on long car rides if the angle is too upright. Of course there are safe limits that you should follow which are illustrated in the manual.  - Seat back height can be easily adjusted. Their ears should be below the top of the back and centered on the head rest.  - There are guides (in easily identifiable bright red) where the seat belt should go through. The top guide you only have to loop through once and the bottom guide is where the lap shoulder belt should touch before you click in. Important aspect here is my daughter can buckle herself in easily and properly.
