I really like this product overall.  I didn't worry about my kids playing with it at all as the paint was all natural.  The size of the items was just right and my kids have loved playing with these over the years.  My only real complaint is that the one maraca did break at the seam and I needed to re-glue it together.  Fortunately, none of my kids were hurt in the process of it breaking.  The paint did chip away at the seam of the other one as well, however, it has not yet broken.  The triangle rope holder also comes off easily and has been "lost" several times in our house.  That said, it easily slides back on.  The drum also got a hole poked in it shortly after purchase, which was very irritating to me, but this was an issue of my kids not knowing how to properly use it.  My kids tend to be really good with their toys, and this set, while I love it, isn't terribly durable.  However, out of all the options that exist out there, I feel this one is the best regarding safety for my kids (paint, etc.) and I feel like it would be as durable if not MORE durable than something made by Melissa and Doug for instance.
