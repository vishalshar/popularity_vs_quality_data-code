I purchased this item (the green Croc in Socks) as a gift for a friend's baby shower. The plush is very soft and has a rattler inside; it seems to be constructed nicely. The socks that come with the plush are cute and feel very durable and thick, with rubber traction dots on each pair. I think the size of the plush is decent, considering it is meant for an infant (it sits about 9.5 - 10 inches tall). Overall, a good value and a unique gift.
