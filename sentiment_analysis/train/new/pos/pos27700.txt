Top quality. It is absolutely wonderful. The comforter is super soft and surprising thick! Its unlike any lower quality character set you would find in a store. I love that's its a solid so it will go with any theme and I can mix and match soft and fun sheets. This will no doubt last until we transition to a twin bed. Worth every single penny! I was hesitant when I saw the price on the green but when I switched to pink it was more my price range and I went ahead. I'm so glad, no regrets . I'm ordering a second set for my 4 month old immediately and setting it aside.Oh and the very best part, my daughter LOVES it. She's 20 months and runs her right hand back and forth on the comforter as she drifts to sleep.
