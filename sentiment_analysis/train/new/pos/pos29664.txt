My daughter was getting to big for her infant seat sooner then I expected.  I shopped around for a cheap " big girl " seat for her. Most of the ones I had seen priced above my budget. I found this one at Amazon, and loved the color and design. Its not very expensive,  Its lightweight. Easy to move. And my daughter can fall asleep in it without hurting her neck. I love that this comes with extra wide sides so the child can lean against it like a pillow.  This is a must- have for any little princess in your life!
