I bought 2 of these Cloud B light turtles. The first one was the original tortoise colored one that projects the starry night sky. The second one was the Tranquil turtle. And between the two, I would have to say the ocean one is my favorite. Originally I ordered the purple tranquil turtle for my daughter because purple is her favorite color, but I was pleasantly surprised at how different and better-in my opinion- it is. The major differences between the this turtle and the original are:1. The tranquil turtle doesn't project stars, it projects wavy "underwater" currents all over the room. The nice thing about this feature is that you have the option to set the waves to still or moving, both which are very relaxing to look at.2. The music option is a must for us. The 2 choices are soft ocean waves sound and gentle music. And there's a volume control! There is also an option for no sound, which is great as well.3. The light has a dimmer feature, so you can make it brighter or less so depending on your needs.4. The auto shut off timer is only 23 minutes, unlike 23 and 45 min like other Cloud B soothers we have. Wish it went to 45 min, but perhaps it would eat up too much battery that way. Still 23 minutes is a good amount of time for most kids to fall asleep.5. It is just a tad smaller than the original, but it is so cute in person. The purple velour is so soft and plush, and I love the way it looks.
