This are not fully waterproof but they will hold some carrots through the lunch hour. By the end of the day they are drying out though.  I don't think it's really possible to get a waterproof container that is fabric unless you have some vinyl or pvc coating in it, so keep that in mind when the carrots are drying out. ;)I've had these for probably 4 years now and they are still going strong.  I wash them with the kids laundry on a regular basis. Holding up very well considering the use.I wish they were a little bigger because it is a bit hard to get your adult hand it or to dump snacks into the opening.  But still, over all a great product.
