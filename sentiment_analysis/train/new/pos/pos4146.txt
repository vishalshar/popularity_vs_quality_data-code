These are the identical bottles that you get with the Medela symphony pump so they work perfectly with my pump parts. They are easily screwed onto the flag and attachment piece and have a good seal on them to give help you get good suction. They come with cap lids that screw on tightly creating a good air tight seal to help keep your milk fresh. They can be frozen in the refrigerator with milk in them for milk storage but they are a thin plastic so if you do freeze your milk in them be very careful as they can crack if dropped. Other than that I like these bottles as the numbers are not colored or drawn on to the bottle they are actually molded I tot he bottle so the number will not scratched or fade off of your bottle. All around I am very happy with these they have been great I have had no issues or problems with them. I do recommend sanitizing them as soon as you get them as they are not in a sanitized bag when they come to you. They have to be washed first before use as well. these are exactly what I was expecting and are accurately described in the provided description and photos.
