I bought this highchair after I returned the Fisher Price luv u zoo chair and it is definitely better. The Fisher Price was too small and would outgrow more quickly and it didn't have a lot of things the Graco seat offered.The Graco gives more room to grow and more space to seat your child. The snack tray is a must! When your child is still a baby and not feeding themselves, they don't want a huge tray in front of them. A small snack tray to lay out finger foods is what you need. Plus clean up is minimal. When they get older, then the larger tray is used when they start to feed themselves. One review complained about how hard it was to remove the trays with a squirmy child. But that is not true. First of all, the snack tray can stay installed and you can pull your child out. Or if your complaint is that your child is too big, then removing the snack tray is a breeze. Super easy snap off. If you used the larger tray, that is also an easy move. One handed snap off as well. REMEMBER: your child is locked in with the 5 point harness. If you wanted to use 2 hands to move the tray, you could too! Your squirmy child can not fall because they are locked in with their seatbelt. So don't let some reviews scare you. Keep your child locked with the seat belt and then remove the trays as needed. Then unbuckle your child and they are out! Easy as 1-2-3.Pros:- installing the highchair was super easy. Only 2 screws and the rest was just snapping the parts into its place.- snack tray is a plus- adjustable foot rest (very important to keep your child comfortable so they can sit longer)- wipeable fabric and machine washable- 3 recline positions (Although we didn't use this feature)- folds nicely to save spaceCons:- wish they had better color selectionsOverall great buy and would recommend it better than a Fisher Price highchair.Graco is the better brand for kid products/furniture and Fisher Price to me is better for "toy" products.
