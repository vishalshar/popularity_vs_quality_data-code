Our baby loves this puppet and that's why I gave it a 5 star. It's the first puppet we have purchased but it seems well built. It doesn't fit my hand great but it fits my husbands better. I think it might be better if it had a cinched down bottom that fit more snugly over the wrist, more like a cuff. Other than that, we have no complaints and the delightful squeals from our daughter are worth any downfall.
