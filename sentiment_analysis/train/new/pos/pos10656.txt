This bedding set is absolutely gorgeous, in fact it is nicer than I expected. The set is actually a very pretty green (which is soft like micro-suede) and tan with beautiful embroidery! I was surprised at how small the bag was that everything is stuffed into... but actually all the pieces are perfectly sized and very nice. The pillow is cute and pretty small -so it will probably be just a fun decoration, and like other people have said, the "bib" is nothing to write home about - but what bib is? I found the diaper stacker sits perfectly if you place a 7"X11" piece of cardboard in the bottom of it... which is really NOT that big of a deal to do! For the price this is an AWESOME bargain!To those who have complained about the bedding "falling apart in the wash" I think the problem may lie in that some of the pieces need to be hand washed (comforter, bumper, and pillow if I remember correctly) and the other pieces are washed in cold. Luckily I have a washer that has a specific "hand wash" cycle... so that isn't a problem. Reading those little tags is worth the effort!Anyways... I am VERY happy with this adorable set and I cannot wait for my baby to be born so he or she can use it!!!
