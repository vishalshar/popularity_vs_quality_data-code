I LOVE this thing. It's so warm and my daughter kicks her feet and giggles every time we go for a walk. The zipper will unzip all the way and come off..but it's not broke it reattaches like any other zipper. It also fits the stroller well with out taking off the canopy l..it does not have to have the back strap attached. It doesn't or slip when theirs a child in it.
