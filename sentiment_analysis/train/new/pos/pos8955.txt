We put this on our coffee table to protect the little one.  While we haven't 'tested' it with him falling on the table yet (and we hope we never really do), it is a great way to cover the table without having to use adhesive products.  It also has protected the table from a spell from his bottle.  It is very fun and colorful.  I look forward to him using it as a play table in the future!
