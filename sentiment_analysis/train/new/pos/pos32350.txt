The cups are leakproof for me, somehow my son has just about mastered spilling from all spill proof cups.  It's his goal (at nearly 2) and he sometimes can accomplish this feat.  The colors are not neutral in my opinion, the blue/yellow/PINK is very pink.  The other cup is neutral.  I have assembled the yellow/pink lid with the yellow cup and the orange/green lid  with the blue cup so my kids (girl and boy) can have an appropriate gender cup - I just prefer neutral colors so I can grab and go.  You may not mind but the pink really stands out and he gives it to his sister because she likes pink...
