My review is plain and simple - - - This product is fantastic. We are in the middle of a remodel of our house and only have access to 1 bathroom. Unfortunately, this bathroom only has a shower and no tub. Our little one-year-old had out grown the small baby tubs and we needed something quick, fast, and in a hurry. We gave the Flexibath a try. Turns out our first shot was a bullseye! This tub has been a life saver for us. Its a perfect size. Our little one is almost 2 years old and he still fits in it WITH room to spare! This is probably one of the greatest (and most affordable) baby gear investments we've made. We are almost at the year mark with it and the rubber joints haven't torn or leaked at all. I was a little concerned in the beginning that those joints would be a problem but they really have held up. The only complaint (hence the 4 out of 5 stars) is the clip that holds the unit folded when stored - - - It can be a little bit of a scratching hazard for the child when bathing. I've actually placed a scrap rubber piece over it myself. Would be amazing if the manufacturer at least covered the latch in silicon or rubber. Otherwise this is a great product.
