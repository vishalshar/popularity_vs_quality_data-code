The measurement markings are accurate. The bags are made of a soft plastic which makes it easy to open, fill, close, store, defrost, and pour out of the bags. The zipper is easy to close, but seals tightly. I appreciate the perforated edge so that I don't have to use scissors to open a bag for the first time. I will never buy another brand!
