Unfortunately we are dealing with reflux in our household, and our baby spits up all the time. These sheet savers are so much more convenient than constantly changing sheets. I'm actually back to purchase another set, because we are constantly washing the two that we already have. The fabric is really soft, they keep the sheet underneath dry (unless you have a really big spit up and let it sit too long), and these fit the crib well. They wash very well. Wish I had known about these when I had my first son.
