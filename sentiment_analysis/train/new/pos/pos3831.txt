Vinyl Free Waterproof Pad, November 30, 2008I bought a set of these pads and now I'm buying another. They are just so useful. I use them under my baby (who was a premie as is now 9 weeks and 9 lbs) all the time, whether on the bed, on the couch, or anywhere else I'm worried about spitup or other accidents. I'm also going to get some bigger ones for when he grows, but I still want more in this size because they're so handy.I was looking for a waterproof pad that was not vinyl, partly because I can't stand the smell of vinyl and partly because it makes my baby sweat. These are perfect.Pros:- Waterproof- Lightly quilted, which my little guy likes, and the padding absorbs liquid really well - so well that sometimes I have to feel twice to check if it's really wet.- Easy care: I throw them in the washer and dryer, and they've been washed dozens of times already and are holding up well.Cons:- The organic flannel fabric does pill, so if you're really adverse to pilling these might drive you nuts, but for me their usefulness outweighs this con by far.
