The colors are very hard to find for nurseries and it was just what we wanted!  We also live in Southern Florida, so it is the perfect thickness for our winter weather or air conditioned rooms.  It is large enough for the crib and snuggling, but probably too big for a swaddle.  It came quickly and we ordered the changing pad covers that match.  Love it all!
