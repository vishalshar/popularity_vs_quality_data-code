Tiny! We bought this along with at least 20 other bottles in the hopes that our breastfed baby would take a bottle. The nipple on this one is very small, but very firm. I feel like if it had been softer she would have taken this one. But of course my little one refused each and every bottle offered.Now a couple years later my little one adores this tiny bottle! She uses it to feed her dolls, because it's so tiny it's the perfect size for some of her baby dolls. Overall I'm happy I got this, it's getting lots of use as a pretend bottle!
