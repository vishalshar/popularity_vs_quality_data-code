Im only giving 5 stars due to the low price of $5.50 for the set. ONLY buy these if you dont need the dividers inside each box. The actual oblong boxes collapse/ fold out, but then youll find cheap fabric shoved in a ball inside each box... Upon unfolding youll see what's supposed to be the insert for each bin. They're so cheap and wrinkled and poorly made I don't think you COULD ever use them... its not possible. Also the insert is an inch taller than the bins so that just adds to the awfulness that is the inserts....The actual bins are great though! I used the long one for one long row of diapers and the small one for baby powder, desitin, baby lotion, etc., etc. If you're like me and could care less about the dividing insert thats shown, then i highly recommend so long as Amazon is offering for under $6. I am usie mine on the shelfs on the side of my babies crib/changing table combo. Due to the differences in length of these two bins I actually ordered another set si that I could use the two shorter ones on the top shelf and the two long ones on the bottom. They fit perfectly.
