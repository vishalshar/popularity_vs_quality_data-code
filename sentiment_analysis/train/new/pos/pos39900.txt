We initially bought 2 of the Evenflo Triumph (one for each car) based on its excellent performance in crash tests, good reviews in the Baby Bargains book and for the reason that it was much cheaper than the Britax ($220 for the Roundabout and $270 for the Marathon). We have been extremely disappointed with the Triumph with its difficulty to install.  (See my review of the Evenflo for more details). Basically,  IF you are installing it properly (most people are not...) so that there is no more than 1 inch of give, it must be installed by 2 people (one to kneel down on it and the other to click it into place) and the BIGGEST flaw is that it cannot be adjusted after it is fastened. So, you have to figure out the exact precise length before and then with all of your might, try to click it into place and hope that it's tight enough. There are other minor complaints we have about its quality (broken knob after 1 year and cheap backing that pulls off).  With our second baby on the way, we asked around and ended up buying the Britax Marathon (we spent the extra $50 for the extra height and weight it buys you but the Roundabout apparently performs just as well) and my husband and I laughed hysterically after we installed it in about 60 seconds with no problems. One person can install it alone because you can tighten the straps AFTER it is fastened. Bonus that we got to choose a fun print (Cowmooflage) that our son loves. My husband initially balked at the price but after the quick installation, he said it's worth every penny. We will be purchasing a second identical one. Unfortunately, we then moved the Triumph over to our less frequently used car and it took us a half hour to install...with sore fingers afterward to boot. If you can, I highly recommend the upgrade. I don't recommend ordering online through Babies R Us, though, as you can find them cheaper elsewhere (even in local independently owned stores) and/or most places ship for free (Babies R Us does not).
