It was a fun addition to the baby shower, I would definitely suggest this game to a future mommy to be. One note though is that when filling up the ice tray, the babies float to the top and sometimes fall out. In order to fully submerge them, fill the ice tray sections only halfway with the babies in them, let it freeze over, and then fill the rest up with water.
