I have a Graco high chair and Graco apparently does not make replacement covers for it. The cover that I had, had rips and tears in it after years of use, and I didn't want my little guy getting his legs pinched on the material. I looked up replacement covers and found that the NoJo covers worked as a substitute for the Graco. I took a chance and got the fire engine cover. I absolutely love it! It fits perfectly, and I can take it off easily to wash it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a replacement Graco high chair cover.
