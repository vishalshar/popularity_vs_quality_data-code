I purchased these frames for each of my children and have them in their rooms. Each has the first picture that was taken of them after being born, along with their hospital bracelet. I can't think of a nicer picture frame to give them. It's definitely a nice keepsake they will always have and look back on many years fromNow. I've also started buying these for all the expectant parents I know.
