I ordered this car seat adapter for use with my Chicco KeyFit30 car seat and my new 2012 BOB Revolution SE Duallie Stroller.  I could not be happier with how easy the system works.  No tools required to install, and I did not even need to reference the instruction manual - all I had to do was snap it into the stroller's accessory adapter.  It is important to me that the car seat actually CLICKS into the adapter so it is secure (versus just resting on a bar like others I've seen); with this system, it snaps in perfectly.  I also like that the stroller can still be folded as usual with the adapter on - though it is not difficult to remove or re-install it anyway.A few notes:- This adapter is only useful for parents who have ONE child in a car seat (i.e. not for twins / use with 2 car seats), as one side has a non-removable snack tray.- There is no choice as to which side of the stroller the car seat can be clipped in - it must be located on the right side (from the perspective of pushing the stroller), and cannot be changed to the left side.  This is not an issue for me specifically, but I thought it might be worth noting for those parents who prefer the car-seated child to be on a specific side.- Finally, it is important to note that this adapter is only compatible with BOB Duallie strollers manufactured after a certain date (I believe 2011 or later).  I learned this by referencing a chart on the BOBgear website, to make sure I was purchasing the correct system for my specific stroller: [...]Overall, I am very happy with the quality of this item, and the ease of use exceeded my expectations.  Highly recommend.
