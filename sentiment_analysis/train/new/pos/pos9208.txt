I have two children, a third on the way and we survive on one income, and a modest one. When my eldest was born I received a gift from my mother of a bundle of flat, simple cotton diapers. From there I've bought bamboo liners and a few snappi fasteners. I also bought the cheapest diaper covers I could get: vinyl and plastic covers. We were living in New York and didn't have a washer and dryer available conveniently in our apartment and so I had to hand wash my diapers every night and air dry them on a rack for the next day. It worked and we saved a lot of money.We have now moved to a proper house, in a different state and have a washer and dryer. We also have a little bit more money to spare so I bought these Bummis Pull Ons. My old vinyl and plastic ones were constantly falling apart at the seems and I was sewing them back together all the time on my machine, but finally I had enough and decided to try out these. Part of me wanted to splurge and go and blow $150 or more on those all-in-one or 2-in-one cloth diapers, but we already have so many flats and the system we have now works fine. But these new diaper covers I got have made my diapering experience SO MUCH better for so little investment.The Bummis Pull Ons retain much more moisture. The material is so much more well made than my plastic or vinyl's. It's soft and thick and sturdy.Also the smell stays locked in much better, which I appreciate.That's why I'm buying two more today.Also, this particular seller was very friendly. My original order was either stolen or lost at the post office and she immediately sent me a new pair, without argument. I thank her for that. That's another reason I'm ordering two more.God bless.
