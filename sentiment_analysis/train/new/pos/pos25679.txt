We bought this in August 2014 and it does have a cover that cab be removed to be washed, attached around the back with metal buttons. Obviously the company listened to earlier comments. It is what other reviewers say, lightweight and apart from expensive European bouncers, the only bouncer on the market with some aesthetic style, the rest being grotesque ideas of what baby items should look like. As another reviewer noted we're not using the toy bar.What it could do with is better sounding speakers (other reviewers have pointed this out), a vibrator with two settings - it seems fairly strong in it's single mode, and three settings for the chair recline instead of two. The headrest pillow could have been more padded to hold a small baby's head straight.Update 8/17/2014 - the batteries seem to last a fair amount of time, though we use that mode only for 5-10 minutes a day. What another reviewer pointed out as a noisy vibrate mode is probably the cheap plastic buttons vibrating in their sockets along with the bouncer, creating an irritating rattling noise. The way we fixed it was to fold small pieces of paper into two and slide them into the gaps between the buttons and their sockets. Now it vibrates silently and looks strange with the bits of papers sticking out so we'll figure out a neater way to do it.
