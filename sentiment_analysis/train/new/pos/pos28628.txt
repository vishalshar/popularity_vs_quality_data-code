What a great kit!! My husband and I just love the quality, material, and size of these decals. The price is well worth the value and quality. The decals are thick but if you are not careful they can tear. They were easy to apply, remove, and reposition on the wall and don't leave any residue on the wall. We didn't have any issues with them sticking and staying on the wall, however, we were very methodical in using the complimentary scrapper over each entire decal. The size of each decal is perfect and covers a wall or two very well. My daughter just loves her barnyard mural and it has added to our conversations, learning and understanding of animals and things on a farm. Definitely recommend this kit though I do have to mention that it took us about an hour or two to get all the decals up on the wall but then we were trying to ensure that the spacing and positioning was perfect. I am sure you could be a bit quicker.
