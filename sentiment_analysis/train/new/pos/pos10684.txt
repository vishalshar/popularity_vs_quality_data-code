We got this product when my younger daughter was about two months old.  It was a godsend.  Unlike her older sister, my little one hated riding in a stroller or carseat, or sitting in a swing or bouncy seat.  She had to be carried or she'd wail.  The only carrier we owned was a front carrier which had no back support and interfered with doing pretty much anything in front of you.  I ordered this one specifically because of the back position (in fact, I never used the front position).After a bit of a struggle, I learned to put it on in the back position by myself.  It helps to have a bed or other raised surface, then put the baby in the carrier and secure everything, then lean back and put your arms through the straps, lift and tighten the straps.  My daughter never liked the initial transition of getting onto my back, but once there, she was happy as a clam - she usually fell asleep almost immediately.  And with her on my back, I was able to do chores, take a walk or take the older one to the park and such like places.I also found the carrier to be comfortable to wear, even as my daughter got heavier.  I could usually wear it for about two hours at a time if needed.  The straps are wide and padded and the waist belt provides decent back support.My only criticism is that when my daughter would fall asleep, she would lean with her head far to the right - there wasn't much support to keep her upright.  Not too much of a problem, but I had to be careful going through doors without bumping her little head.  Eventually that leaning caused one of the clips on the right side to break as it could no longer take her weight.  She was eight months old and probably about 25 pounds by that time.Although it didn't last terribly long, it was invaluable while it lasted.  Good for babies about age 2 months through about 25 pounds or so.
