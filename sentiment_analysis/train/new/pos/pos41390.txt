My wife is an ER peds nurse and when she was pregnant, during her shower she got a pack of these. She looked at me and said "These are dumb, I know how to swaddle!". Well, the first night home, we used one of these, let's just say 4 weeks later we've NEVER swaddled our little one in a blanket. We even purchased more of these as well as a set for gifts.I think the best part of these are the at the 2am and 4am changes/feedings, you don't have to fight with a blanket, just slid them in the sack and velcro the thing closed, can be done in under 15 seconds and it won't come undone, regardless how much the little one moves.The fleece ones are really nice and warm and go good with normal cotton sleepers. We bought the cotton ones for when we put him in a fleece sleeper. This way the little one won't get too hot either way, yet is still swaddled.
