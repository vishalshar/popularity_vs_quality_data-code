These bags are a great deal. I use them for daycare for our twins and up to 10 sunbaby pocket diapers fit. I got two bags so we can wash every other day. The bags do take a very long time to hang dry so we throw them in the dryer with the liners and they've done fine so far. They are holding up well and worth the low price.
