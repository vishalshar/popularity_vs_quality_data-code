I have a queen bed,I even bought the king  size hoping it would be longer but it was not which was disappointing, but overall it's beautiful I have not hand any problems with anything comeing apart. I will definitely reorder it again, but the next time I do, I will purchase the california king set hopefully it will be longer. And if not it ,its not a big deal - it's so pretty that it makes up for it not being long like the picture shows.
