we bought one for the base of the stairs, then a few weeks later got one for the kitchen, then one for the hall. It's easy to set up and remove, low enough to step over (my wife and I are both tall), and doesn't mar the walls or woodwork.One tip -- once you get it dialed in, take a heavy black marker and put lines on either side of the correct notch. This will remove the guesswork for when you have to put it back up in a hurry.
