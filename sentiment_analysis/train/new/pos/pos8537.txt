I bought this for my newborn daughter, she's only 3 weeks old and she's always swinging her arms to hit the leaf that's hanging down beside her. She's not able to fully use it right now but I'm sure when she's about 4-6 months old she's going to love it. I bought this play mat because it's boxed in, so when she does start rolling she won't roll off of it like the other mats are. I LOVE IT
