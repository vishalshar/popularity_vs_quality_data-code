This is pretty neat little travel product. It fold down into a very manageable size and is light weight. My only wish is that it was a little bit larger as my baby girl outgrew it by the time she was 4.5 months old. I would recommend this product for someone travelling with an infant that is not older than 4 months. I would also note that if your infant is already very mobile (i.e. rolls and wiggles while sleeping), you might also want to look for something a little larger. Its a cool product if you need to travel with your baby and don't want to lug around a pack-n-play or other such sleeping arrangement.
