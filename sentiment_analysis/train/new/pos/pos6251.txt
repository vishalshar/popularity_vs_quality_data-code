My baby LOVES to watch this mobile!  I love that it has a 10 minute auto-off feature for music and motion--I start it when I'm changing my baby's diaper in her crib, and she stays entranced long enough for me to get some dishes or laundry done before the music stops =)  It was a more sure-fire distraction when she was a little younger, and now at 4.5 months she might only get 3-5 minutes of full fixation.  I like the two volume feature and I've used the lower one to play ocean sounds if my baby needs an extra distraction to help fall asleep.  I also like that it cycles through a variety of songs, so you're not listening to the same irritating tune for 10 minutes straight like some toys (and these songs are pleasantly arranged as well).  I'm coming up on my second battery change in three months, but we use it daily and often for the full 10 minutes at a time.  When the batteries are low the music will play but the motion will stop (but I'm also using cheapo batteries).  Hoping that this baby continues to enjoy it and that once she loses interest it'll last for baby #2!
