My 4-month old daughter loves this pinwheel. It's soft, has no sharp edges, and keeps her entertained in her car seat for 20-30 minutes at a time. The bottom straps actually come in very handy at times -- I've secured it to the handle of the car seat when it's in the carrier position, which is perfect when sitting in a restaurant booth, to let the pinwheel spin. She grasps the stem very easily and loves to gum the leaves of it. Nice small rattling sound from the center of the pinwheel as well.
