I first saw this pillow in a gift shop on a trip to the zoo and liked it because of it's size.  My husband had bought a pillow pet, but it was just too large for a 19 month old.  The first time she layed down with the cloud b pillow for a nap she slept for 2 hours, we usually only get 1 hour.  We just thought, well she's tired, we had a busy day.  I joked with husband that it had to be the pillow.  First night, slept all night, I joked with my husband again, "It has to be the pillow"  This is the fourth night with the pillow and I have been very pleasantly surprized.  We are usually awakened at 1 am and/or 5 am by a fussy baby, but the last few nights with this pillow, she has actually stayed asleep till 730 or 830 in the morning.  She did wake up twice around 10 or 11 pm, but was not fussy and went back to sleep very, very quickly. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I wouldn't trade this pillow.  The nights before this pillow arrived she fussed and didn't want to go to sleep, and has always hated being in her bed.  Last night, with the pillow, she went to bed calmly and actually layed herself down and went to sleep.  Such a change for the better.  I need one for myself because I keep waking up at 5 am wondering if she's okay because she has been too quiet. :) Love it!
