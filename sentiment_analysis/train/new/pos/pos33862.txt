I've bought other designs at a much better price. Otherwise, I love the MAM bottles. They are easier to clean and assemble than many of the other brands with venting systems. I also like the size. My baby drinks 5.5 - 6oz, so these are perfect. They aren't as wide as Tommee Tippee 5oz, or as tall as Dr. Brown's 8oz, which means they fit easily in various cup holders and bottle bags. They also don't leak when traveling. I just wish they made a preemie nipple, as the extra slow flow is better for my breastfed baby. Also, these only have the design on one side of the bottles. Not a big deal, but it surprised me since another set I bought had the design on front and back.
