All i can say is yes to this cover. I travelled all over the place via plane taxi etc and these held up. I check my carseats with luggage so i needed something to protect them. These did it. Some scuffs from obvious mishandling but no tears or rips. The material isnt thin lile a gate bah, its thick with a little padding (not super thick but enough to protect from drops) It has a good handle on top which i used to put the carseats on and off carts and baggage claims and whatnot. Itll be cumbersome lugging around as any carseat is.. So i would just check them with baggage. Most carseats wont fit in plane seats so why bother lugging them about.I only took a star away because a set of backstraps would make it a heck of a lot easier to transport these around by hand.I have 2 graco carseats.. A 4 in one and a 3 in one.. Both fit fine
