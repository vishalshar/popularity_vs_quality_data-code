These Dappi covers are great, but they do run large. I bought both large and medium sizes. My 3 year old can wear both, but I feel more secure if he wears the mediums. He is currently in size 4T underwear from Target. The photo I am posting is his size 4T underwear underneath the size medium Dappi cover. Great product. Easy to wash and dry. For reference, my little boy is 39 inches tall and about 37 lbs.
