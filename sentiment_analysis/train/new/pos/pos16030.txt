This was a purchase for my 15 months old daughter. We bought them in combination with the lunch bag and the water bottle and I am happy about all so far.I prefer steel utensils over any other stuff (slicone, bpa free plastic etc.). They are durable, safe and do not leak chemicals etc. It does not say what grade steel is used in these particular ones but, I guess it is either 18:10 or 18:8 since lower grade steel would darken or bend easily while these have done neither. They are dishwasher safe too.The plastic parts are easy to grasp for a toddler  and the lady bug pictures are lovely, besides, the steel and plastic bits are well attached (no loosening so far)However you should expect some wear-tear scratches and fading in the colorful bits (not after the first wash like some other reviewers complained but after a few months of daily use) which is no big deal for me.Finally the fork ends are a little rounded so they do not harm the kid easily.Over all, I am happy with the purchase. They are ergonomic, practical and not very expensive. They have helped my kid a lot in her way of gaining independence in feeding herself. I am sure they will last
