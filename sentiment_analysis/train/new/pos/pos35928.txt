My daughter never took paci for months (or a bottle either, but that's another topic). We tried Avent, Evenflo, Playtex pacis, and she would just spit it out immediately. She just sucked her fingers, which we were anxious to stop, since sucking fingers is a bad habit that can be hard to break when she's older.We decided to give this one a try. I'd read on other reviews that babies who never took a paci would take this one on the first try. I was skeptical, but that's exactly what happened! We got this paci (when she was 4 mths) and on the first try, she took it like she had been doing this all the time!!! Amazing. As a test, I tried back the Avent, and she spit it right out.Thanks First Years. Pls don't stop making this.One idea for improvement, there wasn't anywhere to attach a Pacifier Strap. The only 2 holes are on the body of the paci, and then the strap would be pressed against the baby's mouth. Not too comfortable I imagine. I used a single-hole punch and made a hole in the 'handle' (the piece that sticks out) to create is place to attach the paci strap.
