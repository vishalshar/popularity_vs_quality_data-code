I love this bag! It is the only one my husband and I use.  We also have a really nice (and more expensive) tote, but it is freakin' huge...more appropriate for a day at disneyland or something.  For day-to-day this is all you need.  I must note that I am an exclusively breastfeeding mother and I carry no bottles at all.  I have no idea if I could carry everything I would need...but then again I don't know what you need for formula feeding or storing breastmilk.  Anyhow, I can carry 7 diapers, a cloth diaper to use as a changing pad, and a pack of travel wipes in the main top compartment.  I carry an extra onesie, pair of pants, socks, beanie, small receiving blanket, extra breast pads, and a digital camera in the middle zipper compartment. I carry my wallet and Lansinoh Brand Lanolin in the lower compartment, although I could fit much more.  Along the front I carry 2 pacifiers (only for emergencies), my cell phone, and a pen.  I love the pen pocket because I don't like picking up icky germs using the pens at the supermarket or doctors office to sign credit card receipts.  The only problem I have with this bag is the material along the top of the water bottle holder tore after using it for only 2 weeks! And I can't figure out how to exchange or return it to Amazon because it is outside of its original packaging (duh).  Also, it is a little akward to have on while my baby is in his sling... so usually my husband carries the backpack and I carry baby, or other way around.
