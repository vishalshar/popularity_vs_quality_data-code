With winter approaching here in Germany I was worried about walking to the bus stop with my my five year old, three year old and 10 month old.  I love my BOB Revolution Duallie but I realized it's limitation when it comes to weather.  Adding this weather shield has made all the difference.  I may get wet and cold but they stay warm and toasty.  The directions were minimal but easy to understand.  I actually roll up the weather shield and leave it on my stroller at all times.  It is very sturdy and durable.  At first the yellow color was a little shocking, until I realized that in bad weather you want the visibility.  Highly recommended.
