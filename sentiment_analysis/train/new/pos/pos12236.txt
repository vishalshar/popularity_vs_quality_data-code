We are really enjoying this dresser/changing table that we got for our little guy with the matching crib.  We wanted a dresser that could be used as a changing table when they were little buy also grow with them so we didn't have to purchase more furniture.  The only disappointing thing so far is that the drawers sometimes stick when you're trying to push them back in but sometimes it's good when my 19 month old is trying to push them and can't right away so he doesn't slam his fingers so not necessarily always a bad thing.  It fits lots of clothes in the drawers and sheets, blankets, changing pad covers in the shelves with the door.  Make sure you put the door on correctly and tight or else the door will stick.  Our stuck at first until I got my husband to tighten it.  Not a problem since.
