I LOVE this Diaper Bag.Pros:-Abundance of Space-Many pockets for organization to hold bottle, pacifier, diapers, wipes, etc.-Easy to Clean outer layer-Backpack feature (can also be used as a shoulder bag)-Built in changing station-Key holderCons:-Price (but for its features, well worth it)-No stroller clips (purchase separately)This is a great diaper bag.  I was debating between a Ju-Ju-Be and this bag, but am happy with this bag.  I like to carry a lot of things in my bag, so all the pockets are a great feature for easy organization.  Also, I'd rather carry one bag then have two separate bags (diaper bag and purse).  This bag is great since it can carry my stuff as well as baby's stuff.  This is also great as a travel bag.  As baby gets older, I pack more toys to keep her occupied and it fits a lot of stuff. I was debating on getting the smaller boxy backpack, but I'm glad I got the abundance.  I don't like having my bag overstuffed, so the abundance of space is a great feature.  With all the stuff I carry, the backpack helps relieve my shoulders.
