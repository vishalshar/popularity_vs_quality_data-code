When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills.Once I started using something different, I realized immediately just how wonderful the Diaper Genie really was. The odor protection the Diaper Genie provides is much superior to that of the other diaper pail. When I used the Diaper Genie, my son's room never smelled. With the other product, his room smelled horribly, even when I changed it daily!And, I found that the Diaper Genie really isn't any harder to use, and that it is much more pleasant to change, since all the diapers are sealed when you open the lid.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie. Save your money and buy one the first time around. You'll have to spend a little more on refills, but your house won't smell, which really is the point behind a diaper pail.
