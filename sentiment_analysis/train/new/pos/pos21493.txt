I bought this high chair mainly because the color scheme matched my kitchen.  It was bigger than I expected but overall has served us well for the past 2 years.Pros:-Attractive teal and dark taupe color scheme-Padded chair with multiple recline settings for younger babies-Removable top tray for easy clean up-Grows with child.  My son still sits in this chair at 2.5 years old, 36" and 30lbs.Cons:-Entire tray system doesn't lay flat if removed.  So if you take it off to remove child you can't easily lay it on a chair or table, it topples.-Leg support only have one setting and take up a lot of room on the floor.  Chair cannot easily be tucked into a corner, it protrudes pretty far into the room.-The removable tray is really big.  It sticks up about 12" out of our drying rack, which can be a bit annoying in a small kitchen.Overall this has been a great chair.  If I had it to do over I would purchase a smaller chair that can easily be tucked away as we have a rather small kitchen.  This chair takes up a lot of our floor space but it does get used 3-5x/day.
