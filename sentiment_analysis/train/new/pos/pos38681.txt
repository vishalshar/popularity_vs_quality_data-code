I bought this for my son's day care sine he loves trains. The nap mat has enough cushion for my son to sleep comfortably. It has a writable name tag which is great to identify it from the another child's nap mat who has the same one. The blanket has a soft feel/texture. My son loves to feel it as he takes a nap.  The only reason for taking a star away is - the nap mat's "blanket" is great for cooler days, but I don't think it will be good enough in the winters. After several washes the fabric is now starting to fade/
