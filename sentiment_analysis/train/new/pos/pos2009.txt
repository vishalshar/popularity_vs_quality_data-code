I bought these because they were like the one we got in the hospital, except no scent (which is fine). I thought five might be a tad excessive, but not at all. One for the diaper bag, one for the car seat, one for night time, one for playing, and an extra for when you can't find one. I like the pink and purple color too. I know they say zero to three month, but we used them way past that with no problem. They are good quality!
