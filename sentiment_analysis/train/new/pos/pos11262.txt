The Good: Holy cow, this thing really does grip many kinds of objects (but not Sophie, I don’t care what their picture shows) and stands up to heavy bottle drops, too. The rubbery stuff on the innerband grips as promised and the velcro adjusters make it easy to attach. Long enough to work in most situations (as long as 16” when fastened). Moderately priced from 7-12 dollars.The Bad: Longer than the other toy tether so use under supervision, of course. The Velcro seems to be strong enough to start pulling up the weak stitching and might fall apart (although it hasn’t happened yet). Also, this one has a little more engineering to it but it still seems like a home craft project for those of us who are into that kind of thing.The Verdict: Most kids who are in the “drop it” phase really aren’t into the “pick up” phase and therein lies the problem – you are still going to have to pick up whatever you’ve attached to the other end of these tethers. So, the main benefits are: (1) hygiene, keeping dirt and germs off your kid’s stuff, and (2) buying you a little time before you inevitably have to scoop up that bottle or toy and hand it back. And YES, really we all should be able to make something like these, but who has the time? If you like ‘em but aren’t in touch with your sewing side, just wait till they’re on sale, buy it and call it a day.
