For those who wrote negative reviews because this is non-plastic, I think they are missing the point.  The benefit of this mat is that it is PVC and phthalate free.  I use it as an extension of my child's dinner plate/high chair tray and just replace food when she drops it on it.  I wouldn't be doing that with a plastic (usually PVC) mat as they contain endocrine disrupters.  The only thing I would change is the size - it would be good if it was bigger.  And unfortunately, Mimi the Sardine are going to stop making these soon, so I bought a few of them and later they can double as art mats for older children or even be cut up to make aprons (Oh, and I had my mum make some large bibs out of one of them as I can wipe it clean and it's ready for the next meal.)
