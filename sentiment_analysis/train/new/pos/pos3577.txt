Great feeding dishes. Very easy to use and convenient. The three sectioned spaces each hold 1oz of food making it dummy proof when determining how much food you're feeding baby. I use one (1oz) space for meat; the 2nd (1oz) space for veggies; and the 3rd (1oz) space for fruit. The attached spoon makes it very convenient when leaving baby with a sitter or dad! As an added bonus I can slide my thumb in the notch that hold the covered spoon & balance the dish better in my hand.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because pureed foods will leak a bit during transportation; the white dish stains with certain foods (i.e. carrots) & baby will outgrow quickly once he starts eating more food. Still a great product for a new eater.
