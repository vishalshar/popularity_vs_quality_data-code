For the price, this jogger stroller is the way to go.  Super easy to set up, wonderfully smooth ride, pushes well with one hand, great under carriage storage, large front wheel to provide maximum stability, and best of all, provides a real sunshade.  Unlike other joggers that I looked into that only provided a top shade (only works at noon), this jogger stroller has a shade that rotates from above the head to below the chin.  So, regardless of the time of day, you little one's eyes are shaded.  It also collapses with a single touch and stores easily in the back my crossover (no need to remove any parts too).  I would call this jogger a "real" jogger stroller since the front wheel does NOT swivel...for stability/safety reasons, you cannot have a swiveling front wheel when jogging or running.  So, if you are looking to use a "jogger" for the mall or anything that requires frequent turning, don't go with this stroller.  I am a runner, so this one is perfect for us.  The trick is to slightly tip the stroller on its back wheels when turning.  My only complaint is that the seats can sometimes tilt in toward one another.  I finally figured out that this only happens when the fabric gets caught on the back, inner edge of the seat; so, fixing this simply means pushing the fabric off & re-adjusting the seats to sit straight.  Overall, however, a great buy!
