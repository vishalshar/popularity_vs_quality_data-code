I love these bumpers. I had to put them on the crib when my baby turned 4 months old because he kept moving around and his head would end up against the wooden bars of the crib. These bumpers are very secure and I like that they are nicely padded to prevent injury. Also the design is super cute. My baby is now 5 months old and he no longer wakes up crying all the time. Most of the time I find him just talking to the monkeys on the bumpers and trying to reach for them. The first time I heard him blabbing it was soooo cute. They certainly keep him entertained. Now I put him to bed at the same time every night and he just babbles at the monkeys until he falls asleep. I love it!
