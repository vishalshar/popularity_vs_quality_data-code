First of all I have to say I love the MAM nipples!  They were the only nipple that my baby didn't have formula running down his face running into his neck fold.  That being said these are REALLY FAST!  I tried to switch around 4-6 months and they were too fast.  So I wouldn't recommend buying these unless your baby is trying too hard on the level 2 nipples.  I had already bought, opened, and sterilized these so we ended up using around 8-9 months.  My friend however never ended up needing past the Level two for her son.  I'm pretty sure I could of gotten away without these as well.  It also allowed my son to suck down 7oz of formula like he was chugging out of Das Boot.  I was never a big cereal in the bottle fan personally (we had no need other than just a hungry baby), but after everyone and their mother gave me their unsolicited opinion I broke down one day and tried it.  It went through the Level 3 just fine.  No clogging or need to make the hole bigger.  I also bought the Level above this but ended up never opening the package.In summary:  If you're doing fine on Level 2 stick with them unless a need arises to go for faster flow.  If cereal in the bottle is what's working for you and you're having flow issues give these a shot.Being a parent isn't easy and I hope I can help you by sharing some of my experiences.
