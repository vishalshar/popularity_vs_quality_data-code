I had one of these with my first two kids. I liked it so much, I bought another one with my third. Now, I have two so I can wash one and not have to bother hand drying it if I need to go out. I agree with the other reviewers in saying that the top would be better if it were slightly funnel shaped toward the opening. However, it's not a deal breaker since I just quickly rattle it back and forth in the top of the bottle and everything comes out.What I do like about it is:The top stays firmly closed, unlike other brands I've checked out at the store. That is a MUST. Nobody wants powder all over everything in their diaper bag.It is shaped slightly taller and narrower than other brands, which allows me to set it upright in my bag AND still be able to zip it. (Everyone's bags are different, but mine is narrow and tall.)I would recommend this to a friend.
