These training pants are great, they are kind of a velour material inside and super soft. They absorb one full accident and do not leak! Granted, my son wears them without pants and just a t shirt around the house. He has not worn them out yet. BUT regardless, these are great, they are the perfect training pant, in my opinion..I wish I would have spend my money on these instead of Imse Vimse which are a kind of terry material and dry slowly in the dryer. Shipped from LC PALS. I would totally recommend these if you are willing to make a rather large *in my opinion for a pair of undies* investment.Just ordered two more pair.
