I really liked this idea, but was worried about the dinky suction cups when I received it.  So I bought some extra strong suction cups with narrow hooks and figured I would swap them over when it fell.  Well it's been months now and those dinky suction cups are still working pretty well!  They fell a couple times in the first month or so, but they have been holding up quite well and I didn't even need the extra strong suction cups I bought as a backup!  We have quite a few bath toys in the hammock, and I check the suction cups probably weekly, and push them in a little to squeeze out any air holes probably monthly.  I'm in there giving the kids their bath (and toys from the hammock) anyways, so it's not even like I have to remember to go do it.
