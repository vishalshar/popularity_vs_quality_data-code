This is a solid product at a reasonable price from a trusted mattress manufacturer.  We actually purchased an exactly similar/same product three years ago when expecting our first child and are finding that THIS crib-sized mattress from Serta is just slightly "softer" (less firm?) than the other.  Whether or not this is actually true, there is a certain firm-ness that seem to be built into all crib mattresses (I believe, for safety's sake) and this one is still quite firm.  The laminate cover material that it is covered with is easily cleanable although we haven't had any instances where it has been soiled in such a way - over the course of the three months we have been using it.  All it all, this is a completely functional crib mattress that we will have no problem transitioning to a toddler bed later on and, for the price, it is hard to beat.  A person can spend up to $300 on a crib mattress but I'm not sure why they would want to.  Coupled with a quality waterproof fitted crib pad (we have a Carter's "Keep Me Dry"), your baby will sleep comfortably night-after-night.  This product is reasonably priced, well made, has a 7-year warranty, has all the features that you need in a crib mattress, and is easily recommendable.
