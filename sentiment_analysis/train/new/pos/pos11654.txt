I was very skeptical to order this bassinet pad from all the negative reviews but it is exactly what I hoped for. It fits in my pottery barn kids bassinet even better than the one sold from PBK. I love that I am putting my son on an organic/cotton pad vs. a plastic who knows what kind of toxins he would be breathing in all day and night pad. I was nervous that the quality would be poor from some of the reviews but I feel like it is made very well. It is firm, but pads for babies are supposed to be firm to prevent SIDS.
