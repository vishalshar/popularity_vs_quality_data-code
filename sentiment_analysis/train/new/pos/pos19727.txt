I was nervous to spend this much on a high chair but an so happy I bought it! Not only can you instantly detect the high quality of the chair, but it's so versatile too! The wheels glide so smoothly from tile to carpet (and we have a very high shaggy carpet), the seat is sooo soft and u love that the seat back reclines. My baby can easily go from eating lunch to playtime (with the playbar attachment). Everyone who's come over notices how nice the chair is. I'd definitely recommend it!!
