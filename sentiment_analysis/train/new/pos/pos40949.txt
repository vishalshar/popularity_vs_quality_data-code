I just had to write a review on this pillow! It is wonderful! I'm 5'4" tall and I started using this pillow since I was in my 1st trimester (I'm now in my second) and it has saved me! I don't know what people are talking about in a few of the reviews stating that the cover of the pillow is rough? No! True it's not silk up against your skin, but it doesn't need to be! It is very comfortable and I can comfortably turn side to side and I'm surrounded by pillow! This is 100% way better than just having a "body pillow" which is just straight, while this pillow has special curves that fit exactly how my arms and legs would hug it! The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the fact that I use one extra pillow (kind of flat) underneath the head part so that my head is just slightly raised up a little more. That's just my preference. Before I got this pillow I was using like 3 or 4 regular sized pillows and I could NEVER get comfortable! So, with our 3rd baby on the way, I'm so glad that I found this one! Just make sure that you have a bed no smaller than a queen size! This pillow takes up exactly half of our queen bed, which gives JUST enough room for my husband:) I highly recommend this pillow:))
