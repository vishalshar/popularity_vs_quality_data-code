We tried several popular brands including iPlay, Apple Cheeks and others and this was the clear winner for comfort, practicality (easy to put on and off squirming baby/toddler)and style.  We had the pleasure of our little one trying the poop test in it early on and it held in everything without any problem, was easy to take off him without getting all over due to the handy button system, and was easy to wash out to look like brand new.  We have used this item in sand, ocean, chlorine and it looks and feels brand new!  The adjustable buttons make it easy to fit baby as they grow too.  A bit pricier than some of the other brands but worth every penny!
