We bought these for my daughter to replace a different set we had. The other set was very soft and fuzzy, but it kept stimulating her rooting instinct and then she would turn her head and get mad. We bought these instead and they solved the problem well. They are not super padded but are still soft and protect her little neck from the belt. We are very happy with our purchase. Please let me know if you find my review helpful.
