I purchased the infant size for my 5 month old (he is a big boy and 21lbs), and it fit perfectly.  We had no problem at all using this on the flight from Orlando to Chicago.  I even used it on take off and landing and no one said a word to me.  This gave me such piece of mind that if there were turbulence, that I wouldn't accidentally let go of my son!  The strap was long enough for him to sit up on my lap, breastfeed, or lay on me to sleep.  He was very comfortable.  I was concerned it was getting a little hot before they turned the plane's AC on, but we were flying in the middle of the summer.  Once the AC was on, it was fine.  If you want to be able to turn the baby around to look at you or look out the window, you could also put the strap around your forearm, which I did when he got restless and wanted to stand up and look around.  That also worked great and I felt like would stop him from going flying if there were turbulence and allow me enough time to grab him.
