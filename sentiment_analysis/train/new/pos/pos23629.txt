I love the fitted sheet. Very cute. It might have faded a bit as others complained about but I don't mind or notice. The sheet also shrunk and the brown piping isn't at the edge of the mattress, but this also doesn't bother me (as it does other reviewers). I've never once used the blanket. It could be used as a stroller blanket or laid out on the floor but I just don't need it. The wearable blanket is good for summer because of the mesh down the sides. The brown linen crib skirt is too small for our crib?! It's not wide enough so it doesn't provide complete coverage - so that's really annoying and I don't like it. I like the look of the crib skirt but it doesn't fit as intended so no point. And it's not a big deal to not have it. To do it again, I would just buy the fitted sheet.
