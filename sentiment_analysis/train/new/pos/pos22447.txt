Got this for my grandaughter for Christmas. The outer packaging print was all blurry and smeared, so I was concerned about the splat mat itself, but it is perfect- the colors are bright, bold, happy, and perfect. It's not good to give gifts that look like this when you see the packaging, but her mommy doesn't care, so we just looked past it. As for the mat, it's large enough for things like under a high chair, or around the table. I also use the kids' splat mats for crafting all through grade school- they can't be beat for egg decorating, finger painting, Christmas ornament making, etc etc etc... great product.
