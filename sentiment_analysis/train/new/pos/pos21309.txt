I've been using this cover on my one-year-old for almost a month now, and it's great. So far it holds in even the really messy messes, and baby bumble bum gets compliments where ever he goes (it's summer, and public fountains are the place to be.) I haven't tried any of the more expensive brands, but I can't imagine they're better.
