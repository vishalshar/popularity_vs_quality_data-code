This is a great product if you are wanting to heat "room temp" formula. It is not very effective at heating fridge cold formula in a timely fashion.  Room temp liquids will be heated to body temp in 8 - 12 minutes and become warmer the longer you leave it in. Fridge chilled formula takes a while, like 20 minutes, if not longer and if you want it warm rather that aired.  At the end of the day it depends how warm your baby takes it's formula as to how long it takes to do the job. Personally I love this product.  My baby prefers warm formula, a bit over aired so a heating device of some description is required.  As I have a 3.5 years old boy I don't like having to use boiling water (which was what I was having to carry around in a flask) as I worry about him knocking it over.  This has solved that problem.  Boiling the bags after use is a minor pain but mine liquidise very fast, 5 mins, so it's not a big deal.  (Remember to place a tea towel at the bottom of your pain to prevent the insert accidentally sticking to the bottom!) I had initially bought a Dex Grab and Go bottle warmer but was unhappy with the neoprene cover.  It didn't seem to grip very well around the insert & bottle (I use Dr Browns Short fat bottles) and seemed to leach heat.  I then decided to buy this model as it has a fully surrounded cover.  It was worth buying and in my opinion way superior to the Dex for holding in the heat. FYI:- If you use tall skinny bottles this warmer case will not work as it is not tall enough.  You would need to look at DEX or Prince Lion Heart Models.
