This is a four star high chair that can easily be five with three simple mods. Experienced parent here so listen up newbies!...1 - Toss the pad. It is a hassle, an extra germ habitat, and your baby comes equipped with padding.2 - There is a recess in the seat about the size of two quarters that collects nasty and is very difficult to clean. Drill out the bottom.3 - The tray has a green post that collects water in the dishwasher. Drill a hole in the bottom.My wife is a change-averse skeptic. But she kisses me longer now that I made these mods!
