these work well, but they are a little pricey and frankly, should be included with the gate itself. i would venture a guess and say well over 90% of houses would need this as they all have base boards. having to order this, while not a huge deal, is really just an annoyance. that being said, they are extremely easy to use and come with all the hardware needed to install it with the gate.
