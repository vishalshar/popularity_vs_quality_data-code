We bought this for my 6 month old daughter. This rattle in particular does not have a super loud rattle, but is great for her to gum.One thing I really like about this one is that I can get down on the floor to play with her and put one end of it in my mouth and hold it with my teeth and shake my head around to make it rattle. She finds it absolutely HILARIOUS and grabs on the other end to try to shake it/me for more sound.For just four bucks, I don't think you can go wrong. To this daddy, that's a small price to pay for something that can get some quality giggle time.
