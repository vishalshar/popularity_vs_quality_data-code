Just bought this and it's great! Goes great with my sons room decor. In spit of what a lot of reviewers said (and I read a LOT of them before I purchased), it didn't smell, it doesn't hang or sag, the ties were plenty long enough to get around the thickest parts of our crib rails, and the company clearly saw the complaints about it only having ties on the top or bottom, because now it has ties on the top AND bottom, so it stays on very securely. I love it and it was a great price compared to many crib bumpers I've found elsewhere. One teensy tiny complaint...the ties had some threads hanging off them, but that's nothing a quick scissor snip won't fix!
