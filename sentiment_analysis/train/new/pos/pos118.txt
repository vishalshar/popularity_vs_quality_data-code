This is actually a very good pad. It's soft and padded. All the comforts of a regular changing pad but foldable.I can see what they were trying to get at with half of the side being velcro. It make it so that you can basically dissemble the pad and pack it for travel.But I didn't need it for travel, and when I do travel I just use the little pad from the diaper bag. What I needed was a secondary changing station in the living room so I didn't have to go back to the bedroom all the time. So I don't ever take the side apart. What I do however is use the pad without the cover. The cover prevent the pad from being folded and I like folding it out of the way when not in use. I just use the cover on the pad for out main changing station instead.So this basically works for what I need,which is something that is fully functional and can be folded out of the way when not in use.Because I use it without a cover however there are time when "spills" and "stains" are unavoidable. This then required vigorous scrubbing the get remove from the vinyl/plastic pad...especially from the crevices and the pitted pattern......after about 7 months of use it has started to tear where I have scrubbed it the most.....Which isn't so bad considering it probably never was meant to be scrubbed like so...the area of the fold itself show no signs of wear or cracking howeverOverall I like this pad and am getting another one to replace this one we have.
