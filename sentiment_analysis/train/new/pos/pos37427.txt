nice build and does not full apart, keep the baby in place and support her jumping up and down.  I can say it takes a beating, and it keep the bady safe. the side are pretty wide so fitting in door may be a problem but at the same time it can be a good thing when you want to keep the baby from walking out the room. came in good condition and it was easy to put together
