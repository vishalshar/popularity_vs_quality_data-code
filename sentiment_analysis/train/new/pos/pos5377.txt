My husband and I got this mobile to match the Hampton bedding set and I have not experienced any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers.One thing to make note of however is that the assembly directions that come with the mobile are not for the exact model that this one is, so the instructions are not 100% accurate. There is actually less assembly required for this one since the hanging pieces are already attached to the fabric canopy, so all you do is fit the plastic hanger pieces together... (which you will want to do with caution as the picture illustration is backward to how it really has to go together and if you dont pay close attention you could try to force it in wrong and break it). If your crib has wide top railings or round top railings then this mobile will not work for you as the arm has a lip that helps secure it that will not work on wide sections of railing.I still rate this a 5 because for us we had no problems at all and it really is a beautiful mobile.
