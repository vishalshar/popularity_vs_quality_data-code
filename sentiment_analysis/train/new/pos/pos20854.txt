I got very excited about this set when I saw it online because we want our daughter to learn about healthy eating habits, and thought this would be a fun companion to her shopping cart.  When the items arrived, I discovered that the pieces are much smaller than I expected, and that the age rating for the product is 3+ years.  I ended up putting about half of the pieces away as possible choking hazards for our one year old.  The fruits are super cute, as well as the little basket, and I hope she will grow into them when she is a little older and ready to engage in creative/kitchen play.  I don't recommend this for under 2 years old, though...
