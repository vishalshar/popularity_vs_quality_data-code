Either they've redesigned it or the people who have trouble with it popping loose aren't fully seating it in place because mine is rock solid.Like others I clicked the extra side's holder into place so it doesn't get lost.The price is ridiculous, though. When I spend hundreds of dollars on a car seat I expect it to include a cup holder, not view it as a way to fleece me for another twenty bucks.
