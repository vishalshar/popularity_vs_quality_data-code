I love all of my Clouds and Stars products. I am not sure about the negative reviews for this mattress pad because I have three and think they are the best around. The sheet set is my go-to baby gift even if mom didn't register for it.  I have two sons, each with a set of Stars and Clouds Quickzip sheets on their bed. My oldest son is over 2 years old and his mattress pad is still in use and in perfect condition.  I have several of the fitted mattress protectors from the big box baby store and they have indeed melted in the wash and are ruined, but these have not. I do not wash them in any special loads. They go in with everything else and get dried on regular heat. With my youngest son, I change his sheets twice a day because he spits up so much.  I bought the third mattress pad for him so that I always have one ready. I love this product.In addition, just to describe the product in case you are confused:-It is NOT fitted like many pads are. It lays flat underneath the sheet.-It does not have any zippers and does not attach to the sheet set in any way.  When you place the sheet on top and zip it up, the pad stays in place underneath it. The pad is slightly bigger than the zip sheet and I "tuck" the little extra into the base fitted zip sheet.
