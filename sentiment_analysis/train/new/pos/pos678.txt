Only brand of nipples used by two grandsons who normally nurse, but need bottles for daycare.  No problem with either feller going between breast and bottle and nipples work as described ... no excess air thanks to vent ... and they hold up well.  Start with beginner flow and work up to faster flow as baby grows.  Can't say enough good about Tommee Tippee bottles/nipples.
