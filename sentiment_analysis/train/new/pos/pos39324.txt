I read a lot of reviews for high chairs before I ordered one and this one had a lot of great reviews. Plus amazon had a great sale on it at the time basically 50% off. Can't beat that!I ordered this high chair for my, then 3 month old son, he is now 5 months. He is a little small for it, but it still straps in him safely. I love the different design, that still has a nice color to it, but doesn't look so silly. And yes, I get compliments for it! I have quite a few people ask me about it and say how much they like it.I did read reviews about the tray not being easy to clean because the bottom one has screws that food can get into. And one scary review about mold. It worried me, but so many other reviews were really good. I went ahead and bought it and I feel that if you clean it properly after each meal that would not be a problem. Just take the time to wash the removable tray and check to make sure no food got to the bottom tray (which I really don't see how it would, at least much of it).Pros:DesignColorSafety HarnessIt wasn't too difficult to put togetherDishwashable tray-I don't have a dishwasher, but I figured that would be something great for other people. Its easy to wash by hand and dries pretty quick.You can remove the tray with one hand which is great!ConsIs still a little big, but thats not surprising. He is growing into it quickly!It is a bit hard to move because it wriggles. And if its on carpet it is really hard to move around with one hand. Its not too bad on tile or wood.Sometimes when I am putting the tray back down I am a bit afraid it will get his fingers or hand, I just always lift up his hand and it is not a problem.I would buy again and recommend it.
