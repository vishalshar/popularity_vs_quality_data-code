I purchased this car seat protector to go with my Eddie Bauer 3 in 1 carseat. I have to agree with another reviewer who said the carseat protector was not long enough. Now she had a big SUV and I have a 2006 Dodge Durango so I have a big SUV also so maybe it is our big seats. But I think it is pretty pointless to have "storage pockets" on the protector when it is not long enough to be able to store anything in. As it is, the pockets end up under the carseat.I own an Eddie Bauer carseat so it can't be said that the car seat protector just works with the Eddie Bauer brand. My daughter is still in a rear facing position, but I *believe* that when she gets moved to a forward facing or a booster seat the front pockets will possibly be able to be used if it doesn't interfere with her feet.
