I purchased this bed back in March and it has stood the test of time! I catch my son jumping on this bed all the time and the slats are still holding strong! This bed definitely isn't built to support the weight of an adult though so don't sit on it! As far as putting the bed together I did it by myself in 2 hours. The reason it took me so long was because it was a pain the keep all the slats in while holding the frame still and screwing it together. I would advise at least having one other person to help you put this together so it doesn't take you too long.This bed is worth every penny! Its very cute and sturdy for toddlers, even rambunctious ones.
