This blanket is pretty pricey but it is the softest blanket you will ever find.  I buy this as a baby gift all the time and it often ends up being the baby's favorite "blankie" which makes it worthwhile. Advise moms not to use fabric softener ever on this blanket as it will cause the fibers to mat together and it will lose it's softness.  It advises this one the blanket but most moms don't read this until it's too late.
