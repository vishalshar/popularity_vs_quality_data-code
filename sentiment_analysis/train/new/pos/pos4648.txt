We've tried many of the all-natural chemical free sunscreens and found most to be thick and difficult to apply with one thing or another that didn't work for us. Badger was thick and hard to rub in. Mexitan has both titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, has a good texture but leaves white clumps unless you really rub hard right away. Kabana didn't work for us either; it left us feeling like we had a think coat on. California Baby good, but heavy, hard to rub in, and has the micronized titanium dioxide. Having so much disappointment with natural sunscreens, I myself started using Blue Lizard which is quick to apply, offers good sun protection, but isn't so natural.Then we tried Thinkbaby and are very pleased. For us, Thinkbaby offers very good sun protection, absorbs easliy and does not leave you feeling greasy. It has a very nice texture and goes on smoothly with a light and pleasant scent. The only concern is with one the ingredient: "natural fragrance". What is that? A synthetic scent?Having tried may sunscreens, in search of one we liked that is also rated well on the EWG as being safe and non-toxic, this is one of our favorites. We also just recently tried TruKid and like it too.
