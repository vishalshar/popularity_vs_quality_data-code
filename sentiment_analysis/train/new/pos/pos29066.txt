Yeah, I'm that mom that bought so many different cups because they all leaked milk. As you know there's nothing worse than leaking milk all over the house. This cup I'd say 99.8% leak proof. Once or twice there is a drop and only from that tiny little area from the top to the stopper inside. Which brings me to my second reason for loving this cup. There is only 3 parts to clean. The cup, the stopper and the top. Easy as pie to clean. Also in case you're wondering about durability, I have an overly active 21 mon year old and she has thrown this cup from her high chair almost every meal with no chips or breaks. Buy it and you'll love it too.
