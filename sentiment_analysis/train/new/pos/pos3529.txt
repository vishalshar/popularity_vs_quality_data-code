I was looking for a night light that my daughter could sleep with, that would stay on all night.  After reading reviews I decided to go with this product.  This is just okay.Pros:Daughter loves itDoesn't get hotBright but not too brightLove the color options (my child loves the changing one)There really only is one con that I see (so far after 4 days of use) and it's a HUGE drawback, is by default this thing is set on a timer.  So if my 2 year old turns it on by pressing the button on the bottom, it is on and the timer is now set.  If I turn it on (and turn the timer off by holding the power button), the timer goes off.  Now if you child is like mine and likes to play with this and change the colors - the timer is now back on.  Super annoying. I don't know why they couldn't have switched this behavior, so that by default it would stay on and if you wanted the timer on you would have to press and hold the button.If it wasn't for that this would get 5 stars.****Update: 8/2.  I started having issues with this.  It started flickering when changing colors on the rainbow setting.  I contacted customer service and they had me try to reset it.  That did not fix the issue.  They sent me out a new one within a few days. FANTASTIC customer service!  Highly recommend! Updating to four stars for customer service - would be five if they would change the timer functionality.
