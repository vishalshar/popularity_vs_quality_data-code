This makes night feeding so easy. No more screaming baby while I stand at the sink running hot water over the bottle, or trying to mix formula while I'm half asleep. We just mix up the bottles before bed and place them in the cooler. We keep this in our bedroom so as soon as we hear the baby wake up the first thing I do is put the bottle in and set the timer. The bottle warms while I change his diaper. I only wish it came with 2 ice packs invade you forget to freeze it in the morning.
