So you are wondering if you want to purchase this clock.  After reading the reviews (not worth the price, cheap plastic, difficult to set the time, etc.), I waited another month before I finally realized something.  The people who complained about this clock do not have a child who wakes them up every morning before 5 a.m.  If, like me, your child wakes you up, wondering if it is morning, BUY THIS CLOCK.  No, it is not a cute accessory for your child's Pottery Barn bedroom.  Yes, it is overpriced.  And yes, it can be "difficult" to set (especially if your child keeps unplugging it).  But....if you have not had a good night's sleep in three years, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  Sweet dreams.
