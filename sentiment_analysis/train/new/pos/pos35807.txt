After much frustration attempting to install these without any drilling I finally figured out that I could only use the lock with the adhesive and had to drill for the other piece it latches on (mind you I am not mechanically inclined in any way, shape or form - the average person could have likely figured this out much quicker than I did).  With that being said... once I got them properly installed they are wonderful, the adhesive is very strong, as is my daughter and she pulls as hard as she can daily to try to get into the cabinets and they haven't budged.  Using the key is easy and the baby won't be able to figure out how to use it for years.  All in all I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to completely destroy their cabinets.
