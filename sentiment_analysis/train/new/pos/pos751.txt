I visited many stores and did a lot of research before deciding on this crib. I wanted a crib with the Greenguard certification to avoid many toxins that are added to conventional cribs. I worried about the finish and toxins when the little one starts teething and never the less chewing on the crib at some point. I was so excited to see a crib at a reasonable price with Greenguard certification. Many stores I visited had cribs that were starting $400-500 for the Greenguard certification. The only reason I was hesitant on this crib was that it was not solid wood. After receiving the crib and putting it together I couldn't be happier. The quality is excellent and the crib looks great.
