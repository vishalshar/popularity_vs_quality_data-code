I purchased this for my baby on the way. I put it together all by myself at 8 months pregnant in about 30 minutes, as long as you follow the directions it's very easy to figure out. The color is lovely, it isn't true to the manufacturer pics but the pics that a customer posted here are spot on, thank goodness because that's the color I was hoping for : ) It seems very sturdy, I haven't had my baby yet, but I have had 3 other playards in the past for my other kids, and this one seems the best so far. The diaper caddy deal goes on easily and stays on, even though I have it full of items. The only 2 problems I had/have with this playard is that one of the snaps that you connect the changing table to was missing from the side. I went to the store and bought a replacement which my husband put on in about 2 minutes, I just didn't want to deal with the hassle of packing it all back up and returning it for something that was so easily fixed. Also, my ipod doesn't stay plugged in to the music box unless I fiddle with the plug a little, I don't know if a different plug would do the same thing or what. Otherwise excellent product.
