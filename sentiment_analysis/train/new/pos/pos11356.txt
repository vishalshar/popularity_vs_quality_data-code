My kids love hooded towels so this was a nice addition! It's a good size for my 2-year-old and I think it'll be good for when he's 3, but my 5-year-old is getting a little tall for it. I wish someone would make a normal-sized towel with a hood = perfect. Nonetheless, cute towel that's worn well through use and washes. I'll definitely buy another one when it's time to replace.
