Love it. Keeps wipes moist. Easy to load new wipes with the zipper top opening. Compact and takes up minimal room in my diaper bag compared to carrying a full wipe container. Wipes don't come out as neatly as they do from a wipe holder. It's similar to how wipes come out of the plastic packaging as you buy them from the store. It really requires two hands - one to hold the pouch and the other to snap the wipe out (I say snap because the next wipe will come with it if you don't snap it out).
