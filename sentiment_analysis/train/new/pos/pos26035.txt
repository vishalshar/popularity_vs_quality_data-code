This is a great quality bed especially for the price.  It looks great with the bedroom car decor and my 1 year old loves it. I removed a star because the assembly isn't as easy as I thought and a part (the front spoiler was missing).  However, even without that part the bed was fine (picture shown below) and the company has a website that made ordering that particular part easy.
