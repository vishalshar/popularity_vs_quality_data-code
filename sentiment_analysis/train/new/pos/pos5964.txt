These easy grip spoons are great for my twins who are just learning to feed themselves. Now folks let's not expect miracles to happen from buying these spoons, they still want to throw and fling their food and spoons, but these truly do help with establishing their feeding skills. They are short enough from handle to spoon that it doesn't make it hard for them to judge the distance to their mouth. Also I don't know how your babies are but mine try to shove things in their mouths and down their throats constantly so the fact that this spoon isn't long and has the round ball puts my mind at ease that they won't be shoving a long spoon down their throats! Highly recommended these to help your child learn to feed themselves.
