I was looking for a replacement mattress/pad for an heirloom cradle.  I was a little worried because there are notches in the inside corners of the cradle and although my cradle interior measures 36 x 18, I was afraid the mattress would crimp.  This pad actually measures 35.5 x 18 with a full 2" thickness.  Plus it has slightly rounded corners which help with fit.  The pad looks like it was made for this 1940's vintage cradle.  I am very pleased as my first grandchild will lay on this for a few weeks.  The pad is firm, but not too firm and has a waterproof covering which should be very easy to keep clean.The pad was shipped flat in a box so there are no folds or creases.The pad is made in the USA which is an added bonus.  And, i have taken the suggestion of using a king size pillow case as a fitted sheet and which fits just right.  Very happy with this purchase.
