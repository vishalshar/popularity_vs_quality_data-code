I actually purchased multiples of these for my bottle goat, we had in the house. Must be the perfect texture because it saved us several charger cords after she had rejected some other teething toys. I hung them on cabinet handles & by her sleeping spot so they didn't get carried off & lost. Just had to keep them away from the dog.
