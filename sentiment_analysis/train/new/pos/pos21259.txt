We got this monitor 3.5 yrs ago for my daughter and I LOVE it. it has a light that you can turn on and it turns off after 15 minutes. It also tells the temp of the room. I've occasionlly had static in the receiver but if you move it a few inches it usually stops. I got another one 2 yrs ago when my son was born and I can have both of them on and receivers on each channel and both work fine. I just bought this one for my newborn daughter (one of the receivers from our first one stopped working after 3 yrs--it got dropped MANY times before it stopped working though!)so we got one with 2 receivers this time. They plug in or you can put a battery in and carry them around with you.
