I have been debating buying this bedding for my little girl. I really liked skip hop activity mat with treetop friends and we came across it at a store and my husband being the harshest critic Loved it. I tried to check out the bedding for treetop friends and could not really find it anywhere. From the pictures the skirt looked dark brown and i didnt like that. Also bumper pads looked flimsy and cheaply made from the pictures. bumper pads are beautifull and just enough thickness. I love the quality. very cute. in the picture you dont see on upper part of the comforter , there is a little cute bird picture too. skirt color is not dark brown. it is more like muted down brown , more light mocha. Sheet is a good quality. SOOO neutral yet cute enough for a girl:) I have also found matching wall decal. It wouldnt been flawless if skip hop made mobile to match with it because all the owls and squirrels will be just soo cute:) Also wanted to add I washed all the bedding in delicate setting and came out great.so here is the wall art. it is from etsy.com ---  [...]copy and paste will work . i hope:)
