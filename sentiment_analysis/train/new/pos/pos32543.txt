I always buy these as baby shower gifts.  They so incredibly soft and since there's no stuffing they're crib, stroller, etc safe.  My youngest became obsessed with these from about 3-4 months on and refused to nap without one.  They're very durable and such a wonderful lovey.  This one was a gift for the newest nephew in my family and mama was so thrilled that she actually took it out of the bag, immediately gave it to him, and didn't even bother with the rest of the things.  That level of mama approval should tell you all you need to know.
