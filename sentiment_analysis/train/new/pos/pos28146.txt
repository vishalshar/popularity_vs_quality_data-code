I make all our baby food and bought 3 sets of these.  They stack perfect in the freezer and the food pops out easily.  the size is perfect for a portion and the different color lids help identify what foods are inside (I use a homemade chart on the freezer).  masking tape works too to put the contents and date right on the lid.  They easily defrost too.  Love these!!
