My wife loves it!She bought this for 2 reasonsReason #1: this is great for traveling this is perfect instead of bringing the whole baby formula container just fill up the 3 compartments each fit just the right amount for a full servingReason #2: this comes with a small separate mini container that hold the perfect amount for 1 bottle what we do with this is before going to bed we leave this small container right next to the bottle and a water bottle right next to that and then when the baby wakes up in middle of the night all you have to do is fill the bottle with water and just empty the formula that you have in this small container! it really makes a difference at 4 AM lol.Otherwise everything else is also very convenient, Built well easy to open/close and extremely easy to wash.If you found my review helpful itâ€™d be great if you please click yes below. I am happy to leave reviews to help others make decisions prior to purchase and I enjoy reading your reviews to help me with mine
