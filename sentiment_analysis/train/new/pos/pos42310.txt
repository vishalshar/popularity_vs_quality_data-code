We purchased a set 2 years ago and they still look fantastic. Everything still looks exactly as it did 2 years ago. When people daughter's room, they all ask if I had someone paint it. It's only on close inspection that you see it's decals. Great quality. Great service. In fact, originally I had ordered 2 sets by mistake and the seller emailed me to confirm before sending me both. All in all, I can't say enough great things about this product.
