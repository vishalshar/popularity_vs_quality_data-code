I spent months debating on the type of bedding set to buy. Looking out for cheaper deals or specials to get a matching bumper, valance and quilt, but I kept being drawn back to the Travel Time design. I was definitely not disappointed in buying this! It is a lovely bright design and it looks as good in reality as it does in the pictures. The quality of fabric is good and the bumper stays upright and doesn't sag on the cot. My main worry was that it wouldn't fit my Cot. We have the Irish/UK sized 'cotbed'. The sheet fits perfectly on the mattress, however the bumper length is slightly shorter than the length of the cotbed by about 5cm, but the width is correct. The shorter length does not really cause any problems, i just have it tied across the cotwith a slight gap between one end of the bumper and the cot end. We have hung the quilt on the wall - the quilt has hidden fabric loops at one end to allow a string or rod to be inserted to allow hanging.
