1)  This gate does require quite a bit of adjustment to get it set 'exactly right', so it really needs to be "fixed" for one particular installation (as opposed to a portable gate that you can easily pick up and use for various different doorways on a regular basis).2)  Once it's setup it's pretty good to use - easy on and easy off, which makes it nice.3)  One issue is that the baby (12 months old) is attempting to climb this . . . so we might not be using this very long.I would recommend this if you plan on using this for a single entry-way (as opposed to multiple entry ways).
