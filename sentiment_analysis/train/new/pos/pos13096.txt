I looked at a lot of gliders on amazon and it seems like the "perfect glider" either doesn't exist or it is too expensive for me.  I wanted a glider for my daughter that matched her Davinci cherry crib and changing table, so I went with this one.  My son-in-law got it put together pretty easily, and my daughter started using it right away and she said it was comfortable to sit in while she was pregnant and now that the baby is here she rocks the baby in it and it is holding up well.  She is 5'4" and her head hits in just the right spot for her.  It seems perfect for her needs, although it is a little on the small side, if it was just a little bit bigger across the seat area it would be 5 stars.  Adults range from 180- 210 lbs and it has held up well with moderate daily use.
