I wanted a nice, lightweight, reclining stroller for my 7 mo. old baby.  We are going to take him to Disney World for the first time. I remember bringing my other two boys as babies and I know from experience that a heavier "normal" stroller is way too clumsy to lift onto the tram. My husband cursed up a storm the last time we needed to bring a stroller. I have a Chicco Cortina that is my normal trunk stroller, but it's just too much to take to Disney. I've been reading all the reviews and finally settled on the Swift.  I just received it tonight and I didn't need the manual to figure out how to open/close it.  It really is simple and so lightweight.  I love the way it reclines and it will be perfect for my baby to nap in.  The canopy is full size and will work well to keep the hot FL sun out of his eyes.  I was prepared to purchase a larger snap-on canopy, but it's not necessary with this stroller.  I can hardly wait to test it out.  Only time will tell how it will last but from the looks of its construction, I predict it will fare well.  If you are on the fence between those pricier strollers and this one--do yourself a favor and get this, you won't be disappointed and you'll save some $$$.
