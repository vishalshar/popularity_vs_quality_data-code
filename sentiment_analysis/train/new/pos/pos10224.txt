As a first time mommy to be, I spent a great deal of time browsing online for the best bedding for my baby girl. I was set on having an animal theme, so when we found out we were having a girl, I didn't want to give that up, as most of the animal themed beddings were more masculine. I was SO happy when I found this on Amazon, and after looking some more, I decided this was the cutest one and I purchased it, along with the mobile, valance and wall stickers. The quality of the sheet/comforter is beautiful and very soft! I imagine my baby will be very cozy and warm :) I haven't set up the nursery yet so I haven't used the valance or the stickers, but judging but the quality of the sheets, I know I won't be disappointed.
