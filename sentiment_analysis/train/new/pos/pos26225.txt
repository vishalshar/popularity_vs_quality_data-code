After much review of other "wraps" this one is the best designed one. The instructions have one good basic tie for multiple holds unlike the many ties for many hold with other wraps. Also, this particular way of tying the wrap offers better security for the child's safety. (Using the moby I tried others' tying instructions...they were poor.) The special Kanagroo hold was a life saver for our skin to skin care in the hospital. Then came the acid reflux...so sleeping upright tied to me made both our days better. He got the rest he needed & I got the things done I needed. He is now 3.5 months...from being tied to me he is one very secure little man, sleeping in his own bed with no problems, & I still lug him around everywhere. This wrap is far better than the Baby Bjorn that tears into just the shoulder muscles eventually wearing down my back, then my knees. The Moby lets me spread the weight out across my back, over my shoulder,  & through the waist....just like it promises! I now own 2 mobies! He can right facing me on the front, facing out on the front, on my hip, & even on my back (tying instructions go the opposite way). I have toured half of Japan with him right next to my heart!
