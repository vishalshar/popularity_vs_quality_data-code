My baby's pediatrician said we could start giving him baby food now that he is four months, and I bought this wonderful set.  Right now I'm using the orange bowl, which is great for his baby food.  When I used the refrigerated leftover, I just put some on the bowl, put it in the microwave for fifteen minutes, swirl it around to cool off, and feed him.  He loves the spoon, and laughs when he sees it (and opens his mouth right away).  I don't have a dishwasher, so I don't know how it will stand up to that, but it's done find with handwashing.  I haven't used all of the items in the set yet as he is still too young, but I look forward to using them.  I do use the large sippy cup because it mentions it's for four months and up, and my doctor said to give him water after he eats so I use that for water.  Fortunately my baby doesn't care what type of vessel the food is in (never had any issues with nipple confusion with him) as long as he gets food, so he eats from the bowl, drinks some water from the sippy cup, then takes his formula in his regular Avent bottle.  If you have a child who is eating foods, this is a great set to get!  Do note that none of the items are skid proof, even though the larger green bowl does say it is but I don't see how as it has no rubber feet, it's all plastic.  But that doesn't really matter to me, and I may just add some Sugru in the future to help make it skid proof.
