We have always bought Fisher Price toys for our children and n o w that I have my first granddaughter I intend to keep purchasing them. My 4 hideaways h ad this type of musical in their cribs. It's low lighting and soothing music always did the trick of settling them down as they went to sleep. When my 3 month old granddaughter was visiting one day, we couldn't get her to stay in her crib for her nap. I asked my son and his wife why they didn't have something in the crib for her. They did, but it was too stimulating f o r sleep time. The next day I ordered this for her. Now my son tells me that she loves it. They take it with them everywhere as it settles her down instantly. Thank you Fisher Price for keeping generations of babies h happy.
