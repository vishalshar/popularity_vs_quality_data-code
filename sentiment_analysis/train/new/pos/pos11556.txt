Very cute and contains the liquid very well.  You have to try very hard to get any spills out of these.  What I love most about these cups are the fact that you can actually hear a "click" when you screw on the lid so that you know it is shut tight.  Also another plus is that it doesn't seem to impede the flow of the juice like a lot of these spill proof cups do.  My little one tends to be an impatient eater, and if it takes too long to drink or eat something, she will move on and not consume it.  I have to dump down the drain so many half full cups of juice and milk from other spill proof cups that this is a huge plus for me.
