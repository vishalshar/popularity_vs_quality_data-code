4.5 starsAfter looking through Amazon reviews, we tried 3 types of cloth diapers and inserts:1.) Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Meadow, Size One (6-18 lbs) and Thirsties Stay-Dry Duo Insert, White, Size One (6-18 lbs) (total cost twenty dollars and fifty cents)2.) Flip Individual: 1 One-Size Snap Closure Diaper Cover & 1 One-Size Stay-Dry Insert - Moonbeam (total cost seventeen dollars)3.) Blueberry One Size Deluxe Snaps, Giraffe (total cost twenty-four dollars)We only started with CDs when my daughter was 15.5 pounds and about 7 months old.  I have found Flip the best on a few counts . . .1.) Fit - the Flip adjusted to the middle set of snaps works very well for my 16 pound daughter.  The smaller size of Thirsties were too small and leaked on at least one occasion, and the Blueberries are a bit bulky for my taste.  The larger size of Thirsties fit her about the same as the Flip.2.) Cost - the Flip is by far the cheapest option here.  You must buy two sizes of Thirsties (total cost forty-one dollars) and the Blueberry diaper costs about 50% more.3.) The flip dries in one dryer cycle.  The Thirsty insert takes about a dryer cycle and a half.  This is a major issue since the primary reason we chose to CD is to do our part for the environment.In addition, I like the pockets at either end of the Flip cover.  They are larger than the pockets in the Thirsties, making it easier to arrange the insert.I have only one major complaint about these diapers.  The cover is line dry only.  It does line dry quickly, but in general, I believe baby items, especially ones that must be washed frequently, should be designed to be easily machine washed and dried.  This is the reason I gave the diaper 4 stars instead of 5.
