My baby loves it! It keeps her engaged for hours, she loves the colors, the textures (she keeps biting it, especially on the beak) and the squeaker doesn't need much pressure to function, which is great since at 3 month old babies don't have a strong grip yet. I usually just hold it in front of her and she stares at it without blinking, or shake it/squeeze it to keep her engaged. I had already bought another item from Lamaze and the quality is consistently good, I will keep looking up this brand first for all my baby's toys in the future.
