I am pretty sure most of the 1-star reviews are a result of frustration induced by incompetence and exasperation. Most of the products like this are junk, but the Brica actually worked, at least for me.TWO VERY IMPORTANT STEPS!1. You MUST jam the flap all the way down below the window seal. The corrugated seam where the plastic flap is attached to the sun shade must be below the top of the seal. Use an old credit card to jam it down there.2. An old window-tinting trick, WIndex! After you have jammed the flap down below the seal, spray both the window and sun shade with glass cleaner. Then squeegee out the windex with that old credit card and once it dries, you'll be all set. DO NOT PUT THE WINDOW DOWN FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS! Probably best to wait 48 hours and leave the car parked in the sun when possible.Be patient, if done right these things work great. I would have given it 5 stars, because it is the best I've tried, but the install is a little tricky.
