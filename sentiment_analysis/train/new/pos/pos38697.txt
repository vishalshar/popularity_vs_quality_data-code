If you are reading the reviews, please do not let the customer who is upset with Babies-R-Us influence your decision on the Eddie Bauer stroller bag!  Reviews are intended for the customer input on particular items, NOT on store experiences.  I bought this bag for a recent airline trip I took because I have heard airlines can pretty pretty rough on strollers and such.  This bag was very durable and served it's purpose very well!  My stroller was not damaged in any way and it was easy and convenient to get through the airport because of the wheels and carry straps it has!  I am very pleased with the bag and know that I will use it a lot in the next few years!  We have the Eddie Bauer blue glacier stroller/infant seat combo and it fit very easily into the bag (minus the infant seat obviously).  I definitely recommend this bag to anyone who is considering it!
