We've used this every day for the past year. It has held up well, provides adequate pressure (It's using the toilets water pressure after all...). We made sure to follow the directions and definitely empty the toilet tank before installing! haha I've heard stories from others who didn't! It hangs nicely in it's little thingy. We have had zero problems with it. None at all. Would buy again if anything did come up!
