I'm sure Littlelife had every intention to be kind to toddlers by preventing parents from overloading them. From that standpoint, this pack fits its billing.The dimensions listed (9 x 7 x 2 inches) are mostly accurate, except that the pack is slightly hump shaped, so the two-inch interior depth tapers down towards the top.For an 14 to 18 month old who wants to help, this pack would be perfect: padded "just right" on the straps and back, quality materials and durable construction to survive a little rough handling and dragging, plus the leash...However, for our 34 inch tall, 30 pound, not-quite 2Â½ year-old, it was obviously too small as soon as we opened the package.What will the Littlelife hold? We were hoping he could carry his knit nap blanket in it, but it's necessary to literally stuff it in (the blanket is about 2x3 feet).  Two or three board books, or a small lunch, or a hat and a pullover all are about the ideal sized load. And actually, that's not bad for day-tripping. But is it smaller than a bread box? Definitely -- it's too small to hold an average sized loaf of bread (cut me some slack -- trying to think of some common frame of reference).I'll next try a Wildkin Pack 'n Snack Backpack, which has roughly twice the capacity. Undecided if the Littlelife will stick around (possibly in anticipation of our youngest son using it once he's of the right age and ability), or if it's going back. I definitely like everything about this Littlelife except for the capacity.
