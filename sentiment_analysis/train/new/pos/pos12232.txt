I purchased a few different corner guards for different tables around the house and these seemed like the thickest, softest and they do stick.  I have read many of the reviews from this product and others like it, I do feel that it is advantageous to put these on when your child is not around, obviously if they see you putting it on, they will immediately want to remove them.  The tape does need time to set, I put them on the furniture after my daughter went to sleep for the night so they would have all night to set, they are rock solid having tested them myself I feel confident that my daughter will not be removing them without tools, and more importantly I feel they offer enough padding to protect her precious head, which gives a daddy a little peace of mind as his toddler is running and falling all over the place.
