I've read some comments about these receiving blankets which make me wonder whether the reviewers understand what a receiving blanket is.A receiving blanket is a thin, lightweight, inexpensive piece of fabric which derives from the simple plain cloth once used to wrap newborn babies. Originally plain white, most are now printed on one side to make them "cute". It's actually a CLOTH, not a BLANKET. But the name is accurate, not misleading advertising. They've been called receiving blankets for decades.If you think that a RECEIVING BLANKET is the same thing as a CRIB BLANKET, your confusion is probably going to create unrealistic expectations that will cause you to be unfair to Carters, a top-of-the-line provider of infant supplies.A crib blanket is a much more substantial, much heavier, much thicker, much more elegant, and considerably more expensive critter. It is truly what we usually think of as a blanket.Now, if you think that somebody is going to sell you 4 crib blankets for 10 or 15 bucks, you are hopelessly misled. For this kind of money, you are going to get exactly what you ordered -- 4 very nice quality receiving blankets.Some of the comments are sadly clueless -- they read like "I ordered a subcompact and I'm angry that they didn't send me a luxury vehicle."
