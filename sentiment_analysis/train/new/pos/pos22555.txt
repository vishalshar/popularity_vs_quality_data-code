I LOVE THIS CLOCK!  I was so happy to see the quality was what I was hoping for. What doesn't translate in the photo is that most of the design is wood, some pieces are felt (like the nose and irises), and the numbers are stamped on. This mix makes the owl all the sweeter. The clock hands are a bit delicate, easily bendable, but if the clock is on the wall and out of reach of little hands, it shouldn't be a problem. This is a great piece for your own nursery or to give as a baby shower or birthday gift.
