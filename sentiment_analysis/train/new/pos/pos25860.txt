I loved this... Had my baby a week ago.. Via CSection.. of course, you know nurses do not care if you are resting or sleeping or the baby just fell asleep...they will walk it no matter and make your life in the hospital a living no-rest hell :) but, this sign at least got them to knock before coming in...and also our visitors... Just don't expect to have people respect your time because you will have tons of traffic while you are there.We were lucky to be cleared a day before so only 3 days for us in the hospital. Yei!
