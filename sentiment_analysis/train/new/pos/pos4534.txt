I have read all the reviews on this bag before I bought it! Read the comments ect.So here's the skinny on this HUGE bag.Demos: H 12in(top to bottom) W 5in ( back to front) L 18in ( left to right)Outside:Base of the bag is 18x5 inches; with smooth metal feet.Front: The bow is the entire length of the bag (18inches)Back: 8x5in zipper pocket.Sides: the bag has snaps to make the bag thinner for short trips or wider for those longer trips.TOP:  It has a ZIPPER enclosureINSIDE:Changing pad: this is a larger pad but it has NO padding at all. For me this is not a problem.Inside back: 2 pockets, one with elastic 10x5in pocket, and a 6x7in zipper pocket.Inside Left side: 7 in deep pocket for a bottle? Not sure! :)Inside Front: 2 5x7in pockets.This also has a 48in shoulder strap with a (comfort shoulder pad. These do clip and it seems durable. Extra clips are provided.*** I am so pleased with this diaper bag. The quality is great and the material is so soft and flexible. Its very durable and practible. Some complain of the material  that lines the inside of the bag. This is a common material for diaper bags because its resistant to KIDS and their sticky fingers, food, bottles and it cleans up easy.
