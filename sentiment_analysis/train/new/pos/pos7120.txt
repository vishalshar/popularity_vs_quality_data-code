We bought two sets of these and I wish had purchased more (since they were on sale and are now back to full price).  These are great bibs and function just as you want a bib to.  They are the perfect size, large, but not so large that they are too long (which I have seen before), with a good closure that my girls cannot undo (a must!) and the material is great, easy to wipe off if the mess isn't too bad or can be thrown in washing machine and dryer if needed.
