I ordered this to replace the Amber necklace we lost. I just love the Amber necklaces as an alternative to all the medicine. My son has had no problems with his teeth, no fussing, crying etc. The only reason I know he's teething is looking in his mouth and seeing it. He also went on his first plane ride at 8 months, he did great!! We had no problem with ears hurting at take-off  & descent. Some people say I'm crazy but I swear this thing works!! Not to mention it is super cute on. We normally would wrap the previous necklace around his ankle twice, sometimes as a necklace. With this one it could only be worn as a necklace it was just slightly larger than the previous one ( it was the multi-colored one, same company) So we just use it as a necklace for now. Ended up finding the old one, and it looks to be just a bead longer. Also due to the shapes of all the beads being different, that can happen.
