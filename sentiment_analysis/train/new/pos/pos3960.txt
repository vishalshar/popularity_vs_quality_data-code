In my opinion I would say I am addicted to collecting strollers. I love them and have to have one of every kind. This was the one I chose for my "umbrella" category. And boy am I satisfied. Having so many, I would like to think I know what I am talking about when I review them. And this one is great for the money. I wanted an umbrella stroller that looked somewhat high-end without the high-end price of others. I wanted one that was super light weight and I could just shove in the trunk or backseat quickly without much effort. This one was perfect for all of that. It folds up relatively small. I have had other cheapy umbrella strollers that I wouldn't use cause of little issues here and there. One being I am taller and I would have to take baby steps while pushing them so I wouldn't hit my feet on them. Not this one, the handles are high enough I don't have this problem at all. This one also has a great canopy not normally seen on strollers of its price. And the design is one of my favorite things about it. It is a nice European design that is so highly coveted these days! I love that it has a nice padded bar across the front, this is handy when I am in a hurry and don't want to buckle my 2 year old in. It has a good recline for a umbrella style, obviously it doesn't go down flat, most dont, but it does go quite a ways. And when it is reclined it has sides to it so your childs head while sleeping doesn't slip behind the bars. The foot rest I would say is the only thing I am not thrilled about. It is somewhat flimsy but really nothing that bothers me too much, you get what you pay for. The straps are good and sturdy. And don't let the pictures fool you, it looks like the way it sits you child would have their legs sticking straight out, well that little flap has a lever on both side that lets you lower it! Overall this is a very highly recommended stroller. Great for vacation!
