I bought these for our nursery at church.  They are very, very cute, easy to apply and easy to move.  I admit I'm a bit obsessive about getting things straight so I had to remove and reapply quite a few of these.  They came off easily and stuck to the walls even after a lot of repositioning.  They've been up for about six weeks now and they are not peeling at all.However, there is nowhere near enough stickers on this sheet to do an entire room.  I combined them with Roommates Just Dots Primary Wall Decals in order to decorate all four walls.
