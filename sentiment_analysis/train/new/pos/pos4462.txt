We bought one for our three year old when he turned one and just bought one for our hefty 6 mo old who looks uncomfortable in his Britax infant car seat. Love these. Once you install it, it's a piece of cake for all installations to follow. We use the latch system for both boys (forward and rear facing). Also- the entire cover is removeable and washable. The only tough part are the holes by the hips/ putter thighs. You have to shimmy and stretch the fabric around the plastic edges. It's a pain for the first but the second time around it was easy and putting it back on was easier than I thought. Cute green color. This will be the car seat until he exceeds the limits in height and weight.
