This is my 5 month old son's favorite toy right now.  He loves the crinkle page, and the squeaker, even though I have to make it squeak for now.  He chews on every part of this book and will drop even his fancy expensive toys at the sight of this book and reach for it.  He gives it two very slobbery thumbs up!
