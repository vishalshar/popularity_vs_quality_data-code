I ordered this set in particular because the green looked so vibrant and looked like it would mix well with other linens. I was not dissappointed. The dominant shade of green I would best describe as that of a grass stain. We're having a little girl so I bought just regular jersey knit sheets in blue, pink, and purple and they all mix in nicely. The blanket and bumper are surprisingly soft and fluffy.Although the price, including the nearly $20 for shipping, is far lower than most baby bedding sets with only a few items, I still feel kind of taken because I will only be using the bumper, blanket, dust ruffle, and maybe the sheet. It's just as well, because other than those items, the remainder are very scratchy and generally seem low quality. The items I will be using fluffed up well after a washing and feel very soft, but there were a lot of loose threads that I couldn't trace where they came from. The other items could do the same thing, but I have no use for them so I just left them in the packing container.The color on the set is great and the quality on what I would consider the core bed linen items seems to be midrange. It's definitely a gender neutral set with an adorable pattern that can be worked to be more girly or boyish. The shipping was timely and I received the set a few days before I anticepated.
