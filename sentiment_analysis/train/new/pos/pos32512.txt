This was purchased for my boyfriend's birthday as our daughter had just been born only three weeks prior. I wanted to use one of the professional hospital pictures of my daughter and her father but the only one I had was a 6x4 (vertical). I was able to flip the frame into a vertical position and it still is an amazing picture frame. It does not lose any of the sentiment. It is a well-made picture  frame. It was slightly on the more expensive side than I typically like to spend on frames but it was definitely worth the money.
