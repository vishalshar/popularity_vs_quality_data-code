I looked at many tubs and this one really caught my eye. I received it as a gift from my sister. The base comes off easily. The base and the baby seat fits perfectly inside the tub itself for storage. I have a boy and I have to say, the seat isn't great for boys because it looks like it squishes his privates, that might just be me being paranoid because he's comfortable in it.
