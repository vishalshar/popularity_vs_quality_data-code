I just wanted to post here and clear up something about this item:In an older version of this toy, Sassy made this toy slightly different. Instead of two clear pastic balls, one of the balls was replaced by a plastic (i think it was a ladybug or something like that?) that played music. It had a little speaker box with holes in it, and also a small compartment for the battery that was screwed on.The music would play if the toy moved even the slightest bit. You will read in many of the reviews that this was very annoying, since there is no off button. I definitely agree with that (although my daughter seemed to enjoy it!). As you know, babies drool and barf and one time my daughter barfed right on this toy, filled the speaker holes with her spit up. The music stopped playing. There is another reviewer here that had the same thing happen --- and to their surprise when they opened up the battery compartment they found the battery had been corroded from the liquid! Needless to say after I read that my wife and I threw away the old toy.Now the newer version (the one that is CURRENTLY sold here on Amazon) is as shown in the picture --- two clear plastic balls. This newer version does NOT play music. The only sounds it makes is a slight rattle from the little plastic pieces inside one of the big plastic balls. Aside from that, this is the same toy as before. I like this newer version better as it is less annoying for the parent and there are no electronics to be barfed on. I have had no problems with the suction cup but others have noted that it does not stick well for them, so maybe it just depends on the surface.
