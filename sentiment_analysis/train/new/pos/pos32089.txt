After reading multiple reviews about baby blankets I decided to get this one for my 9 month old son.  My son loves to snuggle with anything soft from towels to coats to blankets.  I'm so happy I choose this blanket for him he absolutely loves it.  I did read some reviews about if you dry it the soften goes away.  My son has acid reflux so we are always washing his stuff so I have choosen not to dry it yet.  All in all this is a very soft good sized blanket for babies I highly recommend this for a child that loves to snuggle!!
