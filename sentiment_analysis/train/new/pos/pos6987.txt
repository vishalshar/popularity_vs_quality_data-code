I like this cooler, but the structure is a little bit flimsy. It is soft sided all around with the silver cooler padding inside. The outside is made of plastic but is holding up to being carried back and forth to preschool (by mom). It's quite roomy inside and I like the zipper and handles at the top to keep things upright. I use two little block ice packs and lunch stays cool from 7-noon. I have been using it almost 6 months and it is still in good shape. No smells. You can dunk it and wash it and it dries out overnight. I will keep using it as long as it holds together. I wouldn't recommend if it is being hauled around by an elementary aged child, since it may or may not hold up being dropped or dragged along the bus floor and shoved into a cubby on a repeated basis.
