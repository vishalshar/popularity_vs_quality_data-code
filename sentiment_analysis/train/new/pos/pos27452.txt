Looks cool, sturdy, but small. I've been tryin to get a nice razor sharp edge on it but failed. However I decided to put a pocket knife bevel on it and the edge holds nicely. It aint shaving sharp still, but it makes a great box cutter. Just remember it won't lock, that blade moves around. So if u followed my advice and made a pocket knife out of it, don't cut yourself.
