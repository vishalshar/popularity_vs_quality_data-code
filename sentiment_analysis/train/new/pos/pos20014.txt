This bouncy seat has come in very handy for my 3 month old.  I usually use the highest bounce setting or leave it turned off.  As he gets bigger he overpowers the built in bounce, but that works out pretty well for him.  It is really light weight so I use it all over the house when I need to set my baby down while I am doing something in the room.
