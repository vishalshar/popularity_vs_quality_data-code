Pros:1. Five stackable shapes - awesome because I'm not hunting for multiple pieces. I can click them all together and I quickly know if I'm missing a piece.2. Kids love elephants3. Colors are bright4. The three year old likes to keep her hot wheel cars inside it.Cons:1. Other reviewers have mentioned the pinching between the wheel and the belly. That is a definite possibility, but it isn't going to cut them and all you need to do is turn the wheel in the other direction to release their finger. I think this would happen with the younger babies. Mine is two months shy of her 3rd birthday.2. Child will need adult help to remove packed in hot wheel cars.3. You can store the shapes inside the elephant, but you need to make sure that his trunk is lifted up or they will slip right out. Best to click them all together and slip it through the trunk.Summary: My kid plays with it every day. We all have fun with it.
