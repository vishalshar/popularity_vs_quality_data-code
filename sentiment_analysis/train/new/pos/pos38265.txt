I absolutely love the Thirsties Stay-Dry Duo Insert, White, Size Two. We call our little girl "Gallons" as a nickname (lol only as an inside joke with my husband). She would go through three disposables at night and still be leaking by the morning. With these I double up at night the duo inserts with a duo size 2 and a duo size 1 on top inside the Thirsties cover. She never leaks! Totally dry in the morning and they hold so much liquid it is crazy. She is potty trained during the day, but I am sure changing every 2-3 hours the single duo insert would be fine and leakproof for daily use. The micro fleece cover keeps her dry while the hemp liners hold most of the liquid. The hemp liner hold SO much liquid they can take a while to dry. I run them through one dry cycle and they may be a little damp, but after I hang them overnight they are dry by morning. Washing them is easy, I use the sanitize cycle on my washer and with prewash selected they are totally clean after one run. I don't even unsnap them when washing or drying. I followed the prep instructions well form another reviewer and washed and dried between each initial prep wash. They have all worked like a charm and are so much better than any of the other brand inserts or refolds I own.  I can't wait to start using these with my next baby due in January.  I will never go back to disposables.
