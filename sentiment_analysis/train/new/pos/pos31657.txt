This bedding is really soft, and the colors are bright. The sheets fit a standard size crib/toddler mattress perfectly.  Held up nicely in the wash.  The only thing I do not like about this set is that the print of the flat sheet is only on the front side.  I think it would look nicer if it were harder to distinguish between the front and back, if both sides looked and felt the same.  The back of the flat sheet isn't as soft as the front.  Simple fix...just turn it over.  But, I wish I didn't have to. (Maybe all printed microfiber sheets are this way?  I'm not sure).  The quilt is light enough to use in the summer (the main reason I purchased this set) and is a good size without being too large.  The pillow case will fit a standard size pillow and is very nice looking, but it looks as though the fabric may be a bit thin.  I'm curious as how it will hold up over time, but because she won't be using this set for more than a year or so before she's moved to a bigger bed, I am not too concerned.  For the price I paid, I'm very pleased!
