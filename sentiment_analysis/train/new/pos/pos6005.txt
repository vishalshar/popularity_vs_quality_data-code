I'm writing this review after about 2 months of use. We started with a cloth diaper service right when my baby was born, and have been using both Rumparooz and Blueberry Diaper Covers ever since. I ordered four or five of each and have found that they are essentially the same except:1. Rumparooz is generally smaller in size and style2. Rumparooz has a tighter elastic in general (which ended up leaving marks on my baby, and she's long and thin, not chubby), and has elastic on both leg gussets. The Blueberry has elastic on the inner leg gusset and is a little looser on the outer leg gusset, so it suited my baby much better (no red marks!)3. the Rumparooz has elastic on the front (good for when she had an umbilical cord stump and was tiny anyways), while the Blueberry is smooth and straight from the front (much better now, as the elastic of the Rumparooz is starting to leave red marks under her belly button now)4. The Snap of the Blueberry are much better placed, and it's easy to see what setting we're using because there is a slight space in the center of the snaps, and the snaps are placed diagonally so it is a better fit. I've already went down a setting on the Rumparooz for her, and the fit is just not as good...5. Overall quality of the material is better on the Blueberry- it's thinner and ventilates better I feel.I will say, though, that on both covers, the white picks up stains. If and when I buy more, I will definitely get darker colors. Overall, the Rumparooz were great when she was a newborn (small with the umbilical cord to care for), but now on out I'll be investing in the Blueberry.
