I can't comment on how well these work for their intended use, but I absolutely love them. We started using them with our first son as a burp rag, and after a few washings I was pleasantly surprised with how soft they became. They absorb the messiest of spit-ups and never seem to stain. 2 1/2 years later, we're still using them - mostly for our newborn son, but our older son also uses them as a "lovey" (that's how soft they are!) - he won't go to bed without one.I was upset when I couldn't find these in the store after our second son was born, so I'm thrilled that Amazon was able to pull through for me. We misplaced quite a few of them along the way, so I was able to re-stock us with two new packages. I feared that they wouldn't be the same quality as the ones we bought years ago, but even after one wash they've already softened up and seem quite promising.
