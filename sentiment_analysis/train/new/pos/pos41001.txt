I started off with just one pack, not knowing if these would work out well.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could easily adapt them to my flush face Ikea cabinets.  I even used one set on a lazy susan cabinet door.  See my video for that one.  If you're creative, these should work great for both flush and traditional cabinets.Our baby boy is pretty strong, and he has yet to break one of the doors open.  It would be almost impossible unless the screws rip out.  I also saw one review that mentioned that it would not lock sometimes.  I suspect the locks weren't well aligned, or that that the manual override button was partially engaged.  This one gets an easy 5 stars from me.
