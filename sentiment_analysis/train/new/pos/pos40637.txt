I purchased these along with the "CherryCreek Decals Jungle Monkeys Giant Peel & Stick Wall Sticker Decal" decals CherryCreek Decals Jungle Monkeys Giant Peel & Stick Wall Sticker Decal as well to decorate my daughter's nursery. The monkeys in the 2 sets are not exactly the same size but they are close enough where they look as if they came from one pack.The instructions on how to put together the designs are pretty straightforward (and you can always deviate and align the decals however your imagination wants to). They do, however, take some time to put up if you want them to look nice as you have to be careful and have patience. They are pretty easy to unstick from the wall and reposition if needed. I had to do this several times to get some of the monkey tails positioned correctly.I did not experience the issue that some people had with the decals falling off. Once on, they stuck pretty well. I did this in a hot July summer with lots of humidity and had no issues with applying them. They're still up 2 months later.I've gotten so many compliments on these decals. Everyone loves our nursery theme. My 2-week old daughter also seems to like the decals. Although she can't see far or make them out, she is definitely interested in the contrast of these decals against the white walls. So a hit, even with a newborn!Note: Unlike the Jungle Monkeys Giant Peel & Stick Wall Sticker Decal, this set does not give you overall sizing dimensions of the whole set laid out. So this set is especially super customizable based on your imagination.
