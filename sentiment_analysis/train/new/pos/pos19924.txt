With a 3yr old son and 5 yr old daughter, we have purchased a LOT of bathtub toys. My kids play with this set, as well as the dinosaur set from Edushape for hours (or at least until all the hot water is gone). The toys in any of the sets (the one I'm reviewing first has cars, bus, rescue vehicles, street and street signs) allow them to use their imagination to enact movement and sounds of the vehicles. It's fun to watch them dream up new scenarios.What I love about these toys compared to others that I've had is how quickly they dry. We've all had bath toys that squirt get moldy and gross inside. Others tend to get slimy. Not these. They dry quickly and are easy to wipe clean.One reviewer mentioned that they were of lower quality than the Alex brand and I have not found that to be true at all. We've had these for about 2 months and there is no fading, chipping off of colors or any other quality issues. The pieces are thick and sturdy and are holding up well to nightly abuse. The colors are still bright and look great. They make a great gift, too. :)Update 12/11: Have had three of these sets for nearly a year and every piece is holding up as new. Kids are now 4 and 6 and still pllay with them during every bath. How many toys can you say that about a year later? :)
