I have used this unrefined shea butter since the day I found out I was pregnant I was about 7 weeksand my skin still looks fantastic and my skin still looks fantastic. since I'm growing faster I'm applying in the morning after my shower and one more time throughout the day just to be safe. this is the most moisturizing product I have ever used in my entire life. I will never waste another dollar to purchase another lotion, please save yourself the time and money and hassle of never staying soft and try this stuff out! no words can explain how happy I am to give this stuff a shot. a little bit goes a long way and I'm still on my first container. affordable and effective!
