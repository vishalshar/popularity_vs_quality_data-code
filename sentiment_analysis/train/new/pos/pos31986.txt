Before this swing my son only slept well when he co-slept with me.  Now I have this swing next to my bed and he sleeps in this swing every night.  It rocks him to sleep and he'll stay comfortably asleep in it for most of the night.  Recently we traveled and I dissembled it (an easy process) and packed it in a suitcase with the rest of his stuff.  He was able to sleep comfortably, just the same as usual, while we were away from home.  That alone is priceless!  I like the ability to set the timer for it to turn off and I like that the music isn't obnoxious.  Also, it seems like when you are on the lowest levels the swing is hardly moving.  This is a great transition for the swing stopping and can help baby sleep in it longer.  The portability of this swing in great -- I've taken it into the bathroom to have him close while I get ready for the day and I've taken it to our backyard so that I can watch our older child play.  We have a full sized cradle swing we keep in the living room for during the day, but I wouldn't want to live without this as our nighttime and traveling swing.
