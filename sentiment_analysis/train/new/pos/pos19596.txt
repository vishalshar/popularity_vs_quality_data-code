These little duckies look just as they were pictured. If you are planning on buying these as parties favors or handouts they are perfect. I decided to buy them just because I love rubber ducks. The only thing I was disappointed about is that I did not receive three of each duck. I still got twelve ducks but I got 2 soccer ducks and 4 basketball ducks. None the less these make awesome gifts, toys, etc. and for such a good price at about 60 cents per ducky they are awesome.
