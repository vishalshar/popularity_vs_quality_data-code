Received our package today,  my little one seems to love it. First minutes on it and he could already figure out how to walk backwards. Works great on hard floor, carpet not so much. It seems to me  that my little one will have to work on his legs muscles in order for him to be able to walk  on carpet. It seems just too difficult for him to move in any direction on carpet, as if on carpet his weight had doubled. Otherwise we are happy with our purchase. It is easy to assemble,  seems to be well built, it collapses  (in my opinion it is a plus), the toys and noises from the  steering wheel keep baby interested. Overall we are happy.
