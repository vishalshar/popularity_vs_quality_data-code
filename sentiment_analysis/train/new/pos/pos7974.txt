Ordered 2 and received them about a month later (which is normal for China Post). The patches are extremely good quality. I use amazon to order cosplay pieces very often, and I usually have a general idea from the photos that the quality might be slightly less than described. However, these patches were better than depicted, they look closer to canon than the photos and they ARE iron-on. Of course, with iron-on I always suggest sewing the corners down just in case, but these are great black-and-white patches and I definitely recommend them.
