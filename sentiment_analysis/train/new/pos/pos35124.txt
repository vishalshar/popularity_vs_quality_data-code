Yes, as others have said, this little potty is haunted but fantastic.  It WILL just start singing in the middle of the night and scare the buhjeepers out of you but you can just turn it off after your little one takes their last potty of the evening.  With that said, my son LOVES this potty.  You pee and it sings, you flush it and it lights up and sings.  It's adorable.  I wish more things in life cheered you on for the little stuff.  Hurray for this haunted potty!
