I started looking for some guards after our first "four-year-old shutting the door on one-year-old's finger" incident. I wanted to prevent a trip to the hospital. I was originally looking for some with super saver shipping but I couldn't find quite what I wanted. I'm really glad I bought these. The shipping is reasonable and it's just what I needed to protect my kids' fingers. The material they're made of is hard enough to not break easily, especially if they're taken on and off a lot, but soft enough that it has a little "give" so as to not easily break the door hinges. You can place them pretty much anywhere on the door you want to, even the hinge side. Keep in mind, you won't be able to move the door much if you put these on the hinge side or close to the hinge side on the top, but that will help protect little fingers from getting pinched in the hinge side, which can be worse than the knob side. Good quality product for the price.
