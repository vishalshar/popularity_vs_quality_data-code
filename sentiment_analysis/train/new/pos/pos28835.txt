Great for organization and the protection of those precious baby teeth.The materials are VERY sturdy, the clear plastic covering the tooth slots is strong!  Strong enough so that if you have the tooth not quite in the slot and the plastic (which is kinda hard to move) slides over the tooth, the tooth will break....  (yes, one of her beautiful baby teeth split right in half because it had popped up when I was trying to slide the plastic cover over it and it just snapped in half.)Love that it has a zipped case.  It also has a ribbon on the zipper, which is handy because I hide this in my closet between stacks of clothes and the ribbon is the only part I have sticking out - therefore, I know where it is and it's easy to grab, but my daughter has no clue.Speaking of which, this case seems to be designed FOR your child, as in, your child apparently should know that all their baby teeth are going in this album.  The Tooth Fairy takes all of her teeth, so this case is really for me, and possibly for her as an adult, so I wish it was geared more like a baby book instead of geared towards the child in their childhood years.The artwork on it is UGLY, I'm not a fan at all of the crazy eyed cartoon kids with gigantic heads.  I would have preferred just a simple cute tooth or maybe even just a plain case but no other tooth cases that did have much more muted artwork were this quality.  I haven't compared the size to an actual cd case yet, but they are pretty close so maybe I'll get a cute cd case and swap it out somehow.  It's just so ugly!
