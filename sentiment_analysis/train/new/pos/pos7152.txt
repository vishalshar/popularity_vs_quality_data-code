This was perfect. Loved all the ruffles... Seems well made for what it is. Was cheaper to buy the pieces you need separately than to purchase a whole set. I like that it's plain and not themey... Was able to put together a nice classy nursery for my granddaughter as a Christmas gift for my pregnant daughter.
