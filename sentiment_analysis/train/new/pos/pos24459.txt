I've been really pleased with this diaper so far.  To begin with, one cover and two inserts is a great deal; mine were about $7.50 each. I started out with two of these, but it worked so well I bought two more.I've only used it for a few weeks now, but this one has been washed many times and is holding up well.  The inner lining definitely keeps them dry, and it has not started to pill up like another cheap cloth diaper I bought at the same time.  We'll see what a year of washing tells, but so far so goodThe inserts they come with soaked up a lot.  I do need two inserts at night; it once soaked the tummy area on my son when I didn't have an extra insert.  I've used it as a pocket diaper, and I've also laid the insert on top of the whole diaper.  I have used a disposable liner once to see how that went, and it made clean up super easy.I've had no leaks or blowouts, and it has already been road tested for sure.  They've cleaned up really well and pretty easily.  Look pretty much like new still with a barely visible off-white look in the inner lining of a few.  No sign of any rash or irritation from these whatsoever.  Keeps them as dry as disposable diapers would.My child seems to be happy and comfortable in these.  Big bang for your buck here.  I'm not going to drop big bucks on name brands of diapers when these are so awesome.  Even if they only hold up well through one child, it'd be cheaper for me to buy more of these and avoid pricy cloth diapers.
