This hamper is a great matching item to go with the Cocalo Jacana bedding set. It has a nice mesh bag on the inside that is easily removable to carry the clothes down to the laundry. The hamper is a little flimsy (because it folds up which is nice for storage) but works fine for infant/toddler clothing. I had one just like (with a different pattern) for my older daughter and it held up about 3 years. By that point, she managing to break it by putting her weight on it repeatedly and filling it up too heavy.
