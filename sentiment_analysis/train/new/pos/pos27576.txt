I absolutely love this diaper bag!!  I have two kids, ages 2 1/5 and 4 months.  This bag is great for carrying their stuff and mine all together.  My favorite part is all the different compartments because they really help to organize your things and remember where everything is.  The labels on the pouches make it almost fool-proof!  I've gotten many compliments on the bag already and I've only had it for about two weeks!  The only thing that sort of bugs me is the flap.  It's not a flaw, just personal preference.  If I had my way, I'd have the chocolate brown love tote with a long strap like this one has, instead of the two short straps that it comes with because I like to hang it over my stroller.  If each of them came with short straps and a removable long strap it would be awesome!  Anyway, just an idea, but I really do love the bag!  I recommend it to any mom who wants to carry around their baby's things and theirs in the same bag.
