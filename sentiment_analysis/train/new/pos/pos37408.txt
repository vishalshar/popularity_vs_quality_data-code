After doing a lot of research on this topic, I understood that many companies just will NOT disclose the specific flame retardant chemicals used on their bedding and juvenile products.  The beige "unbleached cotton" quilted pad top feels like pure cotton, on the underside of the quilted pad, you find a stiff white fabric -- I believe this would be the cotton/poly blend from the product description.  The wool padding in the quilted top seems to be of appropriate weight.  The label does not state anything about complying with the California Technical Flammability Bulletein 117.  I wrote to BabyNatura and asked them about what chemicals if any are used in this pad.  I waited for a few days and then returned the pad because I did not hear from them and was afraid it has flame retardants in it.  But today I received a reply from them "We sincerely apologize for the delayed response. We have not had access to the web questions as we are switching over to a new server.We hope you are enjoying your classic mattress pad. There are no flame retardants used on the mattress pad that you have. Wool creates a natural fire barrier. The underside of the classic baby crib mattress pad is made of cotton. There are no off-gassing, and no chemicals in any of the materials in your mattress pad. I hope this helps answer your question and eases your mind.  Take care"So, I guess, this is a non-toxic mattress pad after all, which is a relief. The chemical companies should be prohibited from poisoning babies and children right from birth without even disclosing what type of the poison they are using and making claims like "organic" and "all natural" ... It's scary if you learn what poisons they routinely use in baby products, without even disclosing anything... But, fortunately, you can find some non-toxic products today if you look carefully and investigate...
