Only being able to compare this product with an old Fisher Price monitor I can say that this monitor is crystal clear. The old Fisher Price one gave out a constant fussy hum and picked up far to much noise around the room (eg the wind blowing past our windows). I'm confused though about the packaging between this Graco Ultra Clear Monitor and with the 'Graco Clear Range Monitor' the only apparent difference being 'microchip technology' while both are using 'telephone technology'. However I guess the extra $10 is worth it because this is definately crystal clear, without hissing and without interference. It genuinely only picks up our babies sounds. It is not interfering with our 2.4Ghz cordless phone and I have no idea about the review which says 'it's too loud'. Turn the volume all the way up and only when you put a monitor to your ear can you hear hissing, which is why you only need the volume set down to 2 or 3 (out of 4). It has two channels and so far I've not even had need to try a different channel due to static or interference. Who needs 2.4Ghz monitors (for greater range) like the Sony one- unless you plan on mowing the grass outside while monitoring? And the advantage here is you're provided with two monitors not just one.
