After reading the reviews about the bags not being very big, I paid attention to how large "large" is... they're not huge, but they hold quite a few diapers in each bag.  I carry both bags around with me - one for the diapers if there's nowhere to throw them out right away, and one for dirty food bowls, spoons, etc. (by the way, the person that is talking about one of the bags being tiny must have purchased the other bag pack where you see the "big" bag and then a cute little postage stamp bag in the picture - this set has two "large" bags, as it claims).The one thing that I was worried about when I got them was that there was just a draw-string closing mechanism.  I thought - oh man, this isn't going to keep poopy diapers in and smell from coming out.  So, being the geeky scientist that I am, I did the experiment that all of you will not want to do - I put a soiled diaper in the bag, drew it closed and waited.  For quite a few days, just to see how smelly it would get.  It never got smelly.  I was flabbergasted.  So, I'm buying a set for Christmas gifts for all the new parents I know.Seriously, these bags are great!  And the best part, they're really reasonably priced!
