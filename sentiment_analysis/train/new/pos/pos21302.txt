I bought this for our son (who is now turning 6 months), thinking that the bright colors might attract him. Not only did he love this toy, but he enjoys chewing on the ends of this and feeling all the textures this rattle offers.Also, this rattle is very easy to clean and very easy for a little baby to manipulate. This is easily one of my son's favorite toys right now.This rattle is made mostly of plastic, but the little lines of color radiating out of the middle of the rattle are actually bits of ribbon which offer a different texture for babies to explore.
