I've tried a half dozen different bottles with my babies and these have been the best by far. Other bottles let my babies swallow too much air resulting in gas, tummy aches and spitting up.When they get old the bottom seal becomes weak and starts leaking, but replacements are available. I only had to replace between kids, not while we were regularly using the bottles.
