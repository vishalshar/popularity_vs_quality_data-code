We have to give our 3 month old daughter reflux medicine, vitamin d drops, and probiotics. This dispenser allows us to mix all three together, and give them at the same time, in an easy way. This also allows her to take the medicine more easily than with a syringe, because her sucking reflex is stronger than her taste buds at this point. A few drops of the medicine always seem to be left in the dipsenser after she's finished sucking, but it hasn't been an issue. I just pop off the top, and put it up to her lips and tip the remaining drops in her mouth.
