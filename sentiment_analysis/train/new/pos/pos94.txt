I bought these bags for a trip, knowing that they would be helpful in case we had any "poopy-dos" while traveling. The bags were great for diapers and much more. They were handy on the plane for any garbage created until a crew member could come along to collect. They were also great for soiled clothes until they could be washed.They hold a lot more than just a dirty diaper. In fact, you could probably fit two in the bag easily and still tie it shut tightly.The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming, unless you stick your nose in the bag they come in and take a big sniff. One bag on its own is just enough to assist in the concealing of diaper odors, but not something a bystander would even notice.For the price they are a steal. I recently had to contain a foul smelling "poopy-do" and could actually place it in one of these bags and throw it away in the house. Usually I would need to take it directly outside to the trash can. A lot less spendy then a diaper genie approach, which I hear are not all that great.Ultimate, if you get these I am sure you will find more that the single intended use for them as I did. Looking forward to seeing how else they might be of use as I have so many bags to go through that hardly cost me anything to purchase. For the price give them a try.
