I am very happy with this product.  We originally purchased another "high end" dual stroller, however we eventually realized how cumbersome and heavy it was.  Certainly not easy for a mom that just had a C-section to maneuver out of a car.  So we bought this snap and go frame.  Lightweight (1/3 the weight of our other stroller), easy to transport (built in carrying handle is a plus).  Super easy to unfold.  Relatively easy to set up and fit for seats.  Fits our seats (Graco snug ride), and is well made.Another reviewer noted that the two car seats can be close and smush the rear baby's feet.  I found that by adjusting the bar height adjustments (you can mount in "up" or "down" position), you can create a good amount of seperation between the car seats.  I placed both bars in the down position (in fact the front, I mounted underneath the rails instead of on top).  This angles the seats slightly to create some foot room for the rear occupant.All in all, it was all that I hoped it would be.  Very helpful and portable.
