After purchasing a $300 high end carseat that I absolutely hate, we moved to this Cosco one. While simple, it is effective and sits snuggly in the backseat. The adjustable strap heights make it long lasting and a great value for the price paid. It's much simpler to place your toddler and get them buckled in than the carseats with the higher sides to them. The seat cover comes off easily for simpler cleaning. If your little one is wiggly to get in and buckled up without losing your cool- trust me, save yourself the aggravation and get this simple, easy to use carseat.
