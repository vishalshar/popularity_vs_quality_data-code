I purchased this gate as a replacement to a plastic pressure gate we were using near the top of our stairs.  It was chosen because I was looking for something that would look nice with our woodwork, be sturdy, have replacement parts available, and easy to swing in and out of the way.While this gate can be mounted at an angle, I did not need to do so as our stairs have a small landing at the top which allowed me to mount the gate between two walls.  This presented it's own challenge as the gate is meant to be mounted directly to wood and I had to dig through my hardware to find long enough screws to mount through drywall and into the studs.  The included hardware was not sufficient for this.The directions were acceptable, but you really do need to work slowly and patiently to install this gate and really study the instructions. I'm fairly handy with small projects like this and it took approximately an hour to put this gate up and proved frustrating at times.  Unfortunately, KidCo failed to include the paper mounting template in the box, so I was left attaching the wall hardware by lining up the gate and eyeballing it which took longer than it needed to.For installation I suggest having handy a screwdriver, a level, a pencil, and a drill (for pilot holes).  I would also suggest having a little felt to stick on the gate to pad it wherever it might hit a wall or other obstacle when it's open to prevent damage.Once the gate was installed it's been worth the trouble it took to get it in.  It's sturdy enough that my child at 30 lbs can pull himself up and stand on the bottom rung without ripping the thing apart, and it looks great.
