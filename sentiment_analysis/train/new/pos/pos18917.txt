I chose these cloud decals after looking at dozens of different products.  The shading of the clouds looks great.  They are made of heavy, durable material that easily sticks and can easily be peeled off and placed on the wall again.  You can't make these look bad!  Everyone who sees the nursery loves them.  highly recommended.
