These are great!! We went on a family vacation to Panama for 2 weeks where Mosquitos feast of foreigners and my two kiddos didn't have one bite! Excellent! Made our vacation even more awesomeJust make sure you buy enough! They lasted about 2-3 days depending on the humidity and other factors so stock up!
