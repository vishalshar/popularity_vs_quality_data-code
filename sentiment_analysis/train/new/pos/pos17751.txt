I bought these diaper pins to hold together burlap wrappings around our outside bushes located at my house. It has been 2 months since I bought them and they seem to have held up very well in the cold weather. They are very easy to snap or unsnap in place. So far the plastic seems to be sturdy enough for the cold weather too. I still gave 5 stars since they really did the job for me and were not too small that they would be a hassle to pin/unpin. Now as to how they would work for diapers that is a whole different story, but being a dad with small babies once I would think they would work fine. Seemed like a great price and reasonably quick delivery too.
