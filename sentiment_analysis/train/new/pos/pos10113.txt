This is one of the best purchases I have made for my daughter, and I even ended up purchasing a second one!I ended up taking out their custom wipe case and just putting in one of the Pampers Sensitive packs simply because it was easier, but other than that I've had no complaints.  It's easy to wipe off and disinfect, and while my daughter is quickly getting too long for it, it works well for keeping her tiny bum off of the public changing stations.  I may pack a larger mat with me in the near future, but it will roll up in this thing pretty easily I'm sure.Update: My 8 month old is now officially 30" long and longer than the pad itself, which has a 22"x12" area to put her on.  The entire roll, however, has a total length of 38" if you include the mesh storage sections and I can use that to pillow her head when I lay her on it.  Additionally, I've rolled up a changing pad into one of the mesh storage areas (I was able to fold the one that came with my diaper bag in there no problem). That way I can still use the genie as a diaper/wipe/changing-pad storage solution for on-the-go travel.
