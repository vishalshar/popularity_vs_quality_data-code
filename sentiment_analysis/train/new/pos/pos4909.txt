The quilt is really cute and perfect for a girls room! The other items that go into the room match very well. I will say that if you choose this item as a start up, don't wait until the last minute. The Diaper Bag is made very cheaply and wont last very long. It was the biggest disappointment because I thought it would be very stylish when I ordered the entire set.Advice to the people that sell this product would be to find better packaging. It was place into what reminded me of a garbage bag, by the time it had arrived it had tears in the bag that if any worse I would have had to return the entire shipment. I was lucky I didn't have to, but someone else may not be as lucky.
