We love this diaper bag. I think I've bought four now but this is the one we use. We broke one within weeks (and we are not hard on these things, it just wasn't well made for daily use), and the other two were more decorative than functional. This one is a great mix, it looks fab but it is also hardy and functional and will see some wear for some months to come...
