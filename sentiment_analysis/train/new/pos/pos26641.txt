I purchased the matching Lemon Posy diaper clutch and this looks great along with it. The handle with button closure works great at attaching to the clutch. The snap is very sturdy and so is the handle.I have had several other brands of pacifier pods with a previous child and none of them held up very well. They were all very small and did not clean up well.This one I love for several reasons:1. The material is not stiff, so you can stuff a lot in there2. Easy to clean; I am not sure if you are supposed to place it in the washer or dishwasher but it held up in both. On accident it got throw in the dishwasher and it held up fine. I did place it in the washing machine in a lingerie bag and it worked great; just don't dry it!3. Although the pod is small i was able to fit a nipple cover and a binky inside itOverall i would suggest it to anyone with a child that requires a binky or a nipple cover.
