These bottles are perfect for starting your baby out on baby food because you can add a little breast milk or formula to thin it out.  If you are somewhere and you don't want the mess that comes along with feeding a baby these are very convenient. Also if you have a baby who never seems satisfied these are perfect for mixing infant rice cereal with breast milk or formula. They work a lot better then simply cutting a hole in a nipple on a bottle!!!I used these with all four of my children and absolutely loved them! Some people talk bad about "baby food bottle" claiming they cause child obesity... that is a bunch of bull....!  Not one of my children is even close to being overweight! You choose how much and what you feed your children! I highly recommend these even if its just for occasional use.
