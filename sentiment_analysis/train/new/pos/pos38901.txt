I have had this for almost 3 years. My daughter has severe allergies and constantly has nasal blockage due to lots of mucus. This has been the only thing that helps. I spray her nose with saline and wait a couple of minutes and then use the baby nose clear and it works wonders. Recently my cat got ahold of the filter and put a hole in in so it's no longer usable. I bought the nosefrieda as a back up until I could get another one of these. Lets just say I will be returning that tomorrow. It did absolutely nothing for her. The suction was horrible. And like I said, it was just a temporary fix, since the filters are supposed to be a one time use, I would spend tons of money since with the nosefrieda I'd have to use about 3 filters a day. Not worth it. I will stick with the baby nose clear.
