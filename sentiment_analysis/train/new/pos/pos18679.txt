I do like this car seat.  We just got it for our 4 year old.  Easy to clean...easy to move between cars.  We had the Britax Marathon so it feels a little big and not as secure as that but it is a booster.  He likes it and is comfortable.  I can definitly see it lasting a long time.  I am getting ready to fly cross country and bring it in the bag with me as carry on luggage so we will see how that goes.  Love that it folds.  I do wish it had some sort of lock off sometimes he leans forward and it just doesn't seem secure but I have heard that with lots of boosters.  I think it has great padding.  So many like the Graco ones feel hard and uncomfortable.  Some have commented on the fabric choices I guess I don't really care...it is neutral and easy to clean.  Compared with other boosters I have used or looked at this one is great and I would recommend it.  The other I considered were the britax but I travel by plane a lot and wanted something I could bring with me easily as carry on (so it doesn't get lost)  I think that this booster will fit a kid for a longer period of time than the britax, it is roomy.  I don't know that I would have wanted to use this when my son was three, I don't think he would have had the discipline to sit in it properly at that age so keeping in a car seat like the Marathon as long as possible is a good idea.  But overall I am very happy with this booster seat and my son loves it.  I love the arm rest that move up and down easy to buckle in and secure.  The back also moves up and down and it is a full back so no moving up the back and having a narrow area around the head which I like.  He has fallen asleep in it and been fine, just lean on the side wings.  I have a subaru outback and the belt works perfectly across his shoulders.  I have and would recommend this seat to others.
