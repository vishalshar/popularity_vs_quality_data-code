won't hold up for long with the young ones.  the cards aren't coated or anything, just rough-ish, thick paper.  but as long as i don't let him handle them too much, my 3 y/o loves learning with mickey mouse and easily differentiates between colors, shapes and numbers already.  (he could already count to 12 before, but not easily recognizing the shape of the actual written numbers) The decks come with suggested games, and we've invented our own as well.  I just wish they were coated and sturdier so he could play with them on his own when he gets tired of mommy :).
