I love these necklaces.  I bought one at a baby boutique for $25 that was very simular if not exactly the same.  Works just as well.  I would highly recommend these to any mom with a teething baby. The item shipped fast... I was not impressed with the packaging but didn't stop me from ordering a second one and referring people to this seller.
