I purchased this to use with my 4Moms Infant Tub, White because during my first attempt to bathe my 2 week old son, he was sliding all over the place making it difficult to get him clean. I ordered this shortly after and his next bath went so much better!This sponge keeps him in place and makes it easy to get my hands behind him without pinching or pulling his soft baby skin. The sponge is very soft and also helps to keep him warm throughout the bath which makes him much happier. I couldnâ€™t be more satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone with a newborn!
