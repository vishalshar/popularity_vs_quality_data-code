In my opinion, this is a must have for the boxy backpack.I had seen so many reviewers bashing PPB bags becasue of the Velcro closure, I almost didn't buy one. I have also met some long time PPB owners who have shown me the failing Velcro on their bags.Whith the hush silencers in place, I can turn my bag upside down and shake the crap out of it, and it doesn't open.The Velcro used to startle (awake or asleep) my newborn son. Not an issue anymore.When changing a diaper on carpet the Velcro on the front of boxy backpack would stick to the floor. Not anymore.I have ruined a fine knit sweater by brushing it up against the Velcro. Never again.Thank you Petunia for making a great bag perfect with this product!
