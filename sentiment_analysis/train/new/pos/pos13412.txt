We've had this seat for about a year now. My son is 2, 28lbs and about 33 inches tall. Now as a mom I know no parent wants to think about these things but it happens. I was in a car accident with my little guy with me. We were rear ended very hard totaling both vehicles involved. I suffered whiplash but my son was perfectly unharmed. Not even a red mark on him. The seat help up perfectly with no damage. All buckles and the chest plate were still in place and fastened after the accident.
