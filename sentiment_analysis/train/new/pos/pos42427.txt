As a Kennesaw child care center and school in operation since 2004, Foundations for the Future has seen the best (and worst) in children's products.  We have had hundreds of children put toys to the test over the years, and we know which ones hold up to the attentions of very creative, bright, and determined children.These Careplay Ride-On Push Cars have remained a favorite, and they hold up great, even when used as off-road vehicles, which is probably not the original intent--they absolutely love to ride them down the little hill on the playground, and race them on the sidewalks.Age recommendation: We recommend these for children just learning to walk through about two and half years old.  Three year olds still like them, but they are starting to get too big to use them appropriately, so you might begin to see three years trying to use them in other less desirable ways, like standing on them....Top 5 Reasons We Love the Careplay Ride-On Push Cars:1) They are very sturdy and safe, a must have!2) They can be ridden by little ones in the crawling stage, due to the very low height of the seat and the stability.3) They can be pushed by the little ones just learning to walk--the handles on the back make this easy to grip for little hands.4) They can be ridden by older toddlers, who have as much fun pushing as riding them, on sidewalks, inside, or wherever you allow them to take them.5) They promote gross motor development skills and healthy outdoor play.Value: These are a great value at about $70, because they will last you through as many children as you have.  We have some of these that are at least five years old that are still in use daily with multiple classes of toddlers, with just some wear on the wheels and base showing, but nothing that makes it any less functional.  Even the color still looks good after years of outdoor use and storage.
