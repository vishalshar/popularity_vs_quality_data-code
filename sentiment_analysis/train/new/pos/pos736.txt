My daughter asked for a small photo album to store some of her favorite pictures of family and friends.  She specifically wanted something that was small enough to keep on her desk and this fits the bill perfectly.  It is well made, just the size to hold one 4 x 6 photo and the message on the front shines out like a beacon.  Every time she looks at it, it is a reminder to her that she is loved, and that she loved the people and times stored in the book.  There are enough sleeves to store 22 different pictures or postcards (she has both in her book.)  The inside front cover is paper, a patterned yellow and white, blank, full 4x6 paper, that is perfect for writing a little inscription on.  In spite of it's sturdy construction it is very light weight and could easily be carried in a purse.  Very, very pleased with this purchase.  Just what we were looking for.
