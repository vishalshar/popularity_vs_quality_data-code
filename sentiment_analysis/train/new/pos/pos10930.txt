Like all other reviews already mentioned, this is for a set of 2 spoons - the title is right, the description/photo is wrong, let's get this detail out of the way.This is simply the best baby spoon! It is in bamboo, so like wooden spoons, the food sticks to it, and baby can bite hard on it without hurting his teeth.It is the perfect size/shape for baby's mouth, and holds just the right amount of food.The handle is long and wide for a perfect and comfortable hold for parents feeding baby.And they come in pair, which is very handy because our son always tries to take the spoon from us, so there is one to feed him, and one for him to play with.Easy clean up by hand, they stay nice and soft.Price is right, I found other bamboo spoon at the supermarket at $12 for one!I like them so much I started giving them to other mommies to try (I ordered many in case I loose one when I am on the go), and they all love it!
