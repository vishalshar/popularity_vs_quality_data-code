Very secure, attractive car seat purchased for my new grandson  That way, when I babysit, I can get and up go with him if necessary.  It is a strong, sturdy, comfortable seat with good room and padding for him.  Plenty of extra room for him to grow and continue to use it.  I had a price limit which this seat just made. If I had a bigger limit I might have tried an air version many talk about.  But, this is not his primary seat, my daughter loves it for him and I think that says it all.
