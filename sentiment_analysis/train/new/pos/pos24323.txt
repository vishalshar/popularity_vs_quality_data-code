A couple of factors led us to get rid of our changing table and instead just put the changing pad on the floor. We bought this to hold everything that used to be on the changing table and it has been working great. We used some 3M command hooks on the wall and together this organizer has held up to tugging and pulling. It holds a good number of size 3 diapers so no complaints.
