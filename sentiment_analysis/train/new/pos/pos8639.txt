This Tub supports my Ten Pound, month old son. He does not slide down while getting his baby bird bath. The compartment/backrest that the baby lays back on, can be filled with water preferrably a little warmer than warm water. Reason would want to fill the back compartment with water is because the water in the compartment is used to supply the water for the little portable baby shower thingy.  For the price i cant complain about anything with this tub, it is a good buy.  The only issue was with the shower head on the tub.  There is a pump to give the shower head some water pressure. The shower head has a button on it and without having to press the button on the shower head, the water sprays constantly even while the water button isnt pressed. Overall i like it but for me to have given it a 5 star review everything would have had to be operating as it should. I would recommend this product.
