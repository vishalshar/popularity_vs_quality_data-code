At first my 6 week old son did not seem to know what to make of this when I layed him down on it.  After few times, and me encouraging him to play with the hanging animal by helping him make contact with his hands he loves it.now 8 weeks old he does Muy Thai (kick boxing) hitting the animals with his hands and knees while big smiles and laughing.He loves the music that comes with it.  when the music stops, he would hit/shake the animals to make the music come out again.Great buy for $35.Mine did not come with a detailed instruction.  Pretty much orange hook goes on orange and yello hook goes on yellow and make sure the place for hanging the animals kind of face toward outside.It has more places to hang stuff than 4 animals it comes with so you can move the position around or add more stuffs to it.
