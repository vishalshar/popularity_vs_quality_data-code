A good quality seat at a great price.  Install was a breeze. My only complaint is that the latch system strap is sent in the forward facing location and you have to take the seat pad and shoulder straps off to change it to be rear facing(I assume most people buying a car seat will use it rear facing at first, I guess I also assume most people will use the latch system).  That took 10 minutes of a 15 minute install. This is a secondary seat so I thought I would save some money and I'm glad I did.  It is easier to install and remove than our expensive one, you can really get the seat in tight when using the latch system.  Less padding than our expensive seat but still seems comfortable.  Buttons on both of our car seats are hard to press, I think they do that for safety. It doesn't have an actual level but it does have a level line to help with install. Very happy with purchase.
