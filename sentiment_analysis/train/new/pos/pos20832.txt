I really tried to avoid buying this particular spout cover because let's face it- it's not cute. I loved the way the Skip Hop whale and duck look but unfortunately our daughter's bathtub has the shower pull knob up on the handle part (where you turn the water on). After reading the reviews for those other items I knew it was going to stay on so I went in search of an equally cute version for our type of spout. Unfortunately, I can't find one anywhere. This Elmo version came up as a related item (thanks Amazon) and after reading the reviews we decided to purchase this version. It's not cute and animal shaped but it does fit perfectly over the spout in our daughter's bathroom! I had no problem getting it on and it has stayed on (even with my ten month old trying to pull him into the water) so it earns five stars in my book. Maybe it will grow on me but if you have the same problem of not having a shower pull knob on your spout then this is definitely the spout cover for you. It serves it's purpose, stays on well, and it's reasonably priced so I would definitely reccomend it.Update (two months)- It still looks just the same. No mold issues (and we've left it on the entire time). If something ever happens to it I would buy another because it's been great so far (and maybe the smirky little Elmo is growing on me).(Fifteen months)- after around nine months of use several times a week it did develop mold inside but I sprayed it with bleach and all is well. I'm really surprised at how long this cover has lasted for my toddlers bath. It's probably one of the best bath toys/products I've ever purchased for our family.
