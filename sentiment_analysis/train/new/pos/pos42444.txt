These are certainly more expensive than their cheaper counterparts, however they stay on my little ones hand.  For me these have been worth the extra money so that they are not constantly falling off and being lost among blankets, clothes or car.  These are also easy to put on little hands and do not leave elastic marks on her little wrist due to the elastic being enclosed.  Little things that all add up.  Definitely recommend and will be giving as gifts to future mommies.
