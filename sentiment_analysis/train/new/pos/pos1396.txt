We've had this seat for 2 years. It's been all over New England and the tri-state area as well as up and down the southeast coast and PR.  I'm shocked at the negative reviews. This seat is a life saver. We travel a lot by plane and car. Today is the first time it actually fell in the toilet and it was more a result of my child accidentally kicking it into the toilet. I'm so skeeved that I decided to buy a new one. For $10 it's worth it.  This seat has kept my child germ-free and happy for 2 years. At one point he wanted to use it on every toilet that wasn't home including friend's and relative's houses.
