My husband and I had trouble with this product at first and had to remove our first attempt. It was our fault we didn't wet the entire papper and so some arias didn't stick. My father in law showed us the best way to pui up the border and we didn't have any problems after that. My advice:Make sure you have a bucket of water, a sponge, a dry towl and the part of a roller you put paint on (we discovered this by accident but it really works we.)First, cut a setion of the wall border (I sujest slightly longer then the length of the first wall to be covered.)Second, Wet the entire length of the section briefly but completely, as you pull the border out of the water re-roll the papper so that to glue side faces out.Next, start in one corner and past the border onto the wall, smoothing each aria before unrolling and pasting the next. Take your time and make sure you arn't angleing the papper down. (You will tend to do this since the celing may not be strait if you're house isn't brand new.) use your hand to smooth the air bubbles out.Once that section of border is applied run the roller pad over it and get out all the bumps.go along the bottome edge with a slightly damp sponge and make sure it is smoothed out flat to the wall all the way around.Use the sponge and the towle to remove the glue on the surface of the papper.Repeat on the othe four walls.The key is the reverce rolling it really helps and our border didn't tear once. It may sound like alot but it didn't take us long at all to complete a faire sized room, maybe 45 minutes. I'd tell anyone to go for it and if you goof up a little at first don't get upset because that's when things start to go down hill.
