Forget the name "pregnancy" waist extenders. I bought these for my growing elementary girl for her uniform pants, shorts, skorts, and skirts. Why buy more uniform clothes for that sudden growth spurt? Because of the color, boys should be able to use these too. The middle of it is made of a sturdy elastic for bulging bellies. This is a great solution.
