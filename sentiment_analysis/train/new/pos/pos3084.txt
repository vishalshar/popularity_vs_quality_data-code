I purchased this for my daughter's first birthday and she simply LOVED it. The set was adorable and she quickly became obsessed with the teddy bear because when pressed, it plays the classic Happy Birthday tune. All the pieces are perfect for babies, mainly because they each have a different sensory element that most babies enjoy. Squeaker, crinkles, and rattles will keep babies entertained and happy.It must be noted that this toy is smaller than most people expect, but keep in mind, this toy is meant for babies and thus is sized accordingly. At the regular retail price, it's far too expensive and overly priced, but I purchased this for 75% off w/free ship and it was perfect, so if you are interested in this, try and see if it goes down in price if you have the time. Personally I feel that this toy, although super cute, shouldn't be priced anymore than $15 MAX, mainly because of it's small size. Other than that, it's a great purchase and one that would be greatly appreciated by the child and their parents because it can be put away as a cute keepsake.This would make a cute first birthday gift or even a simple keepsake baby shower gift for boy or girl. Gund is known for their quality and it shows here. On sale, it's a great purchase and I highly recommend it!
