I don't know if I got a good one out of a different batch or what, but my double sit n stand is WAY more durable than the ones mentioned here.  I own 6 different types of strollers, because my kids are 16 months apart, and this is still my go-to for shopping, and outings like the zoo, aquarium, etc.  I exercised with mine outdoors at a park for 3 days a week for 9 months at Stroller Strides.  The trails weren't paved, and I unloaded it and loaded it all those times and the tray is in tact, the back shade and seat are fine, and my kids were fine in it too.  We have yet to take out the back "jump" seat, because my older child hasn't complained about stroller riding yet.  I only stopped using it in class because my younger child could finally sit in the double jogger and that stroller is much easier on me.  The only problem I have is that sometimes the one of the front wheels pop off when I load it in the car, but it pops right back on.YES it is heavy.YES it is hard to turn.YES it is huge and takes up alot of trunk/cargo space.BUT I couldn't find a tandem double stroller that wasn't any of these, so why not save the money?
