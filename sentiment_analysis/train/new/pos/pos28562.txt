I am SO obsessed with wubbanubs. I bought two for myself, and have bought like a million already for friends who are expecting or have babies. I think they are so, so cute and now that my baby is 3 months, he holds onto the stuffed animal part. It makes it so much easier for him to try to put it back in his mouth (he hasn't really mastered that yet) and we haven't gone into pacifier hell in terms of losing them or having a million all over the place. I have one upstairs and one downstairs and that basically works for us. I will totally buy another one soon - I have been debating b/c we don't need it but i just love them SO MUCH. The best and cutest and simplest invention ever.
