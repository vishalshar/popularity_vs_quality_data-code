I first received a pink one as a gift when my 1st daughter was born. I stumbled on a blue version in a Burlington Coat Factory store when my son was a baby, so I had to track down another pink one for my youngest daughter.They are wonderful little, classic memory pillows and they will be treasured forever. I often find they have disappeared from their hooks, to be snuggled in munchkin beds. Years of being treated as more than just a decoration, they have proved sturdy and have held up well.The pen that comes with it is fantastic, it writes very easily so I recommend using very light pressure for a nice thin line. The ink does spread a bit after time, so if you make your orginal lines too thick it will eventually expand and smush together. (A mistake made with my 1st daughter's, it is still perfectly legible after 5 years, just quite a bit fuzzy.)
