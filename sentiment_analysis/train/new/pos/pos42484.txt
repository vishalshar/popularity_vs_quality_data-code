I too needed a carrier that allowed my daughter to face out -- she goes crazy when faced inward. She was about 4-1/2 months when we started looking for Baby Bjorn carrier replacements (my back was killing me!). We tried the Ergo, but I had completely missed the part in the description where it said the baby can't face outward (oh that's right, it DOESN'T say that... I needed to read the reviews more carefully to find that. Damn sneaky marketing folk!). I researched the other options and decided to try the Cybex, and we love it.My husband wears her around while he does housework like vacuuming, dusting, laundry, etc. and has no problems with his back hurting or anything. He keeps the waist strap very secure, so his hips carry most of the weight which takes the load off his back/shoulders. The baby seems to be very securely strapped in and while you can't do heavy stuff (mopping, anything that requires a lot of squatting or bending over), you can still get a lot done around the house while wearing your baby. :)  We took her to the mall while wearing it too -- worked great for standing and walking quite a bit.Pros: Padded straps, the removable/washable bib (I have a teether so she chews on it a lot), the zip-out sections for growth. Cheaper than similar high-end outward-facing carriers. Easy to get baby in and out of, in my opinion, though I do strap her in while standing over a soft surface like the bed or while seated on carpet.Cons: I'm not a huge fan of the buckle behind your neck. it's hard to buckle when you're by yourself, and even though they recommend buckling it in front of you and slipping it over your head, it's hard to do. My husband usually helps me with it. But it's not enough of an inconvenience to send it back.Overall, a great purchase, and we are loving it!
