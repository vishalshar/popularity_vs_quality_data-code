Love the multi-textured pages in the book along with a mini science lesson in every story!  Sometimes non-fiction books are borrring but in this case the beautiful illustrations, different textures etc keep the baby/toddler/preschooler interested:)  Prefer this book much more than Skip-Hops "Who's Hiding" (good intentions, poor quality for a board book).  There are more titles in this same line "If I Were...."  Plan to buy most, if not all.  Great for babies (with supervision b/c of possible fur shredding) thru preschool age.
