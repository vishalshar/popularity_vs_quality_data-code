I love how plush this cover is and it fits our Summer changing pad perfectly!  It should fit any standard changing pad.  The cute liner is very helpful and I bought the two pack of matching liners along with this so that they can be changed out during washing.  Also the liners must be air dried after washing since they have a plastic backing.  Three liners are plenty to get me through so that I never run out between wash loads.  The pink cover also comes clean in the wash if it ever gets poop on it and can be dried in the dryer for a quick finish.
