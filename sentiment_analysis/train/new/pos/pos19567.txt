I love these. I also purchased them with the matching Brand New sticker. I don't use them as stickers though. I just cut them out and tape them where I want them to go that way I can reuse them for my daughter's baby book and decorations for her first birthday. I get compliments all the time on how cute her monthly pictures are. Absolutely recommend. I also highly recommend to the artist to make some coordinating things such as party decorations or baby shirts and stuff. I would buy it!
