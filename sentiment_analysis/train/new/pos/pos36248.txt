So, I am pathetic, I ordered 4 diaper bags to choose between, and still, I am not sure which one I like. This one and the Timi & Leslie Annette are my 2 favors so far, but I am now waiting or the Hannah from T&L to make my final decision.What I like about this one:- lightweight- pockets very functional- outside ones are great for water bottles for the other kids, gotto be able to get to the cell phone and car keys quickly without opening the whole bag, holding a baby, and trying to walk 2 other kids to the car.- stays on the shoulder- nice design- cross strap is nice and works well- comes with stroller strapsWhat I dislike:- the leather looks pretty bad- the inner lining is black too so super difficult to find itemsSo, the jury is still out, but I am highly leaning towards this one.
