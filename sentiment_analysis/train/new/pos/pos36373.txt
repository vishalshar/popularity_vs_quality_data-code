I really love this and so does my 5 and 2 year olds.  We are a musical family and find the quality of the sound to be just perfect for a toy instrument.  Far superior to the metal versions.  Each bar has its own accurate and very pleasant tone, not too loud and not too quiet.  You really can play little songs on it.  My son takes piano and he sits with it in his lap playing the songs he knows - they sound very nice.  Highly recommended.  What they don't mention is that near the handle is a little slot to store the mallats when it is not in play - great feature!
