This is a nice looking and nicely built (for the most part) car seat. The cushion is nice and soft and the armrests are a nice touch although I think they might become more of a toy since they can move up and down.The bottom has a recline feature which helps fit it into a car just right and it also helps to remove the straps for booster seat conversion.One of the great features is that the straps move up with the headrest as you adjust for size. My Graco does not do that and you have to take the straps out when you raise the headrest.Installation is pretty standard, but be warned this will not fit in all cars as a booster. My wife has a CRV and the seatbelt is unreachable when converted into booster seat mode. We have found that several of these multifunction seats are that way with her car. I imagine others are the same.My biggest complaint would be the buckle. While I don't think a child could open it, it seems like it is too cheaply made. It is plastic that clasps together and just does not feel sturdy to me- although it will probably be fine over time.Overall a really nice carseat that has some conveniences for resizing and adjusting that other car seats do not.
