My 16 month old daughter loves her Nuk silicone pacifiers, and was very excited to receive and use these fun animal face versions. These binkies are high quality, built to last (but should be replaced every 2-3 months as the packaging specifies for full safety), and always soothe our baby when she's teething, sleeping, or is just plain fussy. It's so nice to use a great product and know that we can continue to count on it to be a hit with our child every time, while satisfying our health and safety requirements as parents.
