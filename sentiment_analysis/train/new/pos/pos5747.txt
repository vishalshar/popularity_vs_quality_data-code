Very nice cover. Purchased the ivory eyelet since I did not want a crazy print.Terry pockets on the corners. Not see through at all. Big enough to cover but still able to maneuver without feeling like you were wearing a huge cover. Washes well, but the neck band did wrinkle with washing. This could prob be avoided if you undid the neck part before washing.
