This little potty seat met all of our requirements: one-piece, easy to clean, easy to sit, and as an added bonus, sustainably made.  I did place a small rag underneath of it because we have tile in our bathroom and it slides around quite a bit since there is no rubber feet on the bottom to help hold it in place.  At first, it didn't seem like it was very "ergonomic" but I think that is because my son was just a little too small for it still (he started using it at 18 mos, so we put it away for a bit and now it's perfect for him at 20 mos). One thing I noticed, which is to be expected given the materials it is made from, is that after rinseing, when a little water is left to sit in the potty to dry, the fibers in the "plastic" swell a little, so there is a spot in the middle where this has happened repeatedly and it is a bit roughened now.  But it doesn't slough off or anything weird, it's just not a smooth surface anymore.
