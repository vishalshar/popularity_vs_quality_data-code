Came very quickly and well packaged. It was simple to assemble and seems quite sturdy. The pictures of assembly instructions weren't totally clear and the pieces were not labeled at all. Took a few minutes to figure out which piece was what, but that problem was quickly solved. The back sides of each piece is rough, so if you go with that, it's pretty simple to figure out. Only thing that annoyed me was having to wipe it down completely to get all the styrofoam dust and bits off of the wood. Overall, I like it and will enjoy years of use out of it.
