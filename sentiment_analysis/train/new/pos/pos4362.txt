This is the bag for you if... you have one child, not a newborn and are using disposable diapers.  All the pockets on the outside are strategic and perfect.  It's so convenient to have the changing pad on the outside.  I love the zippered pocket just above the pad for wipes. And the other pockets were perfect for pacifiers, nursing cover, keys, phone and wallet.  I love the fabric which seems durable. The inside pockets are large enough to be useful and would perfectly fit disposable diapers, a rolled up blanket, a nursing cover. The strap is padded. The zippers seem really quality.  Love the idea of drawstring pockets on the sides for bottles. However, with one 16 month old baby and another due to arrive in a couple months- I realized this is not our bag.  When I filled the outside pockets, it really only left me room for two cloth diapers (Bum genius pocket diapers) and a small receiving blanket.  I had hoped that if I could fit all my other things on the outside that there would be adequate space for 3-4 diapers on the inside, but it was not the case. Feeling unbelievably sad to return this bag. If it was bigger I would keep it in a heart beat. I wish they made a bigger version it's exactly what I want!
