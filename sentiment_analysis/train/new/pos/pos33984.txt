NUK pacifiers have worked the best with both of my babies, when other pacifiers were rejected. (And I spent a lot of money on various brands). They are durable and last a long time..and the ring make is convenient to hold on your finger or use with a pacifier clip. The only thing is that they are sometimes hard to clean. When you use soap and water, it gets inside the nipple. In order to get it out, you have to cup your hand with water while squeezing the nipple. This gets some water inside to wash the soap out. After that, I always throw them in the sanitizer. Not a big deal. I will continue to buy NUKs!
