We originally bought this to use for my baby girl while she was in the NICU to aid in her eye development. It was simple to attach to the crib and we liked that it was made of plastic because we could easily sanitize everything. I knocked a star off because it looks like some of the cards were cut sloppy with a box cutter. It's just a cut in the middle so that one card can fit into another. I would think that there would be a more elegant way of connecting the cards together, but meh, I guess this works too. It also seems like the plate that screws down in front of the mobile could crack very easily if over-tightened, so just be careful about that. All of the nurses and her doctors would ask where we found the mobile. They were pretty impressed!
