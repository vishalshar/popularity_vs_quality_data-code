These sippy cups are the only ones we've found that don't leak.  I mean, they REALLY don't leak.  All the rest of our cups give a steady drip of varying rates (which is ok during the day) but we save THESE sippies for water at night.  They stay in the crib all night long and we've never had even the tiniest problem with them leaking and we've been using them for about a year.  They are pretty hard to open and close, especially at first, but ours seem pretty well broken in now.  I should say they're difficult to line up the angled neck between the handles because you have to tighten them pretty hard to get them right, and then they can be difficult to open but if you remember the body of the cup is at slightly different angle from the threads on the lid it can be done.  Once you get the hang of it it's a cinch, but other people do have a hard time getting ours open their first try.I should probably mention that our boy is now two and we got these when he was one and weaned him off night feedings.  We just left a sippy with water in the corner of his crib so once he learned where it was he could just help himself and we didn't have to get up.  It is inevitably tangled up in his blanket every morning and they still don't leak.  He loves these cups and would use only these if we let him.  That's why I'm getting more!The only problem we've had is that we lost a valve within the first week of having them, but then that's my fault :pUpdate: I got these earlier this week and they do not have the angled neck like our older ones so lining them up isn't a problem.  We got one pink/orange and one blue/green just like the picture and neither one has leaked in the crib.
