For my second child I swore that there were somethings that I would get rid of and buy again.  1. was the mobile.  I had to have one with a remote, volume switch and a timer.  This one has all three.  I love the fact that it is different from most mobiles.  My daughter loved the thing from the first day home.  With the railing on the crib down, the lower bugs would come very near her face, which meant that she could see them.  As she grew older, she learned to hit the buttons to change the music.  She also loved to play with the little bugs when my son would take them off for her.  The music is NOT annoying, as with some other toys.
