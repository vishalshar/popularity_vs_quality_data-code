iGreat booster, child plays with activity tray while I finish up dinner. It attaches easily to my chairs. Only problem tray is VERY difficult to take off. I worry after long term use bending the side to release tray will cause damage. Only time will tell.Friend has this chair and hasn't had problems with repeated use with many children.
