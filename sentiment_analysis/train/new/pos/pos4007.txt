I purchased this from the reviews and I'm glad I did. It isn't quite as contoured as I would have liked. We put it on a changing table with all four sides. I would not recommend it for a dresser changing top without sides because I would worry about the baby rolling off. Wipes clean easily. It isn't super plastic like. I always keep a cover on it, but I don't think you would have to. It doesn't smell at all! I even put my nose down in it to smell because of what a different review had said. It is nice and firm, but also has enough cushion to comfort baby. Another review talked about having to nail it in. Mine came with two lines to attach it to a dresser and the screws to attach it with. Although I didn't need these because it fits right inside of my changing table. We cloth diaper, so we needed a new changing station for the new baby! This one will work perfect for us! :)
