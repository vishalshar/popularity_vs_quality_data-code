Purchased these for my step daughter to use with our new grandson. He was 3 months when I order these. He is a drooling machine! His clothes were always soaked. These bibs have plastic on the back. They are a little stiff, but work great. The bibs close with velcro and stay closed well. The colors and designs are really cute. Seem to be good quality for the price.
