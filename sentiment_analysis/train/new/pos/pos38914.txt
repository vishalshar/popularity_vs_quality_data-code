We purchased this diaper bag before my son was born as a compromise (it had a lot of cool features and space and wasn't too girly for my husband to carry around). Overall, we've loved this bag. The changing pad that comes with it was a LIFESAVER many times over. Unfortunately, my son peed all over it once and it somehow got into the fabric. After 1 trip through the washing machine on delicate the plastic covering on the one side cracked open and became so sharp and jagged we had to throw it out. This bag has lots of great pockets and enough space for everything! However, my son is now 18 months old and the shoulder pad is beginning to come unravelled and some of the stitching is looking pretty ragged. We are expecting our second child and now looking for a new diaper bag because we don't think this one will hold up for number 2.Overall, this is a GREAT diaper bag, but I didn't expect it to show so much wear so soon.
