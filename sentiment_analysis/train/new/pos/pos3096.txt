Amazing stroller... Very easy to push and durable.  There are multiple configurations that make this stroller truly transitional from infant through older toddler.  It also folds easily and is simple to reconfigure.  All you need are the attachments to drop the infant car seat in.  We have the maxi cosi and it all syncs up well.  This stroller easily turns into a double as well. .. And if you plan on having a second soon after its a good investment.  My only gripe is its gigantic footprint.  Even when folded this is a BIG stroller.  Despite it being so large, though, I must say it navigates very well in tight spaces.... even through the clothing racks at the stores.
