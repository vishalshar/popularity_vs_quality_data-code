I almost didn't buy this because of other negative reviews but ultimately decided to go for it since it was the most affordable organic option. I was concerned by another reviewer's note that the padding was dangerously thick. I didn't find this to be the case at all--in fact the bumper I was using in my previous crib (the Bloom bumper for the Alma mini crib) was much more plush. This bumper is just the right amount of thickness and very nice and soft. I liked the simplicity as well of having it be one single piece (rather than four separate pieces like other bumpers).I was also concerned that there were only top ties (no bottom ties) but that hasn't turned out to be an issue at all. Overall I recommend this bumper--it's simple, organic, and affordable.
