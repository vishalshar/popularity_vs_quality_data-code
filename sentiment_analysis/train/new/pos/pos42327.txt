This was a Christmas present for my (then) 21 mon. old daughter.  I wanted to get this because she loves playing with these kind of things at the doctor's office when we have to go for checkups & such.  It kept her busy & this one seemed to be exactly the same as one she really liked.  The delivery was very fast.  The product itself is very sturdy and keeps her entertained with the variety of things to do on it.  We frequently hear, "Daddy, play!" as she puts her hand in his to take him back to her room to pull him down and make him push beads around or turn alphabet tiles over.  Or if it's not him it's one of her older sibs.  The only thing I wish could be different would be that it was heavier.  She likes to push toys between the cracks on top or the triangular pieces on the sides and then try to tilt the entire thing up to get whatever it is out again.  Sometimes she's set it back down on her toe.  And this thing isn't exactly light but I guess it'd have to made out of lead for her to not be able to pick it up.  But she's never gotten really hurt so I'm not complaining at all.  Kids find all kinds of ways to hurt themselves, it seems.  I'm very glad that there aren't sharp corners on the sides though, so there is less of that chance.  I'm extremely happy with this purchase - as she is too.
