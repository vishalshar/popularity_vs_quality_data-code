I ordered this monitor after having to replace the Graco Ivibe, which basically started malfunctioning less than a year after we purchased it. We also needed something that monitored the temperature in our son's room because our HVAC unit is on the second floor and so his is bedroom--so there is a vast temperature difference between our room downstairs and his. We wanted to be able to monitor the thermostat the best we could in this cold weather. This monitor is great--it detected temperature changes as I searched for a good place to locate it --even within his room. There is also a talk back feature--if you need that,  a lullaby program that can be turned on and off remotely, temperature max/min alert so you know when it may be too cold or hot for your baby, and feed time settings if you need to wake and feed the baby during the newborn stage. Nice modern design as well. It's really a great product that offers much more than any basic monitors. I wish I had purchased it first!
