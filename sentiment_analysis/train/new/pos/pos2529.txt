I researched this booster when trying to find a product that would allow me easy installation/removal from my Subaru BRZ. The car is a small two door coupe and I had a requirement where I could take my daugther to and from school, but remove any hassles should I need to move the seat for additional adult passengers.WOW, the Clek Olli IS the answer! The Latch system worked just like in the Amazon video where I just lined up the seat, gave it a firm push, and it was installed. To remove I just pull the front tab and the light weight seat is up in seconds. This configuration also provided greater room for my daughter's comfort and any passenger riding in the front seat. The only thing that could have made this better for my particular car would have been an Alacantra seat cover! Besides not having that, it looks very classy in my car. Simply an amazing product which feels well made, safe, light, easy to use, and last but not least comfortable.100% recommend especially if you are the owner of a sports car similar to the BRZ or FR-S! If you're wanting to save some money they make the Ozzi; however, I think the extra money is worth the front release tab and padded arm rest!
