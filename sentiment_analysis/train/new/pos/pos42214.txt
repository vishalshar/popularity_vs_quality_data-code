Excellent product for new mothers whether they are nursing or bottle feeding.After much research, I purchased this as a gift for my daughter when she became a new mother. She originally purchased a U-shaped pillow which did not fit around her properly and she therefore struggled to properly support her baby on it. The wedge shape of this pillow allowed her to place the pillow directly where she needed the support without having a pillow around her entire waist. The pillow is cushioned and offers support for both the mom and her baby. This pillow is more transportable than the U-shaped pillow as well. It is easy to use in the car when traveling and even doubles as a car pillow when mom naps during those long car rides. The material is durable and long lasting. My daughter's pillow has been used on a regular basis while raising two active boys and is now safely tucked away for baby number three. This pillow is a  "must have" for new moms!
