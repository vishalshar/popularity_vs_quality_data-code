PRO: My 5 month old son reached out for this monkey the moment I took it from the box. It is cute and snugly. He loves the long arms and legs. I recorded a song that I sing to him when I'm calming him down and he snuggles with the monkey and will fall asleep on his own. That is a huge bonus for tired moms, and very helpful for Dad to have around when Mom is gone.CON: It does shed bad. Ours shed for about two weeks and then was fine. At about 4 weeks though the velcro that holds the sound box inside became basically non existent. The sound box falls out frequently, which defeats the purpose of the monkey, since our baby likes it because it sounds like Mama.OVERALL: Love the toy. Have already purchased extras and some for expecting family. I paid only 14.00 though. Would not pay more than 20.00 given the flaws. The sound machines (we have the giraffe) also work well and don't have the frustration of the sound box falling out. Our son likes the giraffe too, but not as much as the monkey.
