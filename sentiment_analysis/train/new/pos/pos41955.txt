What a great little chair!Got it for our 13-month old and we've had it for a few months now. Although his legs are still a little bit short to rest his feet on the floor and rock, he can make himself comfortable in it to hang out reading or watching TV. He'll just get more and more comfortable in it as he gets taller (he's about 32" currently). I like the material (I got the mesh option) because it's quick drying and easy to wash (but not removable). The chair works as well in our living room as it does at the beaches here in Hawaii and I love that it folds. He treats it like a mini jungle gym sometimes, tipping it and climbing on it etc but the folding mechanism stays true and locked.Although the price is really high, it's something made in the USA and that my kid can grow into and has many uses, so overall I think it's worth it. (although the price is really pushing it!)JULY 2014 -- Still using this chair! Still folds, took to the beach the other day. We have an old coffee table that's turned into a lego station and this is the perfect height for it. My son has grown 8 inches since we got this chair and gained about 15 pounds and he is still comfortable and relaxed in it -- although he is the lanky type. Glad to see it is cheaper currently ($28 not $50) but it was definitely worth the money and is still fully functional.
