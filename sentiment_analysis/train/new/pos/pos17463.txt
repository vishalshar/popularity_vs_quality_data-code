Ring Snuggies are a cheap, easy, temporary solution for keeping your ring from sliding around on your finger if your weight is fluctuating and you don't want to commit to re-sizing the ring just yet.  Sure, they're not very elegant, and I find that after a while of wearing them (even taking my ring off to cook, shower, etc.), the opening in the plastic starts to separate and the plastic becomes discolored.  But it is what it is - a cheap, temporary solution.I initially bought the regular Ring Snuggies because I was losing weight and my engagement ring kept slipping around on my finger.  After I worked my way all the way up to the largest size in the regular Ring Snuggies packet, and my ring was still loose, I ordered the Jumbo Ring Snuggies.  They did the trick!  And they arrived very quickly; all-in-all a no-hassle purchase and a quick fix for my problem.** Please note, however, the description for this item is a bit misleading.  Jumbo Ring Snuggies are NOT good for rings with large bands.  They are good for when there's a lot of extra space between the band and your finger. **
