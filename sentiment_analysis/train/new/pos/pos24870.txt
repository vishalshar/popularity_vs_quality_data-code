How fun!  This was a gift for a little guy who had yet discovered the fun of not having to change clothes 20 times during the day.  Now we have an hourly game - let's sink the animals!The shapes float for a descent amount of time, giving the newest of learners a chance to focus.They flush and dissolve easily (no plumbing issues so far).I love this concept, and will gift this to all of my potty training mommy friends.
