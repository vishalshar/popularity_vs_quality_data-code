It's exactly what I wanted. It wasn't too terrible to put together, but there were a couple times I called my husband over to hold one piece while I put a screw in.I've had it for a few months now and it's holding up well. I use it to store throw blankets, tassels, gloves, and a scarf. I also use it to sit on to put my shoes on.Sorry I didn't have a banana for scale.
