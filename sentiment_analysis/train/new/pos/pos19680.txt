This is super sytlish for mom to wear and also distracts baby while nursing. It is also a great item for the baby to gum on while in the teething stage and still a nursling. I love that I can look fashionable and still have a piece of jewelry that is safe for baby. The color is very pretty and the teether is quite durable. I'm so happy I found this product.
