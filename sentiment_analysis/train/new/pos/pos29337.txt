The Rear and Side Shade set fits the bill for blocking part of the sun from car and home windows, and helps keep our dog out of the direct sunlight.We use the smaller set in the car rear window and works fine, and although they do not quite cover the entire window, they do cover enough.  It is also possible to double up the smaller screens on the suction cup(s) for added sun blocking.  At home we use all of the set in our front glass door to keep afternoon sun off the dog.  Has some overlap but again works fine.  The suction cups hold well, and have a tab for easy removal. (The set we received has only one centered suction cup on the small screens, but holds fine.)The screens are well made, and despite scratching at them the dog has not torn any of the pieces in almost a year of use.An excellent product at a good price !
