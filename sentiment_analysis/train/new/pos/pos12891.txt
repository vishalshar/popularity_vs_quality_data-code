DON'T waste your money on a baby bath. This works perfect in my bath. I am very happy with this item. It folds up very compactly. It happened to fit neatly in the tub I already had. It also holds all my baby's bath things securely for easy travel. Only surprise was that even after all dry, when folded up, the joint leaks water for a second or two.
