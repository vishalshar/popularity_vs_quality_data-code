My 3.5-year-old loves this bed set! Compared to the Thomas the Engine bedding set I got from Wal-Mart (which I love just as much), this one is softer and feels better against the skin, more like cotton and less like polyester. I didn't give it 5 stars because the sheet is already getting those little balls of thread on it that cheap sheets tend to get, and the blanket is too big for a toddler bed, IMO. It makes it hard to make the bed and have it look nice. However, the size is perfect for wrapping up a little kid who wants to feel safe and warm. So, it's not a bad size at all. Just be prepared to fold an end in if you're a perfectionist like me and want to make a nice tailored looking bed. (I have the Orbelle 3-6T toddler bed.)
