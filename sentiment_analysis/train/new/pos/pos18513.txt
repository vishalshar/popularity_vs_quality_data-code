I originally bought a Quinny Buzz when my son was born, and I loved it, but it was wide, bulky and heavy so I got the Maclaren Quest when my son was about 1 1/2.  I had originally intended to just use the Maclaren on trips, but I just loved it so much I tossed out my Quinny and had my Maclaren with me at all times.  Its so light, folds in a snap, takes up very little space in my trunk and when we're on the train or bus its so narrow it can go anywhere.  My Mom also loved it and since she was watching my son while I worked, I just gave it to her and bought the Maclaren Techno XT.  LOVE IT!  Its a bit heavier but worth it.  I love the bigger canopy on the Techno and the fact that it reclines almost flat.  That came in handy at Disneyland so he could take his nap in the stroller vs having to go back to the hotel room.  I have to say that my Maclaren is a must have.  I wouldn't buy any other stroller!
