This is a light , stylish booster with great protection . I had recaroo ( 5 harness ) for 3 years and very happy with it . I tried Britix in retail stores and my 7 years old son did not liked it . He said " I want same racing car booster " . The 2 cup holder that removes and the whole seat cover that is mesh and washable is practical . I got marine color which is pretty too.Parents , if you concern about safty of your children , this is it . If you are concer on money you might find so many other cheap product that just a seat but not same protection . I am planning to use this for my 7 years old through 10 or 11 depends how tall he gets .
