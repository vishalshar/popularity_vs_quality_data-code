We give 4 stars!The Good:* It is seriously soooooo cute!* The size of the horse is perfect!!! Not too big and not to small.* The weight is perfect. Not to heavy and not to light. It will nicely stay right on babies belly without falling off unless baby wants to play with the horse itself.* Looks to be well made. No loose seams, and well constructed.* The size Soothie attached is 3month. Since you have no option but to have the Soothie sewn in it is the best option in size I guess. Not too big and not too small.The Bad:* I hate that the Soothie paci is sewn in. Couldn't there have been some other way to do this... now instead of buying one Wubbanub and a few Soothie's to replace a dirty one with you have to buy several Wubbanub's? That can get expensive. Had I done my research and learned that the paci is actually sewn in I would have bought the Soothie Pacifier Attacher.FYI - Our Wubbanub did not smell when we got it out of the box and honestly I would not have held that against them if it had... come on... manufacturing plants don't smell good. Would you rather they spray toys down with perfume before sending???? I don't!!!!!
