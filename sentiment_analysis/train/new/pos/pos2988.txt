Ok, I wanted to have a good long time to use this before writing a review so I could make sure it was as accurate as possible.  I purchased it for our twelve month old son.  We have seven children and never have I had one have such a hard time with teething.  We are as natural as possible and I didn't want to use Tylenol to ease his pain so I started researching other methods to ease his discomfort that wouldn't stress his liver or other parts of his body.  I made a tincture that worked well, but it was short lived.  I had heard about the amber necklaces but wasn't really sure I bought into them.  I decided I'd go ahead and try it because at worst, it would be a cute necklace.We put it on and let him wear it all the time, only taking it off before bath time and then putting it back on after he got out.  It sat underneath his clothing and he didn't bother with it at all, which surprised me.  Both my husband and I said we thought he was less fussy since putting it on him but we really weren't sure if it was the necklace helping or not.  One evening we forgot to put it back on after his bath.  It dropped down behind the toilet and we forgot all about it.  The next three nights were terrible.  He normally wakes up only once to nurse during the night, but these three nights he woke up every few hours, didn't want to nurse and couldn't be consoled.  My husband and I were so tired.  On bathroom cleaning day, I came across the necklace that had fallen down.  I washed it off and put it back on, telling my husband it would be interesting to see if he slept any better now that the necklace was back on.  That night he slept 10 hours without waking up!  Boy were we happy!Another difference we notice when he's wearing it is he drools less.  It doesn't stop him completely, but it is less than before.  We do notice a difference for the better and are glad we made the purchase.  I will buy for friends as a baby shower gift now.
