So here's the deal we loved the City Mini GT and the Bob Britax B-safe.  Without reading all the reviews we purchased the adapter that is recommended by Baby Jogger, by part number.  After a frustrating two days of returing the seat and bringing the adaptor to Buy Buy Baby, we finally read the reviews and realized we were not the only ones.  I had an older model standard B-safe and the adaptors worked perfectly, however with the newer Bob version they just wouldn't click in.  After close inspection the problem was on the new Bob model the mechanism that goes into the adaptor was not sitting low enough to trigger the lock.  I then looked at the adaptor itself and realized there were two tabs built into the adaptor.  Willing to destroy the adaptor, I used a Dremel tool to file the tabs flat making sure that I did not go past flush.  Now it works like a charm!  I'm not sure why this happens, both the new and old Britax have exactly the same mechanism, appears that it must be a manufacturing issue with the Bob model, really a matter of millimeters.  I know that this is not ideal but it works and the seat solid in place.  I hope Britax reads this and adjusts the adapter page on their website.
