Words cannot describe how much I love this travel bassinet, but I will try. My family recently relocated across the country, and all of our worldly possessions are stuck in a moving cube that got lost in the shuffle and that we won't see for a MONTH. Thankfully, I ordered this and had it sent to my mom's before we moved as a little sleeping nest for my daughter when she visits grandma. Now that we've had to use it for her temporary bed, I'm really tempted to make this semi-permanent until she outgrows it. Here's why:+ Right out of the box it snapped together in 30 seconds without any extra tools, screws, etc.+ It lies almost completely flat when folded, and folds down easily.+ My daughter is 4 months, 15.5 lbs and 25 inches and she has PLENTY of room.+ Light as a feather!!+ The zippered hood gave us peace of mind around my mom's really lovable, curious cats at night.+ The mesh sides are really breathable (our baby likes to mash her face against the side of her crib), but she can't get a hand stuck.+ The pad that comes with it is actually really padded, but not dangerously so. I read the other reviews that said the pad was just a hard slab, but was pleasantly surprised. It's more padded than her pack n play "mattress" for sure. I just covered it with a crib sheet in the photos.I can't think of a single minus, seriously. She still sleeps in our room at night, and I think I'm going to use this as a bedside/arm's reach bassinet. It takes up MUCH less space than her pack n' play, and she falls asleep soundly and deeply in this. It is a good height and depth to be able to reach her without hurting your back, too.
