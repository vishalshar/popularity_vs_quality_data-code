I bought this sheet for my child two years ago when she was born. It has held up well until now, the edges are a little ripped but still usable. It fits very snug on the mattress which I liked, but makes it a little hard to change out. Yes, it wrinkles out of the dryer, but it is so taught on the mattress you can't see the wrinkles once it's on. It is also thicker than other less expensive sheets we have purchased. I have another baby coming and I will buy another one.
