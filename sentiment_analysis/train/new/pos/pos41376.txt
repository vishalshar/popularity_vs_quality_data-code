I attached this to our City Mini stroller and it's been great. I see a lot of users have had issues with the clips but I have had no issues with them. I haven't taken the shade on or off very much though, I just roll it up and use the bungee loops when we aren't using the shade. Works great and extends all the way to the bottom of the stroller. Very handy :)
