Ordered this for my 14 yr. old son with spec needs.  We had a similiar product but he was able to pull on it and break it.  So far this has worked great for my little houdini.  Helpful hint: use a 2nd one to lock the middle seat belt so they can't use it to unhook theirs.  Been there and had that happen.
