These flowers are a great size.  I was worried that 6 wouldn't be enough and was tempted to buy 2 packages.  However, because they're pretty large, 6 flowers was just enough.  We have them placed randomly throughout my daughter's toddler room along the baseboard and they really did a great job of breaking up the monotony of the plain pink walls.12/15/14 Update: Just wanted to give an update that these wall decals are holding up great. We've had them on the walls for 4 years and even had to remove them all to move them to a new house and there was no problem adhering them again in the new room. Very cute! My daughter was 2 when we bought them and she's 6 now and still loves them.
