If your kid is older than 1 and used to the fast flow bottle nipple, you will need to gently enlarge the opening in this bottle top because the flow is too slow.  Sometimes I have bought these and they were completely sealed shut...my son handed me back his sippy with a confused look on his face.  Always inspect the flow before you use it the first time.  I have tried every kind of sippy cup and my kid only likes this one.  Doesn't leak and he doesn't try to remove the top of the topple or unscrew it like every other sippy.  Interchangable with the Nuk nipples if you have more than one kid at home. It's nice that all the Nuk tops are interchangable on the bottles.  CLEAN the spout though.  OFTEN.  Because they go inside the rim the same way the bottle nipples do, all kinds of gross stuff gets stuck in the threads of the rim where it attaches to the bottle.  You have to pop the spout or nipple out. clean it well (I use a q tip), clean the inside of the bottle rim (I use a baby wipe and throw it out) and then wash everything in the dishwasher to sanitize.  I replace the tops frequently.
