My only complaint are the inside pockets. I don't like the material they are made of and I don't like their locations and sizes. This was the only reason I hesitated to buy this in the first place, too. Wish the pictures had had an inside view. However, It is spacious, adorable, and I like that it has the option to use the single shoulder strap or the double straps. I REALLY like the little lunch box thing that comes with it. VERY handy.
