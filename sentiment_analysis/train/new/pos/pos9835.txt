Fits a ton of my cloth diapers and holds up well! Love the pattern, I went with a very simple grey theme for my nursery but this brings a fun pop of color.  It does have ties, so I am installing hooks into my changing table since it didn't have bars that could be tied to.  Was one of the more economical prices for diaper stackers too, I am very happy with it!
