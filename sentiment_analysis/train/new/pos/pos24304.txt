Everything came in 100% condition and it was very easy to assemble! Took my hubby less than hour and it was a breeze to do so! Cannot wait for our baby girl to be here so that she can sleep in this beautiful crib! The conversion kit comes with it as well for those who couldn't find a conversion kit for this crib online! I was surprised that it came with it because most cribs do not Come with one, you typically have to buy it separately!
