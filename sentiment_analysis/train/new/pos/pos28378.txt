I just LOVE these! I've been using cloth diapers for about 4 years and mostly the original ones I bought for my son (who is 4 now). I continued to use them for my little girl (21 months now) but some were starting to wear out so I went on the hunt and found these. The ratings were incredible but I am skeptical by nature so I didn't think they could be a good as everyone claimed. I bought a couple on sale and fell in love!My previous diapers were all velcro closures, some with snaps to alter the fit (lengthwise) and the velcro had to be folded over for washing.,but the wear-and-tear on the strips was brutal. The GoGreen snap system is unbeatable. Easier to wash, just toss them in the machine, you don;t even have to pull out the insert! (I do though, but it's nice to know that if I forget or I'm in a rush it'll be ok.) My daughter has figured out how to undo the velcro (even for the G-Diapers, that velcro "backwards" to keep kids from ripping them off) and the snaps defeated her!It's so easy to customize the fit around the legs and waist for any size baby/toddler and the range of colors and prints are adorable! Endangered Stinkies is my current favorite! They are super absorbant with the bamboo blend inserts and the double gusset around the legs make them virtually leak-proof. I don't even use a soaker for overnight they are so reliable.I would reccomend these to anyone wanting to try out cloth diapers because you won't be disapointed!
