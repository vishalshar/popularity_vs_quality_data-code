I bought this tub for my second baby. I made the mistake of buying a very cheap piece of crap tub with my first baby, and as a result, she hated taking baths and I dreaded giving baths to her. But this tub has worked wonders with my second! It fits in a double sink - which is fantastic for post partum moms because, let's face it, bending over in a big human tub is torture during the healing period no matter how you gave birth. It's a bit awkward and big for newborns (mine was almost 8 pound baby), so I paired the tub with a Turtle bath sponge cushion (Google it) and a baby bath cozy - bath time perfection. At 10 weeks old, he's yet to cry or fuss during bath time, and lately has been smiling and cooing in the tub! He's even fallen asleep in it. This tub is a winner for me. No more tears - for me!!
