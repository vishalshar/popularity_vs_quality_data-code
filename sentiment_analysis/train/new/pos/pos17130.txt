Munchkin does not make their newer cups like this.  This type is the best kind!  The new ones have a big plastic piece on the outside of the cup and every one of those that I have purchased, leak like crazy from the straw.  This kind, without the big plastic piece on the outside, barely ever leak and are just awesome.  These cups are very hard to find now and for a decent price, moreso for boys.
