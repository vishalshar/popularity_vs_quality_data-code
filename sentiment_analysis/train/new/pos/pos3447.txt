These are so huge it's kind of funny, but it works, giving more coverage than those silly tiny baby ones I had on my 15 month old. I do need to clip it with a clothespin in the back at the neck, otherwise the neckline is too big and food can get on his collar area. The velcro also doesn't hold well on it's own, he can pull the bib off. But it works, they are easy to clean and don't smell mildewy (yet?) like some get and we'll be able to use them forever. I would recommend, even with the clipping issue.
