This bubble bath makes the most amazing bubbles! Even a tiny amount makes a HUGE number of bubbles. My daughter was thrilled! The bubbles also last a really long time - we put some in a cup, and four hours later the bubbles were still in the cup as if no time had passed at all. They are a little hard to get down the drain at the end of bathtime since they're so long-lasting and pop-resistant. The smell is faint and pleasant. Overall an awesome product, will definitely purchase again.
