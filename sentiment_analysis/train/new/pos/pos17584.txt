This cover got quite a workout this winter, let me tell you!  Living in Oregon, it's wet wet wet in the winter (and the spring and the fall)!  The fit was perfect for my Chicco Keyfit 30, the elastic and vinyl held up great.  My daughter always stayed warm and dry, even with blowing wind and rain.One thing to note...babies get pretty hot in those bucket seats, even without being covered in plastic.  Make sure when you get inside your destination (or back into the car) to take it off!  The vinyl has little air holes in it, which is fine for brief jaunts to and from the car or walks outside providing it's a cool enough day...but once you get indoors, it will heat up pretty quickly.  The first time I used this, I left it covered while I browsed Old Navy.  The cover was dripping wet, and I didn't want to pull it off and get my daughter wet.  After awhile, my newborn was crying, and when I got her out of the seat to comfort her, and she was drenched in sweat.  So yeah...so much for not wanting to get her wet.  I found that I could flip the end up over the handle and back onto itself so she could get some air flow, yet the water wouldn't drip onto her.
