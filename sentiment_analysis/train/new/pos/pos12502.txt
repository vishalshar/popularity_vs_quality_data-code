My 4-month-old and I both like Tiny Love toys, but I've found that the musical parts of two of the three toys we own (this and the super deluxe gymini -- we also own the symphony in motion farm animal version) have problems with their music.  With all three, the animals are adorable, with bright colors and buggy eyes, and they attract my baby's attention, and she likes to touch and hold them.  She loves tummy time on the gymini, and the take along arch is great because it goes from car seat to stroller to floor without any problem (a great travel toy!).  However, when the take along arch arrived, the turtle didn't play music.  I replaced the batteries, and it still doesn't work (and those batteries are expensive!).  There's no tape or anything in the way.  It just doesn't work.  It's still cute and fun, but definitely not musical.
