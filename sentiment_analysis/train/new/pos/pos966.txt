I didn't like the idea of running my breastpump in the dishwasher with dishes covered in food, even if it does say that the high temps will sterilize it.  I didn't even dream of boiling the parts of my breastpump, who has time for that?  I use this product everyday, sometimes twice a day.  It gives me the peace of mind that I am keeping as much bacteria as possible out of my expressed milk, which means it will be able to be stored as long as possible.  That's important, because pumping is not very fun, and we all like to do it as little as we have to.  Now, even if I just want to sterlize only my breastpump, I use just a little bit of water and it takes only 8 minutes!  Much less time than boiling or using the dishwasher.  One word of caution, this sterilizer will fit many bottles, and will fit the pump, but you cannot fit nine lids, rings, nipples, AND bottles and your breastpump.  If you just sterlize your pump and the nine bottles, it will fit along with a ring or two and maybe one nipple.  Or you can stack stuff on top of each other, but beware as it may topple out on you when you pull it out of the sterlizer.  I still gave the product 5 stars, because I find that its capacity usually fits my needs anyway (i am a breastfeeding stay-at-home mom that expresses breastmilk for evening feedings for my husband and short trips away from baby).
