I had to pump and feed for a month and a half due to my son's reflux. It was a little struggle going back to nursing because my son no longer wanted to wait for letdown, but we were able to get there.  I believe it is partly because this bottle is more like nursing than other bottles.  It requires that the baby actually sucks to get milk and does not drip into their mouths like other bottles.  I do make sure the top is not on too tight, so air can get in the vents, and not too loose so it doesn't drip.  This effort is definitely worth it to me I plan to stick with these, as well as the transitioner into sippy cups! I definitely recommend trying one if you are looking for something other than a typical bottle and nursing friendly.
