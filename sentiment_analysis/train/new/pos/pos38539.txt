I just love all these bright and colorful soft body toys for babies.They help with baby coordination as when they reach for something and finally grab it, they are rewarded with some sort of sound (rattles, chimes, squeaks, crinkles and so on).  Even his legs stretch!On Tomy then giraffes neck is a teething ring.  He is just full of surprises!There is also a link on the toy so you can hang him up when you take him places.Great stuff!  Please, click on "helpful" if my review was to you and THANKS!!  :)
