I will ever do a normal baby bath tub again! This sponge is so helpful. I just lay my baby on it and put a bit of water in the tub. It allows me to reach all the way around the baby to wash, which was more difficult in the baby bathtub. We even used it as my son got older, he sat on it while we washed him and now we lay his head on it when we wash his hair. I just make sure to wring it out after every bath and prop it up to dry. I have had this for at least 6 months now and have had no issue with smell or anything. I have recommended this to all my fellow mommies!
