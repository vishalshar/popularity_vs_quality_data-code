These wipes are awesome. Natural and safe for babies but they also clean really well. My only complaint is that I wish the container was a little skinnier so it would fit in a cup holder of my car as we use them for grocery carts while shopping. Hard to find a good place in the car where they won't roll around while driving. Other than that- I love these and they get the job done in a safe way!
