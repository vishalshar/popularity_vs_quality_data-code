We didn't originally start giving my daughter purees because we started baby led weaning at 6 months. Around the time she turned a year old, she started noticing the other babies at play dates with these pouches of food and wanted one for herself. The problem is, she had always fed herself and demanded to do so with the pouch but wanted to squish the pouch out everywhere. I bought the easy pouch and another brand to see if that would help. The easy pouch has been amazing! It easily holds any of the pouches of tried (basically all the pouches you can buy at target). It's stands up to her busy little toddler fingers and let's her feed herself. I much prefer it to the other brand I tried that seemed to always pop open.
