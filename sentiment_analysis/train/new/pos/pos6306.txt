An exact replacement for the Motorola baby monitor battery.  Working perfectly since purchase.  Worth the few extra dollars over non-Motorola batteries.  We had purchased a non-Motorola set of batteries based on price but had to return them.  Then we got this battery and should have done that from the beginning.  Highly recommended.
