I've had two of these toy boxes for over 3 years and they are still in pretty good shape. I bought the Espresso and it was true to the advertised color. It blends in well with our decor. I like the easy close hinges that prevent the lid from slamming shut. But, the llid only stays open halfway on both of my toy boxes. I recommend keeping it a decent distance from the wall so the back of the lid doesn't hit it when opening and closing. My daughter has done that a lot because the toy box sometimes slides on our wood floors. The brown paint has rubbed off onto the wall, but I can repaint over it easily. Very sturdy piece otherwise.
