I like everything about this wet bag - the cute design, the larger size.  It holds several cloth diapers, doesn't leak or smell, and washes well.  My only complaint is that I wish it had two of the snap handles so that I could hang it from my bathroom towel rack in two places instead of putting the all the weight of the bag on one spot when it is full.  Otherwise, awesome product.
