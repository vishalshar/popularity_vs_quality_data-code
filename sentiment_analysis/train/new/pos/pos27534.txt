I will never buy velcro bibs again. They irritate my poor baby's neck and I feel terrible every time I see a red mark there! These bibs are soft, absorbent, and large. I love that the snaps are on the side-- it makes them easier to put on my squirmy 4 month old. They are a little thin, but my girl is a champion spitter, so most people probably won't have an issue with the thickness.I considered giving four stars for a couple of reasons. One, the other poster who mentioned that the material in front of the snaps flips out and looks silly was right. It does flip out after washing (the snaps could have been placed closer to the end of the material), but I guess I just don't care that much. The second reason is you're not supposed to put these in the dryer. I wash my girl's bibs VERY frequently, so I have to wait until these ones air dry to use them again. I have put them in the dryer a few times, and they did start to fray around the seams a bit.Overall, these are some of my favorite bibs (we use a lot with my daughter) and I'd say they are worth the money.
