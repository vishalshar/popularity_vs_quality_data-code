I've had these before (maybe another brand?) and they're great! I'm always hesitant to give my young toddlers a plate when we eat out, because inevitably it WILL end up on the floor. You don't want them eating off a table that was just wiped down with a dirty rag and probably no kind of cleaner on it at all...what a great solution :) Light weight and compact, I can easily carry several around with my in either a diaper bag or my purse, and they take up no room.Side note: The Pooh place mats I received are not either of the ones pictured. A little annoying...I don't like being surprised with something I didn't order...however, for our purposes it doesn't really effect anything. Just more of an FYI so you aren't "counting" on getting a specific design.
