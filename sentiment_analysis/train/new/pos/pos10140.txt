We have two of these for our 3 and 2 year old. We mostly use them for when we travel and for Dad's car. They are really light and we attach them to our Go-Go Babyz Travelmate.Go-Go Babyz Travelmate BlackWe have flown several times with these and the Go-Go and both are super durable and still look pretty new. Since the seats are light, they're easy to carry down the aisle of the plane, but you can't roll them, still a little too wide. Our kids sleep much better in these seats, than if they were just in the airplane seat too. We detach the Go-Go right before we get in line to board. Our kids like to roll it, so that helps and then we put them in the overhead for the flight. Our longest travel time has been a 6 hour flight, 1 hour layover with a 1 hour flight with a 1.5 hour drive home and the kids preferred to seat in the carseat even when we weren't flying.We also enjoy strolling these through the airport, instead of a stroller. When you go through security. Pop the kids out, keep the carseat and Go-Go attached and they will do a separate check. We walk through the metal detector with the kids. We found that security usually tries to get us through pretty quickly, because we have two small children. People usually think we are pulling our suitcases until they get behind us and see the kids. Our kids love it and always wave and yell out Hi! to people. We have also been lucky to not need strollers at our destinations, but it is also nice to not have to rent a car seat or putting responsibility on whomever we are staying with too.Generally, if we have two suitcases, one of us will pull both kids and the other parent deals with the luggage.One less stress with traveling!The picture attached, shows how we store them in our garage. The handles of the Go-Go are adjustable, just like rolling a suitcase.
