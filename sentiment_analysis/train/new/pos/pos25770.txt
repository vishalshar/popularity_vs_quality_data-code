I purchased these washcloths to carry in babies diaper bag. These terrycloth towels are soft, thin, and colorful. Although, the colors are more muted than the vibrant colors in the photo, they are still very pretty. Perfect for baby. They come folded neatly and packaged beautifully. There are plastic fasteners holding everything in place, but are easily removed if you take your time. I highly recommend this product.
