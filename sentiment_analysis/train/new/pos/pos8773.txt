I use the piddle pad in my infant car seat for diaper accidents.  I do not like taking the seat cover apart to clean the car seat cover and car seat.  The piddle pad has saved us the trouble, sometimes several times a day.  But, it will not get every accident every time.  It is a plus just to have something save me the trouble of disassembling the car seat and waiting for it to dry and then putting it back together.  Especially while traveling.  When you put your child into the car seat, just make sure the piddle pad is pulled up the back, around the sides, and under the diaper area around the buckle.  It really is not that difficult and will not take much time.  It will not work if it is not all under the bottom area of your child.  You will not find anything that will solve all of your problems, but this was worth the money.  I have two.  I keep an extra in the car and one always in the car seat.
