These bibs are great. They are sewn so that you flip the pocket inside-out so it stays open to catch any food that falls. I also love that they have a heavier - duty velcro than most bibs, so when my little one tries to pull it off it - it takes much more effort and I can stop him in time. I hand wash them in the sink and hang dry. They have held up well so far.
