This Harness is SO CUTE! I used to be against using these because i thought it made it look like you were walking your child like a dog but then i had TWINS! im a single mother so taking them out everywhere by myself can be challenging! My thoughts totally changed and i decided to order two of these to get my girls used to walking with me to the car etc. They fit them perfectly! They little angel wings give it an adorable design. The shipping was good as well considering it was coming from China to Massachusetts USA- It was delivered weeks before the expected delivery date!
