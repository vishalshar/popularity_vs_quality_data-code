I saw these slings at Target and found them comparable to sling type carriers I had seen in baby boutiques for $20 to $60 more. After I ordered it from amazon.com, I found myself wishing I had ordered it sooner! It has been the carrier that I use the most! I have a Baby Bjorn as well, which does get used, but this sling folds up small enough to stash in a pocket of a diaper bag, so I always have it with me. It comes with an instructional DVD on the various carrying positions which is very helpful. I have a large baby (almost 16 lbs at 2.5 months old) so he no longer fits the cradle hold and barely fits in the modified cradle hold (sitting upright facing slightly forward against your side) but I find the side carry extremely helpful for nursing on the go. I just wear a nursing top, put him in the side carry, throw a nursing cover over the top and I've been able to walk around the mall while feeding my baby discreetly. (By the way, you can purchase nursing covers for $30 but if you know how to sew, just look up a tutorial online for how to make one and do it yourself, they're super easy to make.) The custom sizing on this makes for a comfy fit and the print is super vibrant and goes really nicely with most of my clothing. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it everywhere I go.If your baby likes it, it is worth the cash.
