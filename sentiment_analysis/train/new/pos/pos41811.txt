These cameras were a great addition to the original startup kit. It took use let than 3 minutes to set up and it worked right away. We have 3 cameras setup now and we have every corner of our house, one in our bedroom, one in the playroom, and one in living room. I'm glad there were no interference issues having so many wireless cams set up in such a small place!
