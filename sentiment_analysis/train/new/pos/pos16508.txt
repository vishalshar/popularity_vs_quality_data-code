We bought these mats prior to winter 2009/2010, and now, 9 months later, they are still in the same shape as when they were new.  My 4 year old was a chronic seat kicker, and just the summer dirt was bad enough.  The thought of what winter muck would do to my seat backs made me quick to try these mats out, and I am glad I did.  For the price, they are a steal !  Initially, they did seem flimsy (the material is quite thin), but as I've mentioned, they held up through the winter and beyond perfectly, and will hopefully continue to do so.I have an SUV (Honda Pilot) which has pretty substantial seats, and had no problems with the bottom elastic band fitting over my seats.  The upper strap that goes around/under the head rests is adjustable with Velcro, however it didn't adjust quite small enough for me.  This wasn't a big issue for me, it only meant that the top of the mat wasn't flush with the seat, but hung away from the seat about an inch, which does not affect it's performance at all. If you have a child that isn't in a 5-point harness and is a "grabber," I suppose this could be a temptation to pull on it, but that never happened to me (just mentioning it in case you have a grabby kid !).  Again, my seats are pretty big, but the cover was adequately long, going almost all the way to the bottom of my seats, which was more than long enough for my 4 year old's leg reach.I would recommend this product to anyone needing mats.  It's worked well for us, and is a real bargain !
