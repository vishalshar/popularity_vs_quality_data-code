i noticed there were no reviews on this crib on amazon. it is also available on walmart.com which has several reviews which is why i purchased this crib. both sites were close in price,but for free delivery i chose amazon. i ordered it on Thursday and received it on Tuesday. my husband put it together easily it took him about 30 minutes. the crib is beautiful and very girly which is exactly what i wanted. it seems very sturdy as well and for me was most affordable. there are cribs that cost less but they don't look as nice as this one and most are mini or portable. i wanted a full size.
