I'm a huge Dumbo fan. This Dumbo toy couldn't be any cuter. The bright colors get my daughter's attention. She is just starting to bat at toys and loves to have him in her car seat when we go out. The orange portion of his left ear has crinkle material inside and folds back to reveal a mirror. He also jingles when you shake him. Great quality. Very happy with this toy!
