I have the Baby Bjorn little potty and this one seems smaller. It's perfect for 6-12 month olds who are doing Elimination Communication.Compared to the Baby Bjorn little potty: -This one has a nice high back, making it easier for new sitters to stay balanced. It also makes it easier to place them on the potty (especially at night) since you don't have to worry about their bottom not being on the seat, and you definitely want their front to be within range! -It's also a bit more narrow, and you can see that it doesn't have much to sit on in the back- making it easier to mimic the natural squatting position that is easiest to move bowels in. -The plastic is textured on the seat, no slipping around if things get damp. -While the bowl is more narrow (makes it a little harder to wipe out) it seems a little deeper, but you'll probably still end up with poo on a bottom with a big movement... It's pretty much impossible to get away from that with a potty that's going to allow their legs to be in the right position. -It costs less. We have a winner.It's about the same when it comes to dumping the contents (there's a groove on the back for your hand, contents go over the front lip) and sliding around on the floor(it slides). I haven't had a problem with either potty as far as sturdiness.The only negative that's different from the Bjorn is the lack of colors to choose from which isn't really bothersome.
