For background, I found it difficult to find the exact car adapter I needed. There are so many options, and I was cautious about getting the correct one so it would work and not cause a short or issue with my pump.This works perfectly with the Medela Advanced Personal Double Breastpump, the one that comes in the tan, rectangular carrying case (a commonly provided pump by insurance companies).The cord is plenty long to use the pump in any position in the front seat - driver or passenger. I am not positive if it would reach to the back seat - that would depend on the size of your car of course.I found the power was just slightly lower than when using the plug in the wall. This may have been due to the car - I've been using it in an older car. There was plenty of power to express milk easily, and I just turned up the pump level slightly higher than normal. The power level was maintained consistently for the 20 minute period I pumped. It is just as efficient as using the wall plug.For me, this is a must-have item for pumping on-the-go.
