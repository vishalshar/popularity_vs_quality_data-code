I had some trepidation about whether my baby (almost 13 months) would let me brush her teeth because she doesn't like us trying to check if a new tooth is breaking through (she currently has 8 teeth), but she loves me brushing with this cute little finger brush. The brush protects my finger when she bites down to chew on it a bit, which is nice from my point of view. Apparently, it is for babies 3 months old and older, but I missed the memo that we were supposed to be brushing that early. She only broke his first tooth through a couple months ago! Experts say you should brush even when it's just gums. My bad. Anyway, highly recommend.We've been using this for a few months now and she really likes it. She enjoyed the taste of the toothpaste and was very excited about the toothbrush. My daughter is very picky about flavors, and she never once complained about or refused to use this like she's done to so many other brands.I really love the NUK tooth & gum cleanser, It makes me feel good to help getup those food particles left behind and also it's teaching my baby girl how to use toothpaste on her toothbrush.p.s. Pluses for the toothbrush, it fits perfectly even on big fingers, now, not only I brush my daughter's teeth, but my husband do this as well.
