Purchased this when daughter was a month or two months old. She spitted up a lot and this helped her to lessen the spit ups after every feeding. Soft and plush like a pillow and perfect as her own movie chair. Eventually became feisty and adventurous that she wouldn't sit still in it. We still sometimes use it if we're in the bedroom but want to feed her food without lugging the highchair up the stairs. It's been 5-6months since we've got it. It's worth it. If she doesn't use it often now, she will likely enjoy it more as a toddler. Who doesn't love a bean bag?
