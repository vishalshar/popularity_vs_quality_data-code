I really like these diapers.  Bought them because they were cheaper than most pocket diapers.  The liner is the same size as gdiaper liners, so very handy for us since we have both.  Not bulky at all, and actually kept my daughter dry all night which we have not found in any other cloth diaper. However, do NOT wash or dry on hot.  We melted the plastic liner on all of them by doing this and ruined them.  I use warm water and delicate cycle dry. I'm buying more because of their great fit (my daughter is tallish and skinnyish, but pretty middle of the road),  amazing absorbency, and excellent pricing.After buying another 5 pack, the liners again melted.  I now realize it's our more-than-15-year-old-dryer that incinerates everything. I have learned to line dry the diaper and put the liners in the dryer.  they're all dry at the same time  :)
