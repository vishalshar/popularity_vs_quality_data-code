This is a little smaller than I expected, but otherwise I really like it! I was expecting this hamper to be made of some sort of cloth material; however, it is made from a durable plastic material...this make since so it does not absorb smell or anything from clothing.The lid is a nice feature; however, I keep it open all the time or folded back so it stays open all the time just because it is easier to throw clothes inside. It's soft and I really like it. This is prefect for a baby or toddlers room, not suitable for a teenager or adult with lots of clothes.*If my review was helpful in your decision making at all, please select "yes" below.
