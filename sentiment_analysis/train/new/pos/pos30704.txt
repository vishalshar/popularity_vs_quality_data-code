These bottles are great!  I was looking for a bottle for my infant twins that didn't have some gimmick resulting in lots of extra parts to wash. With twins who wants extra work?  I liked the Playtex nipples when I had my first child and used the Drop-Ins for a long time.  I bought the twins some VentAire which uses the same nipple.  They liked them just fine, but they had lots of extra parts, so I considered the drop-ins for them as well... but then I'd need to shell out money for refills very frequently.  That wasn't appealing either, so I was on the hunt for gimmick-free wide style bottles.  The Avents are nice, but expensive and I think some of them do have extra parts now, Born Free is way too expensive considering I was going to be buying double, everything else had loads of extra parts.  So, I found these on a whim and thought I'd try them.  They are great!  I will say that in comparison to the slow flow Playtex nipple, this was QUITE fast!  That could be a good thing or a bad thing.  It did cut their feeding time in half when we made the switch.  They've done fine with them and we will continue to use them throughout their first year.  They wash well too - either by hand or in the dishwasher.  A few months ago Amazon had such an amazing price on these that I took advantage of getting plenty for both twins.  These are the winner of the bottle contest for both the twins and their mommy!  Thanks Evenflo and Amazon for this great product at an incredible price!
