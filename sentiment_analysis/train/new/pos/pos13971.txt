The baby toy industry has certainly changed since my firstborn back in 1972. Now I enjoy shopping for Grandchildren and the newest is three months old and the product of musician parents. So obviously while we introduce all sorts of ways to explore his world, music is a part of it. I am very impressed with this piano. I wanted something that he could bat at while he sits on my lap at the table. Of course he'll be able to use it when he sits alone, or in a high-chair, but we aren't at that stage yet. I LOVE the soft keys and the general size of the toy. Not too bulky, clumsy or big. Just right.  The three different languages is also a huge plus for this family! Of course his dad had to "play" with it first and immediately plunked out some Beethoven. I really can't say enough good things about this item and I'll be exploring Baby Einstein for more gems. Meanwhile, whether your baby is musical or not, THIS is a very versatile toy. Lots of ways to explore, color, sights, lights, sounds and counting and language. Pretty cool for a small package. Get it, you won't be disappointed.
