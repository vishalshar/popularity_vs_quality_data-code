I bought this not for baby bottles, but for my wife's Hydro Flask (narrow mouth, 18 oz.) and Camelback bottles (750 ml), and my Hydro Flask (standard mouth, 21 oz.). I have used it once so far on my Hydro Flask and her Hydro Flask, and can say it was worth the investment. It fits in both the narrow mouth (1 1/2 in. diameter) Hydro Flask, albeit it's a bit snug going in the first time. It is less snug going through the standard mouth (2 in diameter, which I believe is closer in size to a baby bottle opening). The handle is long enough to do the 750 ml Camelback, and my 21 oz Hydro Flask, with just enough handle to hold on to to get the job done. We've yet to test the nipple brush on the bite valve for the Camelback (as the wife decided it was clean enough for the moment), but I'm expecting it will clean the valve a lot better than the current way we've been doing it.The bristles and the pouf mesh on it remove tea, coffee, and hot chocolate from the side of the hot & cold Hydro Flask bottles quite well.In all, I would recommend this product for anyone seeking a brush to clean 12-21 oz Hydro Flasks and any water bottles in the Camelback style. It's certainly worth the investment.
