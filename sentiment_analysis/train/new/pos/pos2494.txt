I would give this necklace (and others by "The Art Of Cure") more stars if I could. We started with my daughter 2 and a half years ago on the plain honey. She was 3 months old. Fell in love with it because it really worked. She still wears hers to this day even though it's not needed for teething. These baltic necklaces are great for other pain relief too. She never cries getting shots or when she is bleeding from a boo-boo. I highly recommend these! My son is 3 months old and started teething so I came right back to a great brand that I trust to work. Got this mosaic necklace and it fits my chunky monkey very well. All the beads are smooth and round so they will not be annoying. He has worn it for over 24 hours straight anf has not been so fussy, sleeps better and less chewing on everything. Yes, my kids sleep in them. We only take them off for a bath. The beads must warm up against the skin to work the best so off for long periods of time doesn't help.I am throwing in a picture of my daughter wearing hers too. Same brand, different model. She has been wearing it for 2 years nonstop and it still fits great.
