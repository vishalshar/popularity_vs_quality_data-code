When I first saw these I was unsure about it because there were no reviews on it but the price was great and they looked so cute and not to mention I got free shipping. I am soooo glad I decided to purhase these. They were better than I expected.They are not the softest on the market but they are no where near the worst in the market either. They do the job and are so cute. I would definetely recommend. Great as a gift too. I also got the "I Love Mommy" set too. Love it!
