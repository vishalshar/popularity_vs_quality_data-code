I purchased this 3.5 years ago and filled out with pictures of my daughter.  The picture slots are good sized for a perfect 4x6 fit and pictures go in easy.  My daughter and her little brother look through this on a regular basis and have never ripped anything out even when they are rough with it.  Would purchase again!
