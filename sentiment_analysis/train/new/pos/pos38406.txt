It appeared after we got the scale that it requires 4 C-batteries which took some time to find and costed 7.59, so the item price is really more than it shown because AC adapter is also costs additional money. Usually such parts are included. That was a real disappointment as I wasted time to find batteries.Frankly speaking the scale a good in use changing lb/oz to Kg/g just by 1 click to special button. The weight is indicated one and the same in all attempts - it is a feature of professional equipment. The table is rather big and strong and has a soft washable pad for a baby. It also has some special additional tables for small packages, letters or bottles to transform scale to correspondence or parcel use, if need be.Precision is excellent (1-2g) but only when the load up to 1kg, Loading 1-25 kg the precision appears the same as in competitive models (10g),  which cost approx. $25 less, but they don't have above-mentioned advantages.
