We bought this for our daughter and it looks great.  First off the shipping and delivery was right on time and relatively quick (less than a week).  I consider myself relatively handy, so the comments about it taking a while to build didn't scare me.  Truth be told it took about an hour-and-a-half for me to construct; with some help by my daughter along the way.  The reason is you'll have to construct the head board and foot board including all of the slats for the foot board & head board (the whole thing comes in the box "knocked down").  You'll need a small Phillips screw driver along with the provided allen wrench for tools.  The directions are easy to follow and while they identify all the pieces and hardware in the directions each of the actual pieces do not have their corresponding marks on them.  Needless to say this takes a little more time getting pieces sorted out.  Once assembled the bed is really sturdy, moreover my daughter loves it; I gave it 4 stars only because they didn't mark the pieces like in the directions but I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for a toddler bed.
