I bought this bath toy for my daughter for christmas just before she turned one. I got it because it looked cute, but now that we have it, I've realized it is a really great learning toy. She loves to stack the rings back onto the post on the snail's back, and is starting to learn that they need to go on in order of largest to smallest so that they all fit. What a great learning toy for the bath! The rings do different things as well - one is a shaker, one has little wheels in it that spin when water goes through it, and the other has little counting beads on one end. Packed full of learning!
