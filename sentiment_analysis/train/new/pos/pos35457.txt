Trust me - this hammock works great - you have that box or bag full of stuffed-animals in your house - you know you do.  Why haven't you tossed them?  Because they have some sort of sentimental value, right?  The problem?  Stuffed-animals don't display well.  Guess what?  Now they do - easy install with just a couple of tacks and this baby makes those old stuffed animals a nice decorative piece in any room.  Only one word of caution - be careful with the weight.  The supplied tacks don't go all that deep into the drywall - I really wouldn't exceed more than 25 lbs. of stuffed animals in this hammock.  Cheers!
