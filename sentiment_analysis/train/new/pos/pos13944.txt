My daughter will stare intently at these different cards for minutes at a time. I put three of them in a long frame together. They are a bit thick for a frame but I got it to work. Even though they are thick they are still made of paper so I won't let her handle them cause of course they would get mushy corners from her sucking on them. We do a series of them every morning where I hold them up for her. The reverse side with the Black background and White image holds her interest more intently. She even furrows her brow as she studies them.
