My 8 month old baby & I are often on the go. He refuses to drink his formula if its not warm. And, he will certainly complain as loudly as possible, until it is warm. I can't handle the screaming.THIS WARMER HAS BROUGHT PEACE, JOY & RAINBOWS TO OUR WORLD AS WE TRAVEL.Here is why;" The design is easy to use and fits snuggly around any size bottle. Genius!" The timer; also very easy to use. Large buttons with lights.* Heated my baby's bottles in approximately 15 minutes.I want to address the complaints on here about the amount of time it takes to warm a bottle with this warmer. A car charger cannot power a microwave oven. So if that is what you are expecting, try to get over yourself. 7-Eleven has microwaves & they have always been kind enough to let me use them.
