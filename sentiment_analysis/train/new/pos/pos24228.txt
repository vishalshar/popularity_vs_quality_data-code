I bought these a few months ago for my soon to be baby girl's room. I was a little disappointed when i couldnt figure them out, i was expecting a peel and stick but it turns out these are appliques and i wasnt doing it quite right. After contacting the seller, she walked me through step by step on how to do it and i was amazed "they do work!". After several hours of working with the 3 sets i bought i had a beautiful design! Some of the dots didnt transfer the best, most likely due to my inexperience and poor technique. All in all a great product and excellent costumer service!
