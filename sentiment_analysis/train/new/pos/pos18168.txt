I've become a major fan of the Lamaze toys.  They are delightful, colorful, and stimulating for a 3+month old baby that is learning to grasp, and explore textures and sounds.  The dog has it all.  crackly sounds in the bone, jingling bells in the feet, a squeaker in the chest, and a hilarious barking/panting sound when the nose is pushed.  Not only did my 6 month old go nuts for it, my poor dog was wild about it and desperately wanted it too!  I am so pleased.  We got a super quick ship and are very very happy.
