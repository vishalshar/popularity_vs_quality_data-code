My toddlers were having trouble reaching the water in our bathroom sinks, so I picked these up to make it easier for them. It was pretty difficult to get them on to our faucets but I did manage to stretch them on  -- we have the kind with a single knob in the center that you turn to adjust the temperature and pull up to turn on/push to turn off.The little guys were very happy that they now have "waterfalls for hands" to wash up in and I spend less time fighting to get them to do it.
