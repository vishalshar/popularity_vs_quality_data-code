I just received this today. I am so pleased with my purchase. Super simple to assemble, I didn't even look at the instructions. It's so cute, and the babies love it! The picture shown makes it look pretty small but it's much bigger than it looks. The package felt very light when I picked it up so I was a little worried they'd move it around or tip it if they tried to climb, but it's VERY sturdy! Very happy!
