Three years later and these still are must haves! I keep them on the stroller to go anywhere! At the grocery store, they are priceless. I hang a couple bags on them and then do my shopping. At the park, they hold the diaper changing station and keep my keys accessible. I even use these on my stroller with two handles that could hold bags themselves as they hold them better and I can slide my keys on them. The first year, I used the stroller daily and these were critical as they gave me the ability to carry things around town, but even now when I technically could figure out a way to not use them, I still consider them must-haves as I use them all the time.
