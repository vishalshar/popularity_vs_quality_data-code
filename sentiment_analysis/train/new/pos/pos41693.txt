I bought this for my newborn baby boy, and he and I absolutely loved it. It is literally one of the top 3 things on my list of must-have items for baby especially when you don't have a lot. I love the bright colors and zebra designs, and I was excited to find a unisex option available with a zebra on it. My kids rooms are decorated with zebra print, and I wanted to keep the same theme with all of them. The FP Adorable Animals Bouncer was the perfect pick. We used it everyday for at least the first year, and after he would sometimes use it to sit in on his own when watching a movie or looking at books. I used it for the baby to sleep in at night right next to my bed when coming home from the hospital, and throughout the day for the baby to sit in and during some bottle feedings. I used it when it was time to start feeding baby foods, and it was also very convenient to move the baby in from room to room throughout the day. It is lightweight and easy to assemble and travel with, and it's easy to clean when needed with just sliding the seat off the frame and into the washer it goes. The toy bar and seat belt are easy to connect and disconnect, and it has a calming vibration feature that is battery-powered, so no plugs needed. Truly, a great value for the price. We highly recommend this bouncy seat because it was honestly something we couldn't have been without.
