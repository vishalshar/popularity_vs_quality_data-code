My 6yr old and 11 month old love the applesauce packs that you get in stores, but they are kind of expensive. And the baby food that comes in these pouches are even more expensive. These packs allow me to pack our own go-gurts, applesauce’s, and baby puree that I make with my baby Breeza to have grab and go snacks/meals without all the waste of the single use packs and for a fraction of the price. These are easy to clean and so far do not seem to hold food smells. I even left one with mango applesauce in it for a few days to ripen so I could see how they clean up. I have the cleaning brush that goes with the baby Breeza (I love that thing!) and it fits inside the spout perfectly. The grimy pack cleaned up great! I let them air dry on the bottle rack.  They have been used a few times and still look brand new. I was afraid that they would get thrown out at daycare or school, but so far so good. I also kept the caps from other baby food pouches that we had before these as extra caps and they fit the reusable ones. So far we haven't lost any caps anyways, but I thought just in case. As far as loading them up, it is very easy, the bottom opens up wide. In fact I just dump applesauce into them straight from the jar with no problem. So far they are tightly sealed and leak-proof.For those of you who think “why not just put the foods in some glad ware?" Well anyone with kids knows that kids will eat anything out of these magical little pouches! My picky 6yr old gobbled up spinach applesauce that I made in the Breeza without a second glance. My 11 month old is equally intrigued by this squirt and eat concept. And to be honest, when I saw the pouches in the store for the first time I though “how lazy are people these days?” But now after my second child I realize how convenient these are.
