I don't usually write reviews, but this pump was a revelation!  I had been using an older Medela pump in style and was only getting at most 4 ounces off both sides, sometimes only .5 ounce.  It was really frustrating as I am trying to build up a supply.  I went on an over night trip without my baby and forgot to bring my pump so I used my friends Spectra Dew.  I got double the amount of milk in half the time of the Medela!  I brought home more milk in 1 day of pumping than an entire weeks worth of pumping with the Medela.  I came straight home and ordered this pump.  I had no idea this pump was out there and thought Medela was supposed to be a superior product.  Not to say Medela is bad, but it just didn't work for me the way the Spectra does.  I highly highly recommend this product for any mom needing to pump!
