I got two of these, one in green and one in pink for my daughter, she was still on the bottle and I was just gonna give it a shot, when I first got them when she was 17 months old she would not drink out of them, she wanted her baba, and I didn't push her, she would eventually come around. Well four days ago, 20 months old, she was asking for baba, so I decided to give them another try, and I'm so glad I did, she took right to them, and didn't cry for her actual baba, we have named these cups milkies.She drinks from the straw cups, but when she's drinking milk, she will not drink it from a cup with a straw, it has to be one like this.I am a loyal Avent customer, and I would recommend these to anyone who are just trying to get they're baby drinking a sippy cup or, to transition from bottle, to sippy cup.
