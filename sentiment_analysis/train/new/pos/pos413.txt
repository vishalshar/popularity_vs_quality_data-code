There's not much I can really say other than it's a pillow and it gets the job done. My 16-month old son did not like it at first because it was too poofy. Now that it's flattened out a little, he enjoys using it a lot more. I did machine wash and dry and as advertised, it's durable and holds its shape even after being run through. I was very pleased to see that I did not have to shake it up a bunch to get the original rectangular shape back.
