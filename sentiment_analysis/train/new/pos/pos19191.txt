These are the best value baby washcloths you can buy. I like how soft they are. They aren't super high quality but they last just as long as any of the expensive ones we have. For being functional they get high marks from me. But if you are looking for plush, thick, high thread count cloths then you may want to select something else. For those of us on a budget who only care about getting the job done well & comfort on the skin, then these are the baby cloths for you. Great for making your own reusable "wet wipes".
