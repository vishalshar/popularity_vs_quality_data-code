I love that it's soft all the way around. Although my son didn't chew on the part that supposed to go on the mouth, he really love to the rest of it. We had it for quite a while and he's loved playing with it. However today I wanted to sanitize it in a microwavable sanitation bag and just fair warning that wasn't a good idea. It melted and now I need to toss it. So if you're going to sanitize it I assume just boil it.
