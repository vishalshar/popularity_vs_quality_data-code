My baby boy is 5 months & weighs 18lbs (too big for his infant car bucketseat, too heavy for my back, to be in a carrier), but is not yet able to sit by himself for more than a few seconds, so I needed something that would let me take him into the grocery store in the cart and strap him up, since he would otherwise topple over, or left, or right, in the cart. I looked through roughly 5 billion reviews and ended up purchasing this one, and I'm glad I did, because it worked well and we had a lovely time in the grocery store.  It's not perfect, however, so let me list the pros and cons:PROS:1) Fits different carts well and is easy to put on. Strap which attaches the cover to the 'seat back' is long enough to be put through a back with either tines or around one with a plastic advertising plaque.2) The 'harness' straps around his waist and over his shoulders, keeping him flat against the 'seat back' as well as preventing him from toppling left or right too .3) The cover is nicely padded, making it comfortable enough that my baby lasted a whole 30+ minutes in the cart without fussing.4) Comes with a pouch in the front, to put stuff in, as well as a pouch behind the 'seat back'; also has 3 fabric loops for attaching toys, keys, etc.CONS:1) The buckles on the straps are flimsy; I don't think they're dangerous, but they're really not worthy of the Jeep brand. They'll be getting an email from me presently.2) There is no cushioning for the sides, as some cart covers offer, so my baby really wasn't supported much from the sides. I walked straight into the toilet paper isle and stuck a packet of tp on either side of him to prop him up.3) In addition to the strap which attaches the cover, there are 4 sets of ribbons to attach the padding elsewhere. The ribbons are flimsy and won't really do much. Velcro tabs would have been a better idea. (Again, emailing them).I would still recommend this cover--it's attractive and works well enough, better than most covers, which don't have all the straps, and the price is very reasonable.
