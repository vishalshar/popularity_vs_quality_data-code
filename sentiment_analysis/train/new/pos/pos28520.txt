it came in much sooner than it said witch i am super happy about!!its just as adorable as it is in the photo.Mine is a bit bigger than i expected i was hoping she could wear it before 3-6 months but ill just have to wait,I washed as i do all my babys clothes before i even put them in the closet and the bow already fell off since it was just glued on...i didnt like that but it was a simple fix i just sewed it on!
