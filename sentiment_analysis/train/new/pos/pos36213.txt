I got my moses basket from the Amazon Warehouse for $20, so I paid quite a bit less than the regular price that e/one else paid.  It came in slightly damaged, but nothing that's noticeable once I got the bedding inside it.  Once put together, I was happy w/ the results. It's a cute basket and perfect for our soon-to-be little girl.  I don't expect to use it for long, but it'll be sufficient for those first couple months.  The quality of this basket probably isn't the best, but again, I didn't pay much for it, so I'm not bothered by that.  I like the colors.  It looks just like the picture.  Overall, I'm happy w/ the product, but I don't think I would have paid much more than $35 for it (and, at $20, it's a steal!).
