I love that this comes off and can be washed. My only complaint is that I can't get it to sit perfectly (as picture) once my toddler is in her stroller.I plan on getting some velcro and attempting to secure it that way so it won't slide around. But even though it isn't perfect, I love the ease of wash and continue to use it.
