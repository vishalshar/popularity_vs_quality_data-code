We've been using this monitor now for nearly 4 weeks. I looked at many different monitors but was impressed both by the fact that Motorola makes the device (a leader in wireless communication technology) and by the strong night light functionality.  The 3.5 inch screen version was not then available on Amazon so we decided to buy this version. The only difference between the two is $50, a slightly larger screen and the ability to zoom in from the remote. The bigger screen would be nice but we've found the 2.8 inch to be more than adequate. Like us, I think most people just want to have a quick look to see what their child is doing generally, and don't need to zoom in to just see their face for example.In summary:Video quality is outstanding, both in night mode (B&W) and day (color) modes.No interference problems so far and we live in a large apartment building.The sound sensitivity is excellent and volume is adjustable - we find about 1/2 way to max setting is plenty loud.The remote temperature sensor is nice to have and is accurateBattery life is good, but will not last all day unplugged especially if you are watching a lot of video.Both camera and parent unit appear to be well-built.Another small plus is the chargers are multi-voltage capable so can be used when traveling to Europe/Asia (just need plug adapter). I highly recommend this product to people who are looking for a video monitor.**Update 12/21/2011**Nearly 4 months on and we still love this monitor. A few additional comments:As other reviewers have noted there is a zoom function. 1X and 2X. I don't want to say it is useless but we have never used it (essentially digitally magnifies picture). However it is there if you want/need it.We replaced our wireless Belkin N+ router with a more powerful Asus dual band router. Since this time we have had, what appears to be, occasional interference. This only happens when the router is directly between the camera and parent unit. It is minor and has not diminished our use of the monitor. We've already bought one as a present for a family member, who also very happy with it.**Update 04/10/2012**We recently purchased an additional camera from Amazon and this has worked out great. It is very easy on the parent unit to either set it to switch back and forth automatically every 10-12 seconds or so or to simply switch manually if you like. For this you do not need to keep going back to the menu but rather you only need to double click the 'ok' button and it will then switch to the other camera.
