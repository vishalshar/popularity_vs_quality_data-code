These are great washcloths for what I need.  I can understand they aren't for everyone though.  They are VERY small and VERY thin (not like a typical washcloth).  However, that's what I want.  These are perfect to wash my toddlers in the bath, have them use to wash and play with in the tub, and don't take up much room when I have 3-4 hanging to dry in the bath.  I like the different colors and simplicity of the cloths.
