Don't have the expectation that a child harness is going to operate like your dog leash! If they're hyper and at a full run any harness is going yank on them, trip them and likely fall down.  We bought it for the airport specifically, this allowed our daughter to walk around and it didn't become a chase me game.  Gave it 4 stars because the strap can ride up under her chin but then again it would need a third strap between her legs to accomplish this.  It's still great for my exploring 20 month old.
