I love this cup for my son. He started using it when he was 6 months old, now at 8 months it is pretty much all he uses no more bottles. It was a very easy transition. It has a very soft spout much like a bottle and the handles can come off so it can fit in the bottle compartment of a diaper bag or cup holder in a stroller or car seat. Also it is very easy to line the spout and handles up (It isn't crooked when he drinks). It has easy to read measurement units so it is easy to mix formula in it. It is completely spill proof and comes with a cap and a lid for travel. The spouts fit on the nuk Orthodontic bottles too so you can mix and match. The design is cute as well.
