We got the Mushroom Rattle and it is adorable and affordable. Stuff like this on etsy can be expensive. I measured just to help out anyone who is interested. I always read reviews before purchasing. Its 5 in a half inches tall. The red cap is 9 inches around the middle. And the off white stem is 6 inches around the middle. My baby can hold it just find (4 months old). We have had it for a over a week so far and he still loves playing with it. Its pretty soft too!!!
