Like it because it isn't too bulky, does the job. Auto sleeps tablet when closed, fits well. " Leather" is stiff and flat - slightly better than cardboard, but nicer than plastic. I picked yellow because I'm sick of dark colors - can't find your stuff in the common tote, briefcase or purse because they tend to all be lined with black fabric. Only colors for me now - there are lots of bright ones to choose from with this case - white was not among them, so if you're looking for sophistication, you're stuck with black.
