Living in Southern Arizona, sun protection is a major concern.  It doesn't block everything, but it can help with shade, bugs, flying toys/sippy cups and so on.Pros:Fits the BOBBetter than trying to get a blanket to stay onHelps keep the rays/bugs/wind off of your kidHelps keep toys and suck IN the stroller!Cons:No window to check on your kid!Kiddos can get HOT because it also reduces air circulation.  UV mesh would be better than the screen!Instructions are HORRIBLE!  Someone needs to make a "for dummies" video on YouTube!No quick access to kiddo.  A zipper would be GREAT on the side!Overall, there's no other options for sun protection on the BOB.  I guess I'm glad I bought it, but I may need to make a Pinterest link on how to fix some of the cons.
