Just as described. Works well for my 13 month old granddaughter for daycare naps. Thin, so good for in crib or on cot. No padding for floor sleeping.  Washed a couple times already, gentle, cold water, dryed delicate setting on dryer, looks great. This is very small, do not recommend for older than 3 years. Good if looking for a thin under pad with blanket and pillow attached. Pillow does not come out for washing, but looks fine after washing and drying.
