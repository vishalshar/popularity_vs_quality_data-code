We like this toy it is fun to look at and play with. The fabric rings work well for little ones who like to taste everything, each one makes a diffrent sound jingles crinkles etc. My 7 month old like to take the rings off and chew on the giraffes head seems to soothe his gums. Overall this was a good purchase as it does what it should enertains little ones.
