I am in LOVE with this diaper cover and even purchased two more.  This is the only diaper cover that I know of which has ALL of the following awesome features:  a snap in the back to hold the insert in place (provided that the insert also has a snap), leg gussets, plenty of buttons for size adjustments, and an inner front pocket for securing the snapped insert even better or adding in an extra insert.  As everyone else stated, it is really big and would work best for an older baby or even a toddler, but that is not a big problem for me; I will just have to use smaller covers until my Little One is big enough to fit into it.  However, if you need it right away for a newborn, don't bother.The only thing that stopped me from rating it five stars is that the PUL is not very good quality, but in light of all of the other unique features, that did not stop me from loving the item.  When I washed it for the first time, it took FOREVER to hang dry for it to be just a cover and I noticed that was because it absorbed most of the water rather than repelled it.  Anything that is waterproof should really be doing more repelling of water than absorbing.  This means that it can end up allowing urine to soak through onto clothes and sheets, but again, for me the pros of this product outweighed the cons.
