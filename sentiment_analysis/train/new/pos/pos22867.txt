I've been using this cart cover for about 6 months now and I'm glad I chose the Taggies cover. I've washed it about every other week so, 10+ times and it still looks like new. My daughter is 18 months now and I still use it even though she is more toddler than baby. When I first bought the cover I thought it was more for babies than anything else but now I realize I'll probably use this until my daughter outgrows sitting in the cart. It keeps her comfortable, the fabric is plush and the lap belt has lots of room to grow into. I like that there is extra padding at the leg holes because my daughter often wears a dress or romper.I keep mine in the car when it's not being washed and just take it out of the plastic bag it comes in when I get to the store. It's probably bigger than most in that it doesn't fit in my purse or small carry bag but that is because it is a thick plush material. I don't mind though, it's simple to put on the cart and take off with one hand while holding a toddler. All in all I'm really happy with this cover. It's held up with lots of use and didn't fall apart after a few washings.
