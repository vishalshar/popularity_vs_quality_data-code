When we found out we were having triplets, we like all other multiple parents bought a stroller to accommodate all the babies.  The stroller is so large that we can not even fit it into a mini van.  We have to purchase a large SUV or Full size van to go anywhere.  We bought the Latch Lock carriers from baby trend and we just love them.  When we saw the stroller that went along with them.  We decided to order the Double Snap N Go.  The stroller comes all put together, you just need to snap on the wheels.  Then comes the fun part.  The stroller is made for many different brands of carriers.  You find the carrier you are using in the instruction manual and then you remove bars or rearrange them to fit your carrier.  It is very simple and all the parts are well labeled.  The carriers just snap on to the top, just like when you snap them into the base that is in the car.  There is a strap that goes over the lower half of the carrier to prevent it from rocking or coming off the stroller.  It is great because you do not have to unsnap your baby from the car seat and them snap them into the stroller.  No need to transfer toys and blankets from car seat to stroller.  What a time saver.  It is very light weight and easy to set up.  I pull it out of the trunk and just snap and lock it into place.  I then just snap the carriers in place and we are off.  It takes up the same amount of room that a normal single travel system would take up.  For all you shoppers out there.  I took the stroller into a women's clothing store and was able to easily navigate the store.  The stroller handles very well.  The front wheels are adjustable.  You can set them for straight ahead or let them rotate.  Because we have 3 babies, we easily become a tourist attraction.  The stroller handles so well that I was able to move swiftly and accurately through spectators and display racks.  We love the Double Snap N Go so much that we have asked for the Single Snap N Go for our Baby Shower.
