Very pleased with this harness backpack. I almost didn't but it because of previous reviews saying how small the storage compartments were but I went ahead and bought because of the price. At the time I was worried about safety in airports and crowds and not whether my 1 and a half year old was carrying his own weight or not. He immediately loved the "big kid" look of the backpack and is always exited to wear it. Turns out that the main compartmet is plenty big for a couple diapers and a small package of wipes which is a plus. We also found that the outside sleeve will stretch to fit a small sippy cup without damage to the backpack but it is a really tight fit. Now that he is 3 it is the perfect thing for him to carry around since he no longer needs a diaper bag and mommy is tired of gold fish crumbs in her purse!
