This really is a gorgeous toddler set. The colors are bright and vibrant. The sheets, pillowcases and comforter as smooth and soft. It also seems to be holding up well. My daughter loves Rapunzel, so naturally, she loves this.Now for my complanints - and I'll just start off by saying that these weren't bad enough for me to send the set back. First - the flat sheet (the white one) is ugly. I'm not sure why they had such great designs for the other pieces except for this one. It has a Rapunzel picture on it, over and over, and the picture is kind of blurry, not to mention her lips look way too big for her face and the colors appear to be a bit faded. With the great quality of this set, it just kind of puzzles me why such a weird sheet was thrown in. However, the sheet is still smooth and soft.My second complaint is the comoforter, the big tags are located at the top of it, right in the middle, so they are on my child's neck at night. Normally I try to fold the comforter over at the edge to hide them. But it's still weird and stupidly thought out.Other than those two things it really is a great set. Just keep those things in mind.
