We were having trouble deciding what to get our new baby boy for Christmas this year. After all he will only be 3 months old. When we came across this adorable teething rattle we thought it would be just perfect for him. We love the baby einstein toys they are always good quality toys. This little teething rattle was exactly what we expected and we are very pleased with our purchase. This rattle does rattle and it is very colorful, so it will be sure to keep his attention, it also has a top that is made for teething so it will give him something to chew on. We recommend this product to others. It is alot cheaper on Amazon than it is in the store too!
