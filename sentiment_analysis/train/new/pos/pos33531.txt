Because I'm WARM, do you hear me, WARM!!I held off on buying the Snuggie until my wife got one from her brother for Christmas.  Then I had to have my own.  The things is just too darn warm, comfortable and, yes, snuggable to be without!  The arms are a perfect touch, they keep it from falling down around you like a regular blanket or throw does.  The fleece is thick enough to take a slight chill out of the air, yet not so thick that you'll be uncomfortably warm.  The enclosed reading light is a nice touch.  It turns itself on and opens itself as well.  Too cool.Reviews on this item vary widely, depending on which vendor one dealt with.  All I can say is that mine arrived in a very timely fashion, no issues whatsoever.  I used SVM Products, the same dealer that sells the one I'm reviewing.The only problem I had with it is that it can fall off your shoulders after a while.  A little Mighty Mendit fabric glue (good ol' Billy Mays) applied to the two sides of the neck opening turned mine into a closed collar Snuggie and solved the dilemma.BTW, it's worth a few extra pennies to get the Snuggie Deluxe like I did.  The fleece is a little thicker and it has pockets!For those concerned about it holding up to washing: use Woolite, cold water, gentle cycle.  And stay warm.
