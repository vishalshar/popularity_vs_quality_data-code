Bought this for my baby's room along with multiple other similar style butterflies to mount on the wall. I hung this mobile from the ceiling in the corner of the room and it just looks perfect. It is fairly fragile and easy to tangle so it's not something you'd want to be messing with a lot and it should be hung out of reach of little ones. But it looks so cute and my baby girl loves it....she stares at it all the time while we rock in her room! Perfect addition to her butterfly themed room!
