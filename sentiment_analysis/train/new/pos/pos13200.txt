I really love this stroller so far.  Its very light and convenient and great to use as a mall stroller or some light walking.  If you are going to use it for something more durable (ie: bumpy sidewalks, off path trails) or you want your baby to take a nap in it, use it for hours on end....etc, I wouldn't recommend it-(we have another stroller for that). But for a daily quick use, simple umbrella stroller, I love it. I only have 2 cons so far- 1) One of the reason I got this stroller was because the pad was suppose to be easy to remove and throw in the washing machine.  However, that is not the case.  Its a bit arduous to take off and just easier to wipe off. So far- wiping off hasn't been a problem.  2)Its marketed as a single hand collapse system, but so far, I haven't been able to do that.  It always takes me two hands to break it down. Its not that inconvenient, but its not a simple push button that you might think it would be.  Overall- satisfied with the stroller and would recommend it as a very basic light stroller to use.
