This product turned out to be even better than I expected! I had moved from a large diaper bag for my 9-month old, to a much smaller one. I had been carrying the Kalencom Quick Change Kit with the integrated changing pad and room for a travel wipes container, etc. It was nice, but fairly large and bulky. I needed something to help save space in the new bag.I ordered the My Royal Heinie Wallet in Sunset. It is a nice red color with a red/orange trim, which would be great for a boy or a girl. When I initially received it, my first thoughts were, 1. it looked like a nice, quality product; and 2. it looked too small to fit my baby's diapers (size 3). To my surprise, it fit the size 3 diapers with room to spare!Since the Kalencom Quick Change kit was too big for my new, smaller bag, I had been carrying the diapers and travel wipes container separately in the new bag. I was also surprised at how much room this wallet saved in my bag over just carrying the diapers and travel wipes containers by themselves. It also helps keep the diapers from getting wrinkled up in the bag.I also love the fact that the soft wipes case is integrated into the wallet. It makes diaper changes and quick clean-ups on-the-go so much more convenient than having the separate, hard travel wipes case. I tuck a compact travel changing pad into the wallet, along with the diapers and wipes, and we are good to go!This is a nice looking, compact, quality product that has definitely made a big difference for me when I am out-and-about with my baby. It is also something that I see myself using for quite a while longer, right into the toddler stage. I love it!!!
