Well-made quality back pack! I love that I can have all my hands free with baby and all the supplies!  And I love my husband can take it and pack it and not feel weird about carrying a woman's purse--which is what a lot of diaper bags look like now. The two zipped pockets on the inside are nice and roomy. I am a breast feeding mom, there are more than enough compartments for keys, nursing supplies, changing supplies, sunglasses, and extra clothes for my son. I really love it. The quality of the bag is well made, just like the baby carrier. I love them both.
