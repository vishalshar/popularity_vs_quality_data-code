Both my daughters have slept in GroBags. My youngest daughter especially loves them, and I don't see her giving them up any time soon. She's 14 months, and wears a 2T clothing size, at least. So, I purchased this in 18-36 month size. It looked huge when it arrived, but it's very comfy for her. It's not so loose that I have to worry about it sliding over her head, and I'm glad there is room for it to grow. I have washed GroBags hundreds of times and they still look pretty new. This one's all cotton-knit, and it isn't pilling or showing wear at all. It seems to get softer with each wash.I wish these were easier to buy in the US. Amazing product. I recommend them to all the moms I know!
