This universal fit spout guard fit our Moen spout perfectly.  There is a cutout at the top that allows the shower level to stick through.  I prefer this design of inflatable guards to the hard rubber kind as they offer a little bit more cushioning.  I hope no part of our toddler ever comes in contact with the spout, but if it does, this should do a decent job of cushioning the blow.  We just leave this installed at all times as it works fine for adults baths and showers too.  Its worth mentioning that if you leave it on at all times, you should still periodically take it off to clean underneath as I could see mold eventually growing if you never clean it.
