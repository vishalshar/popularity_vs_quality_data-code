The Beco is the 3rd baby carrier we've tried.  First we tried the original baby bjorn, which both my baby and I hated.  It didn't fit him well at any stage and was very uncomfortable for me.  Next we tried the Moby.  I really wanted to like it, but it was so cumbersome and after wearing it for a few minutes my wiggly baby made it so loose that I never felt he was well supported.  Plus, it was so much fabric I was always hot and sweaty, and I never did understand how I was supposed to wrap the thing without dragging the fabric on the ground.  Finally, we bought the Beco, and it was definitely the best of the 3.Pros:*Thick and comfortable padded straps*Waist belt really does distribute the weight*Stylish design*Soft and no hard plastic buckles digging into baby's crotch or bottom*Many different position options*Probably the easiest to put on and off, and the easiest to get baby in and out ofCons:*Price (however, if we'd bought this first we could have saved money on all the other carriers we had to try!)*the "seat" is rather wide--even on the smaller position I feel like my 5 month old is doing the splits when he's forward facing, and  he's not a small baby.*The buckles are hard to open, but this is a safety feature so I understand why
