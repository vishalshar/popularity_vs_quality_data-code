I went to several local stores to find these, and hit a brick wall.  Finally someone at the Babies R Us told me to go online.  I found them here, and they were perfect.  The ones that I was replacing were older and longer.  These are perfect length, maybe a little to long, but nothing like the older ones.  They also seem a better quality than what I had before.
