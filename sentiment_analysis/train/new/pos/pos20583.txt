We bought this along with the matching convertible crib. Assembly was straight-forward, and all the pieces fit together well. The finished product feels sturdy. It is weighty without being to heavy to move when necessary. The included changing pad is very thin and has a vinyl-y feel to it, and our child only cries while being changed when he's on the pad. It might be worth purchasing a more cushioned, contoured pad.We bought the dresser in chestnut. The finish is quite delicate. It scratches easily. However the colour is very pleasing, different from the standard black or white or espresso or unfinished options that are common in furniture at this price point.It doesn't feel wobbly, although I will probably use the included stabilizing strap to anchor it to the wall once our child is a little older.The drawers are a good size. We have yet to fill all the drawers with our one-month old's clothing and blankets. The drawers open and close smoothly, but they knock loudly when shut. We stuck foam bumpers where the drawers' front panels meet the frame to muffle the sound.Overall, we are very pleased with the dresser.
