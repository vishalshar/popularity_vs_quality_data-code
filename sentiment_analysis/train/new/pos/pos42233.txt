This pillowcase is truly microfiber. Theres alot of cases that claim to be, but this stiching is tighter than most i've gotten that said they were "micro-fiber" The Sheet is kinda plain with some flowers on it, but tinks pillowcase is nice, and my daughters fought over it when I 1st got it. they both wanted it so bad. but i only bought 1 and they had to deal with it. maybe ill buy another for her bday.I would recommend this product!
