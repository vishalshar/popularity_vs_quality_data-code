The PopDecors tree is FANTASTIC! If you've ever played with vinyl before you'll know what transfer paper is. PopDecors tree comes to you ready to use on the transfer paper, just trim out the pieces, and peel them off the transfer paper as you stick them to the wall. The color is lovely and the vinyl sticks well, put it up a week ago and still no issue. I was even able to re-adjust a few leaves as I was looking at it a few days later. Plus PopDecors sends you 2 pages of 'how-tos' including which branch goes where and how to adhere the vinyl to the wall, i.e. how to peel back the transfer paper with a step by step tutorial. They even give you a 'sample' piece to test on your wall!Be aware of what you put in your cart. Because this tree is sold by a 3rd party vendor (PopDecors and others) Amazon sorts the cheapest price to the top and that's the one you put in your cart unless you select another seller. I made that mistake and accidentally ordered from not PopDecors. I remedied that immediately.
