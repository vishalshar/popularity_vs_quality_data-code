The mobile is made of light plastic materials.  Some reviewers think this is a downside, but when you have your air or fan on low, the mobile moves easily.  Since the material has a little more weight, it doesn't move as easily as the card stock used in other Flensted's mobiles.  The first assembly was a little tricky, but after the first, I was able to assemble the other planes quickly.  A word of caution, if you are using this over a crib, make sure there is no way your child can reach (adjust as they grow).  My daughter started to play with another Flentsed mobile I had purchased and the balance was never the same.  I was unsuccessful at repairing so I have to order a new one.
