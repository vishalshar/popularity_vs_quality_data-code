Tried a couple of food trays to freeze steamed veggies, and this tray seemed to work the best.  It freezes a block of food in a perfect ~2oz serving size which allows us to mix different food combos together at mealtime.  Easy to pop out frozen food, and easy to clean.  Only downside is the lid doesn't go on very well, but we only need it to cover the food until it freezes so it hasn't been a big deal.
