I really like the thermometer it's perfect for bottles and babies but there are two things that I didn't appreciate.1: The C/F conversion was a pain to figure out, even with the manual. Here is how to do it for those who need help. When the device is off, press and hold the side button (button 3) for 10 secs, when you see the little C blinking on the bottom below the middle dotted line, press button 3 again once and quickly. When it changes to a blinking F you got it.2. You may not get accurate readings on newborns, it even says so in the manual which is disappointing. Doctors say newer temporal artery thermometers, which use an infrared scanner to measure the temperature of the temporal artery in the forehead, are accurate to use if your child is at least 3 months old. Good news though is that underarm readings from infrared thermometers are more accurate the the advertised forehead method.
