I wanted to keep an inexpensive umbrella stroller at my house for when my granddaughter comes to visit.  I looked at all the $19.00 versions locally, and was very disappointed in the quality of the strollers.  Very flimsy material, no brakes on the wheels, and no adjustable backs.  After reading about the Fisher Price Precious Plants umbrella stroller, I decided that, for a little more money, I could get a good quality stroller that would work for my granddaughter, as well as any future grandchildren.  What a great decision!  This stroller is solidly built with brakes, an adjustable back to acommodate very small babies as well as older children,a canopy (which I wish was larger to help keep the sun out), a cupholder for grandma, and a mesh bag to hold items such as extra diapers, etc.  My granddaughter and I have taken quite a few walks with this stroller, and it has worked perfectly.  Turns on a dime and can be controlled with one hand, as one would expect an umbrella stroller to do.  Collapses for storage, which is nice, too.  Don't waste your money on the cheap $19.00 versions!  Spend a little more and get a stroller of quality which will last for many years!
