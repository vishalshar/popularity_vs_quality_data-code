I have the UppaBaby Cruz and this organizer works great on it, stayed in place. Right away the wipe dispenser came in handy! The little phone pocket is a bit small, might have just been my case though. The fold down pocket was perfect for keeping a few toys and a burp cloth in for quick access.  This is a great organizer for the price.
