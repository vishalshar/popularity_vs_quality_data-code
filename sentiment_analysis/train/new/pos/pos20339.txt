I just bought another one of these sheets. My little guy really loves them. I do not use a mattress topper in my pack and play and the sheet is TIGHT. But I guess thats ok. I have the Carters Elephant Parade Comfort 'N Care Playard & Changer so it works. I DO NOT recommend this placard as the diaper caddy falls off easily and really doesn't have the right size pockets. OK, back to the sheet... I use it with a quilted waterproof pad under and although it is tight, it fits well. I did buy an additional one for grandma's house and we used it WITHOUT the pad and it was still soft enough.It is super soft and doesn't get cold so the temperature change from mommy to sheet doesn't shock him if he's already sleeping.PROS:softfits tightlywashes wellCONS:hard to fold since it is stretchy all the way around the edgeI would recommend this to anyone looking for a soft sheet for the pack and play!UPDATE: (using this sheet for 9 months)My baby LOVES this sheet. I thought it would be too hot for FL but it breathes. I bought another one for an extra and recommend it to friends. It seems to keep wetness off the mattress too.
