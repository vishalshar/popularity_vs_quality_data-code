I bought these scissors when my daughter was very young and we were having trouble clipping her nails with a traditional nail clipper, even the baby size. Those tiny little nails are so difficult to cut! The scissors were a solution recommended to me and I am so glad that I purchased them. You can trim along the fingertip without catching any skin with much more easy and care than a clipping motion will allow. This particular brand is durable, comes with a cover, and is perfect for the diaper bag or home. Highly recommend for anyone with a baby, toddler or young child!
