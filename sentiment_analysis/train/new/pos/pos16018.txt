This was the first sippy cup that my boy used and its still his favorite, even though he can drink from just about any sippy cup now. Recently, I discovered that I could use the nipple and handle on regular Avent bottles that we already had. This was great for when I fell behind on doing dishes... I simply rinsed the nipple attachment and put it on the Avent bottles. It also allowed us to bring along a few different drinks on trips and simply move the nipple/handle to the different drinks depending on what he wanted.I've not had a problem with leaking or losing parts... I'm not sure why some would find them hard to take apart? It has like three peices? Leaking hasn't been an issue at all, in fact these were the only type I had that didn't leak. Of course they have to be assembled right to not leak. If you forget the valve, they will leak.I particularly like the spout design which allows him to drink without getting solids into the cup. When he drank during his meals with the Gerber cup, all sorts of particles would end up in the cup. Not so with this one.
