These are really cute.  The monkey is a really nice soft toy that is just the right size for little baby hands.  It works with the avent pacifiers we use. The only thing I don't like is that the angle at which the pacifier is held causes it to be pushed out of my little one's mouth.  He has to work a little harder to keep it there.  We have a Wubbanub as well and it stays put much better.  Honestly, my son seems to prefer to hold the paci plushie so we use it when we are out.  The wubbanub stays in place better so we use it at home when he's sleeping.  The company website says that they are working on making larger size paci plushies which would be a great idea to market for toddlers.  I would definitely be interested in buying one in the future.
