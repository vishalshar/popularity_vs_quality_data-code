Being deep into the second generation of toddlers I've gotten close to the end of my rope on blocks. The stacking rings are also beginning to lose their appeal. And then we found this. Different things to stack. Different material. Interesting colors. More fun and creative ways to knock them over. Something for the littlest guy that isn't a hand me down from his mother by way of his older brothers.What's not to love? They've held up fine; they're good for a laugh; they roll around; they're easy to handle. And they're a bit more of a challenge. It's all good.
