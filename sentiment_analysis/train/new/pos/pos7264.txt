My husband and I did a lot of online research when choosing which highchair to get our little on. We live in an apartment, so we didn't want anything to large that takes up space. We loved that the parts to the Keter can be stowed away in the base of the chair!We also eat at our fairly large coffee table (being Asian and all, it's pretty normal to eat sitting on the ground), so instead of putting on the long legs that make this chair a highchair, we put on the short legs instead, and it works perfectly for our set up. Our son is basically at the same level as us and I'm not as nervous and worried that he will fall off the chair from great heights. Of course, if we decide to use our dining table, we have the longer legs to use too. I love that this chair can be adapted, and used for a long time. I didn't find that the plastic was cheap looking (like other reviews have mentioned) but indeed it was pretty sturdy.My only complaint is that the table portion is very small compared to some other high chairs. I can see a lot of things dropping from there eventually.... also, I can already see that some of the suction on, fall proof plates will not fit on the table... I wish the table was a bit larger, and it went around the side of the chair. Overall, great design and highly recommended.
