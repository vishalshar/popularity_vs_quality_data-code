We bought this for our first child to use when our second child needs our convertible car seat.  The older one is 19 months old and about 35 inches tall.  He already needs the harness straps to be in the highest position available.  For this reason, I'm a little concerned that he'll have to go to the belt-positioning mode before we're really ready to have him out of the five-point harness.  (Straps are to be at or above child's shoulders.)This is what the instruction manual says:5-point harness:  22-40 lbs, 34-43 in, and over 1 year oldBelt-positioning booster:  40-80 lbs, 43-52 in, and over 1 year oldRegarding installation:  the other two car seats I have are a BabyTrend FlexLoc infant carrier and a Britax Boulevard convertible car seat.  Once we figured out how to put the harness straps through the correct slot (has to be done through the back), this seat installed as easily as either of the other two.  The model we got has a buckle for adjusting the anchor tether, and does not appear to have the "threading" problem mentioned by previous reviewers.  My child was comfortable and didn't seem to mind being in a different seat.
