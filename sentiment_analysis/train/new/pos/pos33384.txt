My 5 month old daughter LOVES her Sophie the Giraffe toy! This toy is absolutely wonderful in every way. Sophie is made of soft rubber and makes a pleasant-sounding squeak whenever any part of her body is squeezed, so even a young baby can elicit a reaction from the toy with minimal effort.I don't know what it is about Sophie, but whenever my daughter plays with her, she gets very vocal and talkative.I saw another review which referred to this toy as "a glorified dog toy". That reviewer is mistaken, and simply doesn't realize the value of this toy.- Sophie's body, while soft, has several areas of thicker rubber (the nubs on her head, her ears, and her feet) which are perfect for teething babies to gnaw on for relief.- Sophie's contrasting colors (spots) are visually stimulating to a baby.- She is easy to grip given her long, thin neck.- This toy is made of 100% natural rubber and uses food-grade paint (SAFE!).- This is a quality baby toy which will last for many years.
