I really like these bags so far. They are easy to fill, the measurement marks are accurate, and I really like that they are individually sealed. Also, the bags are very sturdy, thick plastic, while also being BPA-free, which is great.I know other reviewers have said that they didn't like how bulky the bags can be when standing in the freezer, but I actually don't mind that. Then again, I don't use these bags that often, so we don't have as many in the freezer at one time.I will agree, however, that these bags are pricey compared to other options--and, while I like these Avent bags, I think you can find something that works about the same for a better price. (I like Lansinoh Breastmilk Storage Bags, 100 Count.) I really think this is one of those products (like so many other baby products) that comes down to personal preference. There are so many reasonably-priced bag options out there that it can be worth it to look around a bit before settling. Overall, though, you certainly won't be disappointed with this bag.
