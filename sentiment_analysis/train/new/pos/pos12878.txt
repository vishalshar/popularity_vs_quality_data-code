I did a lot of research trying to find the perfect mattress for our son & finally decided on this one.  I'm not sure if there is a "perfect" mattress, but this one works very well for us.  We put our son into his crib at 1 month.  At the time, we did not realize that he did not want to be cuddled or held when he slept, he just wanted to be left alone.  Once we figured that out, he would be out like a light & up once or twice a night.  By the time he was 4 months old he started sleeping through the night on a fairly regular basis.  The mattress does have indentations from him laying on it, but it does not seem to affect his sleep.  I'm not sure if this is just how mattresses are since my own mattress has the same problem, but regardless, we have been very happy with it.
