Sure, it's a little gross but the relief it offers our daughter when she's sick is so worth it. As any parent knows, when your kid is sick, you would do anything to give them relief. And that includes sucking their boogers out of their nose.Our daughter HATES it. In fact, my wife and I have to tag team to use it effectively. One of us has to hold her head while the other uses the Nosefrida. Our daughter goes from being unable to breathe through her nose while drinking from a Camelbak water bottle to breathing furiously through her nose.It's a love hate relationship, but buy it. You'll love to hate using it on your child! And your child will love the results but hate the process too! It's truly a win-win for everyone!
