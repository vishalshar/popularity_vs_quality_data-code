We call this sweet huggable soft toy Blue Bunny.  He was given to my grandson at birth and he is almost 9 and he is on his sixth Blue Bunny.  We have written a book about Blue Bunny and his travels and visits to the "doctor" to become whole again.  We have two more in stock because we were hoping there would be one left we could put in a tux for his wedding at some future date.Blue Bunny always seems to be near, under his head when he's lying down, under his chin when he's sleeping, and waits at the front door for his return from school.  There is some thing very casual and endearing about the proximity of Blue Bunny near my grand son but it's not a possessive/obsessive thing, it is just something that has always made him happy and comfortable.  Blue Bunny has seen some wear...I don't think they were ever made to endure nine years.  My daughter is an ER nurse and it is explained that she is taking Blue Bunny to the doctors.  A brand new one appears and my grand son doesn't ask any questions but goes on with his casual but loyal friendship with Blue Bunny.
