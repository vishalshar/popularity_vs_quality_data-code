There is no such thing as a leak-proof bottle design.  Use/wash/sterilize any bottle enough and chances are you can get it to leak.  That said, the Playtex Ventaire bottles don't leak very much - less than Dr. Browns and the standard  cheapie bottles.  I actually found the non-clear Ventaire bottles to leak less than the crystal clear ones - and they're cheaper.  If you're a Sam's club member you can get them in a 5-pack there for even cheaper.Re. the bottle itself: I think anti-reflux bottles are a load of crap - the bubbles from standard bottles float up and unless you let your baby suck down the foam at the end, they won't swallow air.  Conversely, if you let baby drink down every last swallow from this bottle or any other anti-reflux bottle (that doesn't have a bag inside), baby'll swallow air.  The truth is, unless your baby is really colicky, that's no big deal, just burp baby.  Also the bent neck of this bottle is useless- it doesn't make anything easier.The reason I really like these bottles is because the bottom unscrews, making washing really easy.  If you don't mind washing bottles, of you have a nice dishwasher that does a good job washing regular bottles, then stick with what works.  But I found the ease of washup to be really nice.  Plus there's only 2 more parts than a regular bottle and they're easy to wash.  Dr. Browns or any bottle that requires you to use a special brush makes a bad baby shower gift - new parents need less work, not more.
