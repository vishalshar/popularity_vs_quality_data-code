First off, let me say that I purchased the item for a dog, not a baby. My dog loves to lounge for hours in the sunshine on our back deck. However, our deck has stairs that lead down 2 flights of stairs to the other neighbors back doors and to a communal patio. So, in order to keep our little fur beast from wandering downstairs to see what everyone else is doing we bought a baby gate to bock the stairs. Originally, we purchased a wooden gate, but as you can imagine... that didn't stand up to the elements and got trashed pretty quickly. This gate is perfect. The hard plastic isn't going to warp and mold in the rain and it is so much easier to set up than the wooden version we had. It is also significantly more sturdy and stable. My 25 pound down jumped up on it with all the fury a dog has when there is a squirrel 3 feet away and the gate didn't budge.
