One of the best electronic buys I ever made. I can now view my child at home or gone anywhere I am. When I return to work I will be able to view and talk to my son with just a couple touches on my smart phone. This buy is a complete steal.The only way it could be better is if it were to better explain how to use Skype.If you need help with Skype here it is:1. You'll need to set up two different accounts, baby's (connected to your wireless baby monitor) and your own. The instructions with the monitor tells you the setup for baby's but does not explain you need two for those who aren't familiar with Skype. You will setup your account and make a video call to baby's account2. You'll need to go into both parent account and child accounts and find each other to add each other as contacts. (contacts, search directory, find Skype name, and click add).3. Understand that the USB connector must stay in a compatible computer and be connected wirelessly for the home AND Skype features to work.4. Yes yes yes, you can use any device with Skype to be able to view and talk to the baby as long as the monitor is connected to the home computer.
