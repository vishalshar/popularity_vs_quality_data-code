Based on the reviews of the top 3 Dream on Me mattresses, you would think the foam mattress is the best -- it's not! I've purchased all three mattresses. Here are my faves, in order:1) Dream On Me 3" Inner Spring Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress2) Dream On Me 3" Playard Mattress, White3) Dream On Me Foam Graco Pack and Play MattressI initially bought the foam mattress and returned it because it was loud and crunchy! Any small movement creates a lot of noise on the mattress -- not an ideal sleeping environment. We returned it and bought the inner spring mattress. It works perfectly and baby sleeps in it with no problems. We use this one at my parents' house. I thought I shipped the same one to my in-laws who are out of state, but I accidentally sent them the Playard mattress. We used it while visiting for one week and my LO had no issues sleeping on that mattress. If you're in the market to buy one and have a few extra bucks, buy the Inner Spring mattress. Otherwise, purchase the Playard mattress. But whatever you do, stay away from the Foam mattress!
