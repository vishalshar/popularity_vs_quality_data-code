So, the real issue with all of the "no spill" cups seems to be leaking. Some of this in unavoidable as when cold liquids warm up they naturally expand and some will inevitably come out the top. Also, when the straw piece is full and a "no spill" cup is tipped over it will generally pour out whatever was in the straw. The Nuby cups suffer from these problems as well but when compared to the Oxo, Avent and Zoli cups they perform much better. My guess is that the larger circumference straw allows for a bit more expansion before you end up with a milk "geyser" like you see with the smaller tube models. It also seems to hold the liquid a bit better when flipped over. There is no leaking from the screw down seal like we saw in the other models and the price is reasonable.Cleaning is another issue for all of these models but the wider straw makes it easier to flush water through. The entire straw piece can be easily removed and washed well by hand without the need for a specialized cleaning device. It's easier to put back together as well...One other thing to note is that once your little one has teeth, the little tabs on the top of the Zoli straw which flex/open to let liquid out will start to go "missing". They are small so I don't think they pose a health risk but the straw replacements are not really cheap and it happened on almost all of our Zoli cups (they leak profusely after this happens).I have to say that another good option is the "Foogoo" from Thermos as it does a great job of limiting leaks (the interchangeable lids are nice too) but they are harder to clean and some models have the same smaller straw issues listed above.
