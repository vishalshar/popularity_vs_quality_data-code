Aw man, I love this pillow! I told my husband that he has officially been replaced. Then he grabbed the pillow and told me that I've been replaced.  Haha, just joking of course. This pillow is seriously comfortable though. I like how you can adjust it into different positions for different uses. I currently sleep with it under my head, pregnant belly, and in between the knees. I like the nice design and the fact that the cover is zipper-removable so you can wash it. I haven't done so yet, so we'll see how easy it is to get off and back on. I plan on using it as a nursing pillow after I have my baby and for just sleeping with it for as long as it will last me because it's so darn comfortable! You definitely don't need to be pregnant to enjoy this pillow.
