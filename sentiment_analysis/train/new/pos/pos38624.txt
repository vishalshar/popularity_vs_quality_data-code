we like this swing, its nothing too fancy, its not too heavy, it swings nicely,it also plays music, its nice that you can lock it and keep it from swinging, so then it can be used to have baby in and feed him in it, you can lower it to the floor so if others are in the room watching TV, you can see past it, it is not in your line of vision. Also the openess at the top makes it easy to put baby in and out of the swing. The only thing, the tray, with the way it locks in seems a little cheap, and the seat could be just a little more cushiony. The baby just Loves the disney characters that hang over. He seems very comfortable sitting in this swing, no complaints. I would buy it again.
