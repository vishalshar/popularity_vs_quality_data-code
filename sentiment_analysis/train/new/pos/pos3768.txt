I got this bassinet and loved it. I felt like it was a little larger than most other bassinets so we used it for a longer period of time. It also doesn't have the appearance of an 80's wedding dress, lol. If the baby stirs at night it rocks him/her back to sleep. The only downside is that it comes with only 2 sheets and you can't buy more that fit this kind of bassinet but on the rare occasion I ran out, I wrapped a receiving blanket around the mattress part and it was fine. I highly recommend it. Its so elegant and useful!
