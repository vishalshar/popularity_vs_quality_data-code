I like this product. It cuts my 1-year-old's sandwiches into nice, small, bite-sized pieces. My only complaint is the curve of the bottom of the tool. You have to teeter-totter the tool side to side to make sure everything is cut. Even then, I still have to push it through the sandwiches a bit more. But I'm glad the tool isn't too sharp. It looks like a fun toy, so I wouldn't want my baby to get a hold of it and cut herself.
