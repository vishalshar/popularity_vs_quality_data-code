So I never write reviews but feel I must on this product.  My husband and I have purchase MANY products trying to capture our infants hand and foot prints including lots of different ink products on the market and other impression material.  This stuff is AWESOME!Some pointers I recommend: You MUST knead the material for 2-3 minutes as directed.  I used books on either end when rolling it out to make it perfectly even and a marble rolling pin (don't even bother with the one in the kit).  When you roll it out roll only in one direction to help keep it from sticking to the rolling pin. When you make the impression I put Johnson and Johnson baby lotion on the hand and foot first to keep it from sticking to the material (make sure you apply enough)!  The best part is even if you mess up you can re-roll the material as many times as you need (we did about 6-7x for the hand print!)  About 12 hours into the drying process peel it off the tin foil and flip it over for the other 12 hours to dry (and keep it from curving in).  If you use your material wisely you actually have enough to make a hand and foot print from the package.  I also managed to turn the frame right side up and put both the hand and foot print in the designated spot along with our infants picture.  It looks AMAZING and Pearhead is wonderful to work with!!If the product does not come out of the package difficultly (sticking to the sides) then it's probably no good.  (I bought 6 ornament impression kits as well and they were drier and made awful prints.  I called the company and they sent me out 6 replacements for FREE)!  They also did that for the ink kit we bought that didn't work out as well.  This company is awesome..can't rave about them enough!
