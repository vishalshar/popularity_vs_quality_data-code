The  Yookidoo is great bath time fun - better yet, kids of all ages will love it (well up to a point). The concept of the Yookidoo fountain is pretty basic it has an opening at the bottom with a small pump. The pump circulates the water to the top and fountain is put into motion (it will make more sense once you see the video). Our daughter loves playing with her Yookidoo even if it is mainly to try to find ways to drink the water!Things we like -- It is very quiet - if it wasn't for the falling water you wouldn't even know it was on- A variety of cups to catch the water (see the video)- Suction cups work great for attaching to the bath tub.- Seems to be high quality (so far) we have used it daily for about 1 month.Areas for improvement- It is a minor complaint, but it might be nice if it was a little biggerFinal Verdict- I can't imagine any child that wouldn't enjoy the Yookidoo fountain. You can buy this with confidence.5 Stars
