Bought this a few weeks ago and we have been mainly happy with it. The instructions that come in the box are a waste of paper, but we just looked at it and figured it out.The bars that connect the panels are spring loaded. Just pull down on them to release (once they are unscrewed).It's heavy. Heavier than expected and I'm fairly strong. Keep that in mind if you're planning on hauling it around (not our intended use so nor a big deal, but dragging it into the house took me by surprise).Some of the 'joints' between the sections do not lock as firmly as I would like, however these are areas where the yard extends in a straight line for more than one panel. I think some of the stability from the unit actually comes from the 'octagonal' shape, and the straight-a-ways seems to be less solid.We bought the main yard plus two extenders. This gives us about 27 sq ft. Pictures below show the yard in comparison to a playpen.The bars are very close together - our cat cannot fit through them. If you have cata that may need to pass thru the yard/gate to get to the litter box etc, you may need to rethink that.
