This toy has been a favorite of all 3 of my kids, so when we lost our first one, I had to replace it straight-away.  The design is the same as the first one, but the colors are 'cloudier', a result, I'm guessing, of no BPA in the make-up.  We have always pulled the suction bit off and all the kids have been happy to spin the fish around while alternately chewing on the blue and white handle.  I've given this toy as a gift to several people, and couldn't be happier with it.
