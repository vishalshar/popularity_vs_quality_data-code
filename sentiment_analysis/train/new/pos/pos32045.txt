These pacifiers are the best of the best in my opinion. My son was born premature and in the NICU they used these (they have a preemie size). Once he came home, they were the only pacifiers he would take so I ordered him more from their website. I love how light weight they are and I love how they have this "grip" on the baby's face/mouth area so they don't fall out as easily, especially when the baby is dozing off into sleep and they're still sucking periodically. Another added benefit is that they're made in the USA so you don't have to worry about toxic chemicals from China possibly poisoning our children. I'm having my second child any day now and I already bought her her own Gumdrops! Best pacifiers ever!***There are other brands who make a pacifier named "Gumdrop" as well. Don't know how they get away with it but unless it states it's the Gumdrop made from "Hawaii Medical" they're not as good and they're all made in China. I think the fake ones are called "The First Years Gumdrop" and you can find them in any retail/baby store. The legit ones, are online order only from the manufacturer "Hawaii Medical."
