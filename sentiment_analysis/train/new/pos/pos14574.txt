i bought this walker for my daughter after she wore out her first one. i thought it looked cute and i loved the idea of stationary toys and the opening trays.the walker was easy to assemble, did it myself, but i was disappointed to find that although the box advertises it is for four months and up - it clearly is not.my daughter is going on eight months and cannot reach the floor in this walker. i am not sure if perhaps ours just has a defect and is supposed to go lower, but it seems to click into the lowest setting just fine - it looks to be correct. but that's a four month difference and had i known that i would not have purchased it.also, it's not the best walker in terms of your child getting around. the one i had before this had eight wheels and she could run all over and turn easily. this is one of the walkers where they can't really back up and/or turn easily which may be a bonus for some parents, but i found it to be annoying and my daughter gets frustrated in it after having one previously that could go anywhere.OVERALL: it's very cute and in general it is well made. i just want to point out some of the flaws so you don't waste your money if your child is only four or five months old and you find they're stuck in the air because they can't reach!4 out of 5 stars.hope this helped!
