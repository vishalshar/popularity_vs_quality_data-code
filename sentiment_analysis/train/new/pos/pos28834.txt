Our family is traveling internationally and we're not going to bring along a monstrous Pack 'n Play so we started looking around for travel cribs. There are a number of options (some cool ones sold only outside of the US available online but we chose to find one domestically).After doing research and looking around at the options, we thought the Peapod was a great design but the recalled design was obviously a dealbreaker so we looked elsewhere. We ended up buying a Phil&Teds traveller which on paper was great. Very light. Very portable. Very sturdy. We got one and found it to be bulkier than anticipated and much tougher to setup and tear down than we hoped.Then we heard that the redesigned Peapod just became available and for half the price opted for the Peapod Plus (our little guy is growing fast so the bigger size seemed to be a no brainer). We just got it and have used it several times.Pros:(1) Super light. It's a few pounds lighter than the Phil&Teds Traveller (weighs about 5 pounds) which is great for long travel as well as trips to the beach.(2) Super compact. It folds up really small and flat, which makes it easy to put in the bottom of a suitcase or in the bottom of a big pile in the car. It probably folds into a circle with a diameter of one foot.(3) Super easy to setup/collapse. This was the dealbreaker on the Traveller but the Peapod pops up quickly with no setup required and folds down really easily (it can be tough to find the right shape you need, but try a few times and you'll get it pretty quickly).(4) Good design. The soft "sleeping bag" snaps to the outside so you could remove it if needed to wash or clean or if you want to go without it but it provides a decent amount of cushion without having to blow up a mattress or carry anything too bulk. The mesh sides are great and breathable and our little guy likes to look out the windows and laugh.(5) Cool profile. We like to camp and the Peapod looks really great - like a miniature tent ready to go. We anticipate this being a fun thing as the little guy gets older.Cons:(1) Because the Peapod doesn't have a sturdy frame (like the Traveller or a Pack 'n Play) it's possible that with the right movement and momentum, a toddler could "hamster ball" the Peapod. Assuming you didn't put anything heavy or dangerous inside the Peapod, I DON'T think this would cause any harm but could illicit some cries or screams. We haven't used this overnight yet (just for naps and at the beach) and this has *not* happened yet, but it's something that seems like a possibility.(2) ... no other cons yet. More use will tell, but so far the redesign looks like a great choice for a travel crib.**UPDATE: August 2013**We just returned from a two week international trip where our boy slept exclusively in the Peapod. We are SO glad we had it with us as it worked REALLY well for a travel crib.A few things to note:(1) Airflow through the Peapod Plus is okay but not great. It gets warm in there pretty fast! We were very glad we chose the Peapod Plus (versus the smaller Peapod) since there is more airflow in the larger Peapod Plus.(2) Due to our destination, we would have needed a mosquito net for an open crib - we were glad to have a fully enclosed place for our boy to sleep on this trip without worrying about netting or covering.(3) Our boy did manage to tip the side of the Peapod one morning when he was playing in it after waking up. **Make sure you only use this product on the floor.****Second Update - August 2013**When I took the Peapod out to clean it, I removed the "sleeping bag" pad that snaps in underneath to clean it and one of the snaps tore right off of the pad. So now I have a loose pad which doesn't snap anymore. I will contact Kidco and hope customer service can resolve the issue quickly. For the time being, I downgraded the Peapod to 3 stars since it seems the pad snaps may be subpar. Will update if I hear from Kidco.**Third Update - September 2013**I added back a star because Kidco's customer service was excellent. It was easy to get on the phone and explain the problem. After snapping a picture with my phone and emailing it directly to the customer service rep I spoke with on the phone, I was called back in short order and told that a replacement would be in the mail early the next week. Within 7 days, we had a replacement in 100% working condition. Very happy with the service and support of this product.
