I bought a silver one and got alot of compliments from people.  However, some of the cons were:  the handles got dirty already and i cant wash them or clean so something to think about when buying a silver color.  The straps were hard to adjust, i guess it is for the safety reasons.  But you only need to adjust them one time so its not a big deal.  I wish ifthe company makes trays or a handle barwhere babies can hold on to.  Buckle is cutewith bmw logo.  Both straps suppose to popout at the same time when you press the logoto unbuckle.  Mine didnt so i had to return itand got a new one.  I cant say much about the footrest because my baby cant reach it yet butit looked cheap being just a thin rubber strapacross the stroller.  I guess it needed to be thisway so that the stroller can be folded.My baby seems comfortable in it.  It is easy to manuver.  Overall I would recommand itbecause it is BMW stroller and unique.
