This is a must for every parent. I took off one star because the letters were falling while trying to write on it. It is hard to do, but I believe a handy person will manage. A little tip, don't pres too hard on the canvas. And after you wipe off something, let it dry before you try again. Good luck...;). Oh and also, do it while the baby sleeps...a must.
