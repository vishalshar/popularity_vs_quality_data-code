Colorful,high quality. Sheet set launders well and gets softer each time. Wash in the coldest water acceptable to keep it color fast. The comforter is reasonably warm but requires other thicker blankets in winter/fall months. If your daughter loved Disney Princess this comforter will become her favorite carry around blanket. Comforter is reversible and pretty on both sides. The opposite side not shown features castles and crowns. Stunning with the matching canopy toddler bed.
