Works perfectly with my gate (Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Safety Gate), but I really feel that one of these should be included with the gate.  Not too many places you can use a gate that small without needing an extension.  We have a fairly standard size staircase which wound up requiring the extension.  The extension actually almost made the gate too large to fit in our space so be very careful with your measurements.This extension was very easy to install and had no complications.  On the full size gate there are some plastic end pieces that slide in to one end of the gate.  All I had to do was remove those plastic pieces and push this extension piece into the two ends of the gate.  Very simple.  I gave it a few taps with a rubber mallet just to ensure it pushed in fully.The full munchkin gate has knobs at each end that are adjustable. This allowed for a few adjustments after installation to ensure I still had a tight fit.Even with the extension added the full gate is very secure.  I was concerned adding an extension might make the gate easier for a little one to push or pull.  With the knobs of the gate tightened my little one has grabbed, pulled, and hung on to this gate without budging it in the slightest.Again I'll admit that this extension is perfect for lengthening the munchkin gate.  However I do feel that when you add it onto the price of a full gate it becomes more than I really wanted to spend.
