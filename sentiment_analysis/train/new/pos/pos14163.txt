My sister-in-law bought me the common head positioners that fit inside the baby seats. (Usually a medium sized dark blue one with a smaller white one that fits inside of it) I appreciated her gift and while they kept his head from rocking back and forth while in his carrier, they did nothing to keep his head from throwing forward onto his chest. That was very disconcerting to me. The way his little head is cradled inside the noggin nest it keeps his head from throwing forward. The fact that it prevents the flat spot is just icing on the cake. I've also noticed much less crying since we purchased it, so I think it's safe to assume he's more comfortable. I only wish that it came in various colors. I don't care much for the denim blue. But, it is definitely worth having.
