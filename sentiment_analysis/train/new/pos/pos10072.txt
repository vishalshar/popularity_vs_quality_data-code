I ordered this bottle for my baby after using a few different other types. I felt that my baby was having trouble latching on when switching between the breast and bottle. I had to bottle feed and supplement with formula after a breast surgery to open and drain a large breast abscess when my son was just 5 weeks old. I was unable to feed him on the infected side but was still able to breast feed on the right side so it was important to me that he not get nipple confusion. This bottle was great at getting him back on track to latching on correctly because of the large base at the bottom of the nipple. It is a lot firmer then other bottles that I used, so it mimicked the breast better and the nipple is more the shape of a real nipple then the others. Being firmer didn't allow for the kibble to collapse. Others that I tried were the Tommy Tippy, Born Free and Playtex Nurser. The only down side was that I felt it wasn't slow flow enough and since I was feeding him formula he drank it too fast and would get tummy aches. The Playtex Nurser was better as far as slow flow. But if your looking for a bottle to help with nipple confusion this is a great choice.
