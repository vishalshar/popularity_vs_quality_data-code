Owl has been my son's favorite toy since the moment they first met - my son was 13 months old and toddled up and gave him a big hug and they have been inseparable since.  In the early days my son was still learning to walk and used Owl as a portable crash pad.  Now it has been almost 2 years and Owl has tolerated pretty much constant abuse and held up extremely well.  We love that Owl is machine washable, and handles both machine washing and drying excellently and looks like-new afterwards.My son loves this toy so much that he decided almost a year ago to forgo his toddler pillow and sleep on top of Owl instead.  Really, who needs a pillow anyway when you can sleep on your best friend?  We fluff up Owl every morning after the inevitable nighttime squashing and he is good to go for another day of active play.  Thank you Lambs and Ivy for such a wonderful (and also super cute) addition to our lives!
