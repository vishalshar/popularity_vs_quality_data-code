We bought this chair 15 months ago, & we AND our granddaughter are STILL thrilled with it!  We have loaned it to Maddie's parents to take along for a week at the beach, or whatever, because it is more compact & easier to handle during travel than a standard booster chair, & have taken it to local restaurants when the five of us wanted to have dinner out.  It is sturdy, very easy to clean, & while Maddie's entertainment values have changed over the intervening months, she still likes having the play bar on the tray if she's waiting for a snack or meal.  This chair will work well for us for several more years (until Maddie is big enough to sit up to the table in a grown-up chair), & has proved to be EXCELLENT value for money.  This is a real winner -- & when we're finished with it we can proudly donate it to a local charity boutique for resale in their children's shop.
