We ended up buying more of these after buying this one because it ended up being so convenient! I use the Medela breastmilk storage set when I pump, and this nipple fits right onto all of the bottles included in the set, so feedings are simple for us! We just screw this on to one of our full bottles, warm, and serve! I love it! No more transferring our milk to a different bottle, its much much easier!
