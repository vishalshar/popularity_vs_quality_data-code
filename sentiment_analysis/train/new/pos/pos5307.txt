I needed something I could throw on quickly when my baby was fussy or for quick trips to the store.  This accomplishes that.  I also have a maya wrap and infantino mei tai and love them both but I wanted something that didn't require long ties.  This ring sling is easy to use and comfortable.  There are several holds you can use, all of which my little one loves.  The DVD that is included was very informative while being short and to the point.  The fabric is thick while also being light.  I love the color.  I was hesitant because of the padding on the shoulder but it makes it more comfortable (I also tried a friend's without the padding) and it actually spreads the fabric across your back more easily.  It's also easy to breastfeed in compared to my other carriers.  I highly recommend this product!
