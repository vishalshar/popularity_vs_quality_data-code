I need to emphasize that you need to have a belly before you think about buying a pillow because you will better understand the difficulty of your sleeping habits. If you were a tosser/turner and then you develope a belly and found you were comfortable on one side of your body, you won't know until that baby starts jutting out. With that said, you need to figure out what kind of sleeper you are to properly find a sleep-aid pillow. If you still toss and turn, you need a lightweight body pillow (using a number of small pillows won't be any good for you because you will have to keep re-adjusting them and you need to stay as asleep as possible to maintain good sleep). If you stay in one position, does your back hurt? Do you sleep with your legs straight or curved?This body pillow is for those of you who don't want to spend the whole night in one position (it is easy to throw on the other side and turn over on top of because it is lightweight) with your legs curved. If you like to sleep with your legs out straight, you will need another small pillow at the bottom. I would say my only complaint is that the section for your head is too full, but I fixed this by undoing some stitching and removing a bunch of fluff and now its pretty much perfect. It's very plush and soft, so don't worry about the pillow being too stiff (unless that is what you are looking for). I've had a hard time sleeping with it during the summer time because my left arm is underneath the pillow and gets a little hot--but I'm sure that's a goofy problem and doesn't hurt my rating of the pillow.If you are one of those people who can spend a night not moving at all, but sleeping in one position, I would strongly recommend getting a number of small pillows. While this one is very comfortable, you have to sleep somewhat curled up, and if you need to stretch its a little difficult.
