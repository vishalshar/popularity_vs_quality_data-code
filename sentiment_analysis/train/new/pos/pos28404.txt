After 3 weeks of having my new infant only sleeping if she was on me, I called the hospital for advice. They suggested getting the Happiest Baby on the Planet video and figure out how to swaddle effectively.  Turns out that my Houdini Baby, who I thought didn't like being swaddled, really needed be swaddled...mommy just didn't do it right.  Bottom line...the standard receiving blankets sold in the baby stores do not work.  You need this large 42" x42" blanket to make it work.  With a little practice and patience with her floundering arms....I got it going.  She slept sound in her own crib finally because of this blanket.  It saved my life.  I have 3 that I rotate. And now will give it as a standard baby shower gift.  What I now know...with "back to sleep" the baby will startle awake because they don't have anything holding their arms down.  Swaddle is more than a comfortable reminder of the womb. It's a necessity.  Thank you Swaddle Designs for making a product that actually works on active babies.
