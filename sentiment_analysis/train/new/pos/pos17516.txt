Nice looking table.  Seems sufficiently sturdy.  Easy to assemble.  One person can do it but two would be preferable.  The only issue I have is that when we shopped for a changing table at various baby stores we did not like how we could see the screw heads on the side of the table(s).  My wife found this table and when I looked at the picture on Amazon I saw no screw holes.  If fact, there are six holes on each side of the table where you can clearly see the screw heads used to hold the table together.  I was surprised the manufacturer did not include stained rounded dowel plugs to insert into the holes to cover the screw heads.  I've attached pictures that show how the table is pictured on Amazon and how it actually looks when put together.  I would have given it a five except for this inattention to detail.  I understand it's a way to cut unit cost but at this price point dowel plugs should be included,
