This play gym is pretty cute and easy to put together, except that I hate having to find a screwdriver to change the batteries.  My 6 week old was mesmerized for over 30 minutes the first time we laid her on it.  She loved the mirror and just enjoys starting at the brightly colored animals at this point.  I also love the flexibility of all the toys. They can easily be removed an attached to carseats, strollers, swings, etc.
