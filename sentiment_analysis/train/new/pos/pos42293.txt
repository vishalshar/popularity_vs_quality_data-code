These came quickly and were much easier ordering from Amazon than calling every Buy Buy Baby to find who had the extensions.The only issue I have, is with the product design overall not against these extensions. Once you have added the 2 extensions, the walls of the Play yard get much more flimsy, and my 8 1/2 month old likes to lean on them for support, as he is starting to stand. He has fallen a few times and hit his face on the plastic because he lost his balance since the wall was flimsy. Hoping North States comes up with something to make the walls a little more firm.
