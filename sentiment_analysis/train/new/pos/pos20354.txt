Bought this for my little grandson, 5 months old. He loves Elmo so got this for him hoping he would be able to use it and like it. Got lucky and got the blue and yellow one as didn't know that there was any other colour. The handles on this cup are different than most and so much easier for him to hold. He loves this cup and gladly drinks water from it. It is his favourite.
