I've been using these bottles for 5 months now and I love them. First I'll lay out my wash routine and then the likes and dislikes.I soak the separate pieces in hot soapy water after use until I'm ready to wash them (I do not remove the 'bulb' end from the straw when washing so that I don't lose it). I wash using a silicone brush and nylon scrubber to avoid excessive scratching. I then sterilize them in microwave using a steam sterilizer. Alternatively I put all pieces in a dishwasher basket and place them in dishwasher with the rest of our dishes. I then dry all parts on a rack and never used them when wet (I've heard this can cause straws to fall off when using bottle).I've only used them with breast milk so I can't speak for formula use.Likes:Never had leakage. EVER!Straw has never fallen off.No nipple collapse.Baby does not swallow extra gas (I only burp him once during an 8oz feeding, then he sleeps for 10 hours at night).No clogged vents.Baby has not had nipple confusion (we started using the bottle when he was 3 weeks old)Dislikes:Numbers on bottles are starting to rub off but the lines are still intact.One more thing: Don't buy 5oz bottles (comes with stage 1 nipple). My son started drinking more than 5oz at 3 months. Just buy the 8oz (comes with stage 2 nipple) and save yourself the money. You can buy stage 1 nipples separately for use when baby is a newborn.
