Please disregard all the "too difficult to remove" negative reviews for this product... Originally I was disappointed at how difficult these seem to be to remove from the wall once snapped into place.  Something happened today with my child, who is fortunately still with us, which has compelled me to write this review.I'll make a long story short because I'm still quite shaken, but the ones you simply press into the wall with no locking mechanism are complete garbage, any child with a fingernail (most children) can defeat them.  The fact that these actually LOCK into the plug is a FEATURE, and after today, I don't care how long it takes me to fiddle with this device to remove it from the outlet, I am using them exclusively.Pro Tip: press the left side in (towards the right), it appears the right side does nothing, but none the less, squeezing both sides accomplishes the same thing (pressing the left side towards the right).  Once this is done, internally, the detent/"lock" on the top is unlocked and can be pressed down.  Once you press the top "lock" down you don't have to continue squeezing the sides.  While continuing to hold the top "lock" down, use your free hand/fingernails to remove the plug from the wall, similar to the non locking ones...(when I say fingerprint multiple times in the video, I mean fingernail)
