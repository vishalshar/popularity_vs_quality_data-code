I like these burp cloths, but they are a little different than my other aiden and anais ones.  the other ones i have have a waffle texture to the linen and these are smooth.  i find that they don't soak up the spit up as well.  i still like them more than any other burp cloth i have. and my baby spits up a lot!!!!!  i have become a burp cloth expert.  =(
