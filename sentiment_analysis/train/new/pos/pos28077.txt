I've owned this pump for two years. I'm a large breasted nurser (32J) and tried all kinds of pumps before landing on this one. Double electric pumps don't work for me because I need both hands to pump one breast (one to hold pump, the other to hold breast). This little pump has been GOLD in my life. It's never lost suction and I absolutely love that I can set the suction mode manually so it perfectly adjusts to what my body needs for let down and extended pumping. It also has a wall adaptar and a battery pack so you can pump at home or on the go! I also love that there's no tubing system which makes clean up a breeze! It's compact, easy to clean, and oh so effective!It's also well made and has lasted through two of my children. If anything ever happens to it I will purchase another one. Worth every penny!
