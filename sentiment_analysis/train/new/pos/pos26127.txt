Don't waste your time with flat plastic.  The curves help little ones get a good grip and make it to their mouth.  I use the sporks for cereal because they are deep and milk drips into the bowl rather than all over the tray.  They love to eat their cereal like big kids.  Id like to be able to buy more sporks.  Teethers love to chew on the handle of these nobby handles  which was wonderful until they got teeth and could actually rip the coating off.  Make sure you are watching.  Still I ordered a bunch.  Dishwasher safe and the kids get good use out of them.
