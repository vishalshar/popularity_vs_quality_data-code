Love this hamper for my daughter's shabby chic nursery! It looks fantastic with all the different pink and aquas and different patterns! Very sturdy and I know we will be able to fit a lot of clothes in there when the time comes. This is the perfect size to also transition to her big girl room in a few years too!
