As a mom I've started to collect animated movies for my growing family.I purchased two of the WubbaNub Infant Pacifier Penguin - Limited Edition and paired each with the film:Happy Feet (Full Screen Edition). It was so cute I ended up keeping one set. My then 8 and 1/2 month old started bouncing to the beats in the movie, while sucking on the penguin pacifier. It was a video moment. These two items make a great gift.The reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because the white fabric discolors easily.
