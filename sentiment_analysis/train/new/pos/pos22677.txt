I've seen just the plain "Princess on Board" signs before, and that is what I got on here looking for.  When I saw this personalized one, I just had to have it!  It is very cute and most definitely worth the money.  The only reason I couldn't give a full 5 stars is because the sign is very flimsy.  I'm worried that when front windows down (and this is in back window) that it will flap and get tore up.  I JUST got this in the mail and opened it.. the clear film on the back is already peeling on 1/4 of it.  Other than that I do love the product!
