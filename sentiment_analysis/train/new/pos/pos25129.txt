This is a really great chair for what it is. I'm tempted to give it 5 stars, but my biggest frustration is that the fabric doesn't come off to wash in the machine, etc. It just needs to be wiped down and after some meals I really do wish I could wash the whole thing.That said, this is the second one of these chairs I've bought. We received one as a gift and I love how it folds and is so small when not in use. It is worth it to deal with the minor irritation of not being able to clean it as easily as I would like.I bought this print because it was the only one available at the time that wasn't super girly as I preferred a more gender neutral option, and I was happy to discover that it's much cuter in person and I really like the dots.
