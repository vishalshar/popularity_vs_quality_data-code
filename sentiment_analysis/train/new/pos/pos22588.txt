Before my son was born, I decided to do his nursery in an ocean theme. This kit was very easy to use and looks quite beautiful. The decals are quite large. We have them only on two walls and I think they look best that way- sort of like a mural. If you were doing a whole room you would need to spread them out quite a bit.We have received several compliments on the way his room looks.Update- My son is closer to 2 years old now and a few of the stickers peel up a little. We do live in a very humid southern Illinois area. It's no big deal to go back along and smooth them back down and we haven't had a single one fall off the wall yet, just throwing this on here for anyone wondering how long they'll last.
