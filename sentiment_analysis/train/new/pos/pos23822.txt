I was referred to this product when my 1 year olds OT recommended it.  He has Down Syndrome and I was looking for a way to ween him from nursing.  I was warned against using typical sippie cups as not to promote tongue protrusion.  This has been awesome for him to learn from.  You can squeeze it slightly to get the liquid up to his mouth and the straw insert keeps the liquid from going back down the straw.  It took him 1 time to get it and 3 times to work in like a pro.  I was VERY HAPPY with this kit.  It worked much better than the other training straw cups on the market.
