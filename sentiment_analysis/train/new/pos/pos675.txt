Love these!  Completely worth the price.  Buy four, and you won't need any other bibs...ever.  A few for home, one for the diaper bag.  Mostly just rinse off and hang over the sink faucet after use...dries quickly.  I wash them in the washing machine occasionally (or after a spaghetti meal), but mostly just rinse and hang to dry.  Lightweight nylon manages to keep everything off...kiddos both loved or didn't mind the thin fabric, never tried to pull off.  The catchall pocket is wonderful too...catches stray noodles/cereal etc. This is a go-to baby shower present for new parents for me now...one of my favorite super-mommy finds.
