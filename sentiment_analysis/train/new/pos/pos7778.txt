I loved the concept of this and bought it when I was pregnant. Now that I have my baby and have been using it for 2months I can say I do like it but it's not as great as I thought. Here's why:- it covers but you will still have a bit of side breast showing no matter what. It's fine if you're okay with it but if you or your spouse are the kind that aren't then you may need a cover over this.- it doesn't fall I to place easily. You have to play around withbit to get it positioned right and covering everything. In a restaurant or when your baby is crying you will wish it was faster and easier.- at first when you go to latch the baby you need to leave the table unless you're okay with your nipple showing. It takes a few minutes to situate your baby properly so initially again you need a cover for over this cover. I usually use my babys blanket.All in all great product with a few snags. I ended up getting on of those cover ups anyway for crowded places and for initially when I need to get her latched since my husband is a little less easy going about breastfeeding in public than I am. But for in the house if you have family visiting and just need a light cover and don't care of you show some skin it is excellent.It also looks good so when you wear it it's not unattractive. I have the black and when I wear black sometimes people do even notice it.
