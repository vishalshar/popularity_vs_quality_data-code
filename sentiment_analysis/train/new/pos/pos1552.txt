My 20-month-old loves this smoothie cup!  It's the perfect shape and size for her to carry around.  I ordered these to replace the cracked straw: Pure Bubble Straw | Pack of 4 with Cleaning Brush | 23 cm (9 inch) Tall x 10 mm wide | Medical-Grade Silicone Drinking Straws | Comfortable, Safe, Easy to Clean | Perfect For Smoothies! | Seeking Health.  They can be easily cut to length and they're flexible. They also fight tighter than the original straw, so they cut down on leaks and she can't easily pull them out.
