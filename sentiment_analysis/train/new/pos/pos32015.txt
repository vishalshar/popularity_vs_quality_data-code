I am simply AMAZED by this breast pump. A friend of mine told me to purchase this a while ago and I didn't listen...now I am kicking myself. I bought this to use in lieu of my dual electric Medela pump while "on the go" (car, day trips, airplane, etc.). At first I was skeptical that it could ever be as efficient as my electric pump. I could not have been more wrong! In fact, this is SO MUCH MORE efficient than my electric pump. I can't necessarily say that I get more/increased milk production with this compared to my electric pump. The difference is in the TIME I spend pumping. With this ISIS manual pump, I can get the same amount of expressed milk in less than half the time. For example, I typically “hook” myself up to my electric pump for 20 minutes each session. With the ISIS manual pump, it took me 3 minutes on each side to express the same amount. Plus, I find this pump to be more comfortable and less "bitey" than the electric pump.An added bonus of this pump is the convenience, of course. There is no need to “hook yourself up” and you feel less like a milk machine.The only negative for me is that I have to keep stopping to change the bottles and/or dump the expressed milk into a plastic storage bag because I typically produce 6 - 8 oz. from each breast per session (I have twins) and currently only have 4 oz. bottles to fit the pump. This can be messy with this device unlike with the electric pump where I can change the bottle without having to remove the flanges from my breast. I plan to remedy this by purchasing 8 oz. Avent bottles, however.If you are looking for a convenient alternative to your electric pump, look no further. This is a great product.
