I have 7 kids with my first 5 grouped together closely and my last 2 only a year apart so i have used many a stroller/double stroller in my day. I LOVE this stroller! I researched for a few months to find a double stroller to fit my needs because i am very picky. This one does the job perfectly. I had a city mini double that was given to me but my 1 year old hated sitting in it. As soon as i had this put together i put him in it and he loved it. He didn't want to get out! My 2 month old likes it as well. Now i am just waiting on the matching car seat to be delivered.I read the reviews on this stroller before purchasing and there were some reviewers that had a problem with it tipping backwards with only 1 child sitting in the back. I was a little worried but decided to order to test for myself. And that's what i did...as soon as i had it together i sat my 15 pound 2 month old in the back, there is NO WAY this stroller is going to tip back with only 1 child sitting in the back. I even pushed on it etc trying to make it tip back to make sure the strolle didn't budge. I am not in the least bit worried about that happening.
