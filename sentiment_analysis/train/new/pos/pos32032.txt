Bought this for my 4 month old and she liked it right away, even though she couldn't make it bounce at that point. As the other reviewers noted, we did have to place a pillow on the bottom so her feet were touching (she's 60%-75% for height). She is now 7 months old and still needs the pillow, but has been bouncing in it just fine since she was 5-6 mo old. She loves to bounce.  It's a good amt of bouncing so she has fun, but she can't get too crazy with the stiffer springs so that I worry about her head bouncing too much. However, I have a 26 mo old that gets in the bouncer and can definitely really make it bounce! There are 2 chew, flexible toys, 1 with a bird in an egg that vibrates when you pull the string (my daughter has always loved that), and 2 toys that need 3 AAA batteries each that talk, sing & make noises (1 has a mirror). My only complaint is that nothing plays full songs, or anything like the classical music from my old Baby Einstein exersaucer. My baby does chew on the butterfly & apple & thankfully we have not had any issues with the paint coming off. Overall, we are very pleased with this bouncer and it has worked out great!
