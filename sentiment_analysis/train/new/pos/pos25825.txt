This really does have a nice sound to it...not loud or obnoxious at all.  The rubberized wheels are easy to push and pull on wood floors, carpet and rugs.  They are the same durable wheels used on the Hape Walker, which we also have.  My 11-month-old likes rolling this around in his play area, and once he is steadier on his feet I am sure he will be pushing it all around the house as well.  It makes enough of a sound to please him, but not enough to irritate me...perfect!My only (small) complaint is that the handle is not straight.  The holes drilled into the blue cylindrical linking piece on the handle are not aligned properly, so when the top part of the handle is screwed into the lower part, it tilts off to one side.  At this stage, it doesn't appear to affect the usage of the toy but I can see that it may drift to one side as my son starts walking and pushing it from behind.  Also, the glue that attached the blue cylindrical piece to the lower part of the handle failed during assembly.  Both sides of the blue piece are threaded, so reattaching was not a problem.  This toy just wasn't as "perfect" as I was expecting out of the box, especially from Hape.Overall, this lawnmower push toy is heads above the rest.  It is on the small side (check the dimensions to make sure it's what you are looking for) but it is a bright and engaging toy for my little one.*edited 11/2014 to correct typo
