This is a great quality and affordable fleece blanket that I am sure is great for a baby, but I actually use it for my dog. She likes to carry a blankey around and suckle on it before she goes to bed (yes, she is my baby). The first one lasted a year before it developed some wear and tear, then I recently bought a second one. Also makes for a good dog cape.
