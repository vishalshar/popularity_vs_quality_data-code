I've been using this sleepsack over pajamas for the winter months- it's a heavy, soft cotton fabric so keeps my daughter comfortable and warm. In the summer, I would probably use this with just a onesie because it is pretty heavy. The zipper pulls up from the bottom and then hides under a flap of fabric at the neck- I like this better than a zipper that attaches at the neck and zips down because it is much easier to find and start the zip. When your baby is fussy at the end of the day, being able to zip her into her sleepsack quickly and easily alleviates some of the bedtime struggle. The fabric washes and dries well in the machine. The design is also adorable and gender neutral. It is big at the bottom, and I anticipate that she'll be able to fit in this for a while.
