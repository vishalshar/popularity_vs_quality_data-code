I bought one organic ABC crib sheet and one non-organic ABC crib sheet.  Both have impressed me thus far.  Both fit a standard crib mattress.  The organic sheet IS softer than the regular sheet (although both are remarkably soft), and I love the feel of it.  It feels like a much more expensive sheet!  I read in the other reviews that it shrinks in the dryer, and so I have been very careful drying it - hanging it dry when possible, and drying it on the delicate cycle when not.  Thus far, I have washed it several times and it has washed well and I have not noticed any shrinking (nor have I had any trouble fitting it on the mattress).  Overall, this is my favorite sheet that I've bought for my son's crib, and I plan to buy more.ADDITIONAL INFO:  I wrote this review in June, 2009.  It is now January, 2011.  This sheet is still soft, still fits the mattress (I've been drying it on my regular settings in my dryer for the last year, at least, without any shrinkage).  All the other brands of sheets I bought no longer fit, or are no longer soft, but these have endured.  I'll be buying more of these sheets for my daughter's crib, because I am so impressed!
