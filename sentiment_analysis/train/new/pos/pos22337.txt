This is just an initial review based on first time installation.  My first child isn't due until January, but we're starting to prepare a little early so we know how everything works ahead of time.First off, I know the price won't be a consistent thing, but finding this on Amazon for $68 was fantastic.  We were going to use a Bed, Bath, and Beyond gift card and a coupon at BuyBuy Baby to get the same price, but this allowed us to save that gift card and coupon for later use.We've actually installed two of these, as we also have the Bravo stroller/Keyfit 30 car seat combo set, and both times things were super smooth, in both our 2012 Toyota Corolla and 2016 Scion iM.  It was really easy to level both bases and tension them into position.  We do plan on verifying the installations in the next few months to make absolutely sure, but at the moment they're not moving any more than they should be.
