while looking over other peoples reviews I took note of the semi-consistent issue of the baby comforter falling apart after the first wash.  So upon receiving my product(1 day after order) I checked the tag on the comforter to find that it is recommended for hand wash only and line dry.  That has seemed to fix the falling apart issue.  Am very happy with the apparent quality of the bedding set and the extremely prompt receipt of the product.  Would definetly recommend this seller and product to anyone.
