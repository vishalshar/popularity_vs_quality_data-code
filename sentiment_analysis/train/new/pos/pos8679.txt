I love it. I have been using it for several months. I use it to to hold my wet umbrella when I'm heading into the office or riding the train. I put my umbrella in this bag and throw it in my Longchamp. I wanted to (1) stop getting the Metro seat wet, (2) stop nearly forgetting my umbrella off the Metro floor, (3) stop having to carry the wet umbrella as it flicks water on my pants, (4) stop having to carry the umbrella at all, (5) stop having to use plastic bags when I go into office buildings with slippery floors, since those plastic bags will eventually end up in a landfill. These are great. When it gets really wet, I turn it inside out and throw it on the floor near my front door near my wet umbrella when I get home. It fits a longer collapsible umbrella.
