You're a new parent. You're trying to enjoy a meal with some friends in a desperate attempt to retain some factor of normalcy since your infant showed up. Everyone gets their food, and you're beginning to eat and relax when you hear the tiny  grunts and moans coming from the car-carrier perched next to you in the upside down restaurant high chair.You know those precious little baby vocalizations are a warning signaling impending reactor core meltdown. You have 22 seconds before every person in the restaurant initiates their own signals disapproving of your parental skill.Quickly, and with precision the pacifier must be located and applied directly to the infant's siren. You have 16 seconds. You relax slightly as you notice the Wubbanub plush toy on top of the blanket that securely wraps the tiny destroyer of decibel meters. Thanks to the extra size and weight of the permanently attached plush toy, it hasn't gotten buried beneath the sleeping baby. It hasn't gotten kicked to the floor. And it is not entombed in the darkest inaccessible regions of the cavernous diaper bag--from which there is no return.Instead It's accessible and ready to deploy in the service of humanity. Thanks to the genius design, the baby can hold the plush toy with pacifier securely in place until the citizens are out of harms way.  And you can eat your meal with both hands.
