I hate when negative reviewers tell you to "Believe all the other negative reviews...this item is crap."  But what, you shouldn't believe any of the positive ones?  Well here is a positive one.  Yes, a couple of the suction cups were a little deformed and didn't stick so well at first...but they regained their shape, and now every single suction cup sticks.  The item worked as advertised for me and my tub...and our little boy loves it.
