We recently made a trip to Disney and used this item extensively to protect our stroller from theft.  The Buggyguard is a good investment if you have a pricey stroller and frequently go places where you have to leave your stroller unattended.  Or in our case, I feel like it was worth it for the one time trip to Disney to protect our $600 stroller investment.  Although not publicized, Disney does experience a fair number of stroller theft incidents.It terms of use, it is very simple to operate.  It is not much larger than one of those bigger smartphones.  You can Velcro strap the unit to the leg of your stroller.  Then it is as simple as putting in your lock combo, pulling out the wire, running it through the wheel and around the frame then back into the unit.  Spin the lock combo and you are good to go.  Now, somebody could just decide to carry the entire stroller away but odds are they will bypass your stroller and go for an easier target.  It might look a little suspicious if they are carrying a stroller around like a baby.  I must have locked and unlocked this unit 100 times while at Disney with no problems.  After doing it a few times I could lock or unlock the unit in probably 15 seconds.Overall, I highly recommend the buggyguard.  It's easy to use, good quality, and an inexpensive way to protect what can be a big investment.
