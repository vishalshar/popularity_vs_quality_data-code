I once thought that all bottle brushes were the same, but not since using the Dr. Brown Bottle brush.  I have been using the Dr. Brown Bottles and just naturally picked up the brush to go along with it.  I like the holder, great idea. Gives it a place to air dry and it doesn't get in the way, you can suction it right to the sink.  This bottle brush does get all bent out of shape like some brushes do. It also has nice spongy material for cleaning the bottle.  Some brush manufacturers us stiff sponge material that doesn't have any give so it deteriorates quickly and doesn't clean as well.  The handle end of the brush can be used to clean the bottle nipples...genius idea!  for the price these are great brushes.  On Amazon you can also buy these brushes in multi-packs thereby saving even more money.  I recently grabbed a name brand brush at the store because my Dr. Brown brush needed replaced and the cost of them was more expensive at the store than on Amazon.  BIG MISTAKE...even tho the name brand item had a holder, that was the only thing it had going for it.  The brush quickly bent out of shape and the sponge part was stiff and difficult to cram into the bottle and it didn't conform to the inside of the bottle to clean the interior.  As soon as my Dr. Brown bottle brush arrived 2 days later, into the garbage with the name brand brush. My only complaint with the brushes is that buying them on Amazon the girl colors are more expensive.  If you want to buy blue, no problem but for a girl, the pink or purple are nice but more expensive
