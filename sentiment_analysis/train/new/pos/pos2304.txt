High quality material, construction, and printing (and the kid looked great in it).  Besides the quality, I liked it because the number one on the front not only represented his first birthday, but also the position he holds in my friend's family hierarchy (his parents told me so).  It was a well received gift, purchased at a reasonable price (with Prime, two-day free shipping).
