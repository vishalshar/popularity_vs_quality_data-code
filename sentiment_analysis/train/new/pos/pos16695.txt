I love mam pacifiers became my son loves them more than any other pacifier. And I love glow in the dark pacifiers for night time. My only complaint is that I ordered this particular set of pacifiers for the colors and designs. I didn't get the ones pictured.I got the blue "boy" ones. Which is fine, just know you might not get the ones shown. The description should tell you the designs and colors vary from what is pictured.**update** it looks like they do now say "colors vary" but you should know the ones I got are also sold by amazon under a separate listing for about $3 cheaper. So it would probably be worth selecting that one anyway.
