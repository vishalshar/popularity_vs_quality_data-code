I looked every where for zebra and pink to do our daughters nursery! This was very cute and was very easy to clean. I didn't care of the part that you have to turn for it to wind up for it to spin. I did like that it hooked easily to the crib. That the hearts could come off easily and that the bar was covered in the zebra fabric also. It was a huge hit for our little one, and we received many, many compliments about it!
