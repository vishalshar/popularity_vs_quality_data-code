I noticed that at times my daughter (now 13 months) would start grabbing my strawed drinks and taking sips of my smoothies and water. When I noticed she was able to do that, I skipped the "sippy cup" (although I often give that to her too, whichever is clean!) and went with this. At first, when we were trying to transition her from the bottle to the sippy, the straw is obviously going to be extremely fast in its flow. This came as a bit of a shock to her for the first few attempts (we had to put on bibs to catch the extra dribble until she got used to it). However, once she got used to it, we give her anything from water to green smoothies (not too thick)  in that.My daughter stopped needing an am/pm bottle of formula/milk because we started switching her off it at around the one year mark. She has been doing amazingly, and attribute part of that to Lollacup's cuteness, ease in holding for our baby, and the amount of liquid she gets (she's a thirsty one). It is a bit pricey, but when I see how much I use it on the daily and how long I'll be able to use it, especially since it came with a replacement straw and a straw cleaner, the price is right.I think hygiene-wise this is easier to clean than the sippy cups that have those plastic stoppers you have to take out and put back in each time you clean it (SO ANNOYING especially when you have two little ones). Also, studies say just skip the sippy and go straight to regular cups or straw to help the swallowing mechanisms for child anyway. GLAD I DID.
