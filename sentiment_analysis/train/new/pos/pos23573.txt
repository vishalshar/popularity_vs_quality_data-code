Hi everyone,  i bought this product about 2 months ago for my 8 month old who is teething.She is in that stage of her life where babies explore everything with their mouth and everything they pick they wanna eat making us wonder if we are feeding them enough lol not really they want to explore and chewing on stuff makes their gums feel better.So there are a lot of teethers out in the market but this one i particularly chose and like because its got gel inside it which is not as hard as other random stuff another added advantage is that since its got gel inside you can refrigerate it, as the baby chews on the cold soft gel they feel good on their soar gums.Its small and ergonomic enough so that a small baby can hold it effectively.  All in all a good product, no cons for this one.I would highly recommend this product, enjoy!!!Regards,Nick HillA bad review is like baking the perfect cake with all the best ingredients and having someone sit on it!
