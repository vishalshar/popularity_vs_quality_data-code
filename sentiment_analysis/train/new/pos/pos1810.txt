We purchased this bag to gate check our stroller in.  Since we have the second seat kit, it doesn't really fold on it's own and needs some sort of bag to contain everything.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that everything fit, a bit tight, but it fit.Unfortunately after our first use there was already a small tear in the fabric but I blame that more on the airline than poor construction of the bag.The bag is very heavy with everything in it, especially with both seats.  It sure would be nice if they added some small wheels to the end!
