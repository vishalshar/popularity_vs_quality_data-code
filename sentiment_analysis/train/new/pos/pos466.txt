I love these sippy cups, and would have gladly given 5 stars but the "standard" shipping literally took weeks. It was listed as delivered for two days, and then re-listed as in another state, and then re-listed as delivered on a date previous to when I made the order. Maybe this is just an anomaly... but that was our experience.But they finally got here, and they are great now. Just be prepared for the possibility of a long wait.
