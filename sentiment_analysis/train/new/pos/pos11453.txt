I think this is great! You never find anything that you can use on the portacrib. The top slides down on the edge of the crib perfectly. True, it could use a couple more play things attatched to it, but that is simple to fix. just add a couple more little tags and hook on a couple of small toys of your choosing. I found a little activity toy by V-Tech and it's a little car that has two buttons on it, and when pushed, they honk, play music, and sounds. Added to the car, hanging down, are three small little items, a soft teether, a little ball thing with "shakies" in it, and another little toy. Since it's a little longer, I will re-arrange the toys already on the panel, and put the one I bought on one of the upper hooks. I also found a small little fabric book, that has little pages to flip through, and one of them has a small mirror. There are lots of things you can use. You actually cannot use their little tags that hold the toys on. Their toys have a little slot that the tags go through to hold them on. However, you can make a simple little loop, instead of a little tag as they have,  to add on your toys. Make it to your own liking. It's the only thing I have found that can be used on the portacrib. Oh, I also got a little red crab, with a mirror on it, that is for the Portacrib. This was not to go on the panel. It goes on the edge of the Portacrib like the activity panel. I purchased them both from Amazon.
