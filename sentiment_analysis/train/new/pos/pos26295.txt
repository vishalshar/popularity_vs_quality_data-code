I very rarely review my purchases, but I had to make an exception in this case.  I registered for one packet of these blankets when I was pregnant.  They are FANTASTIC!  They are the closest thing you will ever find to those multicolor blankets the baby is wrapped in at the hospital.  They are long enough to swaddle a baby, lightweight, and, they wash beautifully.  My son just turned 1, and over that year I have ordered two additional sets.  I have one in each car, one in the pack n play, one in the crib, and one in the diaper bag.  They are still his "go to sleep" blanket- at naptime and bedtime, he rubs it against his face, and closes his eyes.  If he wakes up, I hand to him and he soothes himself.  Friends had the snuggly sort of swaddle device, but i did't like it- if you want a blanket that you will use for a long time, as opposed to just infancy, purchase these.  The nurses will show you how to wrap the baby, and it really isn't that hard- I did it multiple times in the middle of the night with no sleep and very little light.  When you have a baby you will be overwhelmed with gear, and although you may like your brand of bottle warmer, sterilizer, or cradle, and recommend it to friends you must realize that other brands are very similar- this is the one "must have" item because I have never found anything quite like it.
