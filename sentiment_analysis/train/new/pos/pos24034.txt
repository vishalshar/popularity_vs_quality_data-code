My first child loooved this tunnel. She used it from 4 months old to two years old. Unfortunately it broke down eventually with how much she used it, and personally I got sick of storing this thing...it's huge and doesn't store well unless you disassemble it.So, fast forward to our next baby that we had...I missed my old tunnel and was disappointed to find that it was discontinued. We did not use the tunnel for baby #2.When baby #3 came along, we found the tunnel was on the market again. A little different, but mostly the same. I eagerly assembled it and gave it to our 4 month old. He liked it at that time, while he was not mobile. As he got more mobile, the tunnel frustrated him. He would roll inside it and it would get all twisted up. He is seven months old now and really has no interest in the tunnel whatsoever. I'm kind of sad that something that brought my first baby so much joy irritates my other baby. But it is what it is, and I personally love this tunnel. But it is big, and takes up room, and doesn't break down for storage without disassembling it. We are getting rid of the tunnel, after only having it three months :(
