These are great starter plates to help the little one get used to scooping food out of them. The removable ring is adjustable to put on either side for use by either hand of your little one. Suction is okay, but will come loose if not pressed down in the middle and be mindful of your little one pulling on it. A lot of the problem lies not with the product, but the surface it is put on; as most high chairs have a plastic tray that must me cleaned well to allow the suction. I find that put just a little water around the edge of the suction area helps it to stay in place, as you may do with any item that has suction adapters on them. I would recommend as something to help your little one learn to get things onto their utensil. Also the spoon and fork is a great size for little fingers and hand. The fork has rounded tines on the outer edges not to hurt the mouth when using.
