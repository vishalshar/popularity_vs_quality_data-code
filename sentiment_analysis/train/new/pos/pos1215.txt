I love this diaper bag.  It's really sturdy, the fabric wipes clean very easily and it's VERY roomy.  I have two kids in diapers and it holds all of their stuff, plus mine.  There are four large interior pockets with elasticized tops.  I keep diapers (4-5) and wipes (one big pack) in one, my stuff  (wallet, lip gloss) in another, toys/paper/crayons/small books in the third, and then in the last pocket I keep snacks, bibs, and food related items .  There are also two smaller interior pockets (still very deep but not as wide) - I think these could be bottle pockets but we don't use bottles so I keep diaper creams, hand sanitizer etc in them.  I use the outside pockets for sippy cups and the covered outside pockets for my phone and pacifiers - the most important things to have handy quickly.  I also keep a change of clothes for each child in the zippered pouch and always carry a big swaddle blanket in the main compartment.  There is still room for burp cloths, my soft baby carrier (sling), and other miscellaneous things if I want.  So, it holds a TON of stuff.  I love the cross-body strap.  It seems very well made and I hope to use it for a long time!
