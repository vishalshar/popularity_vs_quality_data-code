I'm amazed at how much my baby likes the The First Years Learning Curve Star Teething Blanket. On each end of the star is a different texture -- plastic, crinkling, ring-attachment, squeaker, etc. I got it when my baby was 3.5 months old, and months later, the baby still loves it.PROs- My baby loves each of the different textures of the ends of the star legs.- People have complained about the size, but it's a perfect size. It's about one foot wide. It is small enough for my baby to handle and grab.- Because everything goes in the baby's mouth, each of these star's legs have gone in the baby's mouth and it is short so the baby doesn't choke on it.- This toy makes different sounds. The body crinkles and one of the star legs crinkle as well. One of the star legs also squeaks.CONs- Although the ring attachment is my baby's favorite, it detaches rather easily. Each time it detaches, my baby possibly loses the ring by accidentally tossing it (out of the stroller). This is not a big deal. I just have to keep my eye on it.- Because of the squeaker sound and the crinkle noise, my dog loves this toy too!
