Simple, Easy and Basic! This gate was perfect for my needs! Its light and easy to travel with. I bought it to keep my dog from going upstairs and to help protect the top of the stairs at night when I'm watching my nephew. When in a door jam it secures tightly but please note its not an actual stair way gate. In my house it works for my needs perfectly because it secures well enough on my banister to stay up right and keep people/dogs out BUT it wouldn't support weight if someone fell into it so if you need a stair gate for a toddler please do look into stair gates. For me with my dog needs and my travel needs and it was perfect!
