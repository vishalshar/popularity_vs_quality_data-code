If you are looking for a cute pacifer for photos, look no further. I bought this for a friend that had a baby boy whose father is a college football player. She had some very very cute pictures made of her son with this pacifier as well as other football props. She couldn't really use it as a day to day pacifier because her son didn't like the way it was shaped and wouldn't keep it in his mouth.
