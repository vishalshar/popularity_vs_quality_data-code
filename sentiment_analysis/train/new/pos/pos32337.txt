I was skeptical of this product because it was so cheap, but I was looking for a mobile that was inexpensive and that I could modify to work with the theme of our nursery. This mobile works great! I was planning on taking off the stuffed circles and replacing them, but when it arrived I was so impressed with it, I left it that way. The only issue I had with this is that the clamp did not fit on our crib. This looks like it is made for smaller older model cribs that are not really as popular anymore. I was able to rig it and attach it to the side of the crib with a tie strap and that worked decently.
