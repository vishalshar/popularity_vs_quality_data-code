I don't have a toddler, but I do have a cat whose lack of opposable thumbs can make doors a problem. I put these on the tops of the doors to my bedroom and the room her litter box is in. If the cat gets shut out of the bedroom, she'll cry all night, and if she can't get to her litter box, neither of us will be happy. These guards keep me from absentmindedly closing the doors, and the cat from accidentally shutting them when she breezily dashes out of the room.Edited to Add: I've added a picture of one of these wedged into the door hinge, for someone who asked if that was possible (it is!).
