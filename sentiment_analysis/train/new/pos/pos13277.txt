This bag is excellent! First it is very hard to find a quality stroller covered alone one that would fit the B ready full size stroller. But this cover was perfect. We are new parents and flew overseas to Europe for the first time. I stayed away from all the crappy covers sold at target and Babies r us because they even looked cheap from the clear packaging. And reading the reviews did not help.After reading that his fit other full size strollers in the same category as the Bready we have and as a prime member I decided to take a risk. So glad I did. First let me say the the expansion function work great and you should and can tighten the straps on around the stroller once in the cover. User caution, you should keep your toddle seat on, use the clips to buckle the bottom of the cover together at the wheel base and unlock the wheels. If you keep your stroller wheels locked the idiots will drag your cover an cause burn tears at the bottom from dragging in on and or off the plane.I resized this when we had our layover and did not repeat it. The other 4 flights worked perfectly with this cover. It's simple to buckle back up after use and throw it in the bottom of the stroller while you dash to type next flight. Then fold your stroller up at the gate again-use the expansion again for Bready moms and dads . Clip the buckles right under the frame and around stroller, unlock wheels and enjoy your flight !
