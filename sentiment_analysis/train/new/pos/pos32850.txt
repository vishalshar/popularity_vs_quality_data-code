We had another pacifier that was given from the hospital. The one that we used was really good too except that it was too heavy for infants. Out son is now 8 weeks old and he always love to suck on a pacifier to comfort himself and we needed one to put him to sleep except the old one would fall out from his mouth when he was just about to fall asleep. So we we went to BabiesRUs to get a new one. This is the one that we bought. It's pricy compared to other ones but we wanted to right one so we didn't have to waste money on trying out multiple pacifiers.This one is great. It stays in!! The only thing that bothers me is that water does get into the pcifier and we have to clean it really thoroughly. However, if we shake the pacifier really well, the water will go out and as I observed the pacifier, the water will not get back to our son's mouth.We got another one from Amazon so we have 2 handy. However, I would probably go back to the old ones when he can suck on something that's a little heavier.
