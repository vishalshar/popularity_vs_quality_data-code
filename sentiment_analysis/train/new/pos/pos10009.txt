I bought this lunch bag to replace a lunch box that was made of fabric without any inside liner or protection. After fruit spills, rotten bananas left in the lunchbox overnight, and some juice spills, needless to say the lunchbox was just gross. I chose this Angry birds lunch bag because of the insulated lining that I thought would be easy to wipe and clean and I have not been disappointed. The kids love the Angry Birds design and the easy to use carry strap, and I love that a complete lunch can fit in it. I typically back a water bottle, a sandwich (in it's own plastic container), a piece of fruit and either a cheese or a snack. Everything fits wonderfully with room to spare. I tend to keep 5 stars for truly exceptional products, but I give this lunch bag a strong 4 star review.
