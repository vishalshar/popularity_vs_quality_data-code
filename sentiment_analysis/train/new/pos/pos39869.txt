I love it! I flew with my 2 girls (2.7 yrs and 7 months) alone. The Sit n Stroll worked just like it was supposed to. I love how the handle extends up to a comfortable height for me (I'm 5'10"). Most of the airline personnel had never seen such a thing. The FAA approved sticker is right on the seat so there's no mistaking it.It did not fit down the aisle as a stroller but I would of had to take my daughter out to put it in the seat anyway. It is a little awkward to make into a stroller or roll up the wheels with a toddler in it but you can do it. And make sure the unit is off the ground while transitioning.It made my trip so much easier!! I highly recommend it!
