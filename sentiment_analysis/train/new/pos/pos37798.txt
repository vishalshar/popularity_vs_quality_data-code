So adorable! My two year old loves this and  so do I. It's the perfect size for a little head to rest on as a pillow, to squeeze and hold onto as a stuffed toy, and a just right size blanket to cover her up completely. It's super soft, provides warmth but yet is light weight. I love the little handle on the top for her to tote it around or for me to hang on the stroller handle. It's also small enough to fit in diaper bag and does fit in the matching skip hop ladybug toddler back pack.  I would say it is perfect under five years of age. It would be great for travel purposes like air planes, trains, and cruises.
