The quality and versatility of this bag are the reason why I have carried it since the day my daughter was born and probably will continue to carry it for several years to come. I love the fold out changing station - the material is so soft, it detaches and is easy to wash, and then zips up and out of the way. We cloth diaper and have plenty of room for all of our cloth diapers, a change of outfit, toys, food, etc. My husband doesn't mind carrying it because of the neutral color and backpack style. It is definitely on my list of top 5 baby must-haves!
