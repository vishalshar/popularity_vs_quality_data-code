This works great with our Chicco Capri stroller. It took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close. However, once I figured that out, it was great. I could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed. The swivel is a great concept. I actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder (one on each side) and mommy could have her water bottle clip. We just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles.
