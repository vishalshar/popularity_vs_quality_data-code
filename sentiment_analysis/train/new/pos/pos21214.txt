Our perfect Sippy's. Do they leak, yup! When my toddler chews them open! They do not leak until my doll wants to start acting like KuJo! I still use them when they leak during the day. Blue are for night, that means that they don't leak. Used for night only because they are not destroyed by my toddler. Red is for day! That means they leak, because my son has chewed them open. We have our Contigos... that we let him use when he will be using his Platinum Leap-pad or near electronics. We use the kids Contigos for the car or doing errands. Outside play we use the red ones... There still good we just have a system. With sippys you have to because life's not perfect and neither are sippys!
