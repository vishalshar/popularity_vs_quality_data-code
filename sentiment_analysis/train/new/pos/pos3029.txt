I am the mother of 4 children, ages 12, 10, 5 and 2.5 months old. I've used Playtex, Evenflo, Gerber and Avent bottles. I've bought reusable bottles and the ones with the disposable liners. I've used the wide and the "regular" neck bottles and Dr. Brown's are, by far, the best I've bought and used. I was using the Avent bottles with my 2.5 month old and she struggled with the nipple, it looked like the nipple was too rigid for her. She was gulping as much air as she was milk and making the loudest sucking noises I've ever heard a baby make. Forget about burping her! A friend told me how great her son was doing with the Dr. Brown's so I bought the starter kit. I could see the difference the first time I tried it. None of the loud sucking noises and burping her was a breeze. It does take 20 seconds longer to clean because there are 2 more pieces than a traditional bottle has but it's not a big deal and it's so worth it. Also, the milk leaked out a couple times when the bottle tipped over. Again, not a big deal given how well the baby is doing on these bottles and this could have happened with any brand of bottle. I would recommend these bottles to family and friends .... in fact, I already have. A friend is due next month and I told her Dr. Brown's is the way to go.
