I am willing to try anything sometimes. My now 19 month old daughter was having a really tough time cutting her back teeth. She cried and chewed on everything and the drool was immense. Once she started to wear this necklace it all stopped! Now she loves to put it on every day. Sometimes I do let her sleep in it. I know, I know. We usually take it off at night though. Kudos. This thing works for us!
