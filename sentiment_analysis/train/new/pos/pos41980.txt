I really only had two criteria for carseat harness pads, they had to keep my little one from getting abrasions from the car seat straps and they had to be reasonably priced.  Almost any of the available options would perform the first part of the task but I was amazed at how much the makers of carseat harness pads were charging for a simple piece of padded cloth with some velcro.  I had resigned myself to theJJ Cole Collections Strap Cover in Graphite thinking it would do the job, when the always useful "customers buy this after looking at that box" pointed out these pads by Sunshine Kids.  The do the job, they're nice and soft and I was able to get two sets for the price of one set of the JJ Cole ones.  Very nice Sunshine Kids!
