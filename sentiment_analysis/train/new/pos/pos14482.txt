I was amazed at how easy it was to attach this to my stroller. We have a BOB Revolution jogging stroller, which does not have any riding board accessory. I managed to hook this up in just a few minutes and gave it a successful test ride with my 3-year old who loved it. Smooth ride. Easy to install and remove. Great price.
