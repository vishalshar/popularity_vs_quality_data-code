Love, love, love it!  As a mom to a lot of kids (teenagers down to infant), I have used a lot of carriers from simple slings to the Ergo, Boba, and everything in between.  This is the best!  It is the most comfortable soft structured carrier (ssc) and is my favorite for bigger kids.  For newborns and small infants I use the Baby K'tan and love it.  However once baby reaches about 15 lbs the k'tan stretches and starts hurting my neck and back.  I have been searching for a ssc that supported well and I've found it!  There is absolutely no weight on my shoulders- amazing!  After a few hours I start to get a slight pain in my lower back, but that is nothing compared to the pain I would get after mere minutes with the Ergo, Boba, etc.  Make sure that you tighten the waist belt as tight as you can as that puts all the weight on your hips.  I thought I wouldn't like the unpadded straps but they are so comfortable!  Please be aware that you can't use this carrier until baby is 15 lbs and it is only to be a front carrier although I have seen videos online about how to use it as a back carrier.  I don't back carry so that's not an issue to me. Highly recommend!
