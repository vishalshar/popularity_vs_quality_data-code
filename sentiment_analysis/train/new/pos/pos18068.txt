This was given to me with our first child.  My daughter loved it once she began to stand.  It was a quiet way to tell us "Hey guys, I'm up - get me before I cry."Cons:*The gears are a bit loud if you have the crib in your room.  I wish the gears ran more quietly.  However: The kids never care about the gears running, and they actually find it soothing as a repetitive or constant murmur.*Music can get really loud too, if you let it.  I wish it didn't get so loud (it is a bit excessive on the higher settings)*The music doesn't last long in duration, if the child isn't old enough to keep kicking or pushing the button.*This toy is geared for an older infant or younger toddler.  Babies smaller than this won't be able to keep it playing repeatedly after the song ends, nor see the lights that shine on the ceiling (with the third lighting option).*I wish the MP3 add on wasn't so expensive (still haven't brought myself to spend another $50) So, I know the six songs it has VERY well.Pros:*This has been through two kids now and it's been adored by both my daughter and son.*Each got more enjoyment when they could repeatedly hit the buttons as the songs ceased.*I love the nightlight button, it's dark enough to not blind the child when used to change the midnight diapers.*one last note - It's only taken one set of batteries per child!  In the world of battery usage toys that are heavily used, this is VERY impressive!  1 set of batteries = 2-3 years of constant crib use!)Overall - I love this little toy and so have both my kids.Each kid has found a secret/magic way of "locking" it into a constant gear murmur that I've never been able to find.  However if this happens, neither the music nor lights run and they'll sleep well with the constant hum of the gears.  Once snoring, just turn off the "bugged" run by hitting the pause button or turning it off/on.Bottom line - it's very well loved and the pros outweigh the cons.
