This was a perfect choice for my twins. Although listed as "boys", it really is gender neutral. The colors are bright and both kids love the animals. I liked the fact it was was "wood" so eventually it will store nicely as a keepsake ( Because it's sturdy and can fold). It was a little hard to unfold at first but once I got it open, it was fine. The photo slots are nice. It doesn't start at 0, do you do have to measure up on the wall before hanging. I do recommend taking the bottom down with a 3m command strip or something. I'm using a paint marker to mark the heights.*When I say "wood", please note it's like a partial board or composite-type material. It is not carved or cut wood. It is light, but sturdy.
