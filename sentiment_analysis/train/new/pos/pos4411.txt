It is big enough to hold lots of toys. It allows the toys to drain and dry in the bucket, but the water can be easily poured out without emptying the inner bucket. It doesn't have to drain into the tub. Color coordinates with bathroom. Later it can be a wastebasket when we are passed the toys in tub stage.
