I am pleasantly surprised!  The JOTO fit my ipad mini perfectly!  It is a matte finish so you're going to lose a tiny bit of the screen sharpness but I can't tell.  No way around that but a small trade off to get rid of the glare.  I use the mini in an airplane and found the screen was almost unreadable and acted like a mirror in bright lighting conditions!Installation was a minor challenge.  Here are some tips. Clean your mini screen thoroughly.  Have a roll of scotchtape handy. I have a small fan on my desk I aim at the screen to keep any dust from settling on it.  No clue if it helps.  Set your mini on a flat surface.  Peel the back off the protector.  NEVER touch any part of the adhesive side of the protector.  Hold the protector by gently pressing the edges only.  Carefully line up the protector along the bottom of the mini making sure the button hole is centered.  Slowly let the rest of the protector attach to the screen.  Off center?  DON'T use your fingernail to pry it loose at the corner!  It will never attach in that spot again! Instead take a few inches of tape and use it to lift the protector off the mini and try again.  Use a credit card to push out the bubbles.  You should still have the removable film on the front of the protector so you can push pretty hard without damaging the protector.  Got it on right but there's dust creating bubbles?  That's the hard part.  Use tape to lift only that part of the protector off the screen.  Wrap a piece of tape around your finger sticky side out and "scrape" the dust off with the tape. If you do wind up with a few small bubbles it's not a big deal.  You'll only notice when the mini is turned off.  Good luck!
