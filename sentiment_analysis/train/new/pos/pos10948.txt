I'm using this just to get my son comfortable with the idea of sitting in a potty and learning that he's supposed to pee and poop in it (he's only 8 months old). The slip guards aren't effective because they fall off but that's not an issue because I put it on a rug and it doesn't move at all. I could see how the splash guard isn't big enough to prevent pee from splashing out of the potty, so I don't know how it's going to work out, I suppose i could teach him to just hold down his "unit" when the time comes. It seems like a decent potty training tool. I like that it's construction is simple so it's easy to clean, which matters more than gimmicks. The only con is that the bucket that catches the pee/poop has a small opening so that could be a problem if your toddler is squirmy. Overall I'm happy with my purchase, it's perfect for what I bought it for.
