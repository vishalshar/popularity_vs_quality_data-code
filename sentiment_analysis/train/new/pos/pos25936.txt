I was wary of purchasing this blanket for my first baby, as I thought it would be a waste of money when I could just swaddle him the old fashioned way. However, my little guy managed to wiggle his way out of even the best swaddles, and would wake himself up by scratching his face (ouch)! Though he could at times wiggle an arm out of these, they stayed much more secure than a regular blanket.I ended up purchasing one small knit, one small fleece, and a large of each as well. We got good use out of ALL of them. I used the knit for warm nights/days since they're a thinner material, and the fleece for cooler days/nights. Yes, I even swaddled him during nap time. For the few months that my son was going to day care, the workers LOVED the blankets too. They really helped my son sleep, which all parents know is a priceless thing!The description is not accurate about sizing. We actually used the large up until we stopped swaddling around 8 months. They were getting to be a big snug, but I think they would have fit a bit longer. My son was just naturally done with having his arms held hostage all night.I will be holding onto all four of these blankets to use when we have our next baby.
