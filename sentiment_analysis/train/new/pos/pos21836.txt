This is the only highchair we have and we love it. We had originally looked at the Tripp-Trapp and other tray-less options. The tray on this is small, but I have not found it too small. It has worked perfectly for finger food. Perhaps this will be more of an issue once we move on to consistently using plates and silverware, but the chair is the perfect height to slide up to the table and eat directly from there without the tray once he's ready. We have taken this to family dinners. It collapses easily for transport - it is not tiny when fully collapsed, but definitely portable and fits easily in our car. I was worried about the chair being too small, but my 2-year-old nephew has also used it without a problem. I know that a lot of people have purchased this for small apartments where space is an issue. We have a large kitchen, so space was not a deciding factor for me, so if you're buying it purely for space issues, you will not be compromising on function or quality.My only complaint is that the straps are not removable, so cleaning them is a bit of an issue. However, this could probably be solved by using a bib - which I never seem to remember. I would highly recommend this chair. You can't beat the price. I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to all of my friends.
