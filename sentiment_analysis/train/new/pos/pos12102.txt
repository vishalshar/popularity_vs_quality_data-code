I chose this thermometer for my 10-month old son. I never liked using a rectal thermometer for a number of reasons, and I figured if they use the ear therm in doctors' offices it has to be a good option.The name of the game seems to be getting the probe all the way in the ear canal, which for babies means pulling the outer ear back so that the middle ear (ear canal) is accessible. This can be a little tricky with one parent holding a squirmy baby, pulling on the ear, getting the therm in and then pressing the button to take the temp.I also generally take the temp twice to be sure I have an accurate reading. If it's way too low (in the 96-98 range) I know it's probably not positioned correctly, esp if I think he has a fever.The therm reads fast and I love that it doesn't need a probe cover, you can just wipe it with alcohol to clean it.Overall, a good option and so much nicer than the other option!
