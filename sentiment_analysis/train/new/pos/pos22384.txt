We are actually using this foam stripping on the corners of our walls.  Our 2.5 year old has had a mishap and hit the corner of the wall in a narrow hallway requiring stitches on more than one occasion.  We cut these to the proper length, used the tape provided and they fastened to the wall pretty well.  The foam is sturdy enough that it will hopefully prevent the need for stitches if there should, heaven forbid, be another accident.  The strips have been in place for about a week and are holding well.
