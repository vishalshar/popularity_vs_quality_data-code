We received this as a gift when my second baby was born and my fam loves the super sleek design like kelley mentioned above but our experience is a very different one.No issues at all with it swaying - it does as its states for well over 2 minutes when my 3 month old is in it- not as long when my 2.5 year old is in it-which makes sense considering the laws of physics. Either way- they both love it just the same and I love the ecofriendly factor of it both energy wise and the fabric that's healthier for baby- bot pluses in my eyes especially since it can be used much longer than any other swing on the market. I would suggest this to anyone that ones a swing for their baby that is green, with an amazing design and wants to be able to use it for more than just for baby.
