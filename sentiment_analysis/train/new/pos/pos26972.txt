This stroller was one of my best purchases.  I wanted a lightweight stroller that I could easily manage through an airport.  I recently used this on a trip to florida and couldn't be happier with the stroller.The stroller is easy to push and steer, it reclines to any position, basket is decent size. I have the Land's End Little tripper diaper bag, which fit perfectly on the back.  My baby easily slept and played in the stroller.The front bar is nice because it has some padding my infant frequently hurts himself in my big graco with kicking the hard food tray, so this is nice because he doesn't hurt himself.  I easily hooked toys on to the bar and he was entertained for hours.The only 2 negatives, small shade and the way it locks when you close it.  The shade is too small, but all lighweight strollers have a small shade.  I had a Kiddopotamus sun shade on my larger jogging stroller, I just used that on this stroller and it gave my infant all the shade I needed.the mechanism that locks the stroller doesn't hold the stroller together securely enough.  We bought some velcro and added an extra strap the we used when gate checking the stroller so the stroller didn't come apart when they threw it under the plan.Highly recommend this stroller.  Actually keep it in our car 100% of the time because it takes up so little space and it so easy to open and close.
