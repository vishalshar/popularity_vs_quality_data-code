I purchased the Jump N Jive for our twin granddaughters who absolutely love it. They are now almost 6 months old and show no signs of becoming bored with it. We do have narrow doorways so I put towels or padding where their hands might bump. The clamp used to hang it feels secure. I am glad to see an earlier post explaining how to raise it further as ours does need to come up a little.  I also had some initial problems attaching the cloth seat but once it was on, it hasn't shifted or moved. Only after reading earlier reviews have I realized the jumper was supposed to come with two detachable toys.  Ours did not, although they are shown in the picture on the box. I assumed the rings were there so you could add your own. Regardless, the babies are so entertained with the jumper that the toys aren't needed. We're so happy with the Jump N Jive that I have another in my cart so the babies don't have to share!
