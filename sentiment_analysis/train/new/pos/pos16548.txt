I ordered the additional camera to go with my current levana Monitor. Boy were people right about how hard it is to pair!! I tried everything the comments suggested and nothing  worked. I called the number and that didn't help. Finally got back on the website and did chat option with a representative. I got my camera paired in 1 minute! Here's the trick.1. Turn camera off2. Place electrical tape over the tiny light sensor hole at the top. This is key!!3. Turn camera on....camera should NOT light up green BUT should be blinking orange!4. Once blinking Quickly turn on monitor and press the play button. Then press menu.5. Camera should pair!Bad news! I was disappointed that you can't use 2 cameras in VOX mode. You can set it switch back and forth automatically but then the screen is always on! So you must pick a camera to have set on vox and then manually change to the other camera to check on it.
