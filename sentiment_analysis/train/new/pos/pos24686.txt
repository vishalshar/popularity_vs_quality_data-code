If you're into prefolds this cover is great. The print is awesome and the double gusset legs keep the poo in the diapers. Love this style (cover and diaper) more than stuffing bum geniuses. Saves time in stuffing, laundry and putting the diapers on. Dries fast and the Velcro is strong. Our boy is currently 2 months old and  12lbs; these fit great and will for some time to come.
