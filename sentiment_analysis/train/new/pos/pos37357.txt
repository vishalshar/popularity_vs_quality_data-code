THis is a very nice stroller and car seat set. I bought for my son and it is very comfy, the car seat and stroller, very strong too! Has a lot of space under to put your bags. The only thing I wish it had its to completely pull back having your baby fully laying down. it does not lays down all the way to the back, so when he felt asleep I had to put a little blankie or pillow for his head not to tumble. But overall is a great stroller with pretty gray and baby blue color.
