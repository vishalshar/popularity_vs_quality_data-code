This toy is pretty heavy for my 5 month old, but because if the removable keys, he can still play with it minus a key or two. The weird black and white ball is what gets my son's attention right away, but the sound the key make is a nice clacking sound and keeps him interested. The keys also have rubbery nubs on them so they provide a nice sensory experience. But the best thing about these keys is the little ribbon shreds at the top of the striped ball... My son is in love and caresses them and chews on them whenever he plays with this. It's pretty funny. Good quality toy.
