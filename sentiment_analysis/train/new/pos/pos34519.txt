I bought this for a friend as a first birthday present.  I opened it up to put in the batteries for her, and played with it a bit.  I can see why people may complain about it not lighting up every time, as the ball needs to hit a button in the center of the cone to create the light and sound reward.  I really like the idea of this toy, and found it to be fairly high quality from what I can tell.  The one thing that surprised me was that although the rings are soft and the cone head of the elephant has some padding the whole thing has a hard plastic interior.  I was thinking that this would be squishy and a little huggable, but that's not really the design of it.  It is more designed to be an interactive toy for the balls and stacking hoops.  But it seems well made and is a creative approach to a stacking toy.
