We use this as a therapy dog bag. Most travel bags for dogs focus on having enough room for dog food, water, and poop bags.  This bag has  plenty of pockets to organize  paper work (rabies certificate, Pet Partners Approval letter), ID badges, a water bottle, treats, antiseptic wipes, poop bags, soft blanket, towel, etc.  It is very well made and the shoulder strap makes it very easy to carry around while handling  our dogs.
