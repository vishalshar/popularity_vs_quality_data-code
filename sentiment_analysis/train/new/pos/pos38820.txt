This swing is absolutely perfect and a great price compared to others.  I did not want a giant swing taking up half my living room so this was perfect.  It was incredibly easy to put together and easy enough to fold for travel.  That is probably my favorite feature is that it folds completely flat for easy storage or for taking to Grandma's house for the day.  It has 5 different speed settings and several sound and song options with volume control.  My son is 4 months old and is just now outgrowing it (he is on the large side, 98th percentile) but we still use it everyday.  The included snail ended up becoming a cat toy as my son was uninterested in it but we can hang his other toys from the leaf and he loves that.  It has been perfect for nap times too.  The fabric is really soft and it is slightly padded where his legs lay.  It cradles his perfectly.  The cover also comes off super easily for washing.  I don't think I could have survived those early days without this!
