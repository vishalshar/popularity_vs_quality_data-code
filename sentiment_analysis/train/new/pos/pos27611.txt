This is the only cup our toddler will drink milk from because of the hard straw. We had several of the older style and they finally were wearing down around the 1.5 year mark. The stoppers even when cleaned and installed properly were causing not enough suction and too much air. When I read the reviews about the newer versions I didn't understand but ordered these anyway. Our order was through Baby Haven and FYI they are the newer version. These are great! I really like the extra piece and it seems it is much easier to drink from. Not leakproof though but the old version wasn't either. My only complaint is you can't buy individual colors and if you get all the packs you end up with duplicate colors.
