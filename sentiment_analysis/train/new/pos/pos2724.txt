First of all: I am a first time mom. And I decided to cloth diaper my DD.I am not one of those moms that really go above and beyond wit their laundry, household, cooking, baking.. I am just, well.. too tired, and I honestly didn't even try to fool myself. I am a perfectionist, but I skipped perfection in this case, because I anticipated I would be so stressed out, sleep-deprived, nipple-sore, hungry, showerless.. you name it, once the baby is born. And I was so darn smart right.I knew I wanted organic, but I also knew I wanted something easy. No stuffing, no folding, no 'snappies' for this tired momma. My friends were so nice to buy me 12 counts of the bumgenius elemental (in random colors) and some pocket diapers to try.I used a mix of disposables and newborn pocket diapers until DD grew out of them (5 weeks). Then I switched to the bumgenius. She had around 8lbs when we started the AIOs and I never had a single leak. They just fit her perfectly.So I decided to get some more. Since my husband is a scientist and we both have PhDs (and are super nerdy) I instantly was hooked when I saw the "Albert" print. I thought this print might only available in the "Freetime" version. As soon as I saw it as the "Elemental", I got it.The print is very cute and it looks geniusly adorable on her bum. Need to figure out where to buy nerd glass frames for babies, so we can take a cute picture (to show at her graduation).Why they cost $2 more than the normal prints I don't know. But anyway.. for us with our background it's absolutely worth it.
