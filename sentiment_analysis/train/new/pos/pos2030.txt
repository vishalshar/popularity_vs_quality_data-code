This is hands down my favorite cover.What I like:high quality materials and construction - size 1 fit my baby as a newborn and still fit him now at 1 year old (he'll be ready to go to size 2 soon) and these covers still look and feel practically brand new!perfect trim fitfit well over every diaper I havetwo size system minimizes the number of sizes you need to purchase, but still provides perfect fit - better than a one size which rarely actually fits a newborn anyway..leg gussets - a must for containing newborn poo. - I never had a leak with these!tuck flaps - handy for keeping an insert (like a pad folded prefold) held in place, and also nice for making sure only the soft side of the PUL touches the baby's skin.what I don't like - this gets down to the real nitty gritty:snaps are reinforced with an extra layer of PUL, it is possible for a little runny poo to get under that layer so you can't just wipe it clean but need to put it through the wash - the tradeoff? the snaps are reinforced so won't rip out.I'd love a few more color options. Almost all the colors are pretty bright, I'm a big fan of subtle colors like brown and light yellow for diaper covers. but, since this cover beats out all other covers for me in every other way it became my #1 cover anyway.
