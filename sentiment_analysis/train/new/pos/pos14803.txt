I read a bunch of stroller reviews and ultimately bought this stroller. We needed something for our 10-month old for an upcoming trip to Mexico and I am so glad we spent a little more for this stroller versus trying to rely on our primo-viaggio heavier stroller or on a cheap umbrella stroller.I wanted something light, sturdy, good storage, reclining seat (For naps), and excellent sun coverage. This stroller really has it all for a very fair price.It was awesome on cobblestones. It did great on sandy paths. Even dragged it across the beach and was light enough to pull that way with baby in it. The sun coverage was very good (although we struggled a little with the back flap staying secure on the windy beach). The storage underneath was plenty for a diaper bag and some extra towels. The cup-holder was just the right size for a cold can of Tecate.The stand-alone feature is nice. The weight is AWESOME! It was wonderful to be able to throw the stroller over one shoulder and take-on the flights of stairs leading to our condo -- or getting it through airport security or on and off of public transportation. Baby ate, slept, cruised in this everywhere.Worth every penny we paid for it just for this trip alone. But, know we will get a ton of use out of it on future trips and just local walks and outtings. It's almost just as good and in some ways better than our full-sized stroller. LOVE THIS STROLLER.The higher handle height is excellent. Perfect for me 5' 5" and hubby 5'9"
