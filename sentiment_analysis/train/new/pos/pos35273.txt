I just totally love these! Finally a bib that really fits closely (preventing the drool to wet the neck), that is soft and comfortable and SUPER cute!!! Even if my 4 mo old wouldn't drool or spit up this much, I would still put them on because they are so stylish.Many bibs I tried before were soft but too thin so eventually the clothes got wet too. Or they had this flimsy 'plastic' layer underneath that makes it sturdy and uncomfortable/sweaty in warm weather.These Zippy bibs however have a soft fleece layer underneath that really keeps the clothes dry and it is much more comfortable for the little one. They fit the tiny little neck of an infant but you have two buttons so I am sure my baby still fits this when she is a toddler.Recommended!!
