This has been another great seat to use for our kids. The adjustments are easy, the covers come off relatively easily for washing. Now that we've used it for a few years, the straps sometimes don't adjust as well anymore. But we have had no real issue otherwise, using it forward facing. It was hard to get the right angle when we tried to use it rear facing. So, I wouldn't recommend it for that.
