This water bottle is little girl-approved and mom-tested to be an all around winner.My daughter's criteria: easy one-click opening and closure, just-right grip, stable and stays upright on her desk when empty, keeps water cold through the school day, and, of course, good design--pink with a butterfly motif.Mom's criteria: spill-proof, easy-clean straw, dishwasher-safe, just-right capacity, fits easily in standard water bottle pockets on backpacks, space efficient in the lunch box, BPA free plastic and stainless steel components, drop and dent resistant, and, of course, good design--pink but understated and elegant.After purchase, we both discovered the built-in ring that can be pulled out from the lid in case she wants to carry it via a clip. Unadvertised bonus.What a pleasure to have an everyday item that satisfies on so many levels.  Well worth the cost.
