based on other reviews of this and other snack cup types, I bought one of these to try it out.  now I wish I had already bought 1-2 more!  toddler figured out right away that to retrieve a snack was to would plunge the hand directly through the silicone (?) / rubber (?) opening.  unfortunately I made the initial mistake of mixing snacks in the bowl.  since the bottom is translucent the toddler was able to identify the snackable treasures within, and while I wasn't looking turned the cup upside down and spent several minutes shaking the contents out all over (smarty pants!) it was a mess, but at least the crumbs and crackers didn't simply fall out out of the overturned cup.although the toddler now knows how to twist caps off, this has not happened so far because the opening provides a way to satisfy the snacking urges. and personally I love the "Monsters, Inc." movieI'm likely going to purchase another one, so that I always have at least one clean one on hand, and maybe one more to gift to a friend.
