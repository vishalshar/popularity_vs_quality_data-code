This hamper is so lovely! i have one for my daughter in pink, she has used it for three years. i have no complaints. i recently ordered one in blue for my son who will be born in two weeks.  it is small as others say but kids clothese are small and i wash clothes once a week.  Once it fills to the top i wash everything which is about a weeks worth of clothes so its big enough for me. It does come with a lining inside and her did rip a little but i sitll use it.  What i do is just removed the clothes and not the lining - i always leave the lining bag inside the hamper. over all its a durable , sturdy and very nice hamper for any childs room.
