I was skeptical and avoided buying a Sophie for my daughter because I didn't believe the hype. Well, when she started teething and nothing was working, I caved and bought one of these. Best. Decision. Ever. The face and ears are great for the front teeth, and I bet the legs will be great for molars.One warning: my daughter loves the legs and sticks them really far in her mouth and sometimes gags herself. I would be sure to watch the baby when they have this toy.
