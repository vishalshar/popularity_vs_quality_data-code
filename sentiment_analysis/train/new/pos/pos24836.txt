Wow! This ointment is the best! I used AD with my other 2 kids, but with our 3rd baby I decided to go with Grandma El's because of the good reviews.. and I'm so glad I did. The consistency is much better, it's lighter and not as sticky/thick. It goes on easy & protects the skin really good. I use it with every diaper change, as it recommends. I like it better than AD because it SMELLS AWESOME.. and it's way easier to wipe off than AD, and reapply again when needed. And it really does protect and treat the skin from rashes!It's in my top 3 items I bought from the dozens of other things. And in case you are wondering the other 2 are the Sarabear Diaper Caddy & the new Lansinoh ultimate procreation nursing pads (much better than the original)
