This is hands down the best mobile my wife and I have been able to find for our twins. Please see video for full review but here are some of the main reasons why we (and the babies) absolutely love it:1. The Projection Feature: This is such a great feature. It lights up the mobile with a really cool jungle scene with cute animals and trees and soft colorful lights. The babies literally started smiling the moment they saw this.2. Great Sound: a lot of other mobiles simply don't have good sounding music. They can be high pitched electronic sounding. However, this mobile has very soft, soothing, and gentle sounding music, nature, and heartbeat sound options. Another big win!3. Easy Setup and Installation: Many other mobiles didn't fit the wide bars on our crib, limiting where we could place it. This unit has a strap that fits any width of side bar, which gives us the flexibility to put it pretty much anywhere. It does require 4 D sized batteries. I do wish it had an option to plug into the wall, but the pros of this unit far outweigh this issue for me and the batteries do seem to last a good amount of time.4. Remote Control: It is a great added convenience to be able to turn this on and off with the included remote. After the auto-shutoff kicks in I can simply turn it back on with the remote if the baby isn't quite asleep.The true test of any baby item is whether or not the babies like it. I can certainly speak for our boy and girl twins when I say they absolutely love it! Therefore, this mobile gets a strong 5 star rating from us and we highly recommend it! We bought two for the twins and for the great low price they were well worth it!
