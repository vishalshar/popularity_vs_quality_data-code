Excellent product! I hated the idea of my child sleeping on a plastic surface at daycare, so I bought this to fit over her large folding mat.  It fits perfectly on the big mat.  I have an average sized kindermat as well, and it is a bit loose on that one, but it won't fall off.  The material bedroll type of sleep mats (sort of like a sleeping bag with the pillow attached) are not as cushioned as the large plastic mat, so even though they are cute, I didn't want my daughter to be using that either (the daycare tile floors are so hard and cold!!)  This sheet was the perfect solution.  It's soft and comfortable, and it fits over the thick plastic mat that provides the most support out of all of the mats I researched (and I researched a bunch!!)The sheets, blankets and pillows at my daughter's daycare stay at the facility until Friday (when parents take them home to be washed).  The sheet stays on her mat until that point.  The mat still easily folds up with the sheet still on it and fits right inside her cubby.After two years of use, the sheet has pilled quite a bit, but it is still soft.  I wish there had been more "girl" colors to choose from back then, but maybe they have more now.
