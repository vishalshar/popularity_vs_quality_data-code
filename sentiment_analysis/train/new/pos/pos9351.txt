I bought this for my daughter who is nursing her 7 month old. (she asked me to make one, I thought it easier to buy it on Amazon!!!)  She tells me it is fantastic, keeps the baby occupied while she feeds.  She has since made several more for her babysitter and her husband (works when you bottle feed too). And yes, it is rather expensive considering the materials,  you can make one yourself.
