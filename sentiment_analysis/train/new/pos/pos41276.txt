I bought this because it was the only item that would fit my crib that was in stock for fast shipping.  I am so happy with it.  All the other products out there had ties and I was worried my daughter would get the velcro undone quickly but that has never been a problem.  It doesn't reach end to end of the crib, there are maybe 4 inches on either side, but my daughter hasn't bitten the crib since we installed this.  I also would like to say that the velcro was amazing for when she got sick and it had the be removed to clean - so much easier and faster then undoing a ton of ties.  And there are no stings for her to play with when laying in the  crib. I highly suggest this product.
