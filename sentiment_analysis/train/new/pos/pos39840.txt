I love this container! It is NOT leak proof, so I don't put any wet/leaky foods in there. But it is great as a dry snack container for my toddler. I actually like the fact that it is two containers, which other reviewers did not particularly like. You kinda get two bowls for the price of one! I do not put this in the dishwasher, only wash by hand. Lid fits fine. Wish it came in other sizes....
