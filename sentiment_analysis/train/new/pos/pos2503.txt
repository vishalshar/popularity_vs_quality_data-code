We love the NUK brand of bottles and pacifiers and these pacifiers are no exception! These are the only brand my kiddos would take. With how easy these can be to lose, this 4 pack is so worth buying! The colors are exactly as pictured. Would recommend buying the pacifiers and bottles together because baby recognizes the nipple and will take them easier. Love the othodonic shape - its more natural to breastfed babies and I don't have to worry about teeth problems. Would definitely recommend this product!
