This product is a life-saver. I am an exclusive pumper (a whole other story) and usually spend 2-3 hours per day pumping. This bra gave me my life back and allowed me to return to work with a reasonable expectation of getting things done while still continuing to breast feed. I was reluctant to spend the money at first, but it is completely worth it to buy a quality product if you are planning to pump regularly - I actually have two, one for the office and one for my house (plus it makes laundry easier if you're not trying to plan it around pumping sessions). This bra is very comfortable and securely holds things in place. I do notice that when I'm done, it leaves some pressure marks from the cups, but I think you would get that from anything similar as well.  I've owned it for several months now, and my only complaint is that every once in a while you do have to re-adjust the tie. Because the material is stretchy it does tend to get a little loose over time. However, all you have to do is re-tie it a bit tighter and that problem is solved. One major suggestion: use the strap that comes with it; it definitely improves the comfort level and helps things stay up (especially for those heavy early morning pumps). I use one strap to make a halter (attached in front, up around the neck, and then attached in front on the other side). I never figured out how you would use the other loops (there are also two on the bottom of the bra) and the other strap, but the halter works for me and provides additional support to keep things comfortable. Overall, in my experience this is a quality product that was absolutely worth the money and has made the difficult time with my new babies a little bit easier.
