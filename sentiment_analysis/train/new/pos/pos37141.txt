I can't say enough good things about these cups.  They are SO great.  Reasons are:1) They have soft nipples which makes them super easy to clean inside and out with just my fingers2) They are great ergonomically for my kids and they took to self feeding milk with them right away3) They do NOT leak easily at all if screwed on properly4) They hold just enough for 1 feeding for even my 1.5 yr old who drinks 8 oz each sittingThat said, only thing I've had to rig were the holes on the nipple.  The way they come, barely any liquid gets through even with vigorous sucking (I tried it myself).  I had to cut away HALF OF 1 (ONLY 1 or else it'll be a disaster) little corner on BOTH the nipple and the relief hole.  1 little corner meaning HALF of 1 triangle-shaped piece as the holes are slit with a "+" sign.  You'll know when you see it.
