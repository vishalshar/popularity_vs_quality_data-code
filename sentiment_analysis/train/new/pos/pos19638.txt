We absolutely love this pair of scissors. This is actually our second pair. We had the green one for over 3 years now and need a second pair to keep in the diaper bag. I love the color, the ceramic part is good because that is basically rust free.  The cover is great for on the go and it clicks tight so you don't have to worry about it falling off.  The cover also has a hole at the end so it allows it to be breathable and also any water to leak through to prevent bacteria build up.Pros:1. Ceramic, won't rust2. Easy to clean3. Click tight cover4. Cover has a hole to prevent bacteria build up5. Decent color selection6. Sharp and had no issue cutting harder food.Cons:1. Can only fit one finger through the hole to hold the scissor2. Can't come apart to clean it,need to use brush to clean the nooks and cranny area
