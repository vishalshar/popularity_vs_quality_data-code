Updated 3/27/2015- moved this up to a 5 star. Read the comment on my reply for more context, but my concerns about the "plastic" were unwarranted and the gate has held up perfectly for more than 3 years.FINALLY found a gate that would fit at the bottom of our stairwell where no other gate would go. On one side we had a wooden bannister to mount to, but across from that the stair rail interfered with mounting the other side and the only thing that we could mount to was the door jamb, which was not even close so an angle mount was the only choice. We had tried many other gates with no luck and this one finally worked. Installation took about a solid hour but was not that difficult. Ours is mounted with one side in wooden banister (the latch open side) and the other on a wooden door jamb. Hardware included was fine for both of those surfaces. The ONLY reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was that I really don't like all the plastic pieces on the gate, especially as expensive as it was. I wish that they would have put metal pieces because I still am scared that the plastic pieces are going to snap, not to mention on a gate of this cost I would have really preferred the materials to match the cost. Opening it one handed is easy enough for me, but not easy for my 5 year old (we got it to keep our 1 year old and dogs off the steps)- so it will take a little bit of time to help her learn how to open it so she can get upstairs.
