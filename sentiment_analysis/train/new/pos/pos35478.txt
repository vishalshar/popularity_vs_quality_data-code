The silicone bristles took some getting used to, but I prefer this brush to any other bottle brush now. It scrubs through built-up milkfat like a champ, and the nipple cleaner cleans out bottle nipples without damaging them. The shape makes it easy to scrub around the interior of MAM-shaped, NUK and Comotomo bottles. I do not think I will go back to a regular bottle brush, as the silicone bristles feel a lot more hygienic and are easier to clean and disinfect.
