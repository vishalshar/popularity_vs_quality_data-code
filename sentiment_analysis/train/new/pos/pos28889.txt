Love, love, love these bottles!  I've sent them with my daughter to daycare for her breastmilk, and she took to them immediately and naturally.  I happen to like the short and stubby structure of the bottles and find the nipples to be very natural and wonderful to use.  Furthermore, we kept using the size 1 nipples until she was 9 months old to try to keep her bottles as close to the flow of breastfeeding as possible.  She now uses size 2 and hasn't yet experienced a problem; however, remember that it is best to try to use the lowest-flow nipple as possible for as long as possible, if you intend to keep up your breastfeeding relationship.  These nipples have done a wonderful job supporting this, despite my daughter and me being separated for 9 hours a day, 5 days a week.
