I bought this carrier for my second child. I really didn't use it as much as I should've for him.  He didn't seem to like it very well either.  However, I used it almost daily for our third child, and it was a lifesaver!!  It kept my hands free to do other things and I was able to keep him with me at church for the first 6 months or so.  It's a little hard to get used to putting the baby in it at first, but practice makes perfect!  I didn't use it after he got more mobile, but it says it can be used during the toddler years as well!  Loved it!
