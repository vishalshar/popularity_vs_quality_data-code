I have twins... boys, they're going to be 5 and go through sneakers every few months, literally. I rely on these and having a lot extra. When they were smaller, they knew their sneakers by which color the stickers were. Now that they are older and write their names, they can read the stickers. They ignore the right/left direction and just go with how it feels.... boys, right? Anyway, they are perfect for all their shoes and sandals, not flip flops or water shoes obviously....those get marker
