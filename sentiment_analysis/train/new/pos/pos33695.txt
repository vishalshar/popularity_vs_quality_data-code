I saw a lot of reviews of this brush and comb set that said people had received something other than the Safety 1st Easy Grip orange and white set pictured.  Because I really liked the look of the set, I decided to take a chance and ordered it despite knowing I might not receive it.  In fact the orange and white brush and comb set pictured is exactly what arrived.  All I can figure is maybe the disappointed buyers bought from different sellers - no one specified the merchant and there were 8 merchants to choose from (including Amazon directly) when I ordered.  The set I ordered was sold by River Road and fulfilled by Amazon.The brush bristles are nice and soft, and the comb teeth have rounded ends so they won't scratch the scalp.  The brush and comb are a good in-between size that is easy for both adults and children to hold, and the orange part of the plastic is nicely grippy.  The orange color is attractive, and the orange and white combination makes me think of a Creamsicle!  What more could you ask of a child's brush and comb?
