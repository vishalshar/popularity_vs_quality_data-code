I purchased both the new and used pink badger baskets through amazon.  I purchased this product thinking it was pink dots on pink background.  It's not.  It's white dots with an almost fuchsia background.  It's nice.  But don't let the photo make you think pink on pink.The amazon guaranteed used ones were also attractive, but they are a different color.  I got 2 of each.  One is the bright pink/fuchsia color and the other used set are a pale pink.  They are cute.  But they definitely do not match.  They were both clean and the boards inside were both firm and held shape well.  As a note the 2 used ones match perfectly as do the 2 new ones, they just do not match each other.  I need to get my camera to post a comparison photo as this would help more than the description.  Just wanted folks to know this.  The used would be great if you used all of the the used or if you spread out the colors.  I kinda like the muted pink in the used ones best.
