I don't really understand the negative reviews.  If you order it, realize what you're getting.  You're not getting a powerful food grinder that will grind meats, raw vegetables or undercooked foods.  Of course the food must be well cooked.  You can't feed a baby "crisp tender" vegetables.For $13 it pays for itself in a week.  Cook some green beans till very tender, pop them in, turn the crank and out comes baby food.  Same with carrots, squash, sweet potatoes, etc. Actually it's so easy a four year old can do it.We do bananas and grapes nearly every day.  If we want apple we'll cook it till it's tender.It's great for on the go as well.  The baby is too young right now but I'm sure it would grind up cooked shrimp and fish in a snap...
