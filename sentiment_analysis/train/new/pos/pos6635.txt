My son finally took a bottle with the Adiri nurser.  Phew!  We had a few unsuccessful attempts with bottles, but then at 7 months old I tried this one and it worked.  I mixed the formula with body temp water thinking that was what he was used to.  And I let him have the control--he loved bringing the bottle to his mouth by himself.  I enjoy feeding him with these bottles and he enjoys it too.  He likes to clutch my hair and have his 'ba'.  Good luck!
