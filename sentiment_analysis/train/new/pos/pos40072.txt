I cannot stress this enough....the price of this 69 dollar car seat is a steal !  We have a 150 dollar Graco 3 in 1 seat........had to get this one for another car in our household. Sturdy, comfy and holds bigger kids. My  2 1/2 year old is about 33 lbs.....the Graco is actually getting small for him because of the lack of adjustment. This Evenflo has many adjustments to accommodate a bigger toddler....so this is actually more comfortable for him. I should have purchased this initially and not even bough the Graco. Excellent seat for the money. 5-50 lbs ! Can't get any better than that for 69 bucks
