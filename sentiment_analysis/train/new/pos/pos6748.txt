The Baby Einstein Octoplush was another birthday gift for my one-year grandson. It is a soft plush octopus and upon hugging or pressing the head, it plays pretty music. The velour legs have round colorful, satin patches designating a different color and a corresponding object, (red cherries, blue sky). Each leg will announce both the color and the object as each of the eight legs are lightly pressed, and the switch inside the battery compartment selects a different language, a choice of English, French, and Spanish. There are two sound volumes and an off switch, and for the adult, all the switches and power are easy to access within the closed compartment.My daughter-in-law states that she likes the Octoplush; the music is NOT too loud and actually enjoyable. This toy is professionally finished with nice even stitching, and no loose hanging threads. She was pleased that the Octoplush does NOT have the unpleasant smell of any fire retardant or other nasty odor.My grandson has had the Octoplush for four months and it is still one of his favorites, he understands the head plays music and it is very easy for him to him to press and operate. He holds the Octoplush and sways to the music in adorable dancing movements. This is a child-friendly educational toy, but due to my grandsonâ€™s young age, he does not intentionally use the language buttons on the legs. However, as he gets a little older, and understands more words, the Octoplush will provide some scholastic teaching as a fun learning tool.
