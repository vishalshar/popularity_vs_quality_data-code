I won't pretend... I was linked here because I was searching for brushes in general. I don't have a kid, or a bottle, so I can't speak to this brush's intended use.I can however attest to it's MANY uses outside of the bottle (and I have no idea how it's used WITH one. hmmm)They can withstand a few washings, and make very reusable pipe cleaners... which IS what I was searching for. However... these are BETTER. No bits of fluff get left in the stem, and you can steralize and reuse these (although presumably not for a use with a bottle) plenty of time.I also found that with a spritz of computer-monitor cleaner, it is the BEST way to get... crud... out of keyboards. I'm sure there are more uses... the point is that these are fantastic, and should be in hardware stores!
