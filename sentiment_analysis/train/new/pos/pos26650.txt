Amazing product. So simple, yet so useful. Our son was a premie, and at 2 still hasn’t quite caught up on the weight charts, but heightwise, he’s not that far off. This means that we have to buy clothes sized for his age to get pants that go to his ankles, but they are super loose around the waist. These fix that beautifully for pants that have belt loops. Seriously, thank you to the person that had this simple, brilliant idea! Lifesaver for parents of kids that never got the baby fat.Pros:They make pants fit.They are durable.They are pretty simple to useCons:Not sure if this counts, but like pants sizes, they can be awkward for “in-between” sizes.Not so easy to use if the child doesn’t want to cooperate.Basically, no real cons.One thing to keep in mind, they are useless if there aren’t belt loops, 3 of them, in the back. 2 could work, but the strap will slide up. Also, and I wish I had found out about this sooner, but no one told me, many kids pants have an elastic band inside, with a button that allows them to be tightended/loosened somewhat. Not all of them, but after someone mentioned this, I found that most of them we had did. Dapper Straps are still a great idea, and if fit is an issue for your kid, get them, but know that lots of kids pants have a mechanism built in that does the same thing.
