These are AMAZING. Seriously amazing.They are a little tricky to install, but it is so worth it. There is no way, save having the key, that a curious toddler or child can get into a cabinet that is locked with one of these locks. That alone is worth the minor hassle of installing them.One recommendation: Order extra keys. Order extra keys along with the lock/key set so you have them from the start. Then hide at least two somewhere safe, so that when you inevitably lose the keys you have out for daily use, you have a way to get into your cabinets. Because sometimes even two-day shipping isn't fast enough. :)
