My 7 1/2 year old daughter has always had to sleep with the hall light on and her door open at night because of her fear of the dark.  With the cost of energy, we talked about trying something new at night.  We tried flashlights, night lights, being brave, and nothing worked for her.  Finally, I stumbled upon this little light on amazon one day, and ordered it for her.  It worked like a charm, although the first night she insisted on sleeping with "my little blue friend" in bed with her, and it rolled out of bed in the middle of the night.  Every night after that, her little blue friend has sat on top of her dresser.  I feel so much better about our energy use with this product and my daughter sleeps through the night!
