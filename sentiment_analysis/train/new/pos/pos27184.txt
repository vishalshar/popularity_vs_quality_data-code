I started pumping with a medela in style advanced I received through my insurance. I felt like I lost my freedom being plugged into a wall 8 to 12 times a day. I was hesitant to spend over $300 for a second pump. Since I was planning to pump for at least 6 months to a year, I decided to make this purchase. After one use, I knew it was the right choice. It changed my "pumping" life. I have some of my freedom back while at home. I use my stationary pump at work now since I can't walk around my office building with the hand free pump anyways. Still worth it.
