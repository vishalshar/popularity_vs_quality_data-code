This mat is not super thick but sufficient for our purpose. We placed it over an area rug to add some extra padding as we have hard wood. The mat is very colorful and we appreciate the double sided option. Mickey mouse play mats are hard to find also. It did take a long time to ship (almost a month) and it was folded in a small bag vs. a box. The folding created creases in the mat that remain but for $35 it is a keeper. I don't think it will last too long though.
