I purchased a 2-pack of 9 oz Zoli Bot sippy cups a couple of months ago after trying pretty much every other type of sippy cup and straw cup on the market.  I was thrilled with the Zoli Bot cups and felt like I had finally found the Holy Grail: a non-leaking straw cup that worked in any position, even upside down!  Also, the larger 9 oz size is perfect for our 19 month old daughter (the 6 oz is a little small).  Unfortunately, after 2 months of loving these cups and using them non-stop, they both began leaking on pretty much the same day.  And not just leaking-- they actually starting spewing liquid from the straw, making a huge mess!  I couldn't understand what was going on, and thought that maybe our daughter was blowing into the straw or something.  I carefully inspected the straws today, and noticed that both were missing tiny chucks of silicone from the very tip of the straw.  It's likely our baby was chewing on them.  I tried to order replacement straws, but they were out of stock everywhere I looked (which should tell you that this is a common problem!).  So I called Zoli customer service to see if they had any suggestions.  The woman I spoke with was incredibly nice and when I explained the situation offered to send me not only 2 replacement straws, but also 2 brand new cups.  She even asked what color I wanted.  I was so impressed (I had very low expectations I guess) that I decided to take the time to write a review. In summary, the cups are great, and if they do leak it's probably the straw, so call customer service and they will treat you right.
