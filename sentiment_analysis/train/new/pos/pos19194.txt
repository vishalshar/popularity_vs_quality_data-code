These work really well for storing milk without taking up a ton of space in your fridge or cooler (if you're travelling). Each one stores more than two of the smaller (5 oz.) size Medela storage bottles if you fill these up to the brim. I've crammed about 11 oz. into one of these. You will still need a few of the smaller size collection (storage) bottles though, because I find that this 8 oz. size is too large to be able to pump with - they would hang down long enough to hit my thighs. Plus, the weight of these if they were filled with milk would be uncomfortable during pumping.Notes:1 - These bottles are for storing fresh milk. If you are freezing breastmilk, I prefer to use Lansinoh freezer bags for that (available on Amazon here: http://smile.amazon.com/Lansinoh-Breastmilk-Storage-Bags-Count/dp/B006XISCNA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1449759592&sr=8-1&keywords=lansinoh+milk+storage+bags)2 - Never add fresh, warm breastmilk to cold (refrigerated) breastmilk. You can add warm to warm, or you can wait for it to cool, and then add cold to cold.
