These sippy cups actually don't leak! I bought these because I just weened my son from his pacifier and I wanted an insulated sippy that didn't have a rubber/pacifier-like spout. My son also LOVES Spongebob so I decided to purchased these and I have to say I'm impressed! The sippy has 3 parts: The cup itself, screw on top with hard spout, and a rubbery anti-leak piece that is easily put on and removed from the inside of the spout. I love how this sippy comes apart because it makes it really easy to clean so you don't have to worry about buildup and mold. My sons drinks stay cold for hours and these cups have withstood my son dropping and throwing them. Well worth the money! I plan to buy more in the near future!
