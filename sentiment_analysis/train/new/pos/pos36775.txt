I personally love these bibs, but my 20 month daughter is an even bigger fan!  They are flexible but durable, easy for me to put on (but also difficult for her to take off on her own, which is a great feature!), the perfect size for when she's in her high chair, keep her clean, and most importantly, they are the ONLY bibs she will wear without a struggle.  We have an assortment of cloth bibs, paper bibs, plastic bibs with similar reservoirs, but these are our all-around favorites - by far.  All of the others didn't keep her clean, were too stiff for her to wear and eat comfortably, or were just plain uncomfortable.  These are the perfect size and material to cover her clothes and comfortably fit over or underneath her high chair tray to keep her clean.
