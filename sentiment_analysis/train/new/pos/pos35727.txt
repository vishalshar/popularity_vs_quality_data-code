I purchased this product for my daughter when she first started sleeping without a diaper.  She instantly fell in love with the little guy and used it to go to the potty the very first night.  The only thing she didn't like was the fact that it didn't have a face.  (I fixed that problem by drawing a smiley on it with a sharpie.)I'm not entirely sure if the battery lasts a full 10 hours and the smart-timer option is useless in our household as my daughter has figured out how to change the setting (she prefers having it on for longer than 15 minutes).Overall, I am very pleased with this night light and will definitely purchase another one for my younger child when she potty trains.
