I'm pretty sure this pillow case says it is 100% cotton.  It is very stiff and seems like it has been treated with something so get it so stiff.  I had to wash it several times before it was usuable for a baby.  I wouldn't recommend it.  I kept it because it was more trouble than it was worth to have to mail it back.  I will say though if you dont mind washing it half a dozen times before you use it, that I like the design of it.  It is designed with the pillow entering the center and closes up like a pocket.  It isnt the standard sack pillow case.Here it is 3 years later and I have to say that this has become one of my favorite pillow cases.  It did soften up but it really took a while but since then has really improved with age.
