Every time that I write a review for less than 5 stars, my post is removed, so I hope that people read the reviews...I understand that the company is a "smaller" company, and they have written to me to apologize for the condition that the bear came in, but I still want to get this review out there.  The bear came in with a missing button, and is a really small bear, less than 8" tall I want to say... I immediately returned it, and the company honored the return.  I just have to say that for the money, this bear is not priced accordingly.I was satisfied with the company returning my money and being understanding, and I thank them for that, I just wish that my reviews would stop being removed, because based on my opinion, it is just too much money.
