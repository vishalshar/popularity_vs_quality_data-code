I don't know how I feel about it yet! Its cute and bigger then expected! It's soft and fits my faucet! It's stays on but my kids can easily remove it and I don't like the fact it's easily removed, at least for them, because if my kids would to chew on it, their teeth marks will be visible and if they were to bite on it they can bite off chucks out of it! They haven't done that, but just knowing they could gets me worried! This wouldn't be a problem for older kids! I have a two and a one year old that are still teething and always looking for something to put in their mouths! It's a piece of foam and was hoping for more of a soft kind of plastic feel instead but for what it is, it does the job! It covers the faucet and keep my kid's heads safe! Just not worth 10 bucks for a piece of foam!
