This is the 3rd mirror we tried and this will be the last. As our rear facing car seat is placed in the middle of the back seat there is no headrest. The other mirrors (Brica) we tried were "apparently" supposed to be able to install without a headrest but they did not work out in the slightest. Both fell over within minutes. Fast forward through dozens of failed attempts later to get them to stay up and then we found this one on Amazon. It straps to the adjacent headrest (with two buckle straps) and pivots which ever way you need it to. You can also adjust the angle for which ever way you need as well. It has never fallen down or off but every two weeks or so I give the straps a quick pull to ensure they are secure. This mirror has worked in the following cars for us thus far:- '06 Hyundai Sonata- '07 Hyundai Santa Fe- '08 Ford F150- '11 Chevy EquinoxHope this helps!
