I ordered the giraffe huggybuddy for my son when he was born and he loved it so much I bought the lamb for my daughter when she was born.  These are extremely soft and with a variety of textures baby is sure to find one they find soothing. The arms and ears make good grabbing/rubbing points also. I prefer these to the mini blankets with an animal head sticking out of the middle as these just seem less awkward. Perfect cross between a stuffed animal and blankie.These also wash up well in the washing machine. I have thrown my sons giraffe in several times now and it's just as soft as when we bought it 2 years ago
