I got this set for my granddaughter's toddler bed.  At $14.84 for the three piece set, it was about the same cost as a single fitted crib sheet so I didn't really expect great quality ... So I was very pleasantly surprised that it is great quality.  Looks great & feels great.  The only little flaw is that the pillow case is for a standard size pillow rather than a toddler pillow.  But that's not really a problem in that I just put the toddler pillow in it & fold the extra.  It would be very easy to cut it & reseam it but folding is much easier.  I have washed it three times & it comes out as good as new.  Great set & a great buy!
