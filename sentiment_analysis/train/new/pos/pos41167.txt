I LOVE LOVE LOVE pump ease bra. I'm actually on here trying to order another since I seem to have lost one of my two bras. I've become incapable of pumping without my pump ease! This was intially recommended to me by one of the OB/GYNs I worked with.I've been using Pump Ease for about 6 years now (between 3 kids). I initally bought 2 of them and I have one at home and one for work. I LOVE it. I always put it on my MUST HAVE list for new moms. They've held up after lots of pumping between 3 kids!...and on my 7th month wondering if I can survive with only 1 bra for the last 5+ months of my pumping journey.Pros: I don't have to take off my normal bra to pump, I just slide it up. I also don't have to get undressed!Easy to put on with bra clasps.Lasted me many years and still going strong!I love being productive when I'm pumping. I am in my office and working while pumping. I would hold my baby. Read a book. Hands free driving!The have cute patterns! ..yes who's looking at them? But it's nice to wear something cute during a not so sexy stage of life.Adjustable with 3 clasps. I'm down to the tightest on a small, but my bottles don't slip.Slits are easy to use, place the cones in!Cons: Runs a little big and stretches a tiny bit. Small size and I wear 34 C.Stretches over time.I recommend a good pumping bra regardless because it makes life so much easier and pumping less of a burden! Good luck!
