Very satisfied with this item. We purchased it in early June 2011.  It's easy to install and my 2.5 yr son kicks it like crazy and it's holding up great.  I chose this seat protector over the others because it has two shoe lace type ties at the bottom instead of a piece of elastic.We tried one with the elastic but it was really hard to put over the front seats in our Honda Odyssey van and once we did get it on it didn't cover the seat well nor stay in place well.  Plus the elastic bothers the person actually sitting in the seat.The adjustable top strap and shoe lace ties on this seat protector allow me to securely position the protector in place and provides coverage right where we need it. We bought another one for our Honda Civic as well and will buy more once our 6 month old starts kicking the other seat.
