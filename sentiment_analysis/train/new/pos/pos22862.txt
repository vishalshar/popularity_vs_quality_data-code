This monitor is definitly the best purchase we made! Being a first time parents we were constantly worried about everything! Especially when our baby was asleep. Yeah, we tried sleeping in the same room for a while, but around 3 months she started waking up every time we moved. So we purchased the monitor and set it up right on the side of the crib, so that we could see her face. You can hear every breath she takes and the video quality is great: when the lights are off, you can see as good as if it was daytime. We live in an appartment building, but there is hardly ever any interference. The baby is now 1 and half and we moved the camera in the corner of the room, so that you could see the whole crib. I can see her playing and it is so much fun watching her talk to her toys and laugh all by herself. I would recommend this product for every parent out there.
