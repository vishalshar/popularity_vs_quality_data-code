Was looking for something small and easy to take to a vacation , to pump my baby floats,and after reviewing all product, I've choose the electric one. I was shocked how little it was! That was a great surprise awesome compact size. I ended up not using it, cause didn't want to put my 4 month in the pool... Water wasn't looking right. I did test the pump, it was loud, but didn't care , cause it's going to do the work in half the time with out leaving you breathless if you try it yourself ! Can't wait to use it with other stuff, there are a few good selection of attachment .Good found!
