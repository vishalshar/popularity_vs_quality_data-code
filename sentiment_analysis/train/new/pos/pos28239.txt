We received this as a gift when our son was born two years ago, and it quickly became our go-to, every-night towel for bathtime. It's truly th perfect towel. It has two snaps to secure it around your neck quickly, and two apron ties to secure it around your waist if you want to, though I never do this. It's very long, I'm 5'9" and it goes past my knees. Because of this, it's extremly useful for a long time, in fact we still use it for our toddler who is just over two years old. I pick him up facing me and with one leg on either side of me, there's still plenty of length to bring the towel up his back and the hood onto his head.It's held up well over the years, no falling apart or thinning of the towel, and we do bathtime almost every night. The only thing that's gone wrong is that I broke one of the snaps being too hasty trying to unlatch it from my neck...as with most snaps, you should grab the fabric close to the snaps to pull them apart and I didn't at this time.We have a few hooded towels i.e. Potty Barn Kids and although those are cute, they are not nearly as useful or practical as this towel. We love it so much we've bought a second one for our second baby who is due soon, since we still use our original one for our toddler.Highly recommend.
