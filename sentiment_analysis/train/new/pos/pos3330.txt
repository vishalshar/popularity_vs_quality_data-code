We purchased this chair for our little Batman lover and was very pleased when it came in. The quality is excellent and it has such a cool look. We found the reclining version first and where hesitant to purchase it since the childrens recliners don't seem to last. But we where thrilled to find a simple chair version of this chair. My son loves it and will be able to grow with him for a long time to come. I would definitely recommend this chair for any little Batman or superhero lover!!!
