So I bought one of these calenders for my son 4 years ago at Babies R Us, and they stopped carring the calender, still have a memory book and frame, but no calender. And of course that's what I wanted. They don't even sell it on their website. So when I saw this one, I was soooo excited, because I really enjoyed this calender. It was perfect! Exactly the same as the one I already had (except for it's pink) and it's nice cause you can create your own monthly memories, by actually scrapbooking pics for each month. Thank you soo much, It was perfect!
