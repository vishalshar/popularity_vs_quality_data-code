I have the wonkiest stairway banister.  It doesn't line up, it sits a little uneven at the edge and all in all it isn't made for putting up a baby gate.  The problem is I have a baby, and steep stairs.  Well I was looking for a solution and these extenders are that solution.  I have a Regalo brand baby gate and while these extenders were not made for that gate, but we got them to work.  I just had to add my own washers and it worked fine.  Make sure you measure the inside part of your gate where the extender is going to screw into though because it is a super tight fit on my gate another tenth of a centimeter and there is no way they would have fit in.  Other than that they do what they are supposed to do.  They are about 4 inches long but they have to be screwed into the baby gate so really they don't extend the gate that much.  They are solid metal and have a little pad that in theory would protect the banister, mine is wrought iron so I think it is safe.  The pad is falling off though, look at my pictures for reference.  Overall this works, it didn't work perfectly we had to modify it.  Mostly due to my strange railing but I am happy because I found a way to get the baby gate to stay where it is supposed to be.
