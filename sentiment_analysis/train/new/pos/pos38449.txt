(UPDATE 9/19/13: I just bought a second one on Amazon for $9.99. I liked it enough to pay more for it than the first time around at $6.99, as I could no longer find it at that original price.)I bought the orange OXO Tot toothbrushing station on a whim when I saw it at T.J. Maxx for $6.99.To my pleasant surprise, this toothbrush holder keeps my preschooler's bathroom countertop tidier than I expected. Because of its shape, weight, and long rubber feet, it does not get knocked over nor does it slide around much. There is ample space for a toothpaste and toothbrushes, yet the product itself does not take up too much space. It's sized to fit inside most standard medicine cabinets.The holes for the toothpaste/toothbrush are cut into a material that feels like silicone. The little "fingers" are flexible and accommodates many different sizes.I like that it is top-rack dishwasher safe! It makes for very easy cleaning, as the top portion pops off like a lid. The product is BPA, PVC, and phthalate-free. Made in China.The diameter of the large toothpaste hole is about 2". The diameter of the small toothbrush holders is about 1-1/8". Mine is currently it is holding Kid's Crest toothpaste (Kid's Sesame Street Toothpaste Grape Flavor 4.2 Ounce(Pack of 12)) and GUM Crayola toothbrushes (GUM Crayola Children Toothbrush, Soft, 2-Pack). The GUM Crayola battery-powered toothbrush's handle is too big for it (G-U-M Power Toothbrush, Crayola)...you can force it in there, but it will not be easy to pull back out. It fits fine in the big toothpaste hole, but there's no place then for the toothpaste.A companion cup/cupholder, perhaps attached to this product, would be a nice-to-have...maybe a version that holds only 2 toothbrushes and has a cup holder on the other side?All in all, a nice product.
