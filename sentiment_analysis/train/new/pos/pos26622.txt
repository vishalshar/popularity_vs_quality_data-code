I was hesitant to order it because of the comments about the non slip strips in some other reviews I read. I have no problems at all with the strips, even on bare feet. I don't find them to be too rough at all. They work especially well with socks to prevent slipping.There are three angles available for the stool. It is not hard to adjust, but it isn't something that you can reach down and adjust while you are holding your baby.My new baby hasn't arrived yet, so I am using it while I rock my older child to sleep. It works great for that! I do wonder if I could have just used a cheap $10 stool and gotten the same result.It won't hold the weight of an adult, but my toddler likes to play with it when it's not in use, and it hold her weight just fine.My one complaint is with the instructions. The stool arrives in pieces and has to be put together. I found the instructions to be lacking. It took me a few tries because I put some of the pieces on backwards the first time. The instructions tell you which pieces go where, but not which way they need to face, and that does make a difference.
