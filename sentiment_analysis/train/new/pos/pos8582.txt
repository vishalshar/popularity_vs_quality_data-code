I LOVE this item. I got it because i live on Okinawa, Japan and its a tropical island and we have typhoon season where it rains ALL the time and the mold is REALLY bad because of the heat and humidity. I was told by a mother to get this because the car seats get molded and mildewy quick out here because of all the rain. I used it all the time during the season and it still is in great shape for next year. I say this is a must for any mom. I have the normal graco baby car seat that you see everywhere that goes onto a stroller and it fits perfectly. my daughter doesn't even really notice its there. I was afraid she would cry but it didn't faze her any. I also got the one for the full stroller, i would recommend getting that one as well for when you use the stroller.
