My husband bought me this pillow while pregnant with my first baby to help me sleep at night. It was fantastic! You can use the pillow in so many different positions. I would use it to help support my tummy, other nights I'd wrap it around my back if my back was achy..it turned many sleepless night into heaven.The point I'd really love to make, which I didn't see in too many reviews is this pillow is awesome AFTER the baby is born. I used this daily for breastfeeding with both of my children. It was incredibly comfortable for both mom and baby and snuggled them in just right. On top of that, both of my babies LOVED to nap on this pillow. The pillow sort of looks like two attached crescent moons (more or less)and if you place them together it makes a big circular pillow (again, more or less). Well we'd place the babies right smack in the middle and they'd fall asleep right away!This is a MUST HAVE for soon-to-be mommas. I still have my pillow almost 4 years later! My daughter, now 3-1/2, props it up and likes to read on it.It's simply the best. HIGHLY recommend!
