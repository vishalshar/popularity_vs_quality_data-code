Our son was getting rug burn on his knees from the carpet at his daycare.  I bought these in hopes of stopping that and padding his knees on our wood floor at home.  First off, they appear comfortable enough- he never messed with them or tried to get them off.  Secondly, they are adorable and we got lots of comments when we had him wear them out.  But, that said, they don't stay up very well.  I would constantly have to pull them back up to cover his knees at home.  Also, they don't wash super well.  After the first wash they didn't look nearly as cute.  And, as far as use on the wood floor:  they are not non-slip and my son would have issues with traction in these.  I still give them 4 stars because they work better than any other option we had for carpet and they really are adorable.
