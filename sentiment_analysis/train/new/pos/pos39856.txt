OXO never ceases to amaze me. A very creative company that solves a lot of problems with their clever products. Products can be on the pricy side, but they are worth it when they make your life easier. I'm a bit of a research nut and I always read reviews when purchasing products online. Some reviewers commented on things like spaghetti sauce stains the white plastic, you can't microwave the plate for long periods of time, the plate is heavy for only being made of plastic... Crack me up. Yes spaghetti sauce is going to stain just about any plastic, especially if it's white! You shouldn't have to microwave baby and toddler foods for long periods of time, and it's not good to microwave plastic anyways. And the comment about the weight, it's in the description that it's on the heavier side so that it doesn't fly off of your kids tray, or table. So it's unfortunate that people take points off for those things. I wouldn't pay $6.99 for a fancy ceramic plate. But I did pay that much for my one year old to learn how to become a more independent, and less frustrated eater. The curved sides is just pure genius. The silicon bottom to make the plate not slide around so easy, is also awesome! Thanks OXO for another great product! I have several! I highly reccomed this plate for little ones who are learning to scoop their food. And if anyone is looking for the perfect snack cup for their little one, I highly recommend the tot snack dish. I have a few :) similar design on a smaller scale, with a lid! Oh and one last shout out to OXO, THANK YOU for making frustration free packaging!
