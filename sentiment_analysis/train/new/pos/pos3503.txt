I recently discovered this placemat and wish I had bought it before. I keep it in the diaper bag for use when we are out at a restaurant. It has taken the stress out of feeding our son while we are out. He enjoys feeding himself and now we have a clean surface where he can eat bits of food off our plates. It's the perfect size and I love the tray at the bottom for catching food that misses his bib. The suction cups work well on most surfaces, but sometimes I will have to hold it in place for him so he doesn't pull it off the table if it doesn't stick. I don't mind doing these because of all the other positives of this placemat. It cleans off so easily just like the silicon bibs we use. I secure it with a rubber band and wash it when we get home. Love this placemat and wish I had found it before!
