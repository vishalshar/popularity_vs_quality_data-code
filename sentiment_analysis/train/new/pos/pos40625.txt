I love this humidifier.  First off, it's super cute it my son's nautical nursery.  Second, I love that there is no filters for this.  I've been using a Vick's humidifer that works great however, the filters make it expensive.  We now use this in our room which we don't use every night like we do for my son.  The humidifier needs to be cleaned monthly or every other month (we prefer monthly but could go longer).  The only downside is that you have to fill the water often.  We only run ours at night but by morning it's empty however, you can definetly tell that its doing its job as opposed to our Vick's.  Our Vick's one lasts through the night and a little longer but I am not sure it works as hard as this one.  I am very pleased with it and does its job for our purpose.  If you want a humidifier that lasts for more extended period of time than this isn't your humidifier.
