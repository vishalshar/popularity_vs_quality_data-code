I originally bought this wooden toy for my 1 year old little girl because we needed a new teething toy and it is just so cute!  Also, it is made by Haba (always a reliable company).  Now that we've had it a while, we love it for multiple reasons:- The tiny bell inside jingles, but it's just loud enough to hear if you are holding it --in other words, it's not at all annoying.- It's durable.  We've had it for about 4 months now and it still looks like new.  The paint has not chipped off despite my daughter's constant gnawing/gumming.- Non-toxic- The "sun beams" move around so she can twist them and pull on them.- When we put it on a hard surface, it spins around like a top would.  She thinks this is hilarious.- Highly entertaining (for my baby at least).  She will sit and play with it for 15-20 minutes at a time and she carries it all over the house.I'd recommend Sunni to anyone!
