I bought these for my Graco Secure Coverage monitor - Secure Coverage Digital Monitor - 1 Parent Unit.  I am unable to match up the "2791" or "2795" numbers to this monitor (even looked on the box it came in) but from the picture they looked identical to the original monitor batteries.  I installed these over a month ago and they work great (I have 2 monitors).  Monitors now hold a solid 8-hour charge, maybe longer.  Definitely, definitely worth the super-cheap price!
