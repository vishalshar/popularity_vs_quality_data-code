I have kept this shawl in my breastpump bag to use 3x a day while pumping at work. My office has windows on 2 walls, and throwing on the shawl and turning to a corner is much faster than repeatedly opening/closing the shades on multiple windows. The width and maneuverability of this shawl easily gives me the privacy I need. Wearing it with the opening in the front and wrapping the two sides around me like "wings" gives me privacy while enabling me to look down on the pumps with a clear, well-lit view when needed. In this way, it works much better for pumping than the traditional style nursing cover, which I constantly was adjusting to make sure I had full coverage and which was too dark underneath for me to monitor pumping progress. I also enjoy that it is very soft. (I have not worn this as a shawl or used it as a nursing cover so cannot comment on those aspects.)
