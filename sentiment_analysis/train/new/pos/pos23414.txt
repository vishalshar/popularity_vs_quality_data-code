Very happy with this purchase, the rail stay on bed very sturdy and provide full protection to my 6 months baby girl when she co-slepping with us.  This rail provide no gap between the rail and mattress, so the baby won't fall into the gap. I saw my girl was literally laying against the rail several times, but the rail stay intact and provide solid protection.We don't fold this down because this rail cannot 100% attach to the bed frame on side, maybe works better with crib.So happy to read other customer's review about this product and avoid trouble of buying some cheap product. The quality and design of this rail is worth the money you paid.
