My husband and I used this particular swing for 5 months for our daughter. We purposely wanted something gender neutral, which would work with any additional children. The pattern is very cute and the elephants that hang above are removable for baby to play with. This product, like most other swings, works on batteries only, so the longer and more often you use the swing, the faster you'll use batteries. We used the swing daily and replaced batteries once a month until our daughter was three months old. Then we had to replace them about twice a month as baby got heavier. There are two different height levels to set the swing, the infant insert is removable and the straps are adjustable. The product doesn't come fully assembled, but the instructions are very clear and it is easy to assemble. It only took me about 15 minutes. The seat can recline or sit further forward with a simple pull of a lever. Some reviews said the swing was noisy, but it's a very quiet clicking sound as it moves back and forth. I didn't find it annoying, nor was it loud. I would recommend this product and many other Graco items.
