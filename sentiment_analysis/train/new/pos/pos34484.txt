My 23 Month old daughter will NOT give up her bottle when drinking milk.  We have a cupboard full of insulated sippy cups but she only drinks milk out of her 8 oz. Dr. Brown wide neck bottles.  This 'snuggler' works great.  I didn't know if I would need the window, but it has come in handy.  I haven't washed it yet, but will soon.  It's very sturdy, double walled material.  I'm not sure for how long it will keep milk cold, but I think it's very safe to say that in a warm summer day it will help keep things cold for 30 minutes, if not much longer (just haven't had the time to really test it with thermometers, etc lol).  Piece of mind!
