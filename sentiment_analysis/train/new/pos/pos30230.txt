I purchase MANY different plush animals from companies such as Aurora, Douglas, Melissa & Doug, Yamiko, etc, for YEARS (Im hoarding them after my babies outgrow them for either any future grandchildren or to just keep myself, lol),  BUT this was my first Nat and Jules order along with their Chinese Crested!! I was a bit nervous reading some of the reviews. This bulldog just HAD to match my eldest two childrens' bulldogs for my youngest. But oh my god is it just absolutely ADORABLE!! This puppy looks as real as it gets (im crazy picky) and is VERY well made. It is nothing like the 'bad reviews' commented. It was EXACTLY everything i wanted, heck, 'I' want to sleep with it, lol. Between the Crested and the Bulldog outdoing my expectations, I will most certainly be adding Nat and Jules to my list and buying more for many years to come!!
