My 3 year old has been using this for more than a year taking lunch with her going to day care. It's still good as new. The lid is tight (if someone is not used to it, the teacher at day care had trouble closing it). We've never washed it in dish washer mostly because every day meal don't fill up the dish washer enough to run it everyday, but the lunch box needs to be washed for next day. I bought the boon trunk style first at babies r us, loved it so much (which they don't make anymore and out of stock at babies r us), found it on amazon, I bought two of the two styles each, in case they no longer make them in the future. My younger baby (now just 1) would use it too when she gets older to go to day care. I did extensive search for the kids' lunch box, this box is the best I found. I was actually surprised of the lack of this style of bento box on the market.  The teachers at school say my daughter always have the best lunch, with a variety of food. I love how the box is compartmentalized and the size of it!
