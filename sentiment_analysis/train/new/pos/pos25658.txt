I can not believe we still use this tiny but mighty blender. We have a Cusineart food processor and also a Black and Decker mixer. Yet since we had our twin girls, this small food processor was our right hand for making baby food and we now occasionally use it for lightweight stuff. Bare in mind it is not for heavy duty mixing but it is great if you have a lot of small mixing/blending ticket items. As far as durability, we have used it for the past four years initially quiet heavily and now occasionally and it still runs with no problem. Your great company if you want to prepare baby food. Happy grinding ...
