I absolutely love these and am so glad we found them!  My husband was hesitant to try cloth diapering and was always so afraid of poking the baby with the diaper pins.  I ordered them with our first son and though we've lost a few in the line of duty, I still have one of my original ones.  I just ordered another set now that we have a new baby.  They are a life saver if you're doing the old-fashioned cloth diapers (you don't need them with the newer generation cloth diapers that have a liner and then an outer wrap like the bum genius/smarties/etc.  They're just fantastic for those middle of the night diaper changes when you're compltetly exhausted and can barely see straight, much less safely use diaper pins without poking yourself, the baby, or somehow managing to pin the sleeper to the diaper in the process.  I've only used them on cotton diapers so don't know how they would work on other materials.  These make changing the diaper SO much faster too, since it takes maybe 3 or 4 seconds to completely secure the diaper.  I'm pretty frugal and don't usually try all the new gadgets, but these are worth their weight in gold!  I can't recommend them highly enough!
