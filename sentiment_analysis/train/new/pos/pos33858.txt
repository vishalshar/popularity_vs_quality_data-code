So far so good it's a decent value even though some of the items seem a bit poorly made. The locks are old school and do there job but the door nob covers are difficult to install and remove and don't work with my particular door nobs. The small plastic piece on the end of each is also very flimsy and already broke on one of the two that comes in this set. Everything else is pretty much as advertised and works as it should. You can't put a price on the safety of your kids so I ordered this and as much other stuff as I could find to child proof my home. I would still recommend this product despite a few flaws due to its functionality and relatively good price point.
