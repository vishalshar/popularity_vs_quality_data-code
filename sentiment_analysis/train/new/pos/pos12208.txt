We've always loved the UPPAbaby MESA and how convenient it is with the 2015 UPPAbaby Cruz. It latches on without needing any other attachments. The only downside is the weight of this carrier. We haven't used it yet, but it's pretty heavy and I can't even imagine what it feels like with a baby inside. That's the only downside though! Everything else is awesome! I like how you don't need to thread the belts for adjustments and how easy it fits into the base. I guess another downside could be the cost of the base, but you get what you pay for.
