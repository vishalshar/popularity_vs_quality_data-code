These bibs work great for milk-necks. I had some years ago with my first daughter and she was a messy eater! They wrap snug for the first few months and have a thick towel like fabric. The best bibs for breastfeeding and great for messy babies.I bought more for my new baby and love using them.Shipped right away, happy with my purchase.
