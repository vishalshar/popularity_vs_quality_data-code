Purchased this changer/chest based on looks and future functionality. We are very satisfied with it as a changing table for our twins. We agree that it was a bear to assemble due to poor instructions and mislabeled parts. The new Dad is very handy with tools and has hand-built furniture in the past, so this says a lot about how poorly the instructions are laid out and described. We suggest taking your time or having someone handy with assembling furniture to help you out. Overall, though, we are pleased with the product. Also, note it comes with a pad for the changing area--thin but functional. The changing area will not fit the standard contoured changing pad inserts (the kind with the straps) out there. So, we just use an extra receiving blanket on top of the included changing pad to absorb any messes.
