I bought this out of sheer desperation in spite of some of the negative reviews. Our family was taking an 8-hour road trip with a 2+ month old and I needed to warm the bottle. I was bracing for the worst and instead found that it was highly reliable. I made sure I gave ample time to warm up, as suggested by some reviewers. My child took to the warmed milk/bottle with no fuss.
