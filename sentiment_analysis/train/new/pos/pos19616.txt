This is the absolute gold standard in nursery gliders.  I am a large man at 6'2" and a shade over 3 bills who has used this chair vigorously for over a month in pure comfortable bliss.  I purchased this chair for my wife who recently had our first child about a month sooner than necessary so I could properly put it through its paces.  The thought of buying a glider for almost $700 and then the matching ottoman for another $200 seemed like a massive waste of money.  I tried every furniture store in town and couldn't find anything that was comfortable and seemed like it would last so I took the prime plunge.Upon arrival the quality of construction was evident.  This is actual wood with a lovely finish and it was very easy to assemble.  The sealed mechanism is dead quiet even with a man of my size gliding at full pace.  it reclines comfortably with a locking bar that just be engaged on each side of the chair.  My wife recently had our child and has been using this chair non-stop for feedings and naps in between.  We decided to move it into the living room so that everyone who holds the baby could relax as well.  Having the nursing pillows attached is very convenient as they act as extra support whilst comforting the child.  At the seats narrowest point it is still about 22inces wide and well padded.  This chair is comfortable for anyone from an ex football player to my mother in law who is 5'2" and 120lbs.  If you are expecting a bundle of joy and can afford the splurge...just do it.
