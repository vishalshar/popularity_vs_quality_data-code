Very useful for helping my 3 y/o daughter's pants fit!  She is very tall but very thin, so I often have to choose between pants that fit her lengthwise that are always drooping, or pants that fit her waist that end up on her calfs.  With dapper snappers I can buy pants that fit her lengthwise without having to readjust them throughout the day.  She has no problems pulling the pants up or down when she uses the bathroom.  Definitely worth the money!
