This mattress was delivered fast and free from Amazon. My toddler granddaughter sleeps great on it. If she were here visiting all the time I would have considered something more firm. It is soft and comfortable. It is not a hard or very firm mattress. If you are looking for something very firm, this is not it. It fits nice and tight in the crib so no worries there. I would purchase it again. I am very pleased with the quality and the price was great!!
