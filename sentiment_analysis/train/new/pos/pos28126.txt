I disagree with the previous complaints about quality. I was very happy with the quality of the blanket and really everything for that matter. I think it is clear that the bibs, pillowcases, etc. aren't really the highest quality. I didn't really plan on using them though. We bought my first son's set from WalMart and it was more expensive than this one, and much worse quality. However, it did do the job just fine for the two years he used it. I have not washed this yet or even put it on the bed, so I will update if there are problems from that point. Otherwise I am very satisfied with this set! I like the colors a lot more in person too. Great price for what you get!
