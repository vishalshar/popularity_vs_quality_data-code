We have a number of these in different colors.  The plastic is much harder than an Ikea one we had and threw out.  The rubber hasn't flaked or deteriorated after years of use, and both the top surface and the rubber on the feet are as skid proof as you can reasonably expect without it actually being adhesive.I wouldn't put much stock in the reviews that say this tips easily and should have a broader base.  Obviously there is a tradeoff with respect to the "footprint" and height of the stool, and if you want to make something entirely tip proof, it'll be either extremely low and not useful, or take up a lot of floor area, or be bolted to the floor.  This stool strikes a good balance.  It is great for kids with normal coordination skills ages 3 and up and can be used by younger kids too with supervision.  But it's from Amazon, not Hogwarts, so don't expect it to magically keep your toddler from ever falling.
