I love these. I do not have an abundant supply and work hard to make sure I pump enough while I am at work (I work 12 hour days so have to pump 3x a day).  I have found pumping at work so uncomfortable that I was really considering just quitting. I had tried every size of the medela personal fit shields and the pumpin pals (which are better, but not as good as these).  Before I returned my rental pump, I decided to pay $70 for these based on old reviews (I can't believe Medela has discontinued them and we have to pay such a mark-up for the few remaining sets!). In any case, I am really glad I did.  These are comfortable and there is no painful rubbing or irritation. I feel like I can pump faster and my output is better. It is a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a breastshield, but its cheaper than formula!  I also really feel like I might be able to do this for a full year now and that, in itself, is worth $70 any day.
