I bought this seat to fit in a narrow seat space (squeezing in with 2 other carseats across the backseat).  It is 17.5" wide at base--so a key selling point which met our needs.  The raised arm rests make it easy for my daughter to find and reach her buckle (clarification: the arm rests do not rotate up, by raised, I just mean a space between the seat and the arm).  [We also installed a 3" buckle extender which helps her with buckling herself since the seats are squished together--it fits with this seat--another selling point, since it did not fit our other booster seat.]  The height adjustment is very simple with the release lever easily accessible for parent, located at the top center--important if using for multiple children/carpooling.  This seat is lightweight and was easy to assemble out of the box.  There is not much padding in the seat for child's tush, but for around town it is not an issue; if you were driving long distances, I might consider doing something about that.  I also recommend protecting your vehicle seat from the underside--I noticed a small indent in our seat after using it for just a few days.
