I've had this for 2 years now and am writing a review now because I just busted it out to make some more stuff. It's not just for baby food. When I received it as a gift from my mom, I was ecstatic and immediately destroyed my kitchen making all kinds of baby food. You quickly learn the tips and tricks: Don't overfill. Don't pull the pusher back out before you unscrew the filler tank, you'll suck all the food back up into it. Don't try to force a chunk that wasn't blended all the way into it, it will leak out of the side. It's very easy to use, easy to wash, easy to store. I LOVE IT!!! Now that my daughter is 2+, I use it to make yogurt pouches (what I was going today). I throw my yogurt in a food processor with a variety of fruits, blend well, fill using the squeeze station, and VOILA!! I have yogurt pouches that are good in the fridge/freezer without having to buy the ones from the store with god only knows what preservatives in it. I actually cleaned out my freezer recently and had some pouches of baby food in there from 1+ years ago. The food may not have still been good, but the pouches hold up amazingly well! Extremely sturdy, easy to close, easy to open, and easy for my daughter to eat from. Wonderful product!! I really don't have anything bad to say about this squeeze station.
