Not as flexible as the Wubbanub, but my son was able to hold onto this Pacimal pretty easily.  I wish the animal faced him vs me, but that's okay. It's much more weighted than the Wubbanub so it stays in place a lot easier if my son is holding it; however if I'm trying to rock him it's harder to keep in place, whereas the Wubbanub I can kind of prop against my chest.
