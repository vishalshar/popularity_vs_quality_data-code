Love that it doesn't shut off. Love that it has battery option (even though short lived). Some sounds are pretty annoying but you can switch right off of those. TIP-If after first use (and power was always plugged in ) you can simply push the power button again and it remembers the last sound you had so you don't have to click through the sounds to find your favorite. If you unplug, it will forget the sound, but you just scroll again to find it. Also, the power button is lit up. I covered the power light with some tape to keep room as dark as possible.
