This diaper bag isn't fancy, but it stands up to the wear and tear of daily use. I've bought more expensive back pack diaper bags that were much more "cute" and feminine looking (Timi and Leslie)  that were twice the price at least, and they fell apart after about 6 months. My husband likes that this is a diaper bag that isn't too girlie, it holds a lot (we have a 3 year old and it holds her potty training wardrobe changes) as well as snacks, water bottle, diapers and wipes, etc. Good value for the price. Oh, and most importantly, this bag doesn't get in the way (fall down, fall off shoulder) when chasing your toddler or holding your baby because of the back pack design. Definitely frees up your hands and arms to wrangle your rascals better.
