I don't honestly understand how people can be without this tool. I would have no idea what my daughter was doing if I didn't have this. I know some people worry about safety...I talked to a safety person when I had my car seat installed and they said as long as the mirror was (a) well-attached and (b) contained no glass, it'd be fine. The attaching well was easy - there's a velcro part and a strap that you can attach to one of those rings in the back of the seat. We have two priuses, and attached the mirror differently in each car (in one car the car seat base is in the middle, in the other the base is on the passenger side), but in both cases we were unable to pull off the mirror despite tugging and testing. We just get to see the cutest baby in the world any time we look in the rear-view.
