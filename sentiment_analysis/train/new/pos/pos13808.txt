This mat is attractive and colorful without being overpowering ... bright enough to stimulate my baby, but not blindingly so.  And it's 2-3 times larger than your average tummy-time mat or infant play mat.  Very useful when you have a mobile infant/toddler who's liable to roll, crawl or cruise off the smaller mats.  This mat has lots of little features to keep my little-one interested.  The "flower" in the middle plays a cheerful melody when pressed (great for teaching cause-and-effect), and the animal ears and "little bee" are all made of crinkly paper that grabs her attention.  There are also a few rings (for pulling, etc.) and a couple of teethers.  You really do get a lot for the price.  The mat has enough padding to provide sufficient protection from most falls, bumps, etc., when on our carpeted floor.  However, it probably won't provide sufficient cushion if placed on a tile, marble or hardwood floor.All in all, a solid mat and good value for money.
