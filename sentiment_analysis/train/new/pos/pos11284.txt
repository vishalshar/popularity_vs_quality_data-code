I purchased these because I am making the switch from disposable wipes to cloth wipes. I researched tons of different cloth wipes and I decided to go with these. I am so glad I did! When they arrived, they were larger than I thought they would be and they were extremely soft. They are very thin, though, and I was worried about quality and how long they would last. I have had them for quite a while now and they are still just as durable after many washes. They did shrink after I put them through the dryer the first time, but I like them at a smaller size anyway. I also love that I only need one wipe for even the biggest of blowouts, whereas I would use 2 or 3 of the disposables. I highly recommend these!
