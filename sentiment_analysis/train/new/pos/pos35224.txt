Like other commenters have said, it's nice to get a noise-making toy that's not super loud! My son couldn't figure out how to open the flip phone at first, but once I showed him a few times, he caught on and enjoys this a lot. The light-up lights and sounds keep him engaged, and I like that each number says its name for educational purposes. The mirror is very fun for him, too, and this is a nice sturdy toy so I don't worry when he bangs it around. All in all, a great toy!
