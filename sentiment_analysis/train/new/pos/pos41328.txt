Most of the existing reviews on these screen protectors seem to be talking about either the video monitor itself or something else so I wanted to add one just for the actual product (Summer Infant 02000/02004 Baby Touch Screen Protectors with Chamois).  This is a standard thin plastic screen protector just like what you can get for your cell phone (okay maybe slightly thicker than most of those).  I really cannot see how it does anything to protect the glass from cracking during a fall.  I believe it is meant to 'protect' from scratches and fingerprints rather than physical trauma that can crack the screen.  I rated it 5 stars because it is a perfectly fine screen protector, I just wanted to clarify for potential buyers that it is not going to stop the screen from cracking if your kid throws it against a rock.I purchased the screen protector after my monitor had already suffered a fall and the screen was cracked.  The touchscreen still functioned and the crack was in the corner so I added this screen protector and continued to use it for a long time which saved me a few hundred bucks.  I really do not believe that having the screen protector on would have stopped the original crack from happening, but it did a great job of preventing the glass from coming apart after it was cracked and extended the life of an otherwise broken screen.
