We got this little walker not to teach our daughter to walk (because that's not what they do) but to let her stand up and move around in the house with us and to help strengthen her little legs other than bouncing. One thing I noticed on the "post safety craze" is that all of these walkers are built the same. It doesn't matter if they're $20 or $200 they all have the same boring design; Caster wheels on only the front, little stopper brake pads all around and back wheels that you have to use a pry-bar to move. This really takes all the fun out of walkers for children.It might sound crazy, but the little walker my sister-in-law had, was a lot more functional and more fun for our daughter than any of these new walkers. Sure, you have to watch your child like a hawk, and keep her away from stairs, yadda', yadda', yadda' but who are the parents who don't and made all the rest of us stuck with these things? Tip: Yes may sound stupid, but I removed the "brake" or friction springs from the rear wheels so my little 8 mo. old daughter could actually move in this thing. Otherwise, she could barely push backward with all of her might. Generally it is built well, it's cute, the music is blasting an annoying, and the little strobe flashy lights might give someone a seizure; but it's a baby walker :)
