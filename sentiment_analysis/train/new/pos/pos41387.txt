GMD Workhorses weren't quite cutting it overnight for my 3.5 mo anymore and I'd read so many good things about these diapers that I decided to give them a try.... A week in, I LOVE THIS DIAPER!It's SO SOFT. I seriously wish I had one for myself...it is that soft. It's not bulky at all, especially for an overnight diaper.My son is on the large side for his age at ~16 lbs. We are still able to fold down the diaper for the "newborn" setting but probably not for too much longer. I do wish they had another set of snaps in between that rise because the full rise is a bit much right now. This diaper comes with a long and short insert. Right now we just use the long insert. In the morning, the front of his diaper is pretty wet but his bum is still dry. The diaper is plenty roomy/stretchy if we need to add more inserts down the line. These diapers contain EBF very well, no leaks, but they do tend to hold onto stains after washing a little more than my prefolds do. It can be hard to get the stains out around the legs on the elastics but they do come out easily if I am able to get the sun on them at the right angle. I've also noticed that when drying after washing, the area around the elastics take forever to dry. The rest of the diaper will be dry except for those areas. The elastics themselves are very good and stretchy, I feel they will last a long time.Overall this is a great overnight diaper. Anybody looking for a super soft, absorbant yet trim diaper should consider getting some of these!
