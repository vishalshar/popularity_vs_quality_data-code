My 6 year old Seeker has an oral fixation and when she gets overstimulated, upset, scared, tired, etc she needs to suck and chew. Recently the victims of her chewing and sucking have been her fingers, pencils, shirt collars/sleeves, barbie legs/arms, and anything else remotely chewy that she can get in her mouth. I never knew that there were these awesome things called Chewies/Chewelry until another SPD parent suggested them. So I went in search and found the Dr.Blooms Chewables. I decided to give it a shot. When I ordered I was expecting Child Sized. That is NOT the case. These are actually meant to be worn by parents for teething babies and toddlers. The bracelet is too big for even me to wear and the Gem is HUGE. The Gem is almost 1/2in thick, from where the cord is to the bottom of the Gem it is 2-1/4in long, and from side to side at the widest part it is 2in wide. It is too large to fit in a childs mouth, but they can still chew on it. I bought the Hexagon shape, but I think a long rectangle one would be much better. The bracelet is too large for a child to wear, but if you do what we did and put it on some cord, it can be worn as a necklace for easy chewing.The necklace gem goes everywhere with her. She is always wearing it and it has been a huge hit with her for her chewing needs. I highly recommend this for Seekers with a chewing need.
