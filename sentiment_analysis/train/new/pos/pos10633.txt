Pros: Multiple motion patternsCan personalize musicCons: expensiveBabies preference varies, but all will likeDisplay light can be bright in dark roomI bought this in a frenzy to find ANYTHING to get my baby to sleep or nap better. It's a great concept and design. It had several motion patterns to help rock baby to sleep. It also comes with different ambient sounds to help baby sleep. If you want music instead, you can hook up your mp3 player and personalize you're own music. I haven't owned any other swings so I can't compare speed or motion patterns.Did this work for me? Not really. My baby fell asleep twice in a two month period. The rest of the time he didn't want to be contained in here. He didn't like being strapped in anything. I can't blame the product, only personal preference of the baby. I meant to send the swing back but didn't. Four months later I decided to bring the swing out of storage and guess what? Baby likes it now! Imagine that! He loves to fight sleep and I put him in the swing when he gets cranky. He'll stay calm and sometimes get a nice nap. It's but a magic sleep aid, but it helps keep him calm when he's cranky. It also helps him stay sleep when he falls asleep in my arms and I don't want to put him in crib.If you're thinking about purchasing this I would recommend getting from a chain store like Target, Wal-Mart or Babies Are Us so you can easily return if baby doesn't like it. If you do get stuck with the product try again later, baby might like it in a few months.
