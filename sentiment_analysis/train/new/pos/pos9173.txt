So far, I have bought four My Friend Emily dolls over five years, for every girl baby to come into my personal circle. (The boy babies get  other Lamaze animals. I wish Lamaze made a boy figure, too.) She is just the best first dolly. The ring will attach to a carrier. Her face is great for first focus, her colors are bright and various. Her clothes crinkle, which is one of the first sounds that one can tell a baby is intrigued by. She does not weight much, but is a size that is big enough to hold early and for a long time, as a cuddle friend. She will survive cleaning. In the event she gets lost or destroyed, she is easy to replace for the same reasonable money she cost in the first place. Emily will not lead a gift giver astray. Lots of toy figures will join the collection, but she will always be the first dolly, with a lot of charm and engagement.
