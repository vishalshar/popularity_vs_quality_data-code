From the day she was born, my daughter was the messiest baby when she drank her bottles, it would run down both sides of her mouth. On a whim, I bought one of these bottles from my local grocery store and she didn't spill a drop! These are also great in helping my daughter hold her own bottle. She can grip the sides easily. My husband loves them because there are only 4 pieces per bottle to wash, not 5 like the others we had. I bought these on amazon because it was the best price. Would have been five stars if I could have chosen the colors. I received 4 pink and 5 blue. Would have liked some green.
