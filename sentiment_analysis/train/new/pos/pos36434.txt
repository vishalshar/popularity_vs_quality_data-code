This is nice to take somewhere, but I get annoyed by the strap to close it with, since while changing, it is either under the baby being bumpy or the strap is getting caught up in the diaper while you change.  I am not sure how this could be made better, because when you travel, it is nice to roll it up.  So, it's just my opinion.
