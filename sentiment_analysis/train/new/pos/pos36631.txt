When this bag came in the mail, my first thought was that it was way too large. It was my own fault for not reading the dimensions correctly. However, after having used the bag for over two months now, I absolutely love it. I use it as my purse and diaper bag. For the price, it's pretty durable. I've caught the bag on corners and fully expected to find a rip. But the bag has held up well. The material doesn't stain very easily which I also like.It would have been nice to have more partitions inside since the bag is so large. However, I just learned to put my stuff in smaller bags within the bag and that works well for me. The bag has plenty of smaller pockets on the outside. There are two open side pockets, a pocket in the back that has a Velcro latch, and a larger zippered pocket in the front. The larger front pocket also has a mesh compartment in it. There are no pockets on the inside of the main bag, but there are straps where you can put bottles. The bag also comes with a changing pad and a wipes holder. All in all, it's a very nice item and I'm pleased with the quality and design.
