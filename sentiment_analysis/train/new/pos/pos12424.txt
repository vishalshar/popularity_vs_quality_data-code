I have been using a plastic covered wire basket in my dishwasher for years.  Unfortunately, the plastic tends to tear in the wash and the exposed metal then becomes rusted.  After burying my third dishwasher basket, I set out in search of a basket that wouldn't rust.  I thought it was a bit odd that the only dishwasher baskets that came up via a search on Amazon were in the "baby" section but I was not dissuaded.I purchased the "Toddler" size basket and it lives in my dishwasher.  It is longer, but thinner, than the wire baskets that I've had in the past but I like this size better--I can fit a wider variety of things in it which makes cleaning up after myself that much easier.What goes into the basket: small "Tupperware" lids, small plastic measuring cups, plastic measuring spoons, sport bottle tops, travel mug lids, teeny-tiny bowls, shot glasses, small spatulas, cat food lids, canning jar gaskets.  And the list goes on.  There is something in the basket every time I run the dishwasher because there is always something small that needs to be washed.What does a dishwasher basket do: it keeps small dishwasher safe items from being blown around during the wash cycle, saving them from the wrath of the heating element as well as possible breakage for the small glass/porcelain items.  This basket does a fine job.  Everything gets shiny clean and nothing gets damaged--a true win.  The only "con" is that, because of the width of the basket and lids, pet food lids need to be placed carefully to keep them from getting stuck between the side rungs.
