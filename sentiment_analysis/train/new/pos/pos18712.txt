I would give this 6 stars if it were an option!  We have had one of these since my 4 year old was born and recently bought this one as baby shower gift.  It has 2 volume settings (and an off), 2 different scenes to project on the ceiling (one more simple for younger and one more complex for older) and the choice between classical music and ocean sounds.  It plays for 20 minutes and then shuts itself off.We used this in the nursery when he was a baby as background lighting when we had to get him in the middle of the night, so it wasn't as bright as turning on the overhead lights.  Eventually we started turning it on with music when he goes to sleep and to this day, 4 years later, it still works (and it's taken some hard hits) and he still uses 'star' nightly.  Sometimes the kids play with it during the daytime too, or in the evening we will turn out the lights and shut a door then shine it and look at the ceiling laying on the floor.Such a good quality and good concept.
