Pros:  food catcher, perfect size for toddler portions, dishwasher safe, BPA freeCons: the food catcher can be used as a handle to throw the bowlReview:The concept is brilliant. When a toddler is still mastering the use of a fork and spoon food often spills on the way from the bowl to her mouth.  The idea of something `catching' that is wonderful.This bowl may look a little funny but it does exactly what it sets out to do- it catches food that doesn't make it into your child's mouth en route from the bowl to her mouth.When I first used this with my daughter she saw the `catcher' portion as a handle in which to throw the bowl.  I had to swap out the bowl the first two times. The catcher was a distraction as well since it juts out toward the child.  However, after using it a few times she got used to it being there and we now use it a few times a week with no trouble at all.  It has caught globs of oatmeal and is my favorite bowl to use when feeding my daughter cold cereal.I wash this bowl in the dishwasher after each use and have had no problems with it warping or not suctioning.Overall, I think it is a good addition to your child's tableware.[...]
