This bag is great.  It's super sturdy material, the zippers are heavy duty, the handles are all reinforced and the wheels are big and stable.  If you are going to check your stroller on an airplane this is the bag for you.  However, I'm going to gate check my stroller while traveling alone with baby and I don't think this bag is going to work for me.  The issue is that the bag won't fold up to smaller than about 15" x 18" x 4".  That isn't very big in the scheme of things, but it's not small enough that I can fit in my under stroller net and I can't carry it along with me, baby and the rest of his gear.  The bottom of the bag has a plastic reinforced panel that extends from the wheels to the bottom of the bag and up the back of it for about 12".  That panel limits how small the bag can be folded up.  I'm going to return this bag and get the next one down that doesn't have wheels so I can fold it up smaller.  Overall, I love the quality of this bag and if I was checking the bag or didn't need to use my stroller in the airport this would be the perfect bag.  Instead I'm opting for the next size down and hoping I can fold it up small enough to fit it in the under the stroller net.
