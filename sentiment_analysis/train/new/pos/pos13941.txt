I was a little nervous about buying sheets online, I like to feel them first and have had bad experiences with bedding online. To my surprise, the sheets look the same as in the pictures. They are adorable and perfect for a Cars lover. They are so soft and the colors are very bright. They feel like they have already been threw the washer ten times. I love them. Now I just need to see if the same maker had any of these in Toy Story!
