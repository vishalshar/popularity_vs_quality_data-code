It is a classic stacking train toy, yet I would not have bought it if I had to inspect it closely at a brick-and-mortar store. The constuction is okay, BUT the toy is made from "normal" wood, which chipped even before we got it. There are splinter opportunities in every block! Babies and yonger toddlers like to taste everything so the parts of this toy ultimately went into my toddler's mouth (we got it for her 1 year birthday). I am giving a 4-star rating because she somehow managed not to get any splinters in the past 4 months. Other than the material used, it is a nice toy: it encourages creativity (stack it as you see fit) and shape/pattern/color learning. The wooden rods onto which the blocks are stacked may present a hazard for younger children since they don't move out of the way when pressure is applied (as some other wooden toys that we own do).
