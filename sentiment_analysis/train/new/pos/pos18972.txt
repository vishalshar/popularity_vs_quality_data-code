I gave this product a shot despite the fact that it was not rated, but the item did not work straight out of the box.  I'm returning it.  If I decide to give the sellers/manufacturers the benefit of the doubt and buy another (maybe I just got a lemon?), I'll update this review.  One star for the cute factor...It looks like the classic rubber ducky and is approximately the same size.  However, for now, I cannot recommend this thermometer.**UPDATE: As I reached for this ducky to pack up and return, I accidentally dropped it on our tile floor and it turned on!  So I tested it in a sink full of water and it seemed to work well.  The next day at bath time, I placed it in the tub and it did not work.  I got in touch with my inner-Fonzerelli, banged it against the side of the tub, and voila...we had a working thermometer again.  I've used this now for several baths with seemingly accurate temperature readings.  Sometimes it works as stated (turns on automatically with gentle movement in water), but most of the time I have to bang it against the side of the tub.  I would imagine all the blows to the head cannot be good for the little guy, so I'll update with the status of his functioning and let you know how long he lasts.***UPDATE II: Ducky worked for just over one year, which was good enough for us.  We bought a second one for Grandma's house that has worked without any of the above mentioned problems, so I've upgraded my three-star rating to a four.Pros:-Seemingly accurate readings-Display is easy to read-CuteCons-Not easily turned on-Ducky constantly flips over like a canoe so you always have to turn it over to read the temp.
