I have both the My Breast Friend Twin and this nursing pillow. Both have pros and cons.I really like that this one doesn't have a bulky back strap like the Breast Friend. My babies' feet get stuck in the Breast Friend strap. However, I hate how cheap and small the plastic fastener is for this pillow. For the price, I would expect a better quality fastener.This pillow is a lot less sturdier than My Breast Friend. You really have to make sure you surround yourself with pillows in case your babies fall off (thankfully that has never happened but it has come close..).All in all this is a solid nursing pillow and is good for long term use. I think this one is easier to use when your babies are older, and the Breast Friend is better while your babies are little because of the issue where the feet get stuck when they get bigger.
