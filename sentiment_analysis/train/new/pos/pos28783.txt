We cloth diaper our daughter, who is six months old. She started getting diaper rashes when your teeth started coming in and I was looking for a cloth diaper safe natural diaper cream to use on her. I read tons of reviews on CJ's products and decided to give them a try! I am so glad I did, they are effective, easy to use, and smell terrific. When I was looking at the numerous cents available I stumbled on monkey farts, and thought I would give it a try. I really didn't know what I was getting into since none of yours had a good description that I had read of what the scent is like. It smells a lot like runts candy to me. Very kind of tropical candy-ish without being sickly sweet. The only reason I took off one star, is that I really wish this Mr. was able to actually make it even met so I didn't have to rub it into. It kind of squirts out in a way that is uneven, and any of the smooth it out over the skin. It was even Mist I would be beyond thrilled. either way, this product is a winner. I will definitely be repurchasing with my bottle is gone, although I am anxious to try other scents as well.
