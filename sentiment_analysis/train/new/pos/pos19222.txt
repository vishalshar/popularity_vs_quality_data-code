I love French whisks for making sauces and gravies on the stove, but my old favorite was beginning to get flakey -- the chrome coating was flaking off the underlying metal. So I replaced it with this 18/8 stainless steel whisk RSVP Endurace Spring Whisk, 9-1/4-Inch.Wow, what an improvement over my previous whisk!  The weight and balance are great.  The whisk just feels "right" in my hand.  But I especially like the spring part of this whisk: Not only does it do its job better than my old whisk, but here's the best feature, in my opinion:  The sharp little end in the middle of the flat, spiral base is actually turned upward and inward, so it won't scratch the bottom of our cookware as we're using the whisk!Maybe the engineer who designed this whisk for RSVP actually is a cook who uses French spring whisks!  Great job, RSVP!
