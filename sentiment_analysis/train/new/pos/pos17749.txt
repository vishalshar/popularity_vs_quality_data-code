LOVE this bag. I have five kids and have had many bags. I bought this as I needed to downsize. This is my main bag now and I tend to over pack a little for "just in case" although I've gotten better at not over packing too too much but hey you never know what you might need! LOL! I can fit a small container of formula, 5 onesies, 10 diapers (currently size 2), two blankets, wipes, 3pacifiers, 2 burp clothes, band aids, neosporin, lotion a comb, two bottles (Playtex wide), two pairs of 2T short 2 size 2T-3T pull-ups . I love how stretchy the pockets are so you know the items are snug and wont fall out or move around if your bag gets tossed around a little...ahem like mine does..hey five kids!. I have also from time to time tossed my wallet and phone in one of the the back pockets and know it wont fall out since the pockets stretch snug around them. I also really like how the top and side zip all the way down for the changing pad and how the pad is removable AND it has that netting to keep everything else in place when the side it down. This has come in handy on so many occasions already with my youngest (2.5mths)!The ONLY downfall I have about this is like others have commented is the straps squeak. Yea its a little annoying and all of my friends and family have commented on it but I really like this bag. After reading some other comments I think I'll try some methods to fix the squeak but squeaking does not effect the efficiency of this bag and I've actually just gotten use to the squeak! I'm super glad I bought it.
