There aren't many options out there for installing baby gates on staircases with spindle railings.  We were able to make this work at the top of our staircase.  My husband had to modify it a little to work, but we feel confident that it is going to withstand a few years of torture from our little one.  When you are installing, take it easy...it is plastic after all.  That's why I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5.  Quality is good.  For something so important as a baby gate at the top of a set of stairs, I'd like the quality to be just a little better.  But like I said - I think it will work - so far so good.
