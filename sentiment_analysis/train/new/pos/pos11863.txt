After looking at all the bassinets out there (which is SO overwhelming) I decided to go with this one. I loved this one the most, but it was the most expensive. I was going to get the Halo, but the bulky heavy legs really turned me off. I love that the Babybjorn is so light and the see through mesh is wonderful! It can also rock, which I really love. I wanted something safe and attractive and this cradle is both of those. I bought the canopy that goes with this and I am so happy that I did. Another bonus is that when you are done with the cradle it folds down very small so storing it for next baby will be super easy!If you are not a prime member then I suggest signing up for the 30 day trial and buy this cradle for 10% off. That is what I did and it make me feel better spending the money for it.
