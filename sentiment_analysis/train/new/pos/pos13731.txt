I bought the baby bjorn bibs first, and honestly, I hate them! They are so harsh on my baby's neck!This OXO bibs are fantastic!!- the part that tie on the baby's neck is made of washable fabric, kind of a parachute cloth, with Velcro making it very easy to adjust.- The fabric is gentle on my baby's neck.- you can roll it up and take it with you. Very practical.- the collecting basket is made of soft silicone, very comfortable as she leans over the table.- machine washable Bib- great quality- nice vibrant colors, love the pink!I highly recommend this Bib. For four months I've been washing it daily and it still feels like new. Buy it!!
