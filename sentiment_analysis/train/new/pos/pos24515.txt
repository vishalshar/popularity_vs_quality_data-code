This design is great for a boy or girl.  I was looking for something with browns, baby blues and greens in it and a design/theme that wasn't too busy looking.  This is the perfect set.  It has 6 pieces to it (I found the same set being advertised through several different companies with only 4 pieces to the set and these companies were asking for a lot more!).  What the description doesn't say is how soft it is.  The comforter almost feels velvety it's so soft - perfect for a baby!  The bumper is reversible so you can choose to have the brown side with polka dots facing in or out or the side with the cute jungle animals.  Also, the bumper comes in 4 pieces which makes it easier to tie to the crib.  Added bonus was the diaper stacker and valance with I had planned to buy anyway, so the 6 piece set saved me $$.  This set works great with any color crib and there are enough colors to pick from in the set to create a beautiful baby room.Would I buy it again?  Absolutely!!
