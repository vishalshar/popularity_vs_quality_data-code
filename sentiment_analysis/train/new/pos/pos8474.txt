Our 3 year old loves his blankie and pillow and refuses to sleep without them.  We bought this in the hopes that he can nap away from home without a fuss and it worked.  He'll lay down with this thing just about anywhere and take a nap.  Heck, he'll even grab it sometimes while we're at home and say that he's ready for a nap.  It's pretty thin and there's not much cushion, so it can't be too comfortable if laying on a hard surface, but it doesn't bother our little one.
