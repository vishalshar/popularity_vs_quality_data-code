I received my bongo bag on time and packaged properly. When I opened it up the pattern looked really cute and I really liked the fact that it has two tabs that if you lift them it pops right up, yet you can always re-attach the tabs and its easily stored or out of the way. Its nice quality and I love how it looks! I am really happy with my purchase.
