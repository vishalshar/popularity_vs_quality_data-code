After having borrowed one of these from our lactation consultant for the first two months, we came to realize we had to get one. My wife liked the firework design and so that's what we have. Before this purchase my wife was really falling behind, but now with both hands relatively free, she is earning all kinds of achievements in Ruzzle and  updating her status with the latest photos of our twin boys without fear of dropping a child. Seriously though, the pillow is a lifesaver. When both boys need to eat and so does my wife, this is the only way to do it safely and comfortably.My only complaint with the firework design pillow is that it is not the nice, soft, plush covering that the other designs have. All in all, happy wife, happy life.... and she loves this pillow!
