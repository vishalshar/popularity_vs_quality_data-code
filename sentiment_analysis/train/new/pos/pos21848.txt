This musical toy is available from different sellers for a ridiculously wide variance in prices BUT this is my all-time favorite toy (OK, it was just delivered today).  I am the mother of three kids and I have three grandsons.  They may never get their hands on this BUT I have had more fun than the law allows.  Each instrument has its little place, identified by geometric shape.  When it is chosen by the user, er, little kid to play, it is moved to the orchestra "pit" and adds its unique and fairly realistic sound to the "symphony".  The particular song is selected by pushing the play button until you get to your favorite. It also plays "row, row, row your boat" and the alphabet song.  There is volume control (thank you) and tempo control and a demo option.  Just when you think you've found all of the buzzes and whistles, you find a door on the back that slides up and reveals storage space for all of the instruments.  I'm in heaven!
