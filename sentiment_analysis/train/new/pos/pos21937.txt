I will review these links giving information on reasons why I wanted this item, delivery time, pros and cons, and whether I would recommend this to a friend and why/not.Reasons why I wanted this itemI purchased these stroller links not to attach two umbrella strollers, but to attach a spinner carry on luggage to my stroller. I had to travel overseas by myself and my 1 year-old-baby girl and I wanted something to help me carry my carry on.Delivery timeThey arrived super fast, within their time frame or faster.ProsThese links saved my life. I only used two (the box comes with three links) and the connection was sturdy and perfect for what I needed them to do. Please see the pictures so that you get an idea of how I connected them. I am pretty sure they will connect two umbrella strollers. I am very satisfied with their performance.Cons:If the floor is not flat, they tend to disconnect. So make sure they are really tight. But again, for airport floors (that are really flat) these little guys worked like a charm. Maybe If I had used the three links this wouldn't have happened. But you need to consider that you have to disconnect them to go through security so I wanted something that I could easily connect and disconnect.I will definitely use these links for future trips with or without the hubs.
