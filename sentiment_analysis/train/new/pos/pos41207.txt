We're weaning our one-year-old off of bottles, and have been trying out a ton of sippy cups in the process. We love this one. The soft spout is a nice transition away from the bottle, so our daughter will actually drink from it, as opposed to some of the harder spouts. Two minor things: 1) Aometimes she sucks really hard and makes the spout pucker and not connect properly with the lid, so it leaks. 2) It would be nice if it had handles.
