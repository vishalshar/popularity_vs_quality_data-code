This nursery set is beautiful and includes just about everything. It doesn't include a bumper pad, but bumpers are not recommended due to the increased risk of SIDS, so I'm not worried about it. The price on Amazon was much more reasonable than the local baby store. My only complaint is that the valance that came with it had some minor orange staining on it, but I just purchased a replacement from my local department store. I don't think the staining is related to the product itself, but to the specific set that I received. Overall, I'm very happy with this lovely nursery for our new little princess.
