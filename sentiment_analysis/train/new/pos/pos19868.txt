If you don't need an auto-close gate, this does well. And it's the only tension-mount gate with a low threshold. (Alternately, to a conventional tension-mount gate, you could add the clunky Tee-Zed Dreambaby No-Trip Gate Ramp.)If you absolutely need a no-threshold (hardware-mount) gate, there is only one that auto-closes: the Richell Expandable Walk-Thru Pet Gate. However, it only auto-closes when the door is less than 45', so in practice you'll often be closing it by hand. And, unlike virtually every other gate out there, the Richell is one-way.Hard-to-open fix: When used as a pet gate, you can remove the child-proof tabs: just disassemble the handle and pull out the tabs. Then it can be opened with a knee or even a foot.If anyone has a mod to add an auto-closer to a child gate, please let me know.
