Got this for our 2 week old daughter. So far we are very pleased with it. We own alot of Bright Starts items and love the quality. This uses 4 c batteries. Has a timer for 15-30-45 minutes if you want to use this feature. We usually just leave it on without using the timer. Very easy to put together. Does not seem to go through batteries alot. We give this 5/5 stars you will be pleased.
