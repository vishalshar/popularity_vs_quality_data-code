Out of all the covers for the wall sockets, I love this one the most! My daughter can't get them off, and I still can without using the thing I'm trying to plug in to pry it off the wall! I haven't used the door latches yet, but there are plenty of them as well and I will be using them once my daughter gets a little older. And the door handle covers I didn't really like. My daughter isn't tall enough to grab the doorknob yet. I tried one out for two weeks just to try it for myself and it was really difficult to use. I feel like my doorknobs might be smaller than normal as I had a hard time grabbing the doorknob through the holes of the cover thing in order to open the door. Overall though, I did like how little it cost to get a big amount of items!
