I reviewed a bunch of these suction cup toys before deciding on this one. Most reviews had a comment about suction but this one seemed to be good overall. It isn't bad but I have to re-stick it a few times during each meal to my sons high chair tray. Looking past the suction though, he simply loves this toy. Since the day it arrived, he's been willing to sit and watch it as long as you are willing to spin it. Now that he's starting to spin it on his own, I'm sure it will live on for a long time. Its good quality also, definitely well made compared to similar items.
