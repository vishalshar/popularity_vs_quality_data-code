I love my maya wrap, and my 10 week old son loves it too!It was a little tricky at first to learn how to use it, so I watched the DVD several times and practiced using it several times but now that I know how to use it it's so easy.I'm still a little unsure about how I feel about the length of it though. I'm 5'3 and I weigh 120lbs so I bought size medium. I love how the fabric flows down, it looks pretty, and I feel safe knowing their is plenty of fabric to keep my son nice and safe In it, and I can adjust it and continue using it for a long time while my son grows, however I don't like how the pocket falls right at my knee. It's really difficult to vacuum or do simple chores while wearing it because the length is very distracting and does get in the way, and when I reach down to try to grab my cell phone or keys out of the pocket I have to reach and dig way down for it. Oh well. It's not the end of the world. :)
