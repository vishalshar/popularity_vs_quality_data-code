i use it for my old fridge, when i close it too hard, the door will bounce back and will leave it open until somebody find it. so i got this product on amazon, i ordered it. now i'm glad that i bought. the blue round spot is the part that you can open it up or down, and it has the hinge, so you can flip it open and close by clicking it. it's very easy to use, not complicated, and i really love this product.
