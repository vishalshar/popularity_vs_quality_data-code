We've been using this for nearly 2 years with a Walmart Baby Mod Olivia crib, and we've been really happy. It fits, it has a good safe firmness without feeling hard, and our toddler has slept very happily on this without ever getting limbs stuck.We're having our second baby, and probably going to get a second crib and mattress, and while I think we might go with a different crib, I'm hoping to buy this same mattress again.
