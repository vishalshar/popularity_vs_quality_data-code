We have been using 2 of these seats for 2 years and still LOVE it.  Our daughter is now 2 1/2 and has used it since she was 6 months old.  It has been great for all of these stages.  We will be moving her to a bigger seat and passing this on to her brother in a couple of months.  The seat is very easy to use...install, adjust restraints, etc.  Only complaint is that it is a bulky seat, but not unbearable to move around.
