Spill Spoiler caps are so clever, yet so simple.  I use them to keep my little one’s Pediasure in the bottle when he ‘accidentally’ knocks it over.  Cleanup is easy, I just toss them into the dishwasher when he’s done with the bottle.  And there’s no special straw to clean, just throw it away.  I grab an extra straw when we’re at a restaurant and it works great.  It doesn’t matter whether it’s a skinny straw or a fat one, no leaks!  For those reviewers who complain they don’t fit juice bottles, read the info on the page.  It says very clearly they fit baby bottles, there’s a picture showing what they fit, and the description says if you’re looking for a cap that fits sports drinks and juice bottles to get the Spill Spoiler Sport.  Seems pretty clear to me.  I have the Sport ones too, and they also work great!
