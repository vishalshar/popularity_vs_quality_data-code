Very happy with this set!  I was worried with some of the reviews, but it couldn't be more adorable.  The colors are vibrant and very true to the pictures.  So much for the $, and it is not cheaply made!  The sheet is a little rough, but softened nicely after washing it and using fabric softener.  I have several sheets I purchased to coordinate with the set, so I am not concerned with the stiffness of the sheet.  The wall hangings are adorable and the nursery is darling with all the coordinated pieces and adorable little safari animals everywhere!
