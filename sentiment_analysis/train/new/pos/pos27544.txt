I have a 14month old and have tried a bunch of different types of sippy cups.  But after buying different brands and types I got very frustrated with them leaking or my baby not able to get the liquid out.  So I tried these and am very glad I did.Pros: - These sippy cups are cheap and you get 7, not just 1or2 as most sippy cup packs give you - The lid snaps on tight, so my toddler cannot take the lid off, or not yet at least - the bright colors are very playful and get her attention - For me the 7 ounces is perfect for a meal time drink, not so big that it is hard to hold and she won't finish it, but not to small that she doesn't get enough fluids either. - Comes with a cover to keep the spout clean while traveling - If you tip this upside down it will NOT leak.  But if your baby pounds the spout on the table small drips will come out.  But this is the least amount of spill out of all the sippy cups I have triedCons: - This set comes with 7 cups, but only one of the covers.  I would have liked to have had a few more at least. - They won't last forever, my babies sharp front teeth will eventually make there way into the spout and peel off some of the plastic.  But it took her about 6-8 months before she did this on her first set.  The price makes it worth replacing them.Update:My daughter is now 18 months old and has basically a full mouth of teeth, molars and all.  She is still using the same cups we bought when she was 14months.  But they are on the edge of being bitten through.  Once they have been bitten down a bit, they do tend to leak a bit more if banged just right.  Despite this, they are still my favorite and my go to for a cup any time.  All the other sippy cups I have bought have issues or she doesn't like them.  She is wanting to sip straight from a cup without a lid more and more, so I am figuring I will not need to replace these.
