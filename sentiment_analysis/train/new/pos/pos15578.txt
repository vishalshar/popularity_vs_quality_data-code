These are great for protecting corners so much so that you can hit the corner with your hand moderately hard and it won't hurt.  Some of the reviewers give low stars because these can be taken off relatively easily by toddlers but that's not always the case.Make sure to clean the surface very well and usually a finished, smooth surface is the best at holding.  If possible use the tape on both the top and side surfaces of the corner to help the guard adhere.  Smooth painted surfaces don't adhere the tape very well but still they don't come off that easily either.I've used the straight ones on smooth, painted window sills and yes my 14 month old will start to pull it off or will bite them if left alone.  But who leaves a 14 month old alone for long to do whatever he pleases?  And what is the alternative to protect him while still letting him have some freedom to move around?  My suggestion is the same for everything else that he touches but shouldn't - I tell him no and then distract him with something else or some other activity.My son so far has taken no interest to the corner pieces but only the straight pieces we have on the wall corner and window sills in his playroom.  The straight pieces we have on his dresser and changing table saved his head once and his behind once - without them he would have hit the edges hard.Recommended but you have to keep your child away from them when they take an interest.  I have the same problem with door stops we use to keep him from closing doors and with cabinet locks.  It's just 'par for the course' for a baby who likes to bite carpet daily.  I realize there is no way to 100% baby proof anything because the baby-proofers are not always baby-proof!
