I registered for this set as well as the accessories and it is even more lovely in my house than it was in the store!  The bumper is well made and has bright colors without being too busy and my son loves to look at it.  The rest of the pieces are also well made and nice-looking.  The quilt is gorgeous!  There is enough variety in the pattern that it doesn't look the same coming and going.  My nursery furniture is white and this set looks great with the white furniture.  I love this set and the pattern - it is perfect for a little boy!
