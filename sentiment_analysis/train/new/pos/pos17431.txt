When our 5mo son started sitting without support and reaching for everything we ate, but still didn't have the swallowing reflex, we got him those to lick and chew and get used to different flavors while he worked out the rest.Pros:- sensible colors (buying from Amazon.com, this actually mattered to us - whenever we try buying anything where "colors may vary", we seem to get a lot of pink in the mix!)- white feeder mesh (never felt comfortable about colored ones going in his mouth)- removable feeder mesh (much easier to soak and clean)- safety closure (there's a knack to opening it - one hand presses both clasps while the other twists off the top - but apart from the practice it takes, it's great that the baby cannot open it, and that it's so well integrated into the top it won't scratch or break off)- feeder cover (great on the go)- simple design (this is not a toy, and I really like that it's not covered in cartoons or molded into difficult to clean patterns)Cons:- the hem inside the mesh tends to trap bits of food- the cooling compartment can leakI've never had any trouble cleaning the mesh, however. I just wash it immediately after use with soap and really hot water, and if there's any food trapped, I use the bottle brush and it all comes out. That said, we've only used the feeder for sweet potato and banana, and other foods could be more tricky to clean.
