I was skeptical that these "stickers" would hold up to the constant freezing, thawing, heating, cooling, washing and handling- but they have performed flawlessly and I highly recommend them as an easy/inexpensive way to label your infant or toddlers belongings.  We send our 10-mo old son to daycare each day with two bottles, two small tupperware containers for solids, a sippy cup, a spoon and sometimes a baggie with a banana or puffs.  I've labeled all of these items with these stickers and sent all of these items through the dishwasher, microwave, fridge and freezer multiple times.  NOT ONE LABEL HAS PEELED OR FADED.  Honestly, I'm amazed at how well they've stayed on!  They aren't made of paper (although they feel like they are.I haven't used them for fabrics based on the previous comments, but if you're looking for an easy and inexpensive way to label your kids' plastic or metal items, this is your solution, hands down.
