I've been using this stroller for several years now, and have very few complaints about it. The wheels are more durable than the ones you usually get on a lightweight stroller, so the stroller "off-roads" a bit better (on gravel, etc.). The basket underneath is small but at least you can get (smaller) things into it, which is usually a problem with the smaller strollers. I can even squeeze in my diaper bag in there if it isnt packed too full. The sun cover on the top has some issues: I am not sure if it was bent to begin with or if it just has a strange design, but when it is fully down, it is directly in front of the child's face. The cover has two parts, and you can fold down one or both, which is a feature I liked because it offered more sun protection. However, I've just stopped using the bottom portion because my daughter has to have it right in her face if it is down (as I said, it seems bent, and I cannot manipulate it to take a better shape). I have also never been able to figure out how to secure the stroller when it is folded (there is a latch but seemingly nowhere to latch it), so I often struggle to get it around when it is folded. Otherwise, I find this to be a great stroller: lightweight and easy to fit into the trunk of a smaller car, and fairly durable.
