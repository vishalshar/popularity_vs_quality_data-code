After reading other reviews, I expected to have to do some modifications to make these work for my 2 year old. (But for the price, was still glad to do it.) Truth is, some snap together solidly and I struggle to take them apart and others accidentally start to snap apart when I grip them too tightly. I bought a bunch for my house and put the ones that are definitely not going anywhere on knobs she's determined to open and the others I put on doors she cares less about. I figured once she realized which doors had the strong bonds and which had the weak, I'd be modifying. I still may be headed there, but so far, one month into putting them on all our doors, no super glue has been needed. I've been pleasantly surprised.
