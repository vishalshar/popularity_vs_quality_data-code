We ordered the DaVinci Emily Changing Table in white along with the coordinating crib.  Couldn't be happier with this table - it's sturdy, easy to assemble and is the perfect size for our room.  Plus it has a drawer underneath the top base - what a great spot to hide the little items like thermometers, etc.  Don't think many changing tables offered this as an option.  The only thing I would point out is that the shelves and interior of the drawer are particle board - they still seem perfectly fine and sturdy, but it you're looking for a solid wood piece... this isn't it.  Would highly recommend this product.
