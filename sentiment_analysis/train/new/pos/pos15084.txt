I am very afraid of using public changing stations for changing my toddlerâ€™s diapers as they are not frequently sanitized and am not a fan of reusable mats either. I bought this one for our chicago trip and used it thoroughly.Pros:Good quality and easy to useNot bulky like the reusable matsConsThe size is a bit small but is passable.
