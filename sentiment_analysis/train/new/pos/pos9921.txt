I'd recommend this product. I'd buy it again & my "pro's" far outweigh my "cons". I've only had this for about a month. If any further review posting is necessary I'll do so. :)PRO's:-Great camera- the turn radius is amazing & moves quickly... As does my child!-The lullabies are nice & my child goes right back to sleep when I turn it on if he wakes up.-The battery life is OUTSTANDING! (I did buy the monitor dock and additional camera, though I don't know that I'll ever need the extra one.)-Customer service was EXCELLENT! I had to make an exchange, while that was annoying, they made the process effortless & speedy. (See below)CON'S:-The cord to both the camera & the monitor are too short & very heavy/bulky. I put the camera on a shelf in my child's room, opposite his bed (a little over half way up the wall- 10 foot ceilings) & I had to use an extension cord. Never an issue with other similar products I've  used. The weight of the cord can sometimes pull the monitor as it sits upright in the stand. It has never fallen off the table because our outlet is close, but any pull & it could be an issue.-The instructions could have included more detail.  Some things are pretty self explanatory, but I need to pair my monitor with an additional camera- no instructions on that. The photos below shows the only instructions given. When you hit the home button a row of icons pops up. The instructions tell you what each icon is for & some explain what they are for, but it said nothing about HOW to pair your monitor with an additional camera. That would have been helpful.-A few days after my purchase I noticed the monitor antenna looked odd. Sure enough it wasn't glued together properly and within days it broke completely. I returned it & stated I wanted a replacement. I received an email the same day apologizing for the problem and ensuring me a new one was on the way. That was WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE because I didn't have to be without a camera & monitor.
