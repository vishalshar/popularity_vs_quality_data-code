UPDATE: Since these ties are now being die-cut I have changed my rating to 5 stars!I bought these as a shower gift and I love the design, the only downside is that they are uncut. I spent the time cutting them individually and re-packaging them in a mesh gift bag. Being a new parent the last thing you want to do when you are trying to snap a quick monthly photo is to have to carefully cut the sticker out first.
