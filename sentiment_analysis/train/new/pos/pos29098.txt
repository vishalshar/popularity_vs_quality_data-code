Both me and my daughter like this backpack.  I don't get to backpack much so I do have a little back/shoulder soreness if I use the pack for long periods.  I have had other packs that also caused soreness so I think it just comes with the territory if you're not a constant backpacker.  The pack was easy to get on and off with my daughter in it - I can get it on while it is sitting on the ground.  I love the adjustments for baby on this pack and there is ample room to where baby is not smushed up against the back of my head.  I read other reviews where people were not able to get the stabilizer bar open/closed while the pack was on and I found this to be no problem at all - you just reach behind your back and pop it closed or open.
