This is a really cute teether and I love that its made from safe products. I've put it through the dishwasher many times with no problems. My baby isn't super interested in it yet, but he isn't super interested in any toys yet so we'll see. I'm happy with it and feel like it is exactly as advertised and worth the money. I went on to purchase more from Green Sprouts and have been happy with everything I've purchased from this company.
