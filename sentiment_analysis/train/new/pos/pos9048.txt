Our boy largely refused to pee in his potty. He would wake up dry overnight and then proceed to sit on his potty for 45 minutes while we patiently read him book after book. Then he'd stand up and promptly pee on the floor.Turns out he didn't like to pee sitting down.The first day we set this thing up, he immediately peed standing up, "just like Daddy." It also helped him transition to peeing into a big toilet while standing in front of it on a step stool. (This is MUCH cleaner than trying to get a little boy to sit on a public toilet.)Why I love this:My son was able to be completely potty independent at a very young age. He would wake up in the night, or early in the morning, go to the bathroom, and could easily manage pulling down his pants and taking care of his own business, never even waking us. Glorious. Climbing up on a step stool by himself was impossible at that age, as he would insist on pulling down his pants first, which then made him trip all over himself trying to climb up. All I could envision was him taking a head first dive from a step stool into the toilet in the middle of the night. No thanks. This urinal is awesome.Is it a pain to clean?It depends. We cloth diaper, so we already had a diaper sprayer attached to the toilet. So it was super easy to just dump and rinse. (Pro tip: teach your kid NOT to try to dump this himself...)Quality:We used the clip that attaches the urinal to the toilet bowl, and it held up well for the six months we used this until our son was tall enough to pee straight into the toilet. We never hung it on a wall using the wall attachment.(This and the Tip Pee Toe Step Stool and Carrying Case, Black were potty training life savers.
