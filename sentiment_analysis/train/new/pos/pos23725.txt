My kids have loved these bottles whenever I've needed them.  I breastfed both my kids, but occasionally found the need for a bottle.  We tried different kinds, but this worked the best for us.  I attribute their enjoyment of the bottle to the nipple, rather than just this bottle.  I did find a bottle at a baby superstore that fit the liners and the nipples.  We have a few of those as well and they work just as well.In general, I like these bottles because the inserts make them so easy for me to clean.  I just drop-in the clean liner and I don't have to worry about any old milk residue/build up on the inside of the bottle.  It's clean every time.  I will continue to use this bottle now that my youngest has been weaned but still drinks formula.
