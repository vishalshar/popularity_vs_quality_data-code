We needed a travel stroller for a recent trip to Paris.  We were there for eight days.  This stroller was folded and unfolded a couple of dozen times per day as we went into the metro.  It went up and down small flights of stairs, over curbs and was definately put to the cobblestone test.  It was exactly what we needed and performed very well.  It was easy and fast to fold up and the carrying strap made it very easy to carry.  The taller handles kept us from walking bent over like we do with our cheap umbrella stroller.  Our son ate most of his meals in it and seemed comfortable all day wherever we went.  The only problem I had was that I am about 5'2" and with it on my shoulder it would sometimes hit my feet as I went down stairs.  A taller person would have no problem and it really wasn't a big problem for me either.  The wind barrier worked fine.  We didn't need it for rain so we didn't see how it worked in those conditions, but for wind it worked well.I would definately recommend this stroller.  Happy travels!
