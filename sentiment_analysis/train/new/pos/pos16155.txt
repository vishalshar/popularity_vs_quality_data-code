The growth chart itself is beautiful. The colors are great and I love that you can put pictures in the little slots. This was a gift for my niece's first birthday and they loved it. I gave one less star because the strings holding the 3 wood pieces together were pulled very tight so when we pulled it out of the package it was very difficult to keep it straight on the wall. We had to loosen the strings which was quite the pain while also keeping with the right measurements on the chart. The packaging that the chart was wrapped it looked awful as well. It looked like the item had been returned and the plastic it came in was torn and cracked. We had to take it out of the plastic box before giving it as a gift otherwise it would have looked quite bad.
