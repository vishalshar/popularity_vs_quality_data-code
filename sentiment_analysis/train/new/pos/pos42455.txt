I bought this for my almost 6mo old when I found her pulling on the characters that hung from her mobile..Clearly, she had outgrown it; but she needed some crib toys to replace it. I like this toy because when Mamma needs to hit the baby snooze button--this is it...I press the face, music starts, she remembers that she has this and another toy in the crib and occupies herself for at least 10min-sometimes she falls back to sleep within the 5min of music it plays. At 4-1/2mo my daughter was pressing the button(attached to crib)to turn on her mobile by herself. Only bumber with this is she can press the face but not turn it on. You have to press firmly, right between the eyes. It's OK because she really loves the ends lighting up and of course she has tasted all of the colorful arms many times over--I know they stimulate her brain too* It would've been nice if there was some sort of volume control on the music(soothing-but same one over & over). I would say-worth it for the price--ideally would've bought it for her when she was younger-at 7mo she just looks at it for a minute-I turn the music on,which she likes-and then it becomes background music for her as she plays with other things.
