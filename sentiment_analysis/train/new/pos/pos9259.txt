Been looking for side shades for months now and these are perfect. I've tried the cling on, the stretchy ones, the scroll ones and nothing has worked to my liking. These are high enough, wide enough and I can still see through them at night. I even managed to squeeze them in the back row window, just change the direction of the suction cup to tighten it up. Love, love, love these :)
