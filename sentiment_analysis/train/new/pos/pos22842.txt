Just got these in and on the wall, and they are adorable!  The elephants are big enough that it covers the wall above the crib, and there are plenty of hearts.  I didn't even use all of them, but it's nice to have extras.  Also, the pink is nice and bright.  The elephants were a little tricky to apply, but it ended up looking great.  Overall I am very happy with this.
