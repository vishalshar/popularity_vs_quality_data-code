This is my 9-month-old's favorite toy. He always goes for this one first. It has held his interest for a few months now. It probably has the least "bells-and-whistles" of any toy he has, but he loves it.  I'm actually pretty relieved that he prefers this to some of the plastic stuff that's out there.I like that it's magnetic and doesn't have the peg coming up from the middle like most of these stacking toys do - it seems to make it easier for him to stack and then knock down, which he loves doing. The little bear on top makes it really cute. I try to keep his toys accessible for him since he is not quite walking yet and having cute toys like this to display makes me not mind the extra clutter so much.
