I have used Kushies Ultra AIO for a while now and loved them until I ran out of Kushies Diaper Liners and decided to save the shipping fee by going to BRU and getting the only liners they had on the shelf - not Kushies.  Now I am using these worthless things only to save the staining of the diapers.  Why are they worthless?  They are NOT flushable.  So I have to rinse them out, and either try and wring out the liners in the toilet or drag them dripping across the bathroom to the trashcan.  DISGUSTING.  This is such a pain, I am starting to hate the diapers.  Needless to say, I ordered a three pack of the liners tonight.  Clean and easy, pull the liner out, flush it and you're done.  Saves the diaper and my sanity.
