Love this monitor and so happy I signed up to get it as soon as Amazon had it for sale. It is amazing. Nice big LCD, very sensitive- I can hear everything, crystal clear sound and image including night vision, easy to set up, very adjustable, etc. The pan and zoom are awesome. Skype works great too. My only complaint would be that it was not made clear before buying that this is only PC compatible - not Mac friendly. Doesn't matter if you only plan to use it as a monitor, but if you want to link it to your computer and use Skype, etc. then you have to have a PC. We have both but are a Mac preferred home. We still kept the monitor because it is so nice in spite of not being Mac friendly.
