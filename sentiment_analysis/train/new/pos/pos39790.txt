This is great! It has the wipes container that is shown, and an interior zipper pocket that you can squeeze maybe 4-5 diapers (max) in. An an exterior pocket that is pretty useless, but maybe a peice of paper? I don't know. The diaper mat is acutally integrated into it, so it unfolds with the changing pad attached to the diaper pocket and wipes pocket, but you can unzip the diaper mat and detach it as shown. If I'm just going grocery shopping or somewhere local, I just bring this instead of the whole diaper bag fiasco. It wipes down easily, too!
