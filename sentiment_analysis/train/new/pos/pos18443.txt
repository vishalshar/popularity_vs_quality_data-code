I purchased replacement tubing on the advice of a lactation consultant. I had a Medela Freestyle from my first child, and recently had my second. The LC recommended getting new tubing because I used my previous pump for a year. I wanted a cheaper alternative to the Medela tubing, and the Maymom set was it. It works great, fast shipping, and good price. Would definitely recommend.
