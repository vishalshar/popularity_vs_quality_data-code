As pumps go, it's great-discreet, double-sided and effective.  My complaint was that, at my workplace, I had no privacy for either pumping (hello bathroom!) or storage.  Also, the parts to be cleaned take time that I started resenting because I felt like it was better spent with my baby than with the sterilizer.  If you're set on pumping and it's easy for you, then this would be a great machine.  If not, or if you feel overwhelmed by the time spent pumping, cleaning an packing, don't do it.If you only pump occasionally, then a manual pump is much easier to pack, use and sterilize.
