I have three daughters and we've gone through a lot of car seat toys. I actually did some research for my youngest daughter to make sure we had something that she would be able to use on her own.  She's five months.  I wanted something that made the vibration when you pulled on it which this one does. I also like that the ring used to pull it down is large enough for her to grasp. A lot of other vibrating baby toys have just a string to pull and she doesn't have the motor skills for that yet.  I also love that it crinkles since that's her favorite type of toy, and that it has different textures.  The only thing I would like better is if it had a mirror on it somewhere.  Otherwise, best one we've tried!
