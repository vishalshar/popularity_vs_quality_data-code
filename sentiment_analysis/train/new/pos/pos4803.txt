This pump works great for occasional use and after 5 months, I still have not encountered any problems with the suction that some reviewers have mentioned.  (The instruction book explains how to clean the motor in the event of suction loss, so hopefully that problem is avoidable.)  However, beware that the motor is very loud -- I definitely wouldn't recommend taking this one to work or anywhere else that you would need to be discreet.  (When I use it, I sit in the bathroom with the fan on so that my family doesn't have to hear it!)  I also recommend buying the micro-steam bags by Medela so you can just throw the parts in the microwave and clean them right away each time you use them.
