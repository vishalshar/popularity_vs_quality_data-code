I bought the Maxi Cosi as a secondary seat for my husbands vehicle.  I already had a Britax Marathon which I was pretty pleased with.  I ended up putting the Maxi Cosi in my car and am using the Britax as the secondary seat because I liked the MC so much.  I have a VERY difficult car baby on my hands.  At 15 months he has NEVER fallen asleep in the car - even as a tiny baby he would wail whenever we were in the car for more than 15 minutes.  I have had the MC for three weeks and he has fallen asleep in it twice now on the 10 minute trip from the grocery store.  The recline feature is my favorite and whenever I see him start to look drowsy I lay him back and off to dreamland he goes!  It is such a relief to know we could do a longer trip now and he is comfortable enough to sleep.  The only negative thing about the seat so far is that the buckle is very difficult to depress.  I sometimes have to try multiple times or use both hands to push it hard enough to get it to let go.  Although,  with the Britax my son had also unbuckled himself a few times so while it is a pain to try to unlatch this one it might be better than having one that is so easy.
