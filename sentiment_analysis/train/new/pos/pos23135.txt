While these are now sold as "cereal" nipples, they were orginally sold as "variable flow" nipples.  I do not use them for cereal.  When my first started taking too long to finish a bottle with a slow flow nipple, I switched to these.  They are great and do not leak milk (contast drip) like the other flows.  Baby has to suck to get milk and can control the flow by how hard/fast they suck.  I now use these with my 3 month old who was getting spoiled by the easy/constant flow of the slow flow nipples.  She would get frustrated when breastfeeding.  I switched to these and so far we have not had any issues switching between breast and bottle.
