I love my ergo options carrier! We were using a baby bjorn before we got it and I couldn't carry my son very far after he reached about 15lbs or so because there was so much weight focused on my shoulders. With the ergo there is better weight distribution, so a lot of baby's weight is on your hips which feels much more natural. My son really liked to be facing forward in the bjorn so he could see everything so I was worried that he wouldn't like the ergo since there's no option to face out, but he's gotten used to it and seems to be fine just looking to the side now that he has better neck control. I am excited about the option to use it as a backpack later on too!The options is a good choice because you can mix up the look of it; I've already gotten several compliments on mine from friends who have plain colored ergos :)Also, I LOVE that it has zipper pockets! It's such a simple addition but it makes a huge difference to be able to have my keys and phone right there where I need them since it's hard to get to your pants pockets with that big waist strap while you're wearing it.
