I've been looking around to get a foam pad for my 4 month old son. This is just perfect. The size is great, the colors are awesome, easy to build, and toxic free (which for me, was the selling point.) Note that on the box is say that the recommended age is 10M+, but on the amazon website it says birth and up. I personally think that it's great for tummy time no matter what age the baby is, allow the baby to learn how tol roll without the concern that s/he would bang their head on a hard surface. I would def. recommend this to everyone.
