I became tired of trying to remove stains from my child's cloth bibs.  Not to mentioned dealing with mold and mildew appearing on bibs that weren't laundered right away!  I bought two of these bibs and I will never have to be another bib unless I lose both!  They are very flexible, so they will accommodate your child eating at various high chairs, whether at home or at a restaurant.  My child is 11 months old and we still attach the bib on the smallest setting, so there is plenty of life left in these bibs as my baby gets older.  The cleanup is a cinch.  Just wipe it down with a washcloth or baby wipe.  When there are especially messy meals, I will put the bib in the the sink and handwash it.  Of course, because it is a rubbery material, this bib will attract tomato sauce and some staining will occur.  I've found that a little vegetable oil gets the stains out if they bother you.  I love this bib design and the pocket at the bottom of the bib encourages my child to try feeding himself again and again when he drops his food.  It keeps a lot of bites from falling on the floor!  This is one of those items that I love so much, I'd buy for family and friends who are expecting a baby.  Great product!
