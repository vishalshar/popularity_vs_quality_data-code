Love the bibs...large and waterproof...however...Connie is not a baby...she is a tiny 35 year old disabled woman and, after all this time caring for her, this review speaks volumes!!!  This is Connie taking a siesta which usually involves some drooling to her left side due to her scoliosis!!!  Obviously, feeding, along with feeding rags is "covered"!!!
