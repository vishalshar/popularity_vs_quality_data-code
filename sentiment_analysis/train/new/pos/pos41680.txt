This is a birthday gift for my grandmother, she likes owls. These are small, but that's perfectly fine as she doesn't use much salt or pepper! They are really cute but I should note that they don't say the 'owl always love you' slogan on the box like the Amazon product page title says.If you use a lot of salt and pepper (or the person/people who are receiving this as a gift do) don't get these unless if you just want them for the cute collectible thing factor. If you don't use much salt and pepper (or want a cute thing you don't use) these are good for you or those you gift this to!
