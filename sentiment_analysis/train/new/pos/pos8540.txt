My daughter loves these! I originally got them to fill in some empty spaces on her Skip Hop Playmat, but she loves them without the mat. The wings are crinkly and she likes to grab and "crunch" them. It's also extremely easy for her to grip the green triangle and then toss or shake the birds about like a rattle. I got these when she was just 3 months and she was grasping and holding onto them great. Definitely better than any rattle I've bought her thus far! The chiming noises are also pleasant, not grating like a lot of other toys.
