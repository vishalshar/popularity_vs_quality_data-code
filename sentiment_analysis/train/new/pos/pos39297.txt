Its fast and easy. At first I wasnt sure it was accurate but after figuring out that on my 2 and 3 yo toddlers I have to pull there ears back and a little up it gives me consistant reading. :) my kids arent the type that like to have there temps taken so with auxillary  thermometers its was a constant struggle and often inaccurate due to them wrestling and working up a sweat. With this I just catch em by surprise cus its fast and accurate.  For accurate readings like I said for kids u have to pull back and up a little. For my hubby when hes sick or myself for that matter its just pulling the ear back. I talked to my kids doc about it and he told me what inwas doin wrong. Its been a big help since. Of course the doctor only told me about takimg my kiddos temps. With adult ears I had to play with it a little using my hubby as my genie pig til I kept getting constant temps on him. I would leave it for a while then do it again :)
