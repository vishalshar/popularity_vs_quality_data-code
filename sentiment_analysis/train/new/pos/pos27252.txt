This bag is a dream. I bought it over a year ago in anticipation of my second son. Having 2 under 2 I knew I would need alot of space. It provided the space we needed along with pockets I love to have to keep things in their own place and easy to find. There has been plenty of room for all diapering needs, snacks, extra clothes, for the 2 boys and also enough room for my older child if she needs to tote a sweater or something. There is even enough room to fit our Ergo in and zip it up. Ive had it over a year and it still looks brand new. Ive machine washed it numerous times and it shows no signs of wear. The fabric is nice (the pictures do not do "clover" justice) and the zippers are sturdy. We are expecting another baby very soon and I have no doubt this bag will hold all that will be needed for a day out with 4 children. I do wish the zipper pocket and the one opposite it on the outside were a bit bigger, but they are each still capable of holding a cell phone, keys and chapstick. The end pockets outside are perfect sized as well as the ones inside, so not a big setback.
