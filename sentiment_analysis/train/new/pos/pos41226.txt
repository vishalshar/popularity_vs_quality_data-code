I searched everywhere for a sheet that would fit my extra deep mini crib mattress and this is the ONLY one that fit perfect!  My mini crib mattress is 5 inches deep unlike the typical 1 or 3 inch deep mattresses.  It's also a beautiful design and a good quality sheet.  It washed very well and didn't seem to shrink.  I would definitely recommend this sheet!
