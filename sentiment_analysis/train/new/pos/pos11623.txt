I love the beautiful design of the iPhones and have never had a case since the first iPhone came out; until I dropped my iPhone 4s on the exact same day I received my iPhone 6! The slippery feel of the iPhone 6 prompted me to search a nice looking yet protective case.I researched many cases and purchased more than half a dozen of them (for family members and myself). Glad to say that the Maxboost Clear Case is a winner, very close to a perfect iPhone case.  It has gotten quite a bit of compliments. I have purchased another one to gave it to one of my friends.Big Pluses:1. This clear case allows the beautiful design of the iPhone 6 shine through. Its simple and clean design matches iPhone’s minimalist design extremely well, and it doesn’t take away much of the beautiful appearance of the phone at all (see the pictures posted here).2. It fits the phone snugly and makes the phone feel very solid on hand.3. The rubber/jelly feel of the case gives both decent shock/drop protection and a very confortable grip of the phone.4. The price is unexpectedly reasonable; for less than $10, a steal!A Small Minus:I wish the case were a bit thicker (or with a bit more shock absorbing materials), especially around the corners of the case so to give the phone better shock/drop protection.All things considered, this is pretty much the perfect iPhone 6 case you can find today!P.S., if you want a screen protector - an intelliARMOR HD Apple iPhone 6 intelliGLASS is hard to beat.
