This is a great activity mat. Our two-month old isn't even to the point where she can take advantage of all the features, and she already loves just laying on it and looking at the hanging toys, the mirror (hey, there's a baby over there...), and the mobile with the lights. We also do some tummy time on this mat, using the little bolster pillow. The areas of "crinkly" fabric on the mat are a nice touch, too. Testament to the attractiveness of the mat is that I put my daughter on it, asked my husband to keep an eye on her, went and took a shower AND dried my hair, and she laid there the whole time, not making a peep, completely fascinated. I picked this one due to the great reviews AND the fact that it wasn't the usual pastel or jungle animals theme. I love the bright colors and high contrast, and my daughter does, too! My only complaint is that the mat is a little tough to store unless you want to take the arches off each time (which would be a pain), but that's very minor.
