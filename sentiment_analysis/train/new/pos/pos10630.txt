We've tried a lot of different sipper cups, but these are our absolute favorites!  We've been using them for 17 years.  The valves are easy to remove and to clean, unlike other brands that grow mold inside a valve you can't really clean out.  They don't leak unless banged upside down onto a table or floor, and the valves are easily replaced once they start to wear out.Unfortunately, it's getting hard to find this particular style of the playtex cups.  Since they last a very long time, we've replaced valves and are using some very old ones.  We've even replaced lids once upon a time.I ordered one set of these recently, hoping they'd be boy-colored for my new one year old.  Unfortunately, we received pink and purple flowered ones.  My 3 year old was thrilled and the 1 year old doesn't really care at the moment.  I'm not sure if there's a way to request a boy-theme or not, but we'll probably order again sometime soon and take our chances.
