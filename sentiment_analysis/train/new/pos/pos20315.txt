My husband and I bought the Baby Jogger Summit X3 stroller and a Chicco Keyfit 30 Magic infant car seat.  We bought this adapter to be able to use the Summit as a travel system instead of the traditional, clunky travel system stroller that is "supposed" to go with the Chicco Keyfit car seat.Word of warning:  There are MULTIPLE sets of directions for different brands of car seats.  I originally hadn't notice this and used the first set of (Graco) directions to install the adapter and became very frustrated when my Chicco seat wouldn't click in to the adapter.  I Googled like crazy, and eventually found another review that mentioned this same thing.  Once I used the correct directions, which involved removing a couple of brackets from the adapter, the car seat fits in perfectly and clicks in easily every time.  It is a little pricey compared to adapters for other brands of strollers, but now that I have installed it properly I think it is worth the price.
