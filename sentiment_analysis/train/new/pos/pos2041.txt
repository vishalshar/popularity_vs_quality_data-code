This product is helpful for a few reasons, it definitely helps keep my baby from spitting up at night, he seems to have some morning sinus issue and the inclined position is better than his lying flat, and most importantly, when we first brought our son home, we couldn't put him down to sleep unless he was swaddled, this cushion is so cozy, with the side wedges in, he feels like he's still swaddled.  He did slide down, but he was on his back and waking up every three hours, so it wasn't an issue, I fixed it by wrapping a receiving blanket around the entire cushion, so now it's warm as well as cozy and he doesn't slide. This doesn't appear to be a suffocation risk because I tucked the blanket under the cushion and his weight keeps it in place.  He's seven weeks old now and sleeping well!
