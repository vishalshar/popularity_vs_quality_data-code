I never thought that I would be using cloth wipes.  I really thought that is where I would draw the line with our eco-friendly earth crunchiness.  I was totally on board with cloth diapering, but for some reason, cloth wipes initially grossed me out.  It didn't take me long to convert to cloth.  I felt so wasteful tossing several wipes into the trash can after every change.  I ordered several bundles of these, and we've never looked back.  They're great-- they're the perfect size, and we use 2-4 per change, and then just toss them in with our diaper laundry.  We keep a Thermos with warm water on the changing table, and a little plastic dish.  We dunk them, ring them out, wipe her, then toss the dirty wipe in the diaper pail with the rest of the diaper laundry.  They're natural hemp, very absorbent, soft to the bum, and they're made in the USA.  They're way more absorbent than disposables, and you feel like there is a much thicker barrier between you and your baby's poop.  :)  They're also great for cleaning spit-up incidents or using them as washcloths.My only complaints are 1) You have to prep them, otherwise they won't be absorbent, and 2) The thread at the edges unravels after minimal use.  I don't really care so much about the latter issue (I can just snip the straggling threads off), but the first one is a slight pain in the rear.  If you're not using cloth diapers, or if you wash these separate from your cloth diapers, it's not an issue.  But if you are planning on using these wipes in connection with your cloth diapering laundry, you have to make sure these are washed SEVERAL times and prepped, so that the oils from the natural fibers don't get onto your diapers and cause them to repel moisture.  I wish BabyKicks would send these pre-prepped and then I would whole-heartedly give these 5 stars!
