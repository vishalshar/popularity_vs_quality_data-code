Whew!  I've bought every stainless steel kids cup on the planet and been disappointed a thousand times...until now.  They either leak out of the top, have easily scratched designs, aren't dishwasher safe, blah blah blah.  This is the PERFECT kids cup.  It's dishwasher safe, never leaks, has a rubber panel for gripping the cup, rubber panel is easily cleaned and looks brand new.  I waited 3 months to write this review because i have no faith in cups anymore but this one delivered.  I will never buy another brand of kids cup again.
