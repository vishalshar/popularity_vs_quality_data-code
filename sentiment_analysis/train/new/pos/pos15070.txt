I got these pacies for my son because they are more pleasing to the eye. They have the rounded nipples (not the slanted nipples), which my son liked a lot. Now two and half years later I am using them for my little girl. She likes them just as well. They both were able to use bottles, breast-feed and use a pacifier without any problems switching back and forth. I also like how Advent makes the pacies age specific. Most brands offer 0-3 months and then 3+ months. Advent has them in sizes 0-3, 3-6, 6-18 and 18-24 months. It gives me comfort knowing that the pacifier is growing as their palette is expanding which gives a more comfortable and natural feel.
