These cold packs are the most comforting boo-boo buddies ever! When my children have an owie, these are so soft and cold, but not so cold that they "burn" on the skin like many other cold packs do. The lightweight washcloth cover is exactly the thickness needed to keep the frozen feeling off, yet still provide enough cold to actually help a bump go down. These are truly perfect for bumps and for all ages! My kids range from 15 months to 6 years and it works for any of them. You can also remove the washcloth cover for washing, which is handy if their boo-boo also involves blood.
