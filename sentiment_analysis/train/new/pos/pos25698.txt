My husband and I both come from modest backgrounds were our parents never believed that playing should be a part of our schedule. The only expenditure for them involved providing us with basic necessities plus education (which for them was sacred). Everything else was a waste. So long story short come our only daughter and we buy everything that we lay our eyes upon. Sometimes I wonder who is it that we buy so many toys for? Her or us? Nevertheless this toy organizer does its job well enough. Its larger than its looks. Its not solid sturdy but its not lame either. It's easy to move and the partition within can be moved to just dump toys inside. I use it mainly to divide toys and books. All in all its a good buy.
