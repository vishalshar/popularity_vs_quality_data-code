I love this toy maybe more than our baby- she seems more interested in the red antennas than anything else! I like that it's soft and made in Germany. She makes a face sometimes when she puts the teething ring in her mouth but she has been using it a lot more lately. I'm hoping she chews on the ring more than pulling on the antennas!
