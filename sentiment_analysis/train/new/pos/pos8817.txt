These are great for toddlers. My 2-year-old was using his 9onz natural aven bottle and since a while back he always asked for a refill after he finished his bottle. Fortunately I found these, and they are great. I love them, he loves them. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star is because they came with 3M nipple (medium flow) when a bottle this size should really come with a fast flow nipple, since it is mostly used by older babies and toddlers.
