I already had a Vera Bradley baby bag, which I had gotten as a gift. It looked nice but the handles were too short and the inside pockets never held things in place and they would fall out and become lost in the baby bag abyss.We had to travel abroad and I wanted a baby bag that was a little bigger and had more pockets to put his binkies in where I could reach them easily and one which had a longer strap.After much searching I found this and thought I'd try it. The bag is nothing special to look at but the inside is very spacious and I love the side compartment for bottles (even though our baby was never bottle fed but it makes other small things like binkies and baby food very accessible.) The top zipper is not attached end to end so that the top sorta lifts up giving you an added inch or so more of space (but there are gaps on both ends, so although nothing has ever fallen out of them but I'm always a little conscious that someone might put their hand in the bag through them). The strap is adjustable which is great and there is padding for the shoulder so the strap doesn't dig into your skin if the bag is too full. There are three side pockets the larger of which has magnetic closure which is nice, and the side pockets are great for storing the changing pad (which is a little flimsy but hey, it was free!) and small toys or even his taggy blanky.The inside has only two pockets, one large mesh one and a zipper pocket, so I wish it did have more secure pockets. But it has so much space that for my 18 hour flight, I packed 2 sleep n' plays,  3 onesies, one baby einstein take-a-long tunes, 10 - 12 size 2 diapers, 2 packs of wipes,the transparent "dirty duds" pouch filled with his eczema lotion, vaseline, our tooth paste and lotion (travel size), 2 -3 bottles infant formula (individual liquid serving bottles, just in case) and a full sized baby blanket and it all fit (although the bag was bulging, but do you blame it?:D).And to top it all, it survived the wear-and-tear of travel very well and now I use it everyday instead of my Vera Bradley bag because I find it just so convenient and spacious.
