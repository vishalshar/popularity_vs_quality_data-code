Love this thermometer, it works great! I usually take a few readings and average them out, but usually it's clear if it's a fever or no fever. The display changes colors (green if it's a good temp, yellow if it's a little high, and red for fever) which I thought was a cool feature. The only thing I can't figure out is how to get the surface temp reading to work properly - but I never use that anyway, it would just be nice to know. Over all, I've been really satisfied with this thermometer.
