My wife went through bra pads like crazy because when she fed the baby on one side the other side would leak especially when she had more than one letdown.  She was actually using Medela's hard thera shells at first because of sore nipples and they would help catch leakage she could empty and save later, but they were small, have lots of holes, does not provide enough pressure on breast (milk leaks out of hole where nipple is suppose to go) and not sealed enough so where the two pieces join, milk would leak and still soak bra at bottom and gravity makes it worse.  The O-cal-ette are bigger (a bit smaller in diameter to your average bra pad) holding at least an ounce and there is only one small hole.  Most are terrible in the sense that when you bend over the milk leaks out including these but these cups are better because the single hole is much smaller as compared to even the milkies where the whole top is open.  As a matter of fact the holes on o-cal-ette might be too small because when full it is hard to aim the hole in a bottle to pour out milk, but definitely doable and a trade off for less leakage.  The cups also have a nice seal, are easy to clean, and much more flattering in bra than the small thera shells.  My wife also says as an added bonus, they helped with her blanching.  These cups actually helped her when worn to keep the nipples warmer (for circulation to return) while "airing out" and also slightly moist from milk.  Of course if you prefer completely dry nipples then this might not be what you want.  As long as you remember to empty it out (because they are just that comfortable that she forgets she has them) they are worth every penny.
