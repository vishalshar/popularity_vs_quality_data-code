This is a "dumb" charger.  I have several other smart chargers, but you always need a "dumb " chargers to start charging a completely dead battery.  In my smart chargers they won't recognize a dead battery, so I give it a little time in the "dumb" charger and then put the battery into my smart charger and finish the charging.  I really bought this a s a spare for a similar charger that I have been using for years.  Just this morning it saved me from throwing away 2 eneloop batteries that I had left in a flashlight that I left on for a couple of weeks.  No matter how we advance in technology, there is always a place for the older technology.
