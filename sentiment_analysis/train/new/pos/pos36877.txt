This laundry basket is so cute and perfect for what I need it for.  I bought it for my new infant and so far have had no issues with it.  The top part that closes is nice for when I don't want to look at the clothes that have remnants of diaper explosions on them.  It folds up small but still is big enough to hold a couple loads of laundry when unfolded.  The frame is built out of wires and basic vinyl and quite frankly too cute to not play around with.  I can see if you have a boisterous child, it might not survive forever, but for the price, it is an excellent product.
