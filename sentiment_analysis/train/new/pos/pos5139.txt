I had to make myself get used to these, but now I really like them. They're perfect for short trips where you know you'll only need one bottle, otherwise it's probably just as easy to bring formula. The seals are good. Easy to clean. My only complaint is that they are pretty bottom heavy so baby can't hold it without assistance.
