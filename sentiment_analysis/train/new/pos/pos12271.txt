This Bedding Set was perfect for my 2 year old toddler's room!  It fit his crib mattress perfectly.The colours are very vibrant!  The material the sheets and comforter are made out of is very light weight and slippery totouch (100% Polyester Microfibre).  It wouldn't be warm in the winter but for the summer months nice and cool.
