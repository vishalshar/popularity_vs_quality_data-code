This thing is awesome because no more carrying the car seat on the plane! Our son is 20 months 27lbs and it fit securely. He didn't complain at all. The straps probably seem familiar to him from his car seat. Very expensive for what it is but there are no other options. The buckle is difficult to release the strap so it slides when you are taking it off. Slightly awkward having to put down someone else's tray table while u fumble with attaching it, but it does not get in their way. If u travel on a plane with a toddler this is the way to go. After you are in the air you can unbuckle and they have all that room to do what toddlers do without an enormous car seat taking up that space.
