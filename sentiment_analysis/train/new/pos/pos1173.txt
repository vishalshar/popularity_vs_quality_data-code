The video on this monitor is very clear.  Unfortunately, the speaker was too quiet for me and we returned it.  I ordered a Samsung SEW-3037W monitor instead which has an inferior video display but much louder speaker.  For me I was willing to settle for a slightly worse video display to be able to hear our baby well.
