Overall, this bedding set is very cute and of good value. The pros: super cute design, gender-neutral theme/colors, 2 crib sheets (most bedding sets just has 1 sheet), cute bed skirt, and you get a mobile. Cons: they add decals and wall hangings and what not, and it's cheaply made. But, I didn't buy it for the decals and such, but for the blanket, crib sheets, and bed skirt. The mobile was an added bonus. Overall, good value.
