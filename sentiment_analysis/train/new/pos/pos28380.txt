I've only used this on restaurant high chairs so far, but it's been great. My son is big for his age and started sitting up on his own at about 4.5 months, but we still thought he was too small to comfortably sit in a wooden high chair. A friend recommended this cart cover, so we got it and we love it! It's so soft and plush that he is very comfortable, and now he can sit at the restaurant table with us while we eat. (Before, my husband and I would each have to take turns holding him and eating since he hated sitting in his car seat or a stroller at a restaurant.)Before we bought this one, we checked out other, less expensive covers. We're happy we got this one because it has the following advantages:1. It is very soft and plush (as I said before), so it pads the seat a bit for your little one.2. It straps to the chair, and has its own little strap that holds the child in (it's like a little triangle-shaped piece of fabric that you put his feet through and straps around his waist, so it really keeps him in there! I've seen toddlers crawl out of restaurant high chairs and onto the table, so I think this feature would come in handy for children older than mine, too).3. The tags! Our baby loves them. We also use them as loops to attach links (Bright Starts Lots of Links) and toys for our son.The main disadvantage to this cart cover is that it's kind of big. That's no big deal when we're taking it out in the car, but we like to walk places too. So, we purchased a 4L stuff sack (Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Stuff Sack, size S) for it, which makes it small enough to squeeze into the diaper bag when we're walking out for dinner. I'd recommend getting one if you're a walker too!We love our cart cover! I'm sure it will be great when we use it on an actual cart, too ;)
