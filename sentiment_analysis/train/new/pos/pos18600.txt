We first bought the Stokke Bounce N Sleep Daybed, which we love and which our daughter has napped in every day since we brought her home from the hospital (she is 6 weeks old). I had been waiting to see if she liked the Daybed before purchasing the Bouncer.  She has used the Bouncer several times, and once fell asleep in it - which was great, because then she can be easily transferred to the Daybed without waking her (this is the point of the design).  She is a small baby and is only now getting large enough to really fit comfortably in it (she's about 8.5 lbs) - I felt it was a bit big for her a few weeks ago when we got it. I also think she will like it more as she gets a bit older and becomes more interested in looking at the toys we hang from the overhead bar on the Bouncer. So I guess you could say we haven't used it enough to justify its  cost yet, but I believe we will (for this reason I have given it 4 instead of 5 stars). The construction of the product is excellent - I feel she is very secure in it. Finally, I happen to like that it does not vibrate or bounce on its own - it is a way to interact with your child.
