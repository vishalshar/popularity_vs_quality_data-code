This product arrived earlier than expected in an Amazon shipment with other 101 Dalmatians stuff I ordered.  They are great quality and were packaged well, in thier own box that fit them perfectly to reduce the chance of damage.  The colors are beautiful and they are going to be a fantastic complement to my nursery.
