This is one of the best purchases we made for our baby. I really wanted a jogging stroller that was part of a travel system and this is one of the only ones I could find - and it works GREAT! I jogged with it on paved roads & sidewalks at least 3 days a week in the summer and had no problems. (Just make sure you lock the front wheel when running! Otherwise, it wobbles if you get going fast. With the wheel locked, no wobbling.) Also, the carrier was SO easy to remove from the car and snaps right onto the stroller - so easily! The only problem we found is that it's a bit bulky when folded up, although I don't think it's much bigger than any other jogger. We have a '94 Corolla and it fits in the trunk just fine, but took up pretty much the whole trunk so we couldn't keep anything else in there. Our son is almost a year old and we still use this stroller almost every day.
