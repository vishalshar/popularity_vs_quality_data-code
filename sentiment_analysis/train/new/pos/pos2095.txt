We love these wonder bumpers.Hubby and I are pretty worrisome parents and SIDs dangers are ever present on our mind.  When we transitioned baby at 6 months to the crib in his room, we didn't love the idea of the traditional bulky bumpers at all; but at the same time, baby was an active roller throughout the night.  The bumpers make the space between the slats too small for him to get a hand or foot stuck.  Now at 8 months and with the ability to crawl, sit up, get up on his knees or even stand up, we still love these cushiony bumpers and have had no problems.  We originally bought the set of 38 which would have been enough for slats on all 4 sides but my husband felt that we needed to cushion up the four corner posts too.  Since these are all zipper-based, he just zippered two together to create a piece that would fit the corner ones.  And then we bought a few extras.The zippers are really well made, slide easily, and I wish more zippers were like these.
