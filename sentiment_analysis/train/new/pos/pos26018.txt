I know another person said the bag was too small however it has been just right for us. I have managed to put in two outfits, 2 pairs of socks, 2 cloth diapers for burp cloths, 4 bibs, 10 size 3 pampers, random toys, 5 oz bottle of water, 2 4oz jars of food, gas drops, my wallet, and keys.  My husband uses it more than he uses his own diaper bag. I recommend this bag any one who over packs like I do.
