I purchased this booster seat for my 6 year old son after a friend recommended it, and I also did a fair amount of research. We typically use Britax car seats and I drive a Toyota Sequoia SUV.  This car seat fits wonderfully and leaves my son with a lot of leg room. The seat was easy to assemble, feels very sturdy and had good safety reviews.  I appreciate that this seat is adjustable for width from heafty kiddos or slim ones (I have one of each type of kiddo).  The seat has hooks to keep the seat in place regardless of if the child is in it. Some reviews mention issues with lack of retraction with the shoulder belt but we have not had that issue; as long as the seatbelt isn't twisted up then it retracts great. Overall I am super excited I found this seat, it's well made, priced great and my big boy is safe ;)
