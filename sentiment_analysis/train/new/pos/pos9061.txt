My baby loooves his soothies. I had planned on not giving him a pacifier (I know, I know, lofty first-time-parent goals) but they gave him one at the hospital and he ended up loving it.  I've actually found it hard to find the soothie's in the next size up (in fact, I didn't know they existed before I came on Amazon), but was glad to see they were stocked here.I don't know what the difference is between the 0-3 month size. It appears that the pacifier is the same size, however the base is thicker and maybe the pacifier itself is a little tougher? I was worried that the difference would be enough that my little guy wouldn't take it but luckily he does. We interchange them with the 0-3 months that we still have left and he doesn't seem to mind.
