These stoller clips work great with my diaper bag (although I have a Petunia Pickle Bottom bag, not a JJ Cole). I was a little worried that they might be too short, but they are actually the perfect length. My only issue with these clips is that I wish they attached more securely to my stoller. I like to leave the clips attached to the stoller so that I don't have to take them on & off, but since they loop through themselves to attach to the stroller handle they aren't super secure on there when the diaper bag isn't attached. I was carrying the diaper bag once while my oldest son pushed the baby in the stroller & one of the clips came unlooped & fell off. Luckily I was walking behind them when it happened so I saw it fall off & was able to grab it. I wish there was some sort of snap or something to keep them attached when they're not being used.
