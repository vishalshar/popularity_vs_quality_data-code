These get the job done and the colors are fun. They do "quilt up" and shrink after the first washing, but that increases their absorption speed so it's a good thing, not a bad thing. Even shrunk down these do a great job as a burp rag. They absorb much faster than the flannel cloths so more spit up ends up in the rag instead of dripping off onto your shoulder or pants. The best part is they do not have that stiff polyester pad in the center like a lot of other similar products do so they are not as bulky. The only reason I give these 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have a few of these that I bought several years ago and they are a bit bigger. So sometime in the last few years they've changed them to make them smaller (at least after washing) but even at the new small size, I'm still stocking up.
