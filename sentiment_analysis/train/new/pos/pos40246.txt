The idea of these spoons is great, the size is great for little hands, and it definitely helped get the idea of spoon use for my son.However, the holes are the worst idea ever, it makes the product insanely hard to clean which made me hate these spoons, I would have much preferred the holes not to be there. My husband and I would actually flip a coin on who had to clean these darn spoons because it was so hard.I would have loved these spoons and given them a 5star if it weren't for the holes.The "spoon" part could have been just a tad bigger too, it was really hard for my son to scoop up food because the spoon was so small everything would just fall off.A great idea, a great concept, but it needed to be a tad bigger, and the holes need to be removed
