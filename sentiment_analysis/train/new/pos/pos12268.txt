Just the right amount of light to latch. Buy after having purchased this, I read that red lights are better, they don't trigger the babies brains to wake up like blue or white light. I do notice that my baby wakes up to stare at it if I have the light on the same side that I'm feeding on. Therefore I wear it on the opposite side that the baby is on
