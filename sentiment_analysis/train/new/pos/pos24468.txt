Since crib mattresses are very snug by design, changing the sheet is a big hassle:  pry and lift the mattress from the crib, change the sheet while taking care to ensure proper slack at each corner, then shove the mattress back in.  Repeat for your second baby.With Quickzip sheets, you just unzip the dirty upper portion, then zip on a clean one.  Very quick and easy.  The zippers are big and sturdy, and covered over by extra fabric overhang.Less material to wash equates to more efficient laundry (carrying, load size/soap/water, folding, storage).  We have 3 sets of these for 2 cribs and a few more top sheets for laundry rotation.  They fit fine over Colgate Eco Classica III Dual firmness Eco-Friendlier Crib mattress, Organic Cotton Cover and American Baby Company Organic Cotton Quilted Crib & Toddler Crib Size Fitted Mattress Pad Covers, Natural.
