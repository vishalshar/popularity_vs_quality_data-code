We purchased an Inglesina Fast Table Chair (portable clamp-on highchair - we really highly recommend it btw, it's great!) and were looking for a solution to fill the gap between the table and the chair (which was resulting in lots of food ending up on the floor).  We also wanted a clean, sanitary layer to put on top of restaurant tables so we wouldn't have to worry about sanitizing everything within baby's reach.  This product isn't absolutely PERFECT for our needs, but it's pretty good - and it's the best we've found.  The chair clamps just fine over the placement (inserting the extra rubber layer does not cause the chair to become insecure).  The little lip fits in the gap between the table and the chair - not perfectly (it's just a little too deep), but we can squeeze it in there and it does successfully capture almost all the food (though we do check on it a few times during the course of a meal and sometimes have to readjust it).  I also like that the mat is designed to sort of fold in on itself - so you don't have to worry about little stray bits of food getting loose in your diaper bag after you pack up.  The suction cups aren't really necessary/helpful and are sometimes get in the way, but not that big a deal.For anyone looking JUST for a portable placement (who doesn't need the little lip to catch food as well), I recommend the Modern-Twist silicone placemats.  More streamlined, cleans up great, and super cute designs.  That's the one we use at home when we don't need to worry about filling the gap in the portable highchair.
