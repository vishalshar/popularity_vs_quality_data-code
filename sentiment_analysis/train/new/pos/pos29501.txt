I love this humidifer, most of all it has not filter !!  What nice idea, forI battled with the filters with other ones.  I live in MO and use it in thewinter months for help with dry air, but also the moisture added to theair make my home feel and stay warmer.  In MO the weather changesall the time it seems, and with the other humidifers I've had, whenwe'd have cold weather I'd have it running, and then we'd have a day ortwo of almost spring type in the middle of winter, and there was not reasonto have it on.  With the filtered one, the filter would mold and get mustyin the day or two and not be usable for the day it got cold again.  No problemswith this one.  Just drained in in my drain rack and put aside, used it whenready.Karen
