I just purchased one pack of these to try.  Although my son is a week shy of 6 months, he's just starting to roll over and sit up unassisted (well, for 5 seconds anyway).  I thought I'd get started on baby-proofing.  I purchased these on a whim but, after checking online, other reviewers seem to like this product.The covers are nicer looking than others and a little easier to remove with the aid of a push button.  However, they're still not easy to remove from the socket.  This being said, it does save your nails since you don't have to pry them off the socket plate.  They have to tight fit, though, so I had to "fight" to get some of them out.  The most difficult ones to remove were the ones where, I guess, the outlet plate isn't flat against the wall or the electrical socket doesn't sit straight behind the plate.  Guess that's a blessing in disguise!  When he gets to the age where he can use a "tool" (anything, basically) to pry them out, then we'll figure out something else as I imagine he'll be able to pry out anything by then!I haven't tried to attach them to a vacuum cleaner cord yet but it sounds like a good idea.  I plan on buying 2-3 more packs to cover a 4000+ sf home.  This reference is just a suggestion on how many packs of these you might need without going around and counting every outlet.  At least they're cheap and should provide a hinderance to young toddlers trying to get to the socket holes.
