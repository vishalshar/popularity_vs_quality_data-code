After testing several (6 different cloth diaper brands) we fell in love with Charlie Banana. It's a little more expensive than some of the other diapers however, this diaper is truly a one size fits all diaper.  It adjusts to be snug in all the right places so as to prevent leaks.  The other thing I love about this one size diaper is that it is not SUPER tight on his body to prevent leaks. It literally has fit from newborn, he was 8 pounds, and were still going strong at 19 pounds with no leak issues.  The outer material is truly waterproof and the inside fleece lining is super soft and has remained soft sine we began using them.  The other important part of this diaper is the customer service.  Charlie Banana is on all the social media sites, available via mail, e-mail and phone.  It makes it super easy to ask them questions and get very quick responses.  They have helped me to determine my wash routine and the soap I use to wash them to maintain the ice of the product.  I have so many good things to say about this diaper, we use CB's for 90% of our diaper stash and they are always used for our overnights! The inserts are much more absorbent than other inserts we've received with the diaper.
