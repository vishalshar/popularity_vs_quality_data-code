We ordered this to go on all 3 of our UPPAbaby strollers (Vista, Cruz, G-luxe) as my 1 year old throws her blanket on the ground when we are walking so we end up running it over or losing it all together. Based on previous reviews I was a bit skeptical but wanted to see if it would work for us. We live in North Georgia so it gets pretty cold in the evening during the Fall and cold in the winter months, although not as cold as northern states. My daughter also does not like to keep socks or shoes on so we needed a solution. I used this the first time the other day, it was a windy day (15-25 northern cold wind) and it worked perfect for our needs. She stayed covered and warm and it did not blow around like it did for some other people. The blanket itself is thin, it has the pattern on one side and a soft inside which is nice for the little ones soft skin. Even though it is relatively thin it is actually very warm (I wrapped it around my shoulders to test this out). I would compared this to the equivalent of wearing a north face fleece jacket in weight as opposed to a puffer to put it in prospective.This blanket hooks on the bar, and also goes through the lap belt on the seat but can be used without being connected to the belt as it is a bit of a hassle with an active baby's hands trying to get it. The blank is would work great for northern states Fall weather or southern states year round weather. UPPAbaby makes a thicker one for colder temperatures which also works great and snugs the baby in. Overall I would recommend this for 40 degree temperatures and above.
