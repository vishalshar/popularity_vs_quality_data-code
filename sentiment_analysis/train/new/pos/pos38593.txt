I bought this little bear because of the three previous five-star reviews.  It was meant as a present for my young grandson, visiting us for the first time.  He took to this little guy right away, hugging it until he fell asleep clutching it.  It's amazing what a little "humming" technology can do to help a young child relax, especially in a new environment.  He ended up taking this little bear back with him to comfort him on the plane ride.Although the "purring" sound was sometimes hard to activate, the softness and the hugability of this bear is what attracted my grandson to this comforter.On the back of the package is a small green caveat "Ideal for Ages 3 and up."  That is, I assume, because of the low-lying grey ribbon around the bear's neck, and the possiblity that a determined toddler may be able to wrestle the powerbox inside the bear's tummy open.  The tough velcro, however, will keep the belly closed tightly.
