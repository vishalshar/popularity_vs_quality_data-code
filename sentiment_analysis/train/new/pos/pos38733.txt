Our 8 month old baby girl loves bath time, so we wanted to get her some fun bath toys. These were adorable, and the fact that they move in the water makes them even more fun for her to play with. They were played with a total of three times before Squirt's arm (the turtle) fell off. We will have to figure out how to get it back on there, but it wasn't wound too tightly or played with too roughly or even dropped. It just fell off. And for $10 for only two small bath toys, I was hoping that they would last awhile. So far Nemo still works, but after seeing how easily the other one broke, I don't have high hopes for its quality either. These are fun while they last, but not worth $10...***Update 2/21/2015I have to rerate this a 4-star because Nemo is still going strong and my daughter just loves him :) Nemo was worth the purchase because she also happens to be in love with the movie. Still disappointed in Squirt since we never got him to work again.
