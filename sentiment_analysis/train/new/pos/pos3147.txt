In the CD (cloth diaper) world I have found Bummis to be SEVERELY under appreciated. These are hands down the best prefolds we have ever used. I have had some other mamas give us some old snap covers that take the fitted prefolds that look like menstrual pads in shape and they leak EVERYWHERE. So much pee leaks from those! My Bummis has never ever, ever leaked and my baby wears one prefold at a time all night. These other moms are stuffing like 3 of those other prefolds in their diapers just to hold pee! It's nuts. The Bummis velcro will definitely fall apart after time and start to pull off of the diaper, but we have been using the same kit covers for at least 6 months and they are now finally getting unusable. I won't try anything else. The other CD we bought second hand were total junk compared to the absorbancy of these and they are organic! If you are new to CD like we were definitely go for this kit. We are super happy with the prefolds especially, but the covers are also really worth it.
