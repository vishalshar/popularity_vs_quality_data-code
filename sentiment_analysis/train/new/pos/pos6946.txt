This is a superb product but there is still a lot of room for improvement. My wife has been breastfeeding our daughter with the help of SNS for 8 months now. She had a small mik supply to start with but with SNS, she could feed all the breastmilk she had. This is not only physically good but also emotionally.On the down side, there is a few things that needs to be improved:- It is impossible to properly clean the tank. It is too thin and the opening is too small to comfortably enter a brush into it. If you try too hard, you will puncture the tank, which we did after 5 months. It still worked but you will get dried formula stuck at the bottom after a while.- The tubes come off easily. If you try hard enough, you can put it back (thanks youtube and we could only put back one of them) but it is very difficult.- If you tighten the cap too much, it pushes the seal in too much too and it starts leaking. It takes a bit of getting used to finding the correct tightness.
