This changing pad cover looks exactly like the picture. It is so fluffy and I can only assume that it's extremely comfortable because my baby boy loves to lay on the changing table. I've had to wash it a few times and it's held up great! No fading, fraying, tearing, bunching, thinning,...none of that. It's a little pricey, as is this brand in general, but this particular product was worth the money.
