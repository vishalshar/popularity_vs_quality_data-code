Love having something lightweight and portable that prevents us from having baby sit directly on grubby restaurant high chairs.I also have an Itsy Ritzy cover that I love and have used for several years, although I now use the Brica one more just because it is so much more portable.Pros:-Folds up easily and compactly (fits in diaper bag)-Easy to fit on most restaurant high chairs (I've owned it for a month and a half and haven't found one that doesn't work yet)- Even though it does not have its own straps, once the chair straps are threaded through the cover, they seem to come up a little higher above baby's hips, holding her more securely in seat.Cons (Really just one):-The cover does not have its own straps. There are holes in the back through which you thread the high chair straps.  This is sometimes difficult to do, especially on chairs with very thick strap clips. One time, we could not get the straps through the holes and had to route them around the side of the cover (not ideal). I wish this cover had its own straps like my (bigger and more unwieldy) Itsy Ritzy cover. This would hold baby that much more securely and avoid having to use any part of the yucky restaurant chair--those straps and belts can be disgusting.
