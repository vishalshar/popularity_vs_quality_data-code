I must admit, this is my very first time writing a review.  But because there are almost no reviews on this chair at all, I really wanted to help other parents make a decision.  I researched high chairs for months!  I had no budget whatsoever, and just wanted the perfect chair.  I literally read every review on every possible chair and seen every video on each chair.  I'm not sure why it's so hard to make a chair with all the necessary details, but for whatever reason, I couldn't find what I was looking for.  Here's what I needed in a chair:  easy to clean, adjustable height, several recline positions, t-bar attached to the chair (not the tray), a tray that comes close to the baby (preferably adjustable), wheels for easy mobility, fold for easy storage, not too large of a footprint, and not an eyesore.  This chair has EVERYTHING!!Overall, the chair is great!!  It has all the details I was looking for, and looks great in my kitchen!  Plus it has a handy little towel rack in the back, and you can also place the tray on the back for storage.  What's also awesome is that you can place the tray on the back and wheel the chair under the table when not in use, or bring the baby to the table so that he can eat with the family.Here are some of the negatives:- Although the chair reclines, you have to take the baby out before reclining (big negative, but wasn't bad enough for me to take off a star).- The foot rest is not adjustable.- When folded, the chair doesn't have a lock mechanism (a little annoying, since it begins to unfold if you don't lean it correctly against the wall).- Too plasticky.....has a little cheapy feel to it.  But I guess what can you expect?  It's a cheap chair!Overall, I give it 5 stars.  It's not perfect, but it's the best chair out of all the ones I've seen on the market.
