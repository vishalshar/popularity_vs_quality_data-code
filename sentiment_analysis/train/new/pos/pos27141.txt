First, I would like to say that I am terrible at putting on screen protectors. It seems like no matter how careful I am, I mess them up. This one was excellent in that it resisted my anti-screen protector skills and went on perfectly the first time. I think it's because it's slightly more rigid than some of the ones I've used in the past, so it's easier to manage.I've also never had a matte screen protector, but since I use my tablet mainly for reading, I wanted something that would cut the glare while I was outside or under bright lights. It works wonderfully. I was afraid it would cause a frosty look over the screen, I had a cheaper matte screen protector for another device in the past and it created a frosty look that was irritating. This one did not do that, thank goodness. I would definitely recommend this product, it's easy to put on, it looks great, and it really does a great job at cutting down glares.
