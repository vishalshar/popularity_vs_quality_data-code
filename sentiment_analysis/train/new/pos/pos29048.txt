Love these for my cloth-diapered son. I keep a bottle of homemade wipe solution at my son's changing area and squirt it onto a wipe when it's time for a diaper change. One wipe cleans him up completely (note: he is exclusively breastfed, so the poop is easy to clean up), then goes into the hanging bag with the diapers, to be washed every 1-2 days. They clean up well with my diaper washing routine (cold rinse, heavy-duty wash with hot or warm water), and are a good size.
