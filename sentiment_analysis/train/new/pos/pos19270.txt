I have tried a lot of brands and these Medela nursing pads are by far my favorite. They are not itchy, they absorb a lot and absorb well so you don't feel the wetness, and they stay in place very well even if you don't use the sticky tabs! You can see them under your clothing if you wear a thin bra, but I haven't found any pads that a thin bra will cover up. I usually wear the Bravado seamless nursing bra that has the little foam inserts and that covers them up perfectly!
