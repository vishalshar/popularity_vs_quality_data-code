We already had accumulated an overload of toddler toys passed down from our first grandson for our second to play with, we decided to add to our bath toy collection for #2's first birthday.  Both of our little guys LOVE taking their baths, and this little toy was a great addition to the gift box... very colorful, and each little tulip shaped cup has different configurations of holes in the bottom which makes the water sprinkle out in different ways.  We also play with them on the floor, since you can stack them on top of each other to make a tower (one of his favorite things at this stage is knocking over any kind of tower Grandma, Grandpa or Big Brother builds for him!), and each one fits inside another for compact storage.  This helped calm the fears a baby sometimes has when he graduates  - in our case, from the cozy security of the kitchen sink! - to what must feel like an ocean to him in an adult bathtub.  This was a great purchase.
