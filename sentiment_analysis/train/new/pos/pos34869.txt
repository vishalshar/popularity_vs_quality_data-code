Very thick & high quality cotton terry towel.  I bought a bunch of baby towels (including a few I got sucked into b/c of cute animal hoods), but this is the one I always ended up reaching for after my baby's bath.Some size info that people might find helpful: The manufacturer says it measures 32x32", but after regular washing over the last 8 months mine is now 30x30".  This was a great size for my baby's first 8 months, but he's now outgrown it.  Wish it were bigger.  I'm on the hunt now for a toddler-size towel of similar quality.Highly recommended for baby's first ~8mo, but if you want something that will last for longer I would suggest just getting a toddler-size towel from the beginning.PS about the frog puppet: Very cute and soft.  Great for distracting baby during a change (especially now that he hates being on his back - ever since he started sitting up), or to get him out of a grumpy state after waking up from a nap.  Now that he's teething and sticking everything in his mouth, I also feel much more comfortable sucking on this puppet (made of organic cotton) vs other toys/towels we bought.
