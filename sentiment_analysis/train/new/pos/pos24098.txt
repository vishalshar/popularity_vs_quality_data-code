I don't say this lightly - but this is definitely a must have for parents who venture out of their home with their child during potential meal times. I wish I had known about this product back when my baby starting sitting and eating real food (when baby was 6 months vs 15 months old when I bought it)! Would have saved me so much space in the car for when I packed her high chair when we went to visit friends and family. This folds up/rolls up nicely into the bag they provide, which then easily fits into the diaper bag.This product is amazing and has fit on nearly every chair we've tried - if I'd thought about it even a little bit I would've realized this can't work on a chair that has the lower back open - baby's butt slides back and out (but I of course, learned it the "hard" way).  I saw some reviews talking about how the child can just stand up - but that's not the case at all - as long as you put the seat on correctly and tighten the shoulder straps appropriately. My child is now 19 months and I have never had an issue with keeping baby safely in the seat.
