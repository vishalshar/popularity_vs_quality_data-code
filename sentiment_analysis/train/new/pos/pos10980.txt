I love this necklace, and I'm so glad I got it. My 5-month-old son is becoming very distracted while nursing. He'll pull on anything nearby (which usually ends up being my hair or my clothing), so now he's able to get his lil hands on this thing and it keeps him occupied. He also loves chewing on the necklace whenever I'm holding him or playing with him. I bought the black and white version so that it would easily match whatever I'm wearing.
