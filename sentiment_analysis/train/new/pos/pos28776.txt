The little people I work with just love it.  It creates opportunities for them to extend learning by using fine motor skills as well as communication/language development by vocalizing the sounds the animals make as well as naming the animals.  There is a similar toy with plain colors and pencil line faces that I have used.  However, this Pop Up Farm definitely holds their attention longer with increased interest and activities.
