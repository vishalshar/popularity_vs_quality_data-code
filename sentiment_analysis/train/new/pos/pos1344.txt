I ordered these for my 6 month old who is eager to eat.  We had been using a plastic variety that had a very large (compared to my baby) bowl.  My baby had trouble getting the food out of the bowl.  These also have a very short stem, making it easier for my baby to control.  He is in no way feeding himself, I scoop the food and brig it to his mouth, but he likes to hold the handle too and often sucks on the spoon after the food is in his mouth.  These spoons have been wonderful.  The relatively flat bowl has made it easy for him to get the food, while the handle allows him to hold it too.  Makes me feel like we are moving toward eventual independent eating.  One thing I would like more, is if the handles were rounded or fatter for himt o more easily hold, but he doesnt seem to mind.  He also sucks on the metal stem.
