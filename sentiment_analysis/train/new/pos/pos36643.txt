This set is very pretty and I'm very pleased with it.  The sheet is also pretty, but rips as easily as paper.  It was tight on our standard sized crib and ripped immediately on all ends.  I suggest buying this set, but not buying extras of the sheets that come with it.  I use green, pink, and white solid sheets and they look fantastic.
