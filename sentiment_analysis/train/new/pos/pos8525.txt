Nothing in the ingredients suggests these are more than just sour candies however they are very tasty and do help with my nausea. I tried to replace them with regular sour candies thinking I could find a cheaper replacement but between jolly ranchers (not sour enough) and super lemons/warheads (way too sour) you can see why there is a market for these expensive candies. Order a bulk pack---you will go through them quickly in your first trimester! A great gift for a newly expectant friend!
