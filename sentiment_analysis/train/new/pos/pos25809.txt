I did a lot of research before purchasing this stroller and I am very happy with my decision!!! First of all the price is great because you can not get a decent bassinet stroller for a good price anywhere.  I love the many features this stroller has.  The color that I purchased is blue and the blue online is a little brighter than the actual stroller but I like it more that way.  When I received the stroller I was surprised how small the box was.  The assembly was quick and easy.  I agree with a review from here that the instructions are incomplete and you do have to figure out some things on your own but once you do you will love it.  There are some things that I wish this stroller came along with like a bassinet cover for cold windy days and a rain cover.  I'm having a hard time trying to find a good fitting rain cover for this stroller.  The bassinet is huge, last week I went shopping and fit five gallons of water on the bottom (I probably shouldn't do that because it says not to put more than 10 pounds in the basket).  It rides really smooth and it looks like one of those expensive strollers.  a lot of the parts are plastic so I suggest to be careful with the stroller eventhough it seems to be really sturdy.  I am a tall person so I love love the telescoping handle.  Another great thing about this stroller is that in the bassinet mode you can actually incline a little so that the baby doesn't lay totally flat which is how I keep it all the time and it is good for babies with reflux. The stroller is also a perfect width because my doorway to the building is narrow and I get through it with no problem. Anyone thinking about buying this stroller, go for it!! I highly recommend it!
