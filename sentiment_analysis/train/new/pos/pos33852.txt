I love this bag and use it for the beach, for travel or just everyday when I need to bring a lot of stuff. Unlike other travel bags that I have (I'm a frequent traveler), this one is extremely cute and stylish, and I love the African inspired print. From a practical viewpoint, it's wonderful to wear it both under-the-arm and cross body and all the little extras intended for moms, work well for me too, for example: the little round zippered bag is perfect to put my earrings in when I'm at the beach, and the bigger open bag holds my suntan lotion, and the extra strap secures to my shopping cart. There's lots of little pockets inside the bag to keep me organized and on the outside: I can put my water bottle securely in the side pocket and my i-phone in the outside pocket where it is secured  by the magnetic closure. One tip, make sure to keep your hotel card away from the magnetic outside pocket so it isn't decoded. This does not look like a diaper bag and I get many compliments on it, I won't tell if you won't tell :-) I'm so happy I came across this bag, I love it!
