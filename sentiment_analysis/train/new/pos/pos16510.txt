I have used this baby tooth brush with my kids over and love it.  Whenever I go to replace the baby brush (after illness, new kiddo, just because it's been awhile) I come back to buy this one again.  For us this brush works really well until about age 2.  After that I just use the brushes they get at the dentist.  We've never had mold problems or had it fall apart.  While I can see how it would work ok as a teether I try not to let my kiddo use it as such because it is what appears to be a "regular" baby tooth brush *coated* with a thick layer of silicone.  So a baby with teeth could absolutely chew through it in no time.  My baby does end up chewing on it a bit while brushing, but it's never caused it to break down as others showed.
