I originally purchased similar sheets from another brand, but they kept sending me the wrong size. Fully annoyed, I started to look for alternatives. Boy! Am I glad I did. I love these sheets so far. They fit baby's Naturepedic mattress like a glove, are truly white (a lot of organic sheets are natural or cream colored), and super soft. Most importantly, they are organic. A lot of baby products are treated with nasty chemicals (like fire retardants) in an effort to make them more safe. Recent research suggests these chemicals are highly toxic, if not carcinogenic. Yuck. No need to have to put baby to sleep with a bunch of chemicals. Going organic on the sheets was very important to me. Baby will be spending many hours each night on them.I've only washed them a few times thus far, but they seem to be holding up well. I'll make sure to update my review if I notice pilling, pulled threads, etc. Also, I love the little jersey bags they come with. I plan on using them for storage... maybe to contain small items in my diaper bag or baby socks while traveling... who knows!
