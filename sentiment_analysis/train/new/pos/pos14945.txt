I decided to purchase this one morning when my baby was really gassy. So, I waited to use it the next time he was feeling like that again. Let me tell you. This product really works. My son didn't mind wearing it and it also immediately calmed him down. Keep in mind, I do not put this around his tummy without clothing. I also test the warmth of the bag when it is inside the wrap prior to putting it on my baby to ensure the temperature is acceptable since it will be around his tummy for a few minutes. Overall, I am pleased with this product and would highly recommend this to other parents.
