I bought this car seat to use with my grandchild. He was born a little early and was small but long. He fit nicely in this seat at birth (5# 14 oz) and still is quite comfortable in it at 10# and 20.5". I expect to be able to use it for quite some time. His dad is very tall so the notation that this seat had more leg room was a plus in choosing the seat.I purchased two bases so we could keep the base in the car and move the car seat to whichever vehicle we were using. That is working out perfectly. We've been using it for about 6 weeks. It goes in the back seat and is so easy to move once you know how to do it. It seems sturdy and comfortable. Besides being functional the design is nice.The top of the car seat fits close to the back of the front seats. I am short so that has not been a problem for me. The front seat is pulled up close to the steering wheel to accommodate my short legs. Also, the middle seat of my CR-V has only one latch. When we had the seat inspected, they told us to use the latch from the nearest seat as the second latch. This makes the available space smaller on one side of the vehicle. That is not a problem with the car seat itself though, but rather with my vehicle. However, if you plan to use the latch attachment, you might check your vehicle and find the latches first.
