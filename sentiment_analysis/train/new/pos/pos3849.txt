We call this Bright Starts toy "Mr. Fishy" and every time our daughter sees him her eyes light up and she talks to him, holds him, and plays with him. It was her first toy and she's now 4 months old and shows no sign of losing interest.  The rattle element is the plastic bubble with colorful balls inside. That, the black and white stripes, colorful ribbons, and good plastic handle make for a perfect stimulating toy. We just ordered 3 more so as to protect ourselves if one gets lost.  Mr. Fishy rules!
