We added this Pack 'N Play to our baby registry since the features looked like they would be useful. This is the first Pack 'N Play that I have owned so I wasn't sure what to expect. The directions were fairly simple to follow and only minimal assembly was required for the bassinet support, reversible station, and toy arch.I really like the feel and support of the bassinet. The metal tubing keeps the mattress pretty level and my son seems to be very comfortable sleeping and playing on the mattress.The reversible station is a nice added feature to this version. The napper on one side is slightly sloped and the changing pad on the other is flat with a plastic surface. It is simple to flip with one hand and very convenient to have both readily available. It is nice that the napper is secured on the ends rather than on one side as it is on other models. I feel that this makes it more stable and level. On the down side, it is surface clean only so you can't just throw it into the wash. It is also rather difficult to remove without completely removing the bassinet. Since it also doesn't fit in the travel bag, it's probably something that we'll use only while at home. I agree with another reviewer that the low height of the changing pad reduces its functionality. It hasn't replaced our nursery changing station, but rather provided us with another place change our baby.Overall, I really like this version of the Pack 'N Play. The usefulness and convenience of a reversible station far outweigh any problems I've had with it. My son sleeps in it almost every day and I would highly recommend it.
