We had no idea how versatile stacking cups would be. These things lasted all throughout baby-hood and well into toddler-hood. There are so many of them that you can travel with 3 and keep your kid happy on the airplane for a few minutes. The cups have small holes at the bottom so you can pour water with those (and they prevent suffocation, I guess).The sea friends are cute but not played with as much. Maybe they will be as our child gets a little older.Bonus is that you support a company that tries to be greener than others.
