I have a collection of these fleece/microfleece throws for my sons, they are hit or miss. I buy them when I find a good price and we see what happens. I washed this before use, and it held up perfectly. No little fuzz balls on the rest of my clothes. This is always the first thing I look out for. The picture is nice. The blanket itself is super soft/plush, more so than some of my others. I only wish it were just a little bit bigger. This is on the small side if you have other fleece throws for kids.
