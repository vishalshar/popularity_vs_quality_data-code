This car seat is excellent. It's great having such peace of mind, knowing that if we we're ever to be in a side impact collision, my daughter's head would not flop around. It's also very comfortable for her. She always fought and cried when we put her in her infant carrier, but she sits back and relaxes in this seat, often falling asleep before the car is even moving. The only drawbacks to this seat are it's size...if we had a bigger car, I don't think it would be a problem, but fitting it into our four door 1995 Toyota Corolla was a challenge. We were originally going to put it in the middle, but decided on putting it behind the passenger seat because it is so tall. Seeing over the seat is not a problem though. It's a problem getting my 8 month old daughter into the car seat without hitting her head on the car! I think once we turn the seat forward facing, that problem will disappear, so if you have a car with a lot of clearance overhead, this car seat will work well. I also don't like that the straps seem to twist all on their own. But otherwise, it's a good car seat, one of the safest out there and like other parents, I only want the very best for my child and I believe this is it.
