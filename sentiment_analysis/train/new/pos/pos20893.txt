We picked this chair because it's small and feels sturdy. Plus, it looks nice and it's timeless. I personally don't need all the fancy schmancy features of a high chair that ends up looking more like a space ship instead of a high chair. This chair does the job excellent, I can sit my child and my child eats. Period.The tray comes off easily, you can do it with both hands or one. The pad slides down when you sit the baby, but you can pull it back up once the baby is sitting. Not a big deal for me. Or remove it if "it's too annoying it ruins your day yada yada yada". The pad is made of a plastic material instead of cloth so I find it easier to wipe and keep it clean, it goes high up in the sides so the crumbs don't fall off the chair.  It took my husband about an hour to put it together since he decided to add glue so it stays well together. He said it was easy to put together, it just takes time.I got two. My daughter (14 months) is little messier so I kept the pad of the chair to keep it cleaner. My son is (25 months) and he's pretty neat when eating so I removed the pad.
