BEST baby invention I've seen in awhile.  I was introduced to these by a friend over the summer. She said I could get them at the big box store that starts with a W, but who wants to drag 3 kids there.  Amazon came through again.  My little guy loves homemade baby popsicles.  I've put all sorts of baby food in these and froze them.  He loves them all.  I would say his favorite is when I mash up a fairly ripe banana and then freeze it in these.  The best part is that my 10 month old feels like he gets a popsicle when his big sisters do.  I think it also helps with teething. The nice cool food is very soothing and it's a great portion size, versus the regular sized popsicle trays.  The reason I gave 4 stars is that they are a bit tricky to pull apart when frozen.  I was trying to get one off of the 4 pack when it slipped out of my hand and fell to the floor.  Of course the frozen plastic cracked.  Now I can't stick all 4 back together again.  Oh well.  It makes freezing a little trickier, but these are still worth it.
