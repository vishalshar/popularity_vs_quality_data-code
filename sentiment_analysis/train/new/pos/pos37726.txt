I bought this for myself 3 years ago for my first baby and I am now on baby number 3 and have used the breast packs often! They are the best!  I also love the ribbon in the set used to hook onto the bra strap to know which breast to feed on next. I bought another one of these sets for my sister for her baby shower coming up.
