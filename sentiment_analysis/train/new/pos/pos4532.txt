This is such a great product! It works 100%. Like the other parents' experiences, my 20 month old daughter hates getting water in her eyes during bath time which makes it difficult to wash her hair. I was skeptical at first especially after some of the bad reviews, but for the price I said why not? I paid $1.90 + shipping. I am one of those parents that likes simplicity and doesn't feel the need to "Keep Up With The Joneses" as long as what I'm purchasing gets the job done. I mean $2....my expectations weren't very high to begin with, but so glad I took the risk! The cap is adjustable, so you can find the exact fit. Snaps are better than buttons or hooks as those can tear. It's made of soft foam, so it can stretch a little. I adjusted the cap on the smaller side and just stretched it over her head for a snug fit. The visor completely shields your child's eyes from any direct contact with water. Mine came folded in the mail like another reviewer said, but it straightened out within the first use. Even if it didn't, it would still serve its purpose. You definitely don't want this product to be hard plastic because your child's skin is still very delicate. At first, my daughter was resistant, but after a few tries, she finally understood it was helping her. She also thinks it's fun to see the water trickling off the cap. Lastly, you really only need the cap for like less than 10 seconds each bath time to rinse your child's hair out, so what are people complaining about?  It's a cheap, convenient, fast solution to an every day problem!
