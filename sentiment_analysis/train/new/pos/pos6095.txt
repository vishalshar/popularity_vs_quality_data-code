These are amazing! The pads I had from my first pregnancy just weren't cutting it this time around. I was doubling up on pads at night and was still leaking through! In fact, one night I stuck a thick burp cloth folded up in my bra and it STILL leaked through!These pads have held up every single time. Sometimes when I change the pad in the morning the inside part of it is soaking wet, but it has never leaked through the other side.I would recommend these to anyone, especially those ladies that tend to leak a lot.Oh! And they are quite a bit larger than other pads I've had, which is also quite fabulous for us larger breasted women!
