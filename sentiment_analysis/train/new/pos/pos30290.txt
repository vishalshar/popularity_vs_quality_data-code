I am SO happy that I purchased these, despite the reviews.  My son has a five drawer dresser and loves playing with it.  He has already slammed his little fingers once and I intervened before he did it again.  I needed something that would prevent him from getting into the drawers, but was still convenient for me if I was in a rush.  These have been the perfect answer!  Installed in a few seconds, they close automatically when you shut the drawer (if installed properly, otherwise you have to just make sure it is aligned when you close the drawer).  No matter how much he pulls, he can't get it open and all I have to do is pull back the lever to open the drawer.
