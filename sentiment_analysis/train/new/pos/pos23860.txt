I wholeheartedly agree with another reviewer that this blanket is perfect for daycare or preschool.  It is lightweight, 100% cotton/flannel blanket, providing light warmth.  It is soft and comfortable, not bulky, and folds nicely for storage in cubbies.  It is 60x44, which is a very reasonable size for this purpose.  The colors and designs are bright and cheerful.  This is also a very good "on the go" blanket (airplane travel, a quick trip to grandma's house, sleepovers, etc).  I bought a second one for my emergency bag, which I keep in the trunk of my car, and it's been very useful for our son when daddy blasts the AC, lol.
