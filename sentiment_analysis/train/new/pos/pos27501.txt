I had used the Boppy pillow but it was just too puffy and didn't place my baby at the right angle for breastfeeding. I used this pillow at my lactation consultant's office and fell in love. We had a much easier time getting him to latch and positioned correctly which eliminated the pain I was suffering from. I took off one star because the cover is not removable so there's no way to wash it. Otherwise I would highly recommend over the Boppy.
