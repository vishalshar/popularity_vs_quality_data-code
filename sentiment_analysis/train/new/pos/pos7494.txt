The description says "infant" and my son is almost 8 months old so obviously he fits into this category, right? Well, the Kushies Waterproof Bib is HUGE on him! He is not a small boy by any means (95th percentile for height and weight) but this bib just does not fit. If I use the velcro in the back on the tightest setting the bib only comes up to like half of his chest. I've "made do" by just tucking the bib straps behind him but when he moves it comes untucked. He will eventually grow into it I guess. I was also a little disappointed with the quality; it is very thin and flimsy and when hand washed the edges curl up. I will still use it because I have it but will be purchasing another brand for any additional bibs.Update 11/12/13 - My son is now 2yrs and 8 months old...so we've used this bib for exactly two years. This will give you a good indication of how big it is! It's showing some wear, but otherwise holding up fine. For the money and the amount of use we have gotten out of it, I would definitely say it is a good value. For that, I will upgrade my review from 3 to 4 stars. As long as you have the right expectations when purchasing it (size, material is not like traditional bibs, etc), you won't regret it.  I hope this helps!
