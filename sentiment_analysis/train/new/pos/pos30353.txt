We have this carrier and I absolutely love it!! Easy on, easy off. I love the fact that it is a parent piece and a baby piece and then you put the 2 together. Baby piece fastens on in FIVE places and is completley secure. He seemed really comfortable and loved being so close. I am 5'4" kinda chubby and my husband is 6'4" and kinda thin and it adjusts to fit us both, which is really cool.My son was born over 9 pounds and this carrier was fantastic for a couple of months, but he quickly got heavy enough so the carrier didn't distribute enough of his weight to my hips. Although this did start to hurt my back a little, it wasn't enough to make me stop using it. I got a lot of use out of it until my son as about 6 months old, and I will use it for my next children too.
