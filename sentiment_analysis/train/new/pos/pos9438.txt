We bought the City Mini after considering the Uppababy strollers.  Uppababy was nice and easier to fold than others, but was still a little heavier than we wanted.  We wanted something that folded easily and was lightweight so that my wife could take it in/out of the trunk without straining.  A sales representative suggested we try out the City Mini since we didn't need the bassinet because our child was already 8 months old.We were shocked at how light, durable, maneuverable, and "fold-able" this stroller was, and at a third of the cost of the Uppababy stroller we were looking at!  The sun shade has 3-4 different positions and gets quite low if needed.  Another neat feature is that the sun shade has two peek-a-boo windows.  The major selling point for us was the ease of folding it up, so much that we were driven to make our first video review on Amazon.We wished it came with a belly bar, but saw that we could purchase it separately.  In the end, we bought the child tray instead so we could put things in front of our baby to keep her busy (note that you can keep the tray attached when you fold/unfold the stroller).  Although the 2010 model comes with a larger basket underneath the stroller than the 2009 model, it is difficult to insert a larger diaper bag because of a metal bar located by the opening.  There is no cup holder, but we didn't really care about that.Overall, we would recommend this product.  We are very happy with our purchase.
