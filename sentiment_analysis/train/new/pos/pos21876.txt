These bowls work well but they are not magic. If your kids really want to spill something they will. There is an issue of cereal pieces getting stuck in the rings stopping the gyro effect, but they are easily cleared. I also wouldn't recommend putting in the dishwasher. My wife did with one and it doesn't spin as freely as before, therefore losing its effectiveness. These bowls are really designed for younger toddlers as they mainly prevent accidental spills, older children will find a way to make a mess regardless. Overall I think they are a good purchase as they definitely cut down (but not eliminate) messes to clean up.
