This cover is amazing!!I live in Buffalo NY so it gets pretty coldwith all the carseat safety standards with the jackets being to big & nothing can be between the baby and car seat so it was a given that a snow suite & the bundle me were outYes I'm that mom that follows the safety  word 4 wordI have 2 car seats I tried this on one was a Garco snug ride 25 fit great only place it had a small gap was where the handle is & my second carseat was the Eddie Bauer not sure what seat but its the trail maker travel system. Good fit but there's a little slack so I  just pull it a little more at the bottom. The Eddie Bauer is a smaller seat then Garco but I have the same problem with the Eddie Bauer that o did with Garco there's a gap where the handle meets the carseat I think all car seats  are gonna have this problem ..In one of the reviews I read that the cover don't stay up over the baby. When I got it I looked at it and yes that might be a problem might not haven't had that problem yet but you can put another blanket on the outside when going from the car to where like a carseat canopy or you can attach Velcro to it both easy quick fixesOver all i would definitely recommend this to a friend
