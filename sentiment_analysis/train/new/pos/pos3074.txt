These are the perfect fit for what I needed!!! Finally something that is bigger, safe, and easy to clean. You can dishwash these. I make my son's baby food. I used to use icecube trays, but these are by far the best to use for baby food storage instead. Especially if your baby wants bigger portions. He eats about 2 of these per meal, but i love that i can throw a lid on it and put it in the fridge for him to finish the next meal if he's full. I love that these prevent freezer burn. They keep the food nice and fresh and it's also safe to use these in the microwave if you need to take the chill off, heat up,  defrost, or if you prefer putting them in a hot bath, like i do, or a cold bath to thaw is great because they don't leak or let any water in. I love traveling with them, too. So, i basically will be using these for quite a long time because they are perfect for what i need!!!!!
