We love this product! I have twin girls and we use two of them on our city select stroller. The girls love being able to move around, which is much better than being confined to a car seat. My girls are 3 months and will still have plenty of room to grow - I can see us using these for several more months.A few words of wisdom:1. You cannot fit two babies in one bassinet. I'd hoped, since my girls were little, that we could use one bassinet for a while (since they're pricey, and they do love to be close to each other). But they were squished right away, even at only 5 pounds each.2. This is a bassinet KIT, not an assembled bassinet. It's very easy to make the conversions, but it will ship in a flat box. You need to use the hood from the seat if you want one on the bassinet.3. If you use 2 bassinets, there isn't really room for a toddler to ride on the glider board (purchased separately). Their belly will hit a bassinet. We found that out the hard way but will save the glider for when the girls are in seats.
