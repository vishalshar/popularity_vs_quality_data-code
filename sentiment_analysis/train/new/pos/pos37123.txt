I bought this ornament for my daughter to hang on her tree to commemorate the birth of her son.  Unfortunately we forgot to buy it in 2012 when he was born so to find it in 2014 was a wonderful surprise!  The ornament is nice and who doesn't like Pooh?  My daughter seems to be very happy with the item and I know it will hang on her Christmas trees for many years to come.
