I wasn't sure what to expect from this playard since the reviews are SO mixed.  I had a $50 Amazon gift certificate and needed a safe place for my son to sleep downstairs.  This seemed to fit the bill as long as it worked!!It arrived super quickly, which was a big plus.  I was able to set it up in less than 5 minutes.  I did have to re-read the directions a couple of times because putting it up isn't intuitive at all.  At first I couldn't get the top rails to lock (a common complaint), but I just read the directions again.  It says that the four feet should be almost touching each other when you lock the top rails.  It worked!  After that it was a piece of cake.I'm extremely happy with it!  I didn't need anything extra like a bassinet, changing pad, mobile, or vibrations so this was the perfect model for me.  I just need to get to BRU and pick up some Pack 'n Play sheets for it, and it will be perfect.
