Different things work for different babies and this happened to work for our little rough sleeper. It has made naps and overnights a lot easier. If I could make one recommendation, it would be to buy big. Our 3 month old is 16 lbs and we could barely squeeze him into the small size (rated up to 18 lbs) and had to order the large size after about a week.
