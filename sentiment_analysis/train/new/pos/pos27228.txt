I got it a few days ago and I love the bright colors it matches my room perfect Winnie the pooh theme with his brown crib.And love the price for it wish the matching sheet went down in price will wait for it. Only thing I don't like about it is the holes where the straps goes through on both side it not cut all the way to put an strap through it.Seem like I may have to cut it to get the strap though it and I just left it alone don't want to rid it.
