I had high hopes for this item. My son used this walker from when he was about 4 months until 13 months. At first it was used as a stationary play station but within a couple months i converted it to a walker. To convert it to a walker, stoppers needed to be unscrewed so that the wheels would be able to be used. This was time consuming because there were quite a few stoppers. The positive thing about there being so many stoppers though is that in the stationary position, it was very stable.My son loved the walker. He basically pushed forward to make the walker move. It did not encourage him to walk but it did encourage him to be mobile. The motions he used to move in the walker were much different than those he used when attempting to walk.I bought this walker because I liked that there were only a few items for him to play with but there was a downside to this. He was quickly put off by the lack of toys and wanted other toys to keep him occupied.To convert the walker to one which he could push, was very easy. The seat was removed (which was great for when it needed to be washed.I found the product to be too big for this purpose. It was so large that it was so hard for him to maneuver around the apartment. He became quite frustrated about not being able to move about at his leisure.This item is large and therefore the fact that it can fold down is nice. It can be placed to the side when not in use. When compressed it is still pretty big however, but does not take up as much space.The walker is easy to clean. This too is a plus. When I bought this item, it was inexpensive and therefore a good buy.
