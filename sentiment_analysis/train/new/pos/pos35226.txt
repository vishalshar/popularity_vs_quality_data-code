I'm quite happy with this monitor. I can see both kids in their separate rooms on one screen. It's easy to use, the picture is really clear (even with the night vision, which comes on automatically when the room is dark), and the sound sensitivity is really good. I also love the background noise blocking feature. We use white noise for both kids, and found that we couldn't use a regular audio monitor because it would just pick up the white noise. This one blocks out the white noise and just picks up any new noise. My only complaint (and it's a pretty major one - definitely a feature that should be fixed) is that you can only hear one room at a time, and you have to select which one you want to listen to. So, even though you can see both rooms, you can only hear the one you've selected. Ideally, the monitor would listen to both rooms, and alert you when there's noise in either one (or at least, that setting should be an option).
