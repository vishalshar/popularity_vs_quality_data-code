Good size for 2 year old. In CA with the drought, my tub uses about 40 gallons to get to even a 4" depth-not practical for a nightly bath. This uses maybe 4 gallons to be nice and deep for him.  The suction cup seems to work fine on the shower stall wall, although I just store this inflated and upside down in the empty tub when we're done.  So far it's been great. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the inflator valve on the bottom won't push in flush. According to the directions it should, so I chalk it up to a defect in this particular tub. A little disappointing, but since it doesn't seem to affect the use I'm opting to keep it and not bother with an exchange hassle.
