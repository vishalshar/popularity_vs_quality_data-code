This isn't the best swing in the world, I would actually have rated it a little lower if my baby didn't love it so much--he doesn't care about the things that bother me!  We purchased this swing after the motor stopped working on his old swing, which was a Fisher-Price swing in the same style as this one (just a different theme and it was several years old).  The old swing was perfect, sturdy, great performance (although it did go through batteries pretty quickly).  Apparently these swings aren't made as well as they once were--the plastic is thinner and seems cheap, the frame of the swing rocks as he swings--not enough to turn over, just enough to be annoying to me.  The mobile was made wrong in the factory and would not spin all the way around because two of the arms were pointing in the wrong direction and wouldn't pass the swing bar--so I had to forcefully bend them down, which marred the plastic, but at least my baby can enjoy the mobile now.  I will say that the batteries are lasting much longer in this swing, and it has the bonus option of plugging in to an outlet, which is handy.  The theme is also cute.  The important thing is that it seems to be safe and my baby loves it, which is why I gave it four stars despite my complaints about it.  If I had it to do over though, I probably would have spent the extra money to get a better swing.
