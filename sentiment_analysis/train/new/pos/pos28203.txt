Easy to assemble,. and install.We have a drive way that is too close to a busy road, and we have a basketball goal.  Without some form of blockade along the side of my drive, these do not mix well.This WILL stop a rolling basketball and other balls from rolling under.  For added measure I used 2 ground spikes to keep the bottom of the netting held down on my yard.  If you use this at the end of your driveway over concrete you cant do this, but the net is still strong enough to stop a ball from going under.
