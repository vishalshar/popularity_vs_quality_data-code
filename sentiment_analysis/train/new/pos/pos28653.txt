We were hesitant about buying this bedding set after reading some of the reviews which said it was "noisy."  While the butterfly and flower do make a crunching noise when squeezed, it has not bothered my daughter at all. She loved this bedding for her new big girl bed right away. It has held up for 6 months now so far.  She even prefers to sleep on the duvet pillow cover rather than the regular pillow case (which I can't figure out why since it wouldn't be as soft on your face).  I would purchase this item again.
