Hey... REAL men make babies and take good care of their babies!!  Right?In my humble opinion this Moby Wrap is better for men then for women... on account of us guys being rather and generally "flat chested!" -- there is more room for baby! Holds you kid snuggle-close and I think good for cold weather for that reason too. Nice design. Kid has good air flow (they are not enclosed -- open pocket from above and you can look down and see the little babe. Got a big enough coat you can zip it up to include baby.I was thinking that I could get a white one as a gift for friends having babies -- baby showers, etc. and do a painting on it with an airbrush and acrylic airbrush fabric paints making it into a one-off product!!Guys... take some of the load off your lady's feet... get yourself Moby Wrap.  Chicks are impressed by this... REALLY!!!Jay D. Anderson
