I was so happy this fit on my Snap 3 stroller!!! I love using wasted space & this bag does just that.My youngest and I used it at the zoo in the mid 70s w/ and ice pack and yogurts & string cheeses were perfect. It is SMALL. It will hold a 6 pack, BUT ONLY A 6 PACK, NO ICE. Think 4 cans of pop and 2 ice packs.We are going to Disney in Sept. with our 4 kids (11, 9, 8, and 2). If we don't use it as a cooler, it will be great to hold everyone's sunglasses, sunscreen, or granola bars, apples, etc. No matter how you use it, it's extra storage!!!
