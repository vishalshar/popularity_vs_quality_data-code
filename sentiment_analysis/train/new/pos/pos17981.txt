I've had this for about 2 weeks and it has stayed fixed on my ceramic tile shower wall without budging a millimeter.  I can easily put the weight of my leg on it and probably more, though that is all I need.  I was worried when I saw several reviews complaining that it did not stay in place, but mine at least stays very well.There are a couple of reasons why others might be having trouble.  First, the suction cup will only work on a perfectly smooth, non porous surface.  Glazed ceramic tiles work great, but only if the tiles are at least 6 inches square.  If they are smaller than that, the suction cup won't fit on a single tile, and air will get in along the grout lines.  Plastic or glass surfaces should also work so long as they are smooth.  If you have textured or bumpy walls, the suction cup will not work as they will not create an air tight seal.  Another problem may be that you attached the suction cup when it and the wall were dry.  I've found that all suction cups tend to work better when they are slightly wet.  Run your shower for a minute before attaching this, and hold it under the water for a second or two.  The water helps to create the air tight seal.  If you still can't get it to work, try sending it back for a replacement, as you may just have a defective one.UPDATE:  After two years of use, I am still very happy with the product.  It does come off occasionally.  About once a month or so it falls off, but it easily re-attaches and then holds firm again.  For the cost and convenience, I think it is well worth getting if you have a small shower with no room for a larger shower stool.
