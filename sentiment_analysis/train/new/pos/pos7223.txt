My son likes to grab his bottle, but has a hard time holding on.  I kept wishing I could find handles for his bottle, but Lifefactory currently doesn't make this add-on feature.  Since we will be using the bottles with the sippy top too, I really was hoping to find something that would work (especially as the bottles can get a bit slippery when wet, even with the silicone sleeve.)  These bottles handles, even though they are made for the organickidz bottles, work great!  They are a bit snug, but I would rather have them be snug than loose.  The hole fits over the top of the bottle and the handle arms rest on top of the silicone sleeve or in the holes.  I am thrilled that I was able to find handles that work with his bottles!
