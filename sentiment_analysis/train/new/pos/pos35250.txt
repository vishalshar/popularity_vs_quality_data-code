Other reviews have said that this was flimsy and not like the photo, however for the price it is great.  Yes it is not stiff and will shift out of place, but so long as you make sure it is in place when you place your child in its seat, you're golden.  I am sure this will be invaluable in the future for the new car seat we've bought.  Learned my lesson having to wash and re-wash and re-wash the last one with diaper accidents.
