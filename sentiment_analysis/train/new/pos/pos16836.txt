I have ordered this item twice for my kids. The first order arrived with the product looking like the product advertised (Regalo Sleep Tite Extra Long Drop Down Bed Rail). Few months later I ordered the same item for my youngest child, but it arrived in a package that was completely different (colored vs 1 color). At the time I thought they had upgraded the packaging and just opened the package and threw the box away. I did notice that it came with an extra item (a carrying bag) that was not included with the first order. Again, I thought it was just a packaging upgrade.Few days ago we tried to put the item together and noticed that:1. item does not look like the one we ordered the first time (it's labeled as Portable Bed Rail on the manual and it does not have the same dimension as the Extra Long)2. plastic parts that holds the strap together arrived broken (Extra Long Drop Down Bed Rail's is made of metal)I came back to this page thinking Amazon made a mistake sending me the wrong item, but I see that the model number listed is identical to the "wrong" item we received (2204). Not sure what to make of this, just be aware when you order you may be sent a "wrong" item.Regarding actual product review, I personally love Extra Long Bed Rail, it's sturdy simple to put together and my 33 lbs son sleeps pressed against it every night for about 9 months now and it has not budged. I would give it 5 stars for function, but I took out a star for confusion over model number (and minor inconvenience). Regarding the issue #2 listed above, I contacted Regalo about the broken parts and they were very understanding and told me they would send me a replacement part.
