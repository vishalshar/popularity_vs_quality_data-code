I ordered this hamper to give some contrast to the Nojo Little Birds (primarily pinks with green and blue as secondary colors) nursery theme I have in babies room. The hamper is very cute and comes with a removable netting for laundry days. My only complaint is that one of the front legs doesn't sit on the ground. It's a little wobbly, but I figure once there are clothes etc in there the weight will make it stay put. I do think it's a little pricey for a hamper, but cheaper than Sears. Plus you can't beat free super saver shipping!!
