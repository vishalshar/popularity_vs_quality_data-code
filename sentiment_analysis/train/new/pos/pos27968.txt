I love the handles on this Nuby cup, design wise. I know the newer one has different handles. I have not used the newer handle myself, but this one, with the rubber parts, gives a good grip for my 1.5 old.Also, i can take this anywhere, including  the car rides, since this straw doesnt leak. It took few days for my daughter to figure out how to use this kind of straw at first when she was 12mos old. Ever since she figured it out, this cup has been her favorite. This cup is good for playtime too because i know that wherever she leaves the cup, the liquid inside wont leak. I left this cup in the corner of her room for few days at first for her to examine and play with it, then she just kinda figured out  how to use one day. So its not impossible if you are worried about it being difficult to use. Its something that can be learned I think. I can be patient for few days or even a week for a non leaking straw cup!One trick i needed to learn though, was that because of the pressure when the lid is closed with the liquid inside, you want to close the straw then tighten the cap. Plus, i found out that i didnt need to tighten it so hard. When i did, water came upwards through the straw because of the pressure. When i released the cap a little, water went back down, and still nothing leaked.I have same exact cup i got from Target in different color, and that one doesnt seem to do this as much, but it also does sometimes. Just need to get used to how tight you need to close the cap.Fyi, i got blue/green combination colors as random.
