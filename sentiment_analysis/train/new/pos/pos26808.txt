This chair is height adjustable (very easily done) and also has decent wheels which move through carpet without much fuss.  The wheels are lockable.  The tray is a bit large (13" x 23") for the size of the chair but we aren't complaining.  The footprint of the chair is also large, 33" x 21", meaning the distance between the front wheels and back wheels is 33".  The seat level at its highest position is at 25" high from floor.Seat material is a little cheap kind -- rough plastic.  But it is easy to clean after the baby makes a mess.  The seatbelt helps to keep the baby securely placed.  It was easy to assemble too.  The material used is not of highest quality but good enough to last through the stage when the baby needs it.  Parents with further babies on the way may think of a more sturdy chair though.We feel it is a good buy at around $60 which we paid in April 2009.
