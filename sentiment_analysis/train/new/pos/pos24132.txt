The base was easy to assemble, once I got me four year old to hold the other side up....Lol. Other then that the rest was easy  once you put the actual tub on top of the base before screwing the changing table on. Love this bathinette because I am getting a cesarean and do not want to do too much bending while bathing my bundle of joy. The bonus of being able to fold it up is great. Not having a big bulky tub cluttering up the bathroom floor is nice. I am giving this product four stars only because, I think that they could've brought the price down from $100.00 to $50.00; since it's just a tub on a stand....That's my opinion.
