I have two faves and I alternate between the two for various reasons.  I am pumping 100% because my daughter will not latch on (another story - issues with losing >10% and having to supliment with a bottle with expressed milk - nipple confusion) so finding the right pad to put on always sensitive nipples is critical.  Writing the same review for both.FavesPhilips AVENT Disposable Nursing PadsPROS:- Softer than Lansinoh- works really well when nipples are very tender and drying out makes it worse- regardless of what cream/balm I used, sore nipples / cracks / splits / healing wounds do not stick (only occasionally)CONS:- they are a little bulkier than Lansinoh so they may show through some bras- when I was in the leaking stage (or when I go a little too long between my night and morning pumping session) I have occasionally leaked through the padLansinoh Disposable Nursing PadsPROS:- Thinner and larger in diameter than Avent- keeps nipples drier- I don't think that I have ever leaked throughCONS:- not as soft as Advent- sore nipples / cracks / splits / healing wounds stick to pad and sometimes tear off scabs (sorry this sounds so gross, but it happens)I usually use Avent when my nipples are in bad shape (seems to go in cycles) because they are softer and my wounds don't stick and then switch to Lansinoh when they are healing and need to dry out.
