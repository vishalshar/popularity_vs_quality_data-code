I am trying to buy second carseat for my toddler for my second vehicle and came across this new concept carseat.The product build is reasonable, design is comfortable. Overall, just for the carseat part, its good.Technology: I had a missing Bluetooth receiver on the carseat. Customer support helped me to get a replacement. But still my iphone is not able to detect the carseat. Struggling for the past two weeks before finally returning or requesting a replacement from the manufacturer.Customer support: I had a very good experience with the customer support so far. They have sent a replacement of the bluetooth device. Their response is very prompt.I will see if I can get this worked out by myself, I am good, if not, I will ask the manufacturer help.I do recommend this carseat despite my initial issues with it.
