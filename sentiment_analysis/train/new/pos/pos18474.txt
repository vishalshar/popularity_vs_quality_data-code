My baby loved this swing! I was scared to buy this at first because I read the reviews from past buyers and they said how it makes too much squeaking noise and that it doesn't stay balanced. It's all bull. There is no squeaky noise and if it doesn't stay balanced it's because you're not putting the paddles far apart.Overall, it's a great baby swing. It's got pretty music with light and the butterflies move around. That would always entertain my baby that she would fall asleep on her own. She's 7 months now and still using it.
