I bought this product because I wanted wash cloths that were gentle on my baby's skin and because I was impressed by the high reviews online. I was a bit wary about the price, because these aren't cheap, so I thought long and hard before making the purchase. After buying them and using them on my baby during her first year, I am very satisfied with the product and feel it was well worth the price. They are noticeably softer and gentler than other baby wash cloths on the market. I'm not obsessed with using organic products, but I know that potentially harmful pesticides are heavily used on conventional cotton products, so it's nice to have organic wash cloths that I can also use to clean my daughter's mouth and gums. Even if these are the only wash cloths that you have for your baby (it comes in a pack of 5), it is worth the price if you could afford it (or you can register for it on your baby registry!) Of course, some parents won't want to spend this much on wash cloths, especially if their baby's skin isn't too sensitive. However, based on my experience as a frugal and cautious shopper and mommy, I feel that these wash cloths lived up to the hype. I am a satisfied customer, and I give it 5 stars.
