I have a little girl...first girl after two boys, so her room is decked out and very feminine.  This toy didn't exactly go with the room decor, but after reading reviews, I thought I'd give it a try.  My first child had a Pooh bear hanging above his changing table, and he'd talk to it at every diaper change.  I wanted something similar for my daughter.I hadn't put the toy up at first because it didn't "go" in the room.  After many unhappy diaper changes, I finally hung it.  She LOVES it!  Now the changing table is her favorite place to hang out and play.  It entertains her for at least 20 minutes every time- enough time to fold and put away laundry and gets lots of things done that moms need to do.  Run to the bathroom perhaps?Her favorite is the lion.  She also talks to the animals on the side.  She smiles and lights up and coos and talks.  It's very cute.It's very lightweight.  I have it hung by a small picure hanging bracket.  It may not be the prettiest thing, and the colors may not be your favorite.  You may even find it gaudy, but your child will love it!
