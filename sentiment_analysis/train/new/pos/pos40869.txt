Just over a year ago my son bought a blanket like this for his new born nephew.  The whole family fought over it as they all thought the material was beautiful.  My grandson dragged this blanket all over with him as a comforter and it has now started to look a bit shabby.  Hence the purchase of this second blanket.  Unable to find a similar one in the UK I ordered this from Amazon in the States.  It arrived in less than a week and even with the postage, worked out cheaper than the original blanket purchased last year.  This blanket is so soft but does not shed any of it's pile therefore it is suitable for even the smallest child.  The design is very attractive as well.  Would definitely recommend and would certainly purchase another.
