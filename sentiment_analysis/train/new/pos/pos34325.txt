These are so much easier to use than the cups with all the parts. I buy this and the Mini Brush Combo Pack (Sippy Cup Straw and Spout/Lid Cleaning Brush) and we're good to go! I started using these after my first child's 1st birthday. The second child started learning to use this at six months. It was perfected by 7 months and is still a favorite. It is spill proof but does not require too much sucking. The only down side is that as with all straw cups, the pressure build-up inside of the cup from liquids being warmer than the external temperature will more than likely cause milk to spout through the top of the straw if the cap is screwed on tight. This happened with EVERY straw cup that I have used so no use deducting a star for that. Great product.
