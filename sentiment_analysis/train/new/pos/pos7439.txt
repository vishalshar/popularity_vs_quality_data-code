I bought this for carpooling.  I wanted to find the narrowest booster possible since the space I have available is small.  This one was the narrowest I could find.  I would have loved a latch booster for safety reasons, but my car only can latch in two carseats at a time, so I needed one that didn't use latch.  For anyone that is worried about width, yes the cupholders can be tucked in so they don't add to the width of the seat.  They slide right in and line up with the rest of the seat when closed.
