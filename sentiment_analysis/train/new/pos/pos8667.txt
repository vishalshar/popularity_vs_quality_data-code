With all of the discussion about mold in the sippy cups I was glad that these are the only ones we have ever used. This cup is extremely is to clean and use, it can even be put into the dishwasher. The cup has vibrant colors and cute designs. My 2 yr old loves using these sippy's.**If you find this review helpful, please click yes to let me know. If you have any questions, just ask! :)**
