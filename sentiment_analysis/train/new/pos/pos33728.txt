As I get older, I get more fearful of the day my teeth will fall out of my head. So after my dentist informed me that I should be brushing my teeth twice a day for no less than two minutes each session, I decided to get a timer to ensure I am following his instructions precisely. I could just use the timer on my phone, but I don't like to set my phone near the sink while water is running.This timer was relatively cheap for its purpose, and I'm not afraid of dropping it in the sink or getting toothpaste near it if I have an errant expectoration issue.Sometimes if I turn it too far past the 2 it won't start, but all it takes is a little nudge to get it on its way. I imagine if you have kids this would be a great timer for them to use as well. Easy for small hands to start, and the noise makes it obvious when your two minutes are up.
