I thought I was suffering from usual nipple pain and cracking related to starting to breastfeed until the lactation consultant at the hospital suggested perhaps the pain was coming from the fact that my nipples were rubbing against the sides of the flanges while I pumped. The flanges that came standard with the pump rubbed my nipples the whole way around the whole time I was pumping. Once I ordered these, it only took two pumping session with these x-large flanges to completely heal my nipples and stop all pain! I can't believe I didn't know about these sooner, but I have since bought 3 pairs of them so that I don't have to wash them as often, and they are a huge lifesaver. Highly recommended. Also check out the Hygeia site for more information about proper fit of the flanges, they have a very useful diagram to help determine if you are suffering fro this problem too.
