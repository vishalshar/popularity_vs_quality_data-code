5/1/2012: We've had these pacifiers since Super Bowl weekend (beg of Feb). We do love them, but they do require more work to clean, so we don't use them as often. True, they don't fall open on the floor, but they still need to be washed. You have to wash them in warm soap water, so it takes more time than the dishwasher. Not a lot more time, but with babies, it's hard to find time to do this sometimes. Only other issue, they don't always close when they hit the floor. Usually they do, but it's about a 5% chance it doesn't close, espcially if it's on carpet. Otherwise, good product. I wouldn't pay the $7 I did for the baseball one again, but the $4 ones are okay on price.PS: You also can't have the baby sleep with this pacifier because it closes and they can't open it on their own until about 11/12 months.
