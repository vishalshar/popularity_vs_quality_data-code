Three year old loves this toothpaste so much she won't spit it out! I guess that's ok for now since it doesn't contain fluoride. I'm torn between sticking with this and getting a different kind that she enjoys less. Something less yummy might make training her to spit out toothpaste easier. At least she looks forward to brushing her teeth!
