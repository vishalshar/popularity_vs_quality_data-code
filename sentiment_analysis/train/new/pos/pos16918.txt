This crib, once built is more beautiful in person than in pictures.  However, my only hang-up with it, was that there were a couple of nicks and scratches on it when we received it.  They weren't super significant, but the point is, if we're buying a NEW item, it should be in perfect NEW conditions.  This had NO reflection on the seller we bought it from because we had no interaction with the seller and no issues.  However, just know that if you are ordering this, this item is HUGE! My husband was home all day waiting for FedEx to deliver the item, and I get home from work, and there was a ticket on the door.  I call, they re-deliver the same day and we come to find out that the FedEx guy didn't even bother to take it out of the truck, because he could NOT carry it by himself, it is WAY too heavy for one person to carry.Other than the nicks and scratches that it had, it is an absolute BEAUTIFUL crib and EXTREMELY sturdy!  We love it and it fits well in our apartment.  However, my suggestion would be, to build the crib where you plan on having it, once it's built, its VERY difficult to move.
