I bought this for my 5 year old son.  He is in school for a full day and I need to send milk, water, 2 snacks, lunch and an ice pack is required.  Finding a lunchbox that fits everything without being bulky has been a challenge.  The dimensions of this lunchbox are ideal for the number of items and the containers we like to use- the milk is in a 12-oz double-walled stainless steel bottle and we are able to use a plastic sandwich box (something I could not use with our previous standard sized lunch box).  In addition to it's size, it is extremely well made.  I highly recommend this lunchbox.
