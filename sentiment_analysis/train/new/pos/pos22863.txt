Highly recommended!  I purchased this diaper wallet specifically for a Disney World trip with a 15 month old.  We were able to keep three size 4 Pampers (fresh out of the package, when they are still condensed) in the section with the pad. I packed a chunk of wipes in the wipes section each morning and put the diaper wallet in the netting under our umbrella stroller.  It was perfect! I didn't need my bulky diaper bag! The wallet is easy to grab for diaper changes, the hard plastic makes it easy to hold under my armpit. Convenient to use on the changing tables.  I continue to use the diaper wallet for day trips.  These days we only need the diaper wallet every few days or sometimes weeks.  The wipes are always wet too!  Just be sure you have secured it both inside and out. I seriously tell all my mom friends about this and I am purchasing it now for a gift. Great product!
