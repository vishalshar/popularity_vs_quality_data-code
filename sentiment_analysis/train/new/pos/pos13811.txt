The only pacifier my daughter would take. We got a couple from the hospital and the vanilla was so soothing. This was the perfect size for her little mouth and we needed more asap! So, I turned to Amazon. I get gobs of these everywhere, less we end up somewhere with no binky, which was so unacceptable!!! Now, there are two of these buried in a Build a Bear animal that we used to break her binky habit! These were a lifesaver in our house!
