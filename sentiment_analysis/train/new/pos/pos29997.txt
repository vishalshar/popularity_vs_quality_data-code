I wanted a fast reading thermometer to use on my Son when he is sick.  The Safety 1st 8 Second Digital Thermometer works like a charm. It reads the temperature really fast between 8-10 seconds and appears to be fairly accurate.  I compared it with other thermometers I have around the house and the temperature was maybe a fraction of a degree off of those.  To me it's accurate and the way it takes the temperature so quickly is such a great thing when dealing with a sick and fussy child.  I would highly recommend this thermometer to parents who are in the same situation and want fast and accurate temperature readings.  Oh and it has a soft flexible tip for comfort.  My Son now does his own temp even when he is not feeling the best.  Win win all around. You will not be disappointed if you purchase the Safety 1st Hospital Choice 8 Second Digital Thermometer.
