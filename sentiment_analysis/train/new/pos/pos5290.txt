I ordered these "keys" along with several other teethers for my 8 month old, hoping that something would finally ease his frustration with all the ones he had tried either being too hard or too soft, or unable to get them to the right spot in his mouth.  Out of everything I purchased, he loves these the best!  They are firm enough to help his teeth cut, but soft enough and have some give so he's not hurting the teeth he already has.  The wood also has a smooth texture, but isn't too slippery when wet so he can actually hold it without it sliding out of his hands or out of his mouth.  The different shapes and sizes keep things interesting and each one can hit a different spot, which is super helpful since his front teeth and molars are coming in... YAY! lol  I would definitely recommend these over the mass-produced plastic crap on the market!
