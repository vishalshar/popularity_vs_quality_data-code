If this monitor cost more, I probably would have given it fewer stars, but for the price I think it's amazing. Its main negatives are that you can't mute it - the volume is always on, and the 'night-vision' video is not the greatest -- and it's always on night-vision since her room is so dark for naps, so this is kind of annoying. If she's lying down, it's hard to tell where she is, which I think would make it tough to use for a newborn. We're using it it to make sure our 2-year-old is not climbing out of the bed or doing anything dangerous, so it's fine for us. Things I like were - mostly the price - and that it's got a somewhat heavy plastic surround because it makes it a little more heavy duty when it inevitably gets into our toddler's hands. I also like that it's fairly simple to use --  just plug in and go. We haven't had the reception problems some reviewers have complained about. We live in a small, two-story house. It blinked off a couple times one night but we moved a glass that was near the antenna and it was fine again.
