When our grandbaby was in the drooling stage, we would go through several of these a day. They are soft enough, hold up through multiple washings, and best of all, they're 100 percent organic cotton. They fit nicely around a tiny neck, neither too tight nor too loose, and they keep onesies and shirts dry underneath so you don't have to change clothing.The reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because of the industrial-strength velcro. It is difficult enough to peel back with two hands, let alone when you're juggling a baby on your lap. One time, she tossed her head just as I was unfastening the velcro and the rough side caught her neck, leaving an abrasion that took awhile to disappear. We have used a lot of bibs over the years, and this is the first that had such tight velcro. For grandparents or caregivers with a touch of arthritis, they can be particularly difficult to use.
