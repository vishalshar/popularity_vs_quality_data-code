We just recently added this 2nd camera to our first one as well as monitor.  It was very easy to connect with our existing monitor and works great.  Note that there is no way to adjust this camera from the monitor and that is all done manually so you need to position this prior to leaving the room.  The monitor iteself will go in to scan mode when both are connected so it stays on each camera with sound for about 10-12 seconds or so before switching over.  There is a speaker so that through the monitor, you can tell your child, "I'll be right there!"  That's a great feature of these cameras.  The quality is excellent and give you exactly what you need.  A nice expansion to your system and monitor that is easy to use and of high quality.  We have been using it for 4 months now and had no problems.  It has been dropped on the carpet a couple of times and is durable enough to survive those several falls.
