When I first got the bag I thought the color was a bit too neon for me but I decided that the great features of the bag far outweighed the color.  Now, I am way over the color and actually really like it now.  I think this bag is amazing.  I love all the room, tons of pockets, it's easy to wear, it's iPod friendly and I really like that it hangs from my stroller.  I think they thought of just about everything when designing this bag.  I recommend this bag to every mom out there.  Don't be afraid of the green.  It's totally retro and it grows on you very fast.  I'd buy it all over again.
