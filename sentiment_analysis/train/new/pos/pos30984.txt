The monitor has excellent sensitivity (can hear the baby in a 20X30 room even though the monitor is plugged in one one wall and a TV is playing in the room) and good monitor to speaker range (at least 40 feet through 2 walls)Major draw back it the units are not battery powered (actually I like this because no issues with dead batteries or recharging).  Extension cords work just fine if you can't mount the units directly to the wall.
