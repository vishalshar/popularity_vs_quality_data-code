Almost all the one star reviews are because they didn't read the instructions that came with the sippy cup. Yes, if you don't pinch the straw in the right spot to activate the straw it WILL be impossible to get liquid from it! And yes, if you don't read the directions, once you take the cup apart it absolutely WILL be impossible to put back together. I know firsthand because I skipped the directions and had both problems and then went straight to the reviews, looked at the 1 star complaints, and almost threw it in the trash. But seriously, if you read the directions, this sippy cup is by far the best one we have had. We had the other Munchkin one with the weighted straw and the handles which is a great sippy cup but certain ones leak and certain ones don't close properly (not all of those are made equal) so one day I threw in the towel on those and I'm so glad I found this one!! (For age reference, my son is 15 mo old).
