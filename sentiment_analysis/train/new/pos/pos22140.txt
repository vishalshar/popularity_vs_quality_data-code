We first bought the Meeno Seat Liner, which left our daughter sweating profusely after a blocks of walking under the low 80s temperature (we live in NYC). We returned that and hoped the Geleeo would perform better. However, the body heat of the baby would transfer to the gel after just a few blocks of walking too. We needed to take the baby out in an airconditioned room to let the gel pad cool down.After much research, this was a last resort and wished we got this in the first place! We wasted so much time in testing out the other products. We used Manito on a day that was even hotter and less windy than the days we used the Meeno & Geleeo, walked the same number of blocks and baby came back dry & most importantly happy and not fussy!Be sure to use the colored side up in hot weathers. I have not tried the other side for cooler weathers (it's supposed to do the opposite and keep baby warm).UPDATE:We have both the Uppababy Vista and Uppababy G-Luxe, it fits for both.
