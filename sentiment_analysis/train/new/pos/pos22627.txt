I bought this blanket for my niece to come home from the hospital in. Six months later, she loves it and uses it as her blankie. It's soft and fluffy, and a perfect baby blanket. I had planned to get her name embroidered on it, but that didn't happen, and I'm glad it didn't because it would have taken away from how soft and fluffy the blanket is.
