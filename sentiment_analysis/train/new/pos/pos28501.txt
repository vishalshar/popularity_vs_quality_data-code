Perfect mini gift boxes with a safari theme for a baby shower!  The set of 24 is a sure fire hit with all attending the baby shower as they go well on a table for each person to grab one, or two, and take home.  The boxes can be filled with candy, but I don't recommend putting unwrapped pieces of candy inside the boxes as they tend to stick together and some may melt and seep through the walls of the mini gift box.  There are cute little safari animals on top which are perfect for a safari themed party or baby shower.  I highly recommend this product!!
