I get so many compliments on my ergo and I feel great wearing it.  I love that this version doesn't have the pouch-- it makes it less bulky.  The colors are brilliant, it's totally comfy, I can nurse in it while walking or pushing my bigger kid on the swings.  I do not use the infant insert, just a blanket in the beginning.  You may note though that it does not fit a person with a 44 waist.  I was a bit disappointed my husband can't use it.  Although I got this for my third baby, I've also used it with my toddlers-- both in the front and back.  One night my two younger ones had fallen asleep in the double stroller and we had a longish walk home from dinner, so  I put my 3 1/2 year old on my back with the ergo and wear able to get home with no fuss. Another time my 2 year old was having one of those overtired tantrums and I put him in the ergo and he calmed down!  Wish I had it for my first two when they were babies.
