I saw that several other parents complained that the cup leaked, but my one year old gets less drink on himself with this than any other sippy cup - probably because the liquid is a little harder to suck out than with other cups.  I expect him to get a little messy.  If you're concerned about leaking, get the package with extra straws.  As he gets a little better at drinking through a straw I anticipate switching to another cup which will let him drink faster, but this is excellent as a first sippy cup.
