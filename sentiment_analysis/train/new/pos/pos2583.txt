I bought them for my grandson (now 2) who now takes them EVERYWHERE! Yes, when I say 'them' I mean BOTH blankets go not just one! My daughter asked me for another set just in case they get lost!! I have purchased 3 pair as gifts so far. I have another friend who is due the end of January... I need to get her some as well... Love 'em!
