I ordered these for my son for Christmas even though at the time he was on the young side for them.  Over the past few months, his interest in them has only grown.  True, the don't really stack all that well but they are soft blocks and honestly, the age group they are meant for are more interested in the textures and crinkle or rattle sounds they make.  And boy do they offer sounds and textures!  Each side has a different picture and is made of a different fabric and all sorts of tags.  Some of the blocks make a crinkly sound when squished and some of them rattle.  One reviewer mentioned that they didn't like that the blocks could be crushed.  Personally, in watching my son play with these, this is a fantastic feature!  It means that they give when he grabs them and he is able to really hold on to them.  He LOVES the bright colors and when he is having some tummy time he will stare intensely at them and push himself towards them.  He is 6m now and truly loves them - especially the ones that crinkle.  And oh the tags!!!  HE has recently entered his tag phase and is in heaven with all of the different "tags"  All in all, I am very happy with this purchase and I am so glad I chose to get these blocks over some others I had been considering.  I truly can't say enough good things about them!
