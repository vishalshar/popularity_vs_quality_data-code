This tray is great, until it breaks, which it probably will.  The plastic is a tad on the brittle side, and the parts that connect to the chair aren't as sturdy as they need to be.  Pretty much immediately there was a visible crack in one of the attachment points (see photo).  Then tragically, and rather suddenly, the other side snapped off (see other photos).  I glued it back together, and the other one snapped off.  Then again.  And again.  Sometimes it breaks along the same lines, and sometimes it breaks in new places.  Just yesterday, both sides snapped off as my daughter was leaning on it, and if I weren't there to catch her, she would have really hurt herself.  I've attempted to contact the manufacturer at 4mykid.dk, but they have failed to acknowledge my correspondence.  If there were other good options for the Tripp Trapp, I'd go a different route.  Certainly for the price I expected more.7.9.2014 Update: After posting this review and forwarding it to the manufacturer, they finally responded.  Well, they forwarded my email to their US distributor, modernmini.com, and they were awesome.  They replaced my busted one with a new PlayTray post haste.  And so I've revised my 1 star review to a 4.  I'd do 3.5 if I could as this product is flawed, but since Modern Mini will stand behind it, I'm going with the 4.
