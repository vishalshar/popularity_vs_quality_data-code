My sister-in-law gave me some of these with a bunch of other toys that my niece and nephew outgrew.  They are great.  They are one of my son's favorite things to play with.  He is 6 months now, and he has loved them since he could grab hold of anything.  I tried to buy more but didn't know what brand to look for.  I tried 2 other brands.  They are OK, but not as good as the Fisher-Price.  These are a little more difficult for my son to pull apart, so they provide more of a challenge for him.  Because the other brands come apart so easily, they are useless for using to connect toys to the stroller.  I love the Fisher-Price because I can connect other toys and teething rings to his stroller and they don't end up on the ground when we are out and about.  He loves the different textures of all the brands of links we've tried.  He still plays with the other brand of links.  He enjoys pulling them apart and throwing them all over the place.  For my part, I don't regret trying the other brands, but I don't really need anymore than the Fisher-Price ones.
