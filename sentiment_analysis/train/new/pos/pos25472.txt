We had the Summer Infant monitor at first- it was fine, but started to lose range and just overall wasn't that fabulous. We decided to go with the Motorola monitor instead, and OMG it's awesome!  Fabulous interface, great display and no problems other than our neighbor's occasional interference in the evening. Not sure what they do but it makes our monitor lose signal for a minute or two every few nights... I just move the monitor and signal comes back no problem.Can't say anything bad about this monitor- it is great and does everything we want it to do.
