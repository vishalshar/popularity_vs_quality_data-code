I have small children and it never fails that they always need to go to the bathroom when we are out somewhere.  I was tired of using half a roll of toilet paper to cover the seats (I have girls, so they have to sit down).  The toilet paper would always move and my kids would somehow touch the seat.  I was disgusted.  There are so many germs on the seats and I didn't want to take a chance of my children catching anything.  These seat covers are well worth the money.  Price doesn't matter when it comes to my children's health.  The seat covers are extremely easy to use.  I purchased the 100 pack.  They come in 10 packs.  I carry a 10 pack in my purse.  When we are in a public restroom, I just pull one out of my purse, peal the back tape off, stick it to the seat and my kids can sit down with ease and safety.  The seat covers are large enough to cover all of the toilet seats out there.  My kids bottoms never touch any of the toilet seat.  The seat covers are large and go over the edges of the toilet seat.  The sticky sides do stay put.  The seat cover is thick enough that nothing from the seat will come through when your child sits down.  I will continue to purchase these until my girls are old enough to where they can hover over the seat like us adult women do.  At least I hope that all of us adult women hover over the public seats and don't sit down.  Hope this review helps.
