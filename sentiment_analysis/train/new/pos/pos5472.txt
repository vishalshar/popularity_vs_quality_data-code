So far so good! The fit is great. Originally bought to have a trim cloth diaper option under clothing.  Baby is 5months and 20lb / 27 long and in 96%.  I wish I went with grovia first when choosing cloth diapers.  As the fit of them is very trim and fits under his clothing unlike the Charlie banana that we have.  I am adding Grovia to my stash.  Baby wears for a max of two hours before change and once diapers were prepped (4+ washes seem to do it) all was well and did not have any leaks yet.  Wish they came in lots of colors but the quality seems good so I will take that any day. If your not sure about cloth diapers give one of these guys a try!!  also nothing in the legs to adjust!!!! I hate adjusting the inside to fit, it's one more thing to do and my "little guy" grew very quickly so I feel like I'm in there all the time changing the fit. The photo I added shows the grovia on the left and CB on the right.  Both are stuffed.
