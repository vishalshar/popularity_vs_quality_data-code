We have been extremely satisfied with this stroller. It moves very smoothly and our son seems very comfortable. After about 8 months of light use, we have not had any problems. It is rather heavy and bulky, which can be troublesome when trying to take it on a vacation. However, that's the tradeoff for a larger stroller like this, and its size and weight are reasonable for its class; we just take our little umbrella stroller when space is a concern.
