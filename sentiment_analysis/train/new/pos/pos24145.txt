I ordered this gate to replace a standard pressure mounted, plastic gate we were using to section off the living room from the kitchen.  With our old gate, everytime you wanted to go into the kitchen, you either had to step over the plastic gate, or remove it and reinstall it EVERY time....such a pain.  I wanted something that could stay installed but still would allow us easy access to the kitchen.  This gate does just that, and does it BEAUTIFULLY.  I went with this gate over the other walk-thrus since it has the widest opening and my husband is a big guy (6'8).  It installed in just a few minutes and seems really sturdy.  My toddler loves it because he can see through the bars, and I love it because it looks so much nicer than our old one.  My favorite aspect of this gate is that you can leave the "door" of the gate in the open position if you need to, and simply close it to keep the baby out.  The latch to open the gate is super easy to work with one hand (as long as you have the gate installed correctly and level).  Overall, a fantastic purchase and I will definitely be buying another.
