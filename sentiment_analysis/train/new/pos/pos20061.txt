PROS:  Solidly built and attractive.  The music and motor for the swing operate on the same battery, and after two months of use, I have yet to have to change them.  The music isn't too annoying (let's face it, anything gets old after a while), and it's a pretty quiet unit.  I LOVE that I don't have to have a separate bouncy-seat and swing, because I need and use them both but in a smaller house, having them separate would have taken up a lot of space.  I also love that the frame of the swing folds up, because we can stash it behind the couch when we need to.CONS:  The lap tray WILL NOT stay closed.  The part that goes between the baby's feet pushes down into the seat itself, and there is too much tension in the fabric, so it always pops back open.  Yes, there is a harness, so it's not really a safety issue, but when my son gets older, I don't see how he'll be able to use it for toys or anything.  I am about to just figure out how to remove it altogether.  Also, the toy bears are only on the swing frame, and well out of the reach of baby (no matter how old), so they're kind of pointless.  The seat doesn't come with any toys at all, so once my son is older, I don't imagine he'll stay entertained in it for very long.  Yes, you can buy some that will attach to the tray, but with the problems I've had keeping that closed, I don't want to do that.Overall, I'm glad we bought this unit because it fits in our house well, but I'm afraid we won't get much use out of it once my son gets older.
