i was looking for a product that would help with preparing a quick bottle.  from this products description it matched what I was looking for...it's really easy to prepare bottle in a short time, product does heat up water very fast and it's ready for baby to take (perfect temperature).  Night feeds are great and speedy.  The only fall back that I see is that the water doesn't drain all the way as you fill up the bottle, but a good workaround is just to add a little bit more (not a problem for me) I have also used the other functions warm food and cleaning options which work great as well.  I've only used the product for about 2wks, so far it's a good product.
