Purchased this because my super active infant son is not content playing in a traditional Pack n Play, as space is so limited.  He needs room to crawl or he feels too confined.  We have hard wood floors so I purchased a set of interlocking foam mats and placed the Superyard on top of it, to give him some cushion when he falls.  Just add some of his favorite toys and he is content to entertain himself long enough for me to get ready for work in the morning and I don't have to worry about where he's crawled off to and if he's somewhere he shouldn't be.  We've affectionately dubbed it his "cage."  :)I didn't imagine that setup would be challenging, since it arrives with the panels stacked and interlocked (as shown in the picture) but the joints are a little stiff so it takes a little room and maneuvering to get it into place.  It also takes a few tries to latch the panel ends together to create the octagon.  After a few times, it was a breeze...I just needed to get the hang of it.  Definitely adhere the sticky foam "feet" to the bottom, it helps with gripping to the floor.  I will consider purchasing the extra panel set to extend the size as he gets older.
