I purchased four packs of The First Years Disney Princess Easy Grasp Flatware sets for my two daughters. My older daughter just turned four, and my youngest is 20 months. These Flatware sets are a great size for both my daughters. Yes, my four year old is old enough to use regular sized utensils, but she still likes to use the kid size and she loves everything princess. My girls and I are Disney enthusiasts, so this flatware set is great! The printed images are great quality and they have held up well to the dishwasher with no fading. $2.68 per a set is a great price, which is why I bought four sets. I could not find metal toddler flatware sets for cheaper anywhere else. The Disney Princess theme was a bonus! I think these utensils will be enjoyed for many more years until both my daughters outgrow them.
