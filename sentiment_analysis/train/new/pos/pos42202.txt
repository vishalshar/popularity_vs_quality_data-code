Love this dresser. It matches our DaVinci Autumn crib and our daughters room looks so polished.The changing table portion is connected at the back of the dresser so when we are done with the changing table there will not be any marks on the top of the dresser. I use a basic thin changing mat from Babies'r Us and it fits very snug but works well.The drawers are deep and fit a good amount of clothes.My only complaint is that the wood is really soft and so it marks easily!
