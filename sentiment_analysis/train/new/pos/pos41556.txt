This tub is well-made, easy to clean, and both of my kids loved getting baths in it.  We put it in the bathtub (as most people do, I presume), and bathed the kids in it until they were able to sit up on their own in the bathtub.  I see that there are a number of baby tubs for sale in the $30, $40, and even $50 range (not so when we bought this tub).  If money is no object, by all means, but you will find plenty of other excuses to overspend on items for your kids in the years to come, so I recommend going for the budget item here - you won't be disappointed.
