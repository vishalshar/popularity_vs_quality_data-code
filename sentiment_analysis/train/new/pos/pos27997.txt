The Diono black shade arrived in a rolled package and it is a 2-pack!  I was worried and wasn't sure since the description lacked this detail.  It was fairly easy to unroll and install on the two rear windows of our 2008 Ford Escape.  The static cling tint covered about 85-90% of the rear window and reduced the sun's glare effectively.
