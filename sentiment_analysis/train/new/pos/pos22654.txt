Bought this as a baby shower gift and she absolutely loved it. At first she was unaware of what it really was, but when she went to go pack a hospital bag she text me and was so thankful! She said that all she really needed to add was a pair of PJ's! Awesome gift. Will continue to give and hope to receive!
