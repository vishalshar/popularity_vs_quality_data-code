I bought these to go with my son's new Klean Kanteen for an even higher flow option. It is slightly faster, but even the original green ones are surprisingly easy. He loves them- easy switch from the soft straws he was using. The only liquid that can make it out is what remains in the spout above the gasket after the child stops drinking- miniscule. At last, my couches are dry LOL. My son is not frustrated by it, even I would use it! It also dissembles and reassembles very easily so you can clean it very well, which was something I did not like about any of our previous sippys. Highly recommend.
