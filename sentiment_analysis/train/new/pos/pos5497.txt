I've dealt with a LOT of baby/pet gates over the past few years, working with a pet rescue and as a pet foster family. Superficially, this one resembles most - it's got a one-hand-operation latch, it uses pressure pads at top of bottom of each end, it has some extra removable sections to adjust to different sized openings.The devil is in the details, and this gate gets a lot of details right. First the expansion sections - they fit TIGHTLY into one another and to the gate, the whole unit is a solid structurally and visually cohesive construction.Second the gate itself - it's quite wide compared to most, very easy to walk through.Third the finish - a very nice dark finish metal on the fence portion, with a slightly lighter wooden gate.I'm using this gate as a barrier to keep my dogs from rushing the front door when we have visitors. It's part of our living room, so having it look - if not exactly attractive, at least unobtrusive - is very important. The opening I have is about 55" so I used all but the smallest 4" expansion, and it's quite sturdy.If I could have one thing different, I'd like an auto-close option but typically that feature is hard to come by on a dual-swing gate, so overall I'd rather have the dual-swing and no auto-close. Very happy with the product and the price.
