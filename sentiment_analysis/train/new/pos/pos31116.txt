First off, I really love this product.  It's the quickest, easiest way to swaddle my baby girl, who sleeps much better at night when she's securely wrapped up.  We went with this kind of swaddle over a blanket because she has been a "mobile sleeper" since birth, and always managed to wriggle out of our blanket swaddle.  Note that these notes below pertain to the small size.Now - here's what you need to know about sizing, based on my three months of experience and multiple attempts to get it right.- There are three kinds of swaddle fabrics at the time I'm writing this:1. Flannel (in the gingham prints)2. Fleece3. Cotton jersey (like a t-shirt).  This variety has the most options in terms of patterns and colors.I've arranged them in that order because that's the order of smallest to largest.  The flannel variety stretches, well, not at all. It's the smallest of the three types of fabrics, therefore, in terms of fit.  (My daughter outgrew her small size swaddle at 13 pounds, after washing it a few times - even though it's supposed to fit up to 14.)  The fleece variety does stretch a bit - she's now 15 pounds and this still fits her.The cotton variety is the stretchiest one - and it REALLY stretches.  The first time after I wash and dry it, it's pretty snug.  But if I'm lucky enough to get 2 or 3 nights of use out of it, by the third night it's considerably bigger than it was.  I just bought another small cotton one and my baby's 15 pounds.What's more, I just bought a flannel gingham swaddle in large, and that fits her great.  (But the cotton variety in large was HUGE and I'm returning it.)  Anyway - hope this is helpful to all of you out there.  This is a great product and I wish you luck!
