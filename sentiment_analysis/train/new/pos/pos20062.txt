This is an excellent rain cover, we used it during an especially rainy week at Orlando, Fl. Although me and my wife got very wet even with raincoats on, my daughter was happily dry inside her Pliko P3 stroller. This cover is easy to install, easy to remove, has some meshes at the sides for breathing, and opens fully in the front, giving full access to the child.
