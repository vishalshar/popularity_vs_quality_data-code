I've owned this floor seat for a month now, and I like it better than the Bumbo for two reasons. First, the leg openings are larger which will allow it to be used for longer than the Bumbo. Another reason is that it folds for easy storage or to transport it.Pros:Very stableGood support in front and backSeat covering is machine washableTwo tethers with two toys includedCons:"Squeakers" for feet do not appear to be usablePretty straight-forward floor seatUltimately, it doesn't have lights or music, it doesn't pivot or bounce, but it does make an excellent floor seat. I'm able to set my son in it and know he's safe and he really enjoys playing with the toys and viewing the world from an upright perspective. Overall, I'd recommend this seat.
