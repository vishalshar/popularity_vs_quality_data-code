Awesome awesome awesome wetbag. So thin but so freaking functional. Have used this for very wet clothes at the pool and never had leaks. I think everybody should invest in these not just for baby stuff. It has worked well from newborn and now we're in toddler years and it's still great. Washes well and has still held up. Can be folded nicely into a compact roll and does not take up lots of space and tucked away until ready for use.I will continue to use this. Highly Highly recommend for every parent!
