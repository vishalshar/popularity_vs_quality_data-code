As a father of 2 with the 3rd on its way, the shaidee made being out in the sun with our baby hassle free. No sun screen needed and I can easily pay with my older son while wearing it.Throwing it on is fast, easy and doesn't disturb your baby. I did it all the time with my daughter sleeping in both our bjorn and our sling.Great simple carry bag makes it small and easy to pack.Really impressed with how well it stays on and holds up in the wind.We use it at the beach, park, on walks and even as a rain cover when caught off guard. It has taken a lot of abuse and still looks like new.Great product. Simple and smart. I highly recommend it to anyone that uses a carrier and likes to be outside.
