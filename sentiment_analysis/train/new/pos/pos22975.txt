I love table toppers.  We currently live in Asia and travel all over the world.  We've used them in Japan, China and in the USA.  Food gets spilled off plates, dumped on tables and plopped in little kids mouths.  With table toppers we KNOW that the surface they are eating off isn't filled with germs.My daughters like to rip them off the table occasionally, but we found that the trick is to fasten the edge close to them over the edge of the table and wait to put them down until right before the food arrives, that way they are more focused on the food than the placemat.
