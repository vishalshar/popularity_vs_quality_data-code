We have this border on three walls..The first wall took maybe 30 minutes,because it didn't stick. The second wall,we tried with help of wet sponge, but it still took a really long time. the third wall,we didn't follow instructions(it says don't unroll it and soak it in the water)well, we unrolled it in the water so the whole thing could get wet...and it sticked on the wall PERFECTLY and in maybe 2 minutes.But my husband still needed my help,it's not for only two hands.But it's on the wall and looks great!!!! (excuse my wrong English)
