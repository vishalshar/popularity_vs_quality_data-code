My wife and I purchased this swing after reading several reviews.  We also compared swings in-person at brick-and-mortar stores like Buy-Buy-Baby and Babies 'R Us before purchasing this one.  The "My Little Lamb" swing is a really nice looking and great feeling swing that operates well.  The swing is extremely easy to setup (according to directions) for anyone who even knows what a screwdriver is; and they include the proper size allen-key wrench in the package!Pros include: high-quality fit/finish (moreso than even other Fisher-Price models), great price-to-value ratio, soooooo cute for a boy or girl to use, relatively quiet operation (some mild startup noise as the motor and cam get the carrier swinging, but not very noticeable once in-motion), light weight and easy to move, efficient and long-lasting 4x D-cell battery operation, and overall happiness effect on children!Cons (very few) include: relatively similar swing speeds ('slowest' setting is not really slow, it's sorta fast; 'fastest' setting is not super fast, it seems very similar to the 'slowest' setting!  Although don't worry: your kid will not go flying out!), and no AC-adapter.All-in-all, you will LOVE this swing for your child.  Makes eating dinner an easier affair for both parents (or any task where you need to set the child down for a short bit and still want to observe/watch them).  For the price it can't be beat.  Spend a couple extra bucks compared to the cheaper swings, and let the good times roll (or swing) for your child!
