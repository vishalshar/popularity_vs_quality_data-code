I am a mother to 5, including 12 week old twins. This is my first time using bottles (older kids breastfed exclusively), so I started with the ones made by the pump manufacturer and used at the hospital. One twin was having a tough time with those nipples, so we switched to Dr Brown. That twin seemed to do better with Dr Brown, but the other twin didn't like those (the nipple is narrow), so I ordered these Born Free bottles. Both twins did so well with these! I really like that they are wide mouth, which makes cleaning easier. Although they do have five parts of you count everything separately, it is so easy to take them apart and put them together --- really it only takes a few seconds --- that I personally don't consider it a problem whatsoever! I think the system for preventing air gulping a highly effective, and that and the nipples work so well!  I did move onto the glass version of these but still use the plastic and like to take the plastic in the diaper bag just because they're lighter. I love both the plastic and the glass and highly recommend these to anyone. I quickly put away all of the other brands and have been exclusively using the Born Free since about a week after I bought that first set.
