These are awesome!  I read some of the other reviews saying theirs didn't come with peel and stick adhesives.  Mine did.  I had to cut it to the right size/shape, but other than that it was pretty easy and self-explanatory.  I'm wondering if the manufacturer is just inconsistent with that.  We've had ours on for about 6 months and they have stayed on and protected the little one's head from getting bonked.  My only negative comments would be:  1) I wish it came in the color white to blend in better, 2) I wish they had one for an obtuse angle, and 3) it really did take FOREVER to arrive.  I think about a month.  So if you are in a hurry, go with something different.  Other than those three things, I recommend this!
