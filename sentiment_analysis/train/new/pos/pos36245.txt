My 2 year old uses this to get onto her bed, to reach the sink to wash her hands and as a stage for her singing. The stool is really cute and sturdy. It does not slip on flooring, carpet or tile. Great price for a great item.so the above review was done in 2011 when i purchased the product. My follow up is that now my child is 8 years old and this stool about 5 years. Some of the paint has faded but I can say this thing has served its purpose and more! I have used it as a chair for my self (Im about 175 lbs) and I have used it as a stool myself. It has really been used by the entire family and the stool remains sturdy. No dents or warps. The only damage is the fading of the color but for 5 years worth of work this thing is amazing! My now 8 year old doesnt use it to reach the sink anymore but it's her comfort spot where she likes to just sit and/or stand to watch tv (I dont judge). Well worth the money!
