Playtex Sipsters (Level 3) are the first cups my daughter did well with when we tried to transition her off the bottle. The spout is easy for kids to use and they don't require that much effort to get liquid out unlike some other cups.These cups are easy to clean. The non-spill mechanism consists or a small piece of soft plastic or rubber that acts as a valve. It cleans up super easy if you make the mistake of leaving one in the car all day with milk in it while your kid is at preschool, like I did.The biggest downside is that despite the non-spill mechanism they are a bit more leaky than some other cups. No worrying about one fall sending milk all over your rug, but if your child hides it somewhat upside down there will be a puddle after a while. That isn't true of all sippy cups.Overall I would recommend them. I like them a great deal and they are working well for the family but they are not perfect.
