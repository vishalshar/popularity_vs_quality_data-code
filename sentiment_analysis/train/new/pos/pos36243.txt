We purchased these changing pad covers to help extend the life of our larger, softer changing pad cover. The cream appears to be pretty close to what it looks like on my computer. While I haven't tested out exactly how waterproof they are, they are nice and soft and are relatively thick and absorbent for how thin they are. I've washed them several times already and put them in the dryer and they've held their shape well and don't curl up like some other changing pad covers seem to do according to their reviews.For comparison purposes, I also bought the Boppy changing pad covers in white. They are much thinner, the material (a thin, terry cloth feeling material) is much less soft, and they overall feel cheaper. Since the Boppy covers have a more plastic-y feeling backing, I air dry those.Overall I prefer the Graco ones to the Boppy ones for their softer feel and thicker material, but the Boppy ones may be more waterproof given their plastic backing.
