Love these cups and was pleased to be able to find replacement spouts. My toddler chewed through some of the white soft spouts, so I needed to find replacement spouts so I can use them to train my young baby to use the cup. The green "12 month" spouts are hard....they still gets scratched up from teeth and we often have to tell our oldest not to chew on the spout, BUT so far they are the best we've found. They really don't leak, and the spout has lasted longer than others. So -plan to replace soft spouts way more often, but the green ones hold up great for an older child. In fact, get away from the soft spouts and switch to the hard ones as soon as your child can use the hard spouts, because then you don't need to be so vigilent for tears which are a choking hazard.
