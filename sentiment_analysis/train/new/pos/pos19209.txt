I got these as a hand me down and they still work well! So well in fact that i wish they woudl fall apart so that i have an excuse to buy new ones.Its basically a plastic sheet sandwiched between 2 layers of cloth, fused together so they dont shift.I like them as they prevent your changing table mattress getting wet, yet I think they are way better than a plastic mat for the following reasons: 1. are not cold .2. they fold down to smaller sizes then a padded plastic mat.3. are more hygenic since you woudl probably wash them vs. just doing a "wipe down"4. do not crack at fold lines with prolonged use. I have been using the same one for 2 years.. still going strong and no leaks.There is some pilling after washing but nothing that hinders the usage of the product. It cant look brand new forever. Besides,think of these from your babys perspective.. which kind would you put your bare bottom on ;)? .
