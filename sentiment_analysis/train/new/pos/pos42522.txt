This took a while to arrive (almost 4 weeks), so please keep that in mind when ordering. It looks adorable and of decent quality, however bear in mind, the crochet threads and net means it's not a durable everyday use machine wash blanket. we got it exclusively for baby photo session and it looks great for that. We haven't tried it on the baby yet so not sure about the fit - however, many other similar outfits had fit issues - too long/short/loose etc. so went with this design because only the hat needs to be snug fitted and will still work even if it was a little loose or tight.
