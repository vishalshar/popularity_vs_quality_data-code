My 4 month old adores this lovey.  She just loves to chew on the tags.  She also loves to put it over her face and play peek-a-boo.  I had to buy another one to have while the other one is being washed.  Keep in mind this blankie is small...but it is a great size for babies and the quality is very good.  I have washed them a few times so far and they stand up well and stay soft.
