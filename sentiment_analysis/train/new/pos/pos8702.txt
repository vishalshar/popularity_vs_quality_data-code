first of all, let me say that all of the negative reviews about the assembly being so difficult is really off track.  the assembly went flawlessly and very fast.  almost didnt need the instructions.  the only tool needed was a #2 phillips screwdriver.  when tightening the 8 screws(yes, that's all there are, except for the wingnuts and bolts for the wheels) after you install them all finger tight, you don't have to gorilla torque them down.  just snug them up and that is all you need.  THINGS ARE ONLY AS DIFFICULT AS YOU MAKE THEM...
