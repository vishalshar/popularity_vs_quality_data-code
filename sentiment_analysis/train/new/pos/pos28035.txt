I bought this for my second baby because we moved to a new house and didn't have room for our pack n play in our bedroom anymore. I really really like this bassinet. Our daughter has slept in it every night since she was born, and she's 5 months now. It has a nice design and I love that it comes with a changing table attachment as well. After our daughter is in her own bedroom, I intend to bring the changing table version of this down into our living room.The only thing I didn't like about this bassinet is that you can't see through it. So those first few weeks my paranoid mom brain would get up several times to actually visually check on her. If the sides were see through, this wouldn't have been an issue. And (obviously) was something I overlooked when purchasing this bassinet. I have been very pleased with it aside from that, and that only lasted a week or two.
