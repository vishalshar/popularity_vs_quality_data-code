So my little boy has very narrow waist and hips. It's so hard to buy pants for the little guy without them falling down to a ghetto gangsta standard. So I bought this snap belt, and it's handles the job perfectly. Now all of his pants fit! I recommend it for sure and it'll last years because it's adjustable and just goes around two of the loops on the backside instead of wrapping around the entire waistline.
