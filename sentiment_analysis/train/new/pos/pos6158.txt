After purchasing several different swaddleMe products and colors I can say that this one was my favorite. The material is similar to a thermal -- but is more breathable. My baby is a little on the big size so once she was about 12 pounds I couldn't use this size anymore. The color and design are very cute and they do look like the image. I wish that they offered more SwaddleMe items made with this fabric in a larger size with cute colors and animals like this one.
