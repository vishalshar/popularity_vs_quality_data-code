I love this product!!!!! I wanted more space in my closet and happened to be looking through a baby catalog and saw this product. It looked strong but I was unsure of the size since there were no specifications in print or on the site. Thanks heaps to one of the previous reviewers who provided the dimensions!!!!!!!!!I bought the pink and reorganised by closet. It works great. It looks great. I put tops/blouses between the dividers. I use the drawers for items that I don't need to iron (tops, skirts, pants). I put personal items in the side pockets.Excellent product!!!!!!!
