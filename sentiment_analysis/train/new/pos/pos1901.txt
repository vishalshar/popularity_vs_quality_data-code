I was worried for the great price that it wouldn't be authentic Baltic Amber, and was skeptical in general of using the necklace to help with teething. I'm a total covert! The day I got it, I put the necklace on my one year old (who only has one tooth, they're all starting to pop through together though); I didn't notice a big different until I took it off of him to go to sleep that night.  He cried and screamed for hours until I put the necklace around his ankle -inside his footie pajamas- and within twenty minutes he was sound asleep.  We haven't taken it off of him since! (Except bath time of course :-) )
