I wasn't sure, but the baby did follow this more than other toys early on at 3 months.  The item says it is because of high contrast.  Perhaps so, but she does like the toy.  She's still able to grab other toys better, however, so I have to do most of the work with this one.  A good small price item if you need a little add-on piece of novelty since your baby is bored with all her current toys.
