What a cute little denim butt!!!  We have been cloth diapering our daughter for over a year.  We started out using Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Blackbird, Size One (6-18 lbs) with Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefold, White, Size One (6-18 lbs) never had issue with leaks or blowouts.  We moved to Size 2 Thirsties when she reached about 15 pounds.  I wanted to try this covers out because it looked so cute, and at the price I figure it was worth a shot!  I used the Thirsties pre-folds in this diaper with the Bamboo Biodegradable/ Flushable Liners for Dispoable or Cloth Diaper- BubuBibi and had fabulous results.  This diaper cover is adorable and holds in the wetness and mess.  I just lay the prefold diaper in the cover with a liner and use the covers snaps to hold everything in place.  Be sure to adjust the rise and leg gussets to fit your little one -- very customizable size!  You can keep using the cover too, just swap out the old diaper for a new one -- as long as it isn't soiled you can keep using it.  The snaps are good and the product is well made.  I was very pleased with this product.
