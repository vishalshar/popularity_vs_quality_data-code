We received our first pair of these at a shower for our first child 6+ years ago. Now at 3 children total (lots of clipping in this house!) we've JUST had to replace these clippers. I was so excited to see this exact "model" was still being sold. It's got a great fit in your hand that allows you to make steady cuts even with squirmy toddlers. And I know there are models out there with lights and magnifying parts...that just seems excessive and distracting to me though. I can't say I've tried them, but there's no need because the simplicity of this design combined with effective blades on these clippers work wonders!
