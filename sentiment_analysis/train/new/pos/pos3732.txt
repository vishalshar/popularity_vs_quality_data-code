I looked at this for a long time before buying it. I just couldn't quite bring myself to spend almost $30 on freezer trays. I bought some cheaper silicone ones and while they worked for freezing chicken broth, I needed trays with smaller portions. I was just starting solids with my 6 month old. Eventually one day, after wrestling to remove a cube of broth from my silicone tray I gave in and bought this. I have to say it's worth it! Portion sizes are perfect! You can feel the quality materials used and I have never had any problems removing the cubes, just push down on one side and they pop right now! If you plan on making your own baby food this is the item for you
