When our swing arrived I was actually kind of disappointed since it didn't seem to swing at all even on the highest  setting. I called Fisher Price to complaint about it and they told me to change the batteries since that was the most common reason for the swings not working properly. I did, and nothing seemed to change. So I called them again wanting to return the product, they told me that they would send me a new motor part in order to fix the problem. I was very skeptical, but when the part arrived (next day, bravo Fisher Price!) and I replaced it, it started to work wonderfully, maybe even a little too fast for my newborn, but he seemed to like it.Every time we need a moment for ourselves we know the swing will work his magic. Hey, sometimes he enjoys it even without the swinging motion, so it's a convenience that I can transport the little chair to spots the whole swing couldn't fit.At the beginning I thought the two little toys that came with it were too small, but our son seems to love them and he's starting to coo and giggle at them (or yelling at them as well, don't ask..)I also love the idea of being able to keep the rocking chair once our son gets too big for the swing.All in all, great and versatile product (specially for the price), and a great experience with Fisher Price's customer service.
