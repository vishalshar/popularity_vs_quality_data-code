I am giving this a 5 star rating because the set is adorable and went very well in the nursery. My only complaint is that the mobile doesn't work when you wind it up. It's a cute decoration piece but it'd be nice if it worked. The photos show some yellow where it should be a lime green like it shows on the rug. So if you are looking for yellow and purple this would not work for you. Overall I am very pleased with this set and would recommend this set to anyone.
