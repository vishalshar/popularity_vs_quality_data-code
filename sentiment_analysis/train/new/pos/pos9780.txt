Very cute cake topper.  It's a great size too.  I didn't really know what to expect but it's a heavy, solid piece that will be very cute on my baby shower cake.  I ordered a cake from Wal Mart.  I ordered a two tiered cake and got one layer brown with pink polka dots and one layer just pink and I am going to set her on the top of the cake.  If only I could find a matching outfit to wear to my baby shower!
