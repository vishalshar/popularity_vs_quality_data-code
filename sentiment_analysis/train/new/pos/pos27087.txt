This 3-in-1 Body Pillow is the best! What I love about it is the fact that its manageable, not too bulky, very easy to snuggle up with without the added burden of having too much pillow in the bed. The built in wedge became a VERY IMPORTANT part of my pregnant life once I entered the second trimester. Such a good idea! The wedge helps supports my belly while the rest of the pillow makes side sleeping so much more comfortable that any other body pillow I've tried. A MUST HAVE product. I have told all my friends about it and have been giving it as gifts to pregnant friends. It comes in a very sweet and easy compact package with handles so it's a really great gift.
