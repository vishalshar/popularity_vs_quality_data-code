The K'tan is one of a kind for babywearing.. It is basically a pre-set-up wrap, so its very easy to use - you just put it on like a necklace, pull one strap down, put baby in, pull strap up. You can get out of the car and throw it on, pop baby in and you're good to go. The material is super soft right out of the box. The shoulder straps dont dig but you do have to order the right size for you (the size chart is very accurate). The material is stretchy enough for your growing little one, you can also nurse easily in this carrier.Downside, you cant share with your spouse unless you are very similar sizes. You have to be careful washing/drying to avoid shrinking. You can't do a back carry with it as far as I know. Like any stretchy wrap, after many uses it needs to be washed and dried to shrink it back up a little bit.The material is lightweight even in the summer but the K'tan also comes with a mesh variety that is a little bit cooler.
