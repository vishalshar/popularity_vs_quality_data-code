If your baby always pops back wide awake and cries when being transferred from your arms to the co-sleeper, then O dear reader TRY THIS ridiculously overpriced (yet somehow at the same time totally worth it!) fuzzy sheet!I've noticed a huge difference in quality of my three-month-old's sleep on these; no more fussing when put down (or very, very little), and longer stretches of sleep at a time both at night and during naps. She clearly seems much cozier, and I've seen her gently rubbing the fabric with one hand to soothe herself while falling asleep. I think these make it easier to learn to self-soothe to sleep from just a drowsy, partially-awake state because she feels snugglier. Huge improvement over the standard-issue rough cotton that comes with the co-sleeper.I've only washed and dried a handful of times, but so far, no shrinking or pilling.The velour is plush, but not so much as to present any kind of suffocation hazard (the nap is very fine and short. Think suede, or very light velvet).
