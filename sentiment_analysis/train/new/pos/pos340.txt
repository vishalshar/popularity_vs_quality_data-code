This was a lifesaver for both my kids. My first child would only sleep in the car seat for the first 3 months.  After months of blearily pushing a snap-n-go stroller back and forth in the bedroom at 3 AM, I discovered this car seat swing. Instant improvement in quality of life!  The 2nd child will sometimes sleep in the crib, but  the duration of sleep is considerably longer in the car seat swing than in the crib (6 hours vs 2-3 hours from bedtime to the first wake-up, at 3 months old). The clicking noise didn't bother either baby, and was a small price to get the baby to sleep.It works with rechargable batteries. If it doesn't turn on with the rechargables, it is NOT a voltage issue. The reason is that the positive terminal of the AA battery isn't contacting the positive wire coil contact in the battery compartment. You have to pop the wire coil out from behind the plastic tab (I used a screwdriver to do this), and/or bend the end of it so it protrudes more. I use the high-capacity Amazon basics rechargable AA batteries, which are generic Eneloops, with Eneloop C battery spacers. They will last a few nights.For detailed instructions, see this post:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KENKB4U6WKJV/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Y9AMZG
