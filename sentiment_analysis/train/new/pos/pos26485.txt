I bought my Bidet Ole at Goodwill for $2.  Brand new in box, it had never even been installed.It installed easily, even with 4 dogs trying to get in on the action and  see what I was doing....  Then I waited.  Waited to poop.I have been using wet wipes foe years-- but this Bidet Ole makes them look like what wipes made toilet paper look like.  Something savages use!I have few  possessions I could not live without-- my Rainbow Vacuum, my French cafe press and now-- my Bidet Ole.That thing is like a car wash for your toilet bowl too!  That bowl, along with me (down there) is cleaner than ever.Vive Le Bidet Ole!
