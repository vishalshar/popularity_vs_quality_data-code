The cups are nice and colors are pretty, I got the yellow/orange set. They are portable and cute, I like the long spoon. One problem I got in my set is that 2 of the cup's bottom are kind of sticking out a little, which doesn't cause them to fall but just wobble a bit. Overall they are useful cups at a nice price.
