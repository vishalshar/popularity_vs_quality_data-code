I bought the Jolly Jumper Stroller Caddy for my Uppababy Vista stroller. I would assume that it has a similar fit on other strollers with angled handles. Hopefully this video will demonstrate how it fits on the stroller and the sizes of the compartments.The caddy attaches to the handles using 4 velcro straps. I found the straps to be much longer than I needed and have them almost as tight as they possibly would go. It's tight enough that there is no chance it will slide down the handle bars.The cup holders are a good size. I wasn't able to find any cups or water bottles around my house that didn't fit inside the cup holders. I did however find that a tall Starbucks coffee cup was too short and the lid too large to fit in the cup holder. I usually just use one to hold a spare water bottle and my wife keeps her sunglasses in the other.The zippered pocket is great for storing a spare burp cloth since you can leave the caddy attached to the stroller while folded.I would highly recommend this caddy for anyone who has an Uppababy Vista and is looking for a versatile cup holder solution.
