With our princess themed nursery, we knew we wanted a princess mobile.  Surprisingly, there weren't that many out there that we liked.  This one, however, was the one that we did.Pros: - Easy to assemble.  Didn't even need the instructions. - Matches the rest of our non-disney princess cribbing. - The castles and carriages that hang down can attach/detach in seconds. - We love the music that it plays!Cons: - Its lightweight, but not very sturdy.  Seems a little flimsy at times. - Our crib is not straight on the sides, so it hangs cooked. I am sure this would be a problem with all cribs like this.
