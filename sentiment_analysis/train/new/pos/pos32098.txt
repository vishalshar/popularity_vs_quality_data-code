OKI own a minium of 20 different sippy cups, and for this one baby in my care I couldn't find anything he would drink from. I tried tommy Tippy, Nuc and many others. Both those 2 are some of my favorites, but this little guy didn't think so, so I went on Amazon and started ordering any different sippy cups I could find. I found this cup with no reviews, and decided it couldn't be any worse than the others, and it was the winner. Little guy is much happier now. He can drink comfortably with out making a mess, and it is a nice large size since the summer is coming up I want to make sure I have something big enough for long play times outside. Thanks for making a great product. I'll be trying some of the other Green to grow products!
