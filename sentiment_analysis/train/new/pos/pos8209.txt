This stroller is awesome! Where do I start?1)The pattern and fabric are beautiful!2)I have a 2 month old who is 14 pounds and a 15 month old who is 23 pounds. My oldest sits in front of course, and this stroller is sooo easy to stear! I take it to the mall all the time!3)The parent tray is awesome. I put my drinks and my keys in it all the time.4)The storage basket is huge and is accesable when the seat is reclined. It has a flat storage area in the back under the parent tray. It also has two side storage pouches that I haven't even gotten to use yet, but I am sure my girls will love them when they are older!5)It has a huge canopy in the back and a small one in front that really do the trick in blocking out the sun. My older daughter has even taken a nap in the front seat.6)It is not that heavy and it fits in the trunk of my Mom's Ford Contour with tons of room to spare.I lift it in and out of our minivan with no problem and I am pretty small.7)It has a snack tray for both seats. My oldest uses the front one all the time. Of course my newborn hasn't gotten to use the back one yet, but I am sure it will come in handy.Here are a few things I didn't like:1) The parent tray that came with it didn't lock into place correctly, so I contacted Evenflo and within 3 weeks I recieved a new one. This one doesn't fold down like the original designs calls for, but it does unsnap fairly easy so I can fold it away that way.2)The wheels are squeeky. They started squeeking after about 3 weeks.I would highly reccomend this stroller to anybody! I can see myself using this stroller for years to come! I payed $149 for it because I had a $20 coupon, but I would have payed full price with no problem!
