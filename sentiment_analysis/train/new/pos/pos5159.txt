I mostly buy Graco products for my children as far as car seats, strollers, high chairs, swings, etc. I have found that they are by far the best constructed and their company has been around for decades. Graco has stayed a top contender amoung baby products since the beginning and for good reason. By far the best quailty for the money out there.Pros:- This carseat not only was well constructed but was critical need for a newborn/infant.- There is no better way to carry a newborn or infant around then in a carseat without disrupting them. It can go from the car to stroller to your home and attach to a swing base if you go for that option.- It comes in a variety of styles/colors for a boy, girl or neutral- Can hold an infant beyond the 22lbs of the Graco Snug Rider (essential for me since my son was 25lbs at 1yr old.)- The padding for safety is thicker then the Graco Snug Rider.- Still in great shape after one child (could use for a younger sibling)Cons:- The base is a little wider then the snug rider so it may be hard to get it in the car if you have 2 other carseats/booster seats.- The seat overall is a little heavier but that is because it can hold a larger infant.Overall I would recommend this to anyone who is in need of an infant carseat. Definitely worth what I paid for it and would purchase another one if need be.
