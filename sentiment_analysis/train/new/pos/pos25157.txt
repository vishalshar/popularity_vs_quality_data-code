I love this mirror!  The concave mirror lets you see a greater area without having a huge mirror in the backseat.  The mirror holder is strapped to your backseat headrest and has a wide Velcro square where the back of the mirror attaches.  The Velcro allows you to position the mirror however you want without parts that can break or sag over time.  It stays where you put it- and we've hit it several times by accident with the car seat, the baby has kicked it, and our dogs have tried to pull it off/lick it when traveling and it doesn't budge.  The only thing I could add would be a light so I could see my child during the evening, but it's not really necessary.  The overhead light is enough (and, frankly, if the lights are out, chances are she's sleeping and I don't like disturbing her, anyway).  If you need to put a mirror in more than one car, you can purchase another strap for your car and just share the actual mirror between vehicles; it's an inexpensive fix and doesn't require you to unhook everything to transfer to another car- just take the mirror off the Velcro.  I highly recommend this mirror.***UPDATE***2+ years later and we're still using this mirror.  It's held up very well and we use it every day (we're trying to go to 4 years rear-facing).  My daughter kicks the heck out of it and only recently did she do any damage.  She popped the mirror out, but we were able to put it back in.  It's been such a great purchase, we bought two more for our recent additions.
