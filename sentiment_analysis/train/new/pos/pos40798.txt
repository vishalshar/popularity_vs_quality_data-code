GREAT, GREAT, GREAT BUY!!! My son fit perfectly in the carrier. He would fall asleep after a few minuets so it must have been comfortable and comforting for him. As for me the straps were positioned in right spots so there was no back pain. Easy set up, so it was a simple slide in clip down and go. I would strongly recommend this product to everyone.
