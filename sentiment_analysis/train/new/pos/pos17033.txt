I ordered 2 other pairs of these pajamas they came straight from amazon they got here sooner with free shipping. I want a few days longer for this pair and the shipping cost from the store was stunning. the pjs. where 14.95 and the cost of this one pair was over 8.00 that is a very big turn off. I could have bought another pair of pjs. If it had came overnight that would be different. I was pleased with the pajamas in every other way. but I would never by straight from this seller again. I got ripped off. Thanks and I hope you look into how much you charge for shipping. They where one pair of tiny baby pajamas. Thanks, Diana
