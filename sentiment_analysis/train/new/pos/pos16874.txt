I bought this for my grandson (7 months) and he absolutely loves it! He is teething and the nibbler with an ice cube works perfectly. He can hold it and pick it up easily too so the I like the handle design better than the others with a loop handle. I agree with other commentors that it's a better design and I like the twist lock better too! makes it easier to use. I purchased this three pack plus three extra nets for $9.99 which made it a great bargin. I received this on time as well. I would recommend and purchase again.
