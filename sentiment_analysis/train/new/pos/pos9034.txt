The design and color on photos is really the exact one, cute and fun compared to other similar products that are displayed in any other websites! Size is perfect. As for its purpose, it does work well except that my baby wiggles and move around a whole lot during sleep and her head ends up slipping off this nice pillow but we only let her use this when we are around to watch her.
