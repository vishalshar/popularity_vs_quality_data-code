We've had one of these since just before my daughter was born in early 2004.  We have used it every night, all night, since (other than about 5-10 nights when we were out of town), and many, many days too.  It has worked perfectly for us, and has not broken down.A few tips: (1) like any other radio transmitting device, it can be finicky about where it is located, and the position of the antenna; you need to play with it to get optimum reception; (2) it operates on the 900 MHz frequency, which a couple of our phones do also; if you use the phone, the thing goes completely static, and you just can't use the monitor at all; if you can't live with that, get another monitor, or another phone (which, for privacy's sake, you should do anyway, because 900 MHz phones can be easily listened to by the neighborhood busy body).All in all, we love it.  In fact, I'm at the website today in order to buy another one for my son's room.  We've told everyone we know how great these are.
