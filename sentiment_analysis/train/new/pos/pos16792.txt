Okay let me start by saying we own about 10 thermometers!  We have one of every kind because someone's husband who shall remain nameless was sent for one and didn't know which to buy so we have definitely tried them all.  This thermometer is the absolute most accurate when used under the arm in my experience which is from newborn to toddler.  You cannot beat the accuracy matched with the 9 second result.  And the 9 seconds matters don't let anyone tell you any different!  Most children will not hold still any longer.  And the results are more accurate even than the ear thermometer which is what they use at the dr's office.Buy this product and you won't have to buy all the others which are a waste of your money.
