So far this chair has worked out great! The seat is very comfortable and the gliding motion is very smooth. You don't need to put out much effort to rock in the glider and the foot stool makes it even easier to glide. The chair arrived sooner than I thought and the chair was not damaged and the color of the wood was very true to what the picute indicates. It took 30 minutes to put it together -  we had an issue with the arm cushions ;). I would highly recommend this chair for anyone who is looking for a glider for his or her nursery. The only down sides to the chair are the seat is not wide enough to fit you, the baby, and a boppy pillow comfortably (for those moms who will brest feed); the cream colored cushions are getting dirty faster than I thought, and if you are sitting close to the edge of the seat DO NOT LEAN FORWARD!! I made the mistake of leaning forward - my little one and I went overboard!  Other than that, the chair meets all of my requirements and I would tell others to buy this chair. Especially at the price - you can't beat it. You don't need to pay top dollar to get top quality.
