Love this cup! My son is 7 months old and has always shown in interest in our glasses. He didn't care for a sippy cup and those should not be used long term due to damage to the mouth/teeth they can cause. I found this cup and he loves it! We started out only putting a small amount of liquid in it, but he does better if we put more, about half inch now. We supervise him drinking and help place it down, but I love that he is so motivated to use it.
