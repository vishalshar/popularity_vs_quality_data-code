This is an amazing product! I can't believe that I didn't find these sooner like when my sone was a baby. I bought 2 one for my sister and one for my cousin who are both about to have babies. I knew that anything that would make giving a little one medicine would be a great thing to get anyone for a new baby. I did open them for the diaper cakes that I made and it seemed very well constructed the back piece where you put the medicine comes out and goes back in very easy so I would say that it is almost mess free. The pacifier part is soft and gentle like a regular one so no worries about them not wanting to take it. I love this product and will purchase one for myself for the next go round.
