My 5 year old daughter has a rare chromosomal disorder and thus is developmentally delayed. Transitioning from bottle to sippy cup initially was a tedious endeavor; we went from regular nipple to orthodontic nipple to just about every sippy cup ever manufactured, until finding one that worked. As she outgrew that one, we, again searched for a suitable sippy sup. We went from bottle to avent sippy cups, to munchkin click lock hard spout sippy cups....and finally, I was ready to make the attempt at a straw. That worked out horribly. She has fine and gross motor delays and therefore the process of pursing the lips to form an "o" whilst sucking in to draw liquids from a straw is a skill that we needed to find a way to master. Along comes these cups. The spout is round like a straw, and has kind of a rubber like covering, so its hard but not unpleasant.she has to purse the lips into an "o" to form a good seal around the spout. She transitioned rather quickly to these. The valve is two parts, easy to remove and clean. It will however get knocked out if the cup happens to be tossed across the room, or banged up against a wall or object (not that my little angel would do such things). Of course, when it comes to special needs kiddoes, the accomplishments are celebrated, and there is always the need to present the next challenge. These cups will stay the course, until a suitable straw cup comes along to take its place. Very proud of my little girl for taking these up with such ease!
