We bought this set for our daughter and built the color scheme of her whole bedroom around it. There are lots of colors in Pretty Pennant, making matching easy. The bedskirt fits around her crib perfectly and the sheet is adorable. The blanket has cotton pennant print on one side and fuzzy fleece on the other, which is nice. However, I don't love the body suit. It's very thin and I haven't had much of a use for it. I do feel that it is overpriced for what you get though.
