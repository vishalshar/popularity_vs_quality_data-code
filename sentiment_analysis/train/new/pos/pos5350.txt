after having one very good monitor for several years (which broke right before our 3rd baby was born) we had to go out looking for something new.  i purchased an expensive graco monitor that was on sale thinking i fell into a great bargain but was disapointed.  the volume was very loud, even on the lowest setting and distracting since i could hear all the tansmitter noise from it just being on.  it went right back to the store!  the sound and lights monitor allows me to turn the volume all the way down (which is not silent but very very soft) and just use the lights to keep an eye on the baby.  i can hear everything when i turn the volume up, including the whir of computer in my room where the baby is also.  it is so sensitive and clear that if the window is open in the room where the transmitter is i can hear what is going on outside through the monitor from downstairs!  but it's nice to be able to turn the volume all the way down and not be hit by a constant barrage of noise that i do not need to listen to, e.g.: dogs barking outside, geese honking (though the only interference i get is a slight static from my under-cabinet halogen lights -- moving the receiver away takes care of the problem)! as an experienced mom i can often tell by the lights if the baby needs to be picked up, and if in doubt, i just turn up the volume!  it's perfect and so is the price!
