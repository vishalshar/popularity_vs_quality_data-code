After extensive research on convertible car seats, we chose the Britax Boulevard 70 for our 10 month-old daughter. The CS (Click and Safe) feature was not a feature that I felt we needed as we always double check both the fit/snugness of the harness as well as the buckle.  [BTW, there is a great write-up that summarizes this feature at: [...]Amazon offered this convertible car seat (with the CS feature) for much less than we could find anywhere else on the internet or at a brick and mortar vendor (including using 20% off coupons).  Even at full retail (approx $329), the safety ratings and feedback from other parents from various groups to which we belong indicated that the Britax convertible car seats (Marathon as well as the Boulevard) were the best option as far as safety and quality of construction.  We were in an auto accident when I was 16 weeks pregnant and both my husband and I suffered significant neck and back injuries so we are particularly mindful of protecting our daughter in the car. While I realize the car seat is not inexpensive, I would rather cut back in other areas and spend the extra money on this particular convertible car seat.We have only recently begun to use this car seat so I cannot comment on the durability of the construction (the seat/base appear quite sturdy) nor ease of cleaning of the seat (the fabric appears to be of good quality and we chose a color/pattern which would be forgiving).An added bonus is that our daughter - who still suffers from GERD - is much more comfortable in the convertible car seat than she was in the Graco car seat we had been using, as the incline is better positioned for her.The only drawback we have noted thus far is how to attach toys to the convertible car seat since there is not a carrying handle.  As our daughter is only 10 months-old and rear-facing, she still needs various stimuli to play with (we have an activity mat and mirror on the back of the seat which she faces but she is not able to reach them). This is not an issue which I feel is unique to this convertible car seat, however, we just need to get a bit more creative in how we attach the toys!
