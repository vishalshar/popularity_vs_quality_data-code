I like the Dr. Seuss motif, and bought them for my six month old son (although this would work for a girl too). When I got them I was worried because the material of the green, and red bib was velboa (a fluffy soft, stuffed animal kind of texture) I thought that would never wash well, or stay looking fresh. Well, I was wrong. Washed great, and the size of the bib is more generous then the typical bib of the same ilk. Would recommend.
