Selected this model because it meets all  domestic and international carry on standards. My 5 and 7 year olds each have one. Just packed them for a 3 week trip. easily fit: pr pants, 6 shorts, 6 shirts, 2 long sleeve shirts, swim suit, socks, etc. As they get older, this will be a great little carry on for essentials. The hard shell isn't rock hard, but tough. Will update after we travel. **UPDATE: After a 3-week trip (which included checking the bags at the airport twice), I'm very happy with this product. There's a little scuffing on the edges, but the zipper has held strong as did all the other working parts. Plus the kids love them and are in charge of their own bags. Winner all around.
