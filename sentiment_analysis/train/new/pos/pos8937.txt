If you are looking for an every day high chair do not purchase this. This is great as a travel booster (eating at parents house or traveling). But for everyday you are better off with the fisher price product. This is also great as just a booster without the tray if your child is old enough to eat at the table but can't quite reach it. The many options (with the tray or without, with arm rests or without, with back or without) is great which means the seat grows with the child. Only downfall we had with the tray is the cup holder part doesn't fit most sippies.
