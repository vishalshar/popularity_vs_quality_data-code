This was the first pacifier clip I purchased...because it's one of the more moderately priced ones at $3.99. I also have a Booginhead on the way for $5.50, but this one worked out so well that I'm not sure I need it anymore. Here's some info:1. Plastic. Yes, it's plastic, but the part that hooks onto the paci is soft and bendy not brittle. Baby also enjoys chewing on it.2. Clip operation. The clip is behind Piyo Piyo (the duck guy). It's not the standard squeeze to open. You lift the part you would normally squeeze, and the teeth on the other end open. You push it down, and the teeth clamp shut. Like i said, this is my first paci clip so I don't know how others are, but this clip is pretty nifty. Not too shallow either, so you can actually clamp some shirt or seatbelt and get it to stay put.3. Length. Generous length, though not dangerously so. I clip it near my baby's tummy and feel fine. I could see it potentially getting tangled around her wrist, but it hasn't happened.4. Manufacture. Based on the packaging, this product is from Hong Kong or China, not Japan. Just an FYI.Overall, very cute and works well. Only drawback is that it won't work with soothies (it will, but would push against baby's face). I would purchase a second one if necessary.
