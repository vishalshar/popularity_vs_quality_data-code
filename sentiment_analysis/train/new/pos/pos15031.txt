I am so happy with this purchase!  We waited to find out our baby's gender until he was born.  I had planned on ordering other bedding, but by the time my son arrived, it was sold out.  But, I'm so happy because I found this set instead!  The quilt is so warm and thick.  The bumpers are very fuzzy and so adorable.  Everything is very high quality.
