Being a first time mom, we'd been using standard terry cloth type bibs even during solid food feedings. We were accumulating stained bibs despite our best efforts to stain-treat them when I remarked to my husband it'd sure be nice if they made waterproof ones we could just rinse off and reuse. Voila! Not only are the Bumkins Waterproof SuperBibs waterproof and machine washable, they are still soft against baby's skin unlike some of the thicker plastic/rubber bibs out there.  They are also generously sized so they will fit our little one's neck as she (rapidly) grows, whereas some of her original terry cloth bibs are already too tight.The price is a little high for just 3 bibs but they clean up so quickly and easily you may get by with far fewer than traditional cloth bibs. You literally can rinse off the soiled bib under the tap in your kitchen sink, scrunch it up to wring out any water, lay it out and it'll be dry in an hour or less.  And they hold up great in a washer and dryer (we wash them along with the rest of our little one's clothing, gentle cycle, and you don't really need to put them in the dryer.)
