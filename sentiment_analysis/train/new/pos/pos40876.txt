This is a wonderful activity center for toddlers.  Adjustable it provides entertainment for babies, from first sitting up through early walking ages.  Musical, attractive, engaging and good exercise -- it's rightfully popular.This model is actually the second Fisher-Price jumperoo I've purchased.  First came the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo, the original model introduced several years ago, the one with vertical supporting poles and a circular base.  My grandson loved it and then so did his mother, my daughter.  Thus it ended up in their home and a replacement for Grandma's House was in order.  As my wife didn't want exactly the same model, I next purchased this one for roughly the same price.  We are very pleased with both.So what are the differences?  In the original, the Rainforest Jumperoo, the vertical supports are more rigid.  This one, the Rainforest Friends, has a smaller, more triangular base, with curved supporting poles.  This design is more flexible, with all the pieces moving together.  Its looser configuration allows the seat to move somewhat back and forth as well as up and down, a smoother, less jerky movement.  This one has a green hard plastic palm frond for dangling the teether/toy as opposed to a felt frond with a plastic rib for the original.  Other than that they are VERY similar.Other reviewers have complained that this model is dangerous, that their child's safety was at issue.  Obviously its loose jointed construction is intentional.  Being an engineer I checked out this model thoroughly for any tendency to break due to wear, to come unexpectedly apart or to topple due to vigorous use.  I find none at risk.  My grandson gives ours a thorough workout with the pieces moving easily in harmony.Both jumperoos are fine products.  If my other daughter ever gives us cause to buy yet another, I would buy this one.
