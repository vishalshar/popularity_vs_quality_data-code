Good quality for the price. Able to withstand multiple uses, holds up to the high temperatures of the dishwasher, and cheap enough that I'm not sad when we lose one. My toddler thinks it's fun to throw away utensils so I expect these will disappear quickly but if they happen to hang around they are quite durable and should last without issue.The utensils are slightly smaller than my Re-Play set. They are not as dense as though but at nearly 1/3 of the price the quality isn't much lower. My favorite utensils are the Nuby but they are also the most expensive. The. But had a large emotions grip and a deep curve to hold food.Again though I do like these Take and Toss. The handle is curved and has finger grooves that encourages a solid grip. The spoon and fork base have a concave shape that helps to hold food on.Perfect for travel, daycare, or for the toddler that enjoys trashing your dishes. I would definitely buy them again.
