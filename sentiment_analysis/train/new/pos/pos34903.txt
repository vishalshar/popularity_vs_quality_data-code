It's not possible to loosen the belts on our car seat in the way that we could slide the buckles on it, so I had to be inventive... I just sewed it with threads on it! Our nearly five years old son with development disorder was pretty surprised when I introduced it first time. It's been one week I'm using those buckles and it works great! Finally I'm not so worried because our son was taking the belts all the time of his shoulders no matter how tight they were...thanks! PS: I wouldn't recommend for tiny children or baby's, it would be too big...
