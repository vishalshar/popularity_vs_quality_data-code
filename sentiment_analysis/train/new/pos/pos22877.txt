This is pretty much the same thing as an arctic one but without a blanket. We already had a blanket that we could use.The fabric is surprisingly soft and it feels better than it looks in the picture, also color looks better too. We returned JJ Cole Urban Bundle me, because of it being unsafe for car seats. I was really happy to find out that the fabric, even though a different texture, is as good of quality as JJ Cole's. Also wasn't to crazy about the JJ Cole going over the baby's face completely, and this one seems to leave some room for breathing while serving as a shield from wind and chill. Not sure if it is completely waterproof, more water resistant, but I am not planning on walking around in rain for extended period of time!
