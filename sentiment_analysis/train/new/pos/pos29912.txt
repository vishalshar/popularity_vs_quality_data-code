We got a green one from the hospital and our baby loves it. We figure we should just stick with what we have instead of experimenting. We found a similar-looking one by Avent but they weren't the same. Thank goodness Amazon has these. They are exactly the same as the one we got from the hospital except the color but the engraving on the pacifier is all the same. The color for the blue ones is actually much lighter in person than in the picture -- more of a transparent grayish light blue; very pretty though.I personally like how it's one piece so I don't have to worry about loose pieces coming off -- choking hazard. The pacifier is really soft. I know they make harder ones for teethers but these are the softer ones for newborns and non-teething babies. It's very easy to clean and long-lasting. We're actually still using the green one we got from the hospital but having spares make it easier if I have to clean them then I don't have to worry about not having a pacifier available if it's being sterilized. I sterilizes them in boiling water and they stand up to the heat very well.These pacifiers does tend to get stuff like lint and hair stuck on them because of their sticky-ish surface. I don't use napkins or cloths with lots of fiber to wipe them otherwise they get fury. Most of the time I just run it through warm-hot water and maybe scrub it a little with my hands then let it air dry.
