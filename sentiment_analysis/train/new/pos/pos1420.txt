These and by far the best sippy cups ive come across.  Before being done with bottles, my lo was using size 3/ fast flow nipples.  These cups have a flow similar to what she was use to and is why I believe she took to these cups so well!!  Every other sippy we tried was much harder to use and she would get frustrated.  So thanks boon for these awesome cups.
