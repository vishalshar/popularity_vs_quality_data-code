Well, it's that time. My small 5 year old daughter has hit the milestone of graduating to the big girl seat. We have been using our beloved BRITAX ROUNDABOUT for as long as we possibly could. It was an easy choice, to get another Britax...until they discontinued the cowmooflage parkway model that i wanted to move into. So i asked friends who own a compass, poured over info at many babystore sites. I could just not buy the junk flimsy seats that i see in most stores. I saw the Giraffe print here at amazon first and was reassured that this Compass was the answer. I didn't want the basic version from the store, my daughter was going to get a FUN one. Kudos to Compass for understanding that making the seats comfy &'cool' is key to getting kids to willingly sit in a booster.From order to door, this amazing seat arrived in less than 3 days with super saver shipping! (of course, i am on the same coast as the distribution center, but Amazon has always shipped my orders within just hours of ordering) SEAT DETAILS; I was pleasantly surprised that the 'spots' are BLACK not chocolate(if you care about that sort of thing like i do ;) What gives her *****? Build quality, fabrics, ergonomics, genius design from folding down forward, adjustable FULL back, to the smooth bottom to protect your leather seats...it's a no brainer. We have moved from Britax to Compass with ease. Or Cow to Giraffe...*Check out that camouflage version for your little man too!*
