This blanket was better than I expected.  It's soft and adorable.  My 3 month old son was not "into" tags but I thought he'd like it because he likes to chews on blankets.  The weather is getting hot so I don't put a blanket on him when he's in the car seat anymore.  He seemed bored and doesn't hold on to toys for very long.  So I got this and it's perfect.  He loves to hold it and suck on it.  The colorful tags capture his attention too.  It's the perfect size.  It's not meant to keep him warm, just something for him to chew and play with.  It's held up for about 5 washes and seems very durable.  I also ordered a learning curve teething blanket but haven't tried it out yet.  He may like it better because it has different textures but the crinkle is loud and i might sometimes prefer he play with the quiet blanket.  :)
