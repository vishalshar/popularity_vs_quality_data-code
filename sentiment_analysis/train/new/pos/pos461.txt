I did a lot of research into what kind of stroller I wanted and decided I didn't want to buy a big set of stroller & car seat for financial reasons.  I was worried that I wouldn't use the big stroller that typically comes in those sets and end up wasting a lot of money.  I wanted to save the big bucks for a jogging stroller, but those aren't typically easy to use for an infant and not convenient to take into stores. I really liked the idea of the stroller frame, especially when my little girl was still in her infant car seat.It's so easy to pop it out and stick the car seat in it.  It's light weight and small, so it's easy to maneuver in a store with small aisles. My only complaint is that when the car seat is in place, it's hard to get things in and out of the storage basket.  You aren't able to stick a diaper bag into it and pull it out easily when you need it.  You have to undo the locks at the bottom of the car seat and tilt it back to get anything large in and out. I ended up buying a jj cole diaper bag that attached to the handle bar with clips.  For me, the basket wasn't very useful except for coats and blankets.Other than the basket, I found it very useful!  I would buy this again.
