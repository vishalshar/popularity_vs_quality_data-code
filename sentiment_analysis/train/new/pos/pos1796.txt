Great concept and design, but this product has glaring flaws.Pros:-Keeps everything organised! The configurations are endless. It can be used as 1 large rack or 2 separate racks, the pegs can be arranged as needed, and you can place or hang just about any bottle gear I can think of and much more.-Doesn't take up much counter space.-Comes with drying mats.Cons:-Falls apart readily. None of the pieces snap together or lock into place so the pegs come out VERY easily. This is definitely frustrating!-It isn't weighted, so it could potentially tip over. This has never been a problem for me but it could be for some. This definitely wouldn't work for glass bottles.-Very small pieces can fall in between the racks. I find myself having to lift the entire unit up to retrieve a peg or pump membrane out from underneath. This isn't difficult, just annoying. A smaller clearance between the bottom openings would help prevent this.Overall, I like this product a lot compared to other designs but it definitely could use some basic upgrades.
