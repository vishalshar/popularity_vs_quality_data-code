I wanted to create a second changing "station" in my living room so that I don't have to run upstairs with my son every time he needs a diaper change. I wanted something that would fit in the decor of our living room and this basket was the perfect fit between the dark brown basket and the polkadot brown and beige colored liner. In the future, when my son no longer needs diapers, the pattern is neutral enough that I could use it to store anything else and it not look like it was meant for a nursery. I store a decent amount of diapers, two bottles of lotion, and a tub of wipes in the basket.
