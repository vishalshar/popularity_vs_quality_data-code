I ordered the standard Easy Step gate, and it was too narrow by just a few centimeters. This one was just right for the doorway into my kitchen. Be sure to really read the instructions, as some other reviews point out. Measuring will also help you get a more precise fit. There's my old pressure gate in the background of the photo, which my two-year-old could take down with one swift kick. No more eggs taken out of the fridge and broken. No more finding cat food and water dumped onto the linoleum. No more flour dumped onto the carpet. Most importantly, my daughter won't have access to the stove or sharp kitchen tools. Thanks, Regalo Easy Step gate! My life is just a little bit easier.
