We full time in an Rv and this was my third high chair to purchase from Amazon and the other two obviously didn't work out, but I'm absolutely obsessed with this chair. Works great on your Rv table tho im sure it wouldn't work on all Rv tables. Ours is very stable. It doesn't take up much space at all. Doesn't jut out into our room too far. It fits my 2 year old really well with tons of room for growth (one of the big issues with the other chairs were they were too small). Easy to clean too! My daughter loves it, I love it and so does my husband. I will never go back to a standing high chair ever again!
