This was an easy setup, looks great, like the bonus sippy cup! Easy to take apart to do the seat-only on the floor. And my 11 month old seems to sit longer in it than his previous seat, and loves to "dance" while eating which brings this cute bouncy action as he rocks in the seat. Love it for all these great features. Only two concerns: 1) The legs feel a bit too springy - almost unstable - when I put my son into the seat. The legs feel like they'll keep spreading apart...but they don't, thankfully. 2) it's really hard to push the chair back when we're finished mealtime because of the rubber "shoes" on the two back legs. The chair is easy to move around when standing behind it, but it's very difficult to maneuver from any other side. Combi needs to reengineer these: a leg brace and handles to lift from the front are two thoughts.
