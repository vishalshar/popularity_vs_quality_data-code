I bought this for my son when he was 2 weeks old.  He hated the Fisher Price Rainforest bouncer seat and I wanted to be able to reach him from the couch or floor while I was pumping.  My son sleeps soundly in this for his naps without any trouble.  I can tell when the boucing turns itself off after about 20 or 30 minutes because he will start to stir a bit.  He loves the nature sounds which are more like white noise and he is starting to get into the music as he gets a bit older.  You can rock the chair with your foot and it slides easily across the carpet.  We even slide him into the dining room when we eat in this seat so we can see him better from the table.  Don't buy another bouncer seat, you won't like it as much as this one!  The only things I don't like are the toy bar doesn't stay in that well and it is too far away for  my son to reach.  Also, the bouncing will turn itself off and he likes it to stay on.
