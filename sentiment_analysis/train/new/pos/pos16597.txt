I was going to do the online tutorial to make my own and muss around with a bunch of stuff, then realized it would only save me like 5 dollars and it would look terrible.  This sprayer has enough juice to blast the diapers clean and sometimes even give me a little thrill (YIKES!).  Easy, ergonomic, stylish, worth the extra couple bucks to buy and not have a headache with pipe dope etc.
