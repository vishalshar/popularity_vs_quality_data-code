Over the last year and a half, I have placed many orders for these pacifiers for my twin toddlers.  This is a five-star purchase if you are buying an already beloved pacifier for your child.  I think the design of the Nuk is by far the best - the large centered handle, the curved shape of the plastic and the angled nipple.  And of course, it is extremely adorable that these are almost identical to the pacifiers that I used when I was a baby. Note that color is random, but never the pastel colors shown in the photo.  You will get either bright pink/purple/green or bright blue/orange/green.However, if you are considering a new kind of pacifier for your child, I highly recommend against the Latex Nuk and encourage you to get the NUK Juicy Puller Silicone Pacifier in Assorted Colors, 6-18 Months instead for these reasons:-The latex appear to be slowly being phased out so you risk getting your child hooked and then not being able to find replacements.  I already can't find replacements in stores.-The color selection is extremely limited.-The latex will degrade over time, especially if you're frequently sanitizing them.  That means it will start to feel "thin" and could even rip (although I have to say, I've never had one actually break).  I have to replace these every six months or so.-Mainly, the latex ones are very difficult to clean.  Gunk gets down between the nipple and plastic cover.  I've never had that issue with the silicone ones.
