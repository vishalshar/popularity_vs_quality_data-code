Love this item, hooked up to my dewalt job radio  (aux input)  and crank it up after every goal.  Unit itself has good sound, but not very loud, literally has every goal horn in the NHL.  Mine, of course is glued to the  NJ Devils, (ok, so it hasn't been going off much the past few games) but move the bottom knob to your fans number, and you'll think your at the game.
