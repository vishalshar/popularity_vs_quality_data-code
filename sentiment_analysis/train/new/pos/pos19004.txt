My one year oel LOVES this puppy dog !When you pull it, he barks and sniffs like a real dog. His ears are very soft. My daughter loves to pull it around the house and she laughs every time he barks. Its super cute ! The strong is the perfect length as well ! We had another one and the string was too short so every time she pulled it the dog fell over and shed get super mad. This one is great!
