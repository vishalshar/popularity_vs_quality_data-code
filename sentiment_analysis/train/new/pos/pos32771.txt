Based upon the other two pretty poor reviews I was a little hesitant buying this, but I am GLAD I did! I'm surprised these aren't sold more widely. It's so cool looking! Works just like the bigger desktop versions do. It also does the thing where when you touch the bulb with a finger(s) the light follows you. The bulb is bigger than I thought it would be, about regular lightbulb size, but that's fine. Can't wait for my friends to see it, guaranteed conversation piece. Complete with on/off switch it's convenient to just turn it off. LOVE IT! I might get another for more rooms in my house.
