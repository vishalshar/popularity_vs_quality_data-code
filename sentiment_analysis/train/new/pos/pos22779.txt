I wanted to do better for the environment with my first child. Real Nappies are good basic diapers. They are also a good value. The diapers themsleves, are "old school", big pieces of absorbent cloth. You fold them and they fit into the nifty waterproof pants. The diapers come with inner liners that keep the poo from staining the cloth diapers. I was pretty grossed out about the idea of cloth diapers, but the liners keep them from getting too gross. I use the detergent made for cloth diapers, which I purchased on Amazon. I was them every couple days, since they are mostly pees. The only problem is that the diapers are bulky (like a lof of cloth diapers) so his pants and outfits don't always fit. The kit is a good value, with the diapers, 3 outer liners and inner liners. It is a great intro to cloth diapers for someone who wants to try them out seriously. I ordered the next step up as well, as I was happy with them. Many of the plastic pants costs around $12 and you get three with this kit, and I use them with other cloth diapers as well. Other intro kits are far more expensive. My son doesn't mind them. Keep in mind, these do have to be changed often, as they don't do anything magic, like whisk away moisture with weird gels or chemicals. My son doesn't seem to know the difference, so we will keep using Real Nappies!
