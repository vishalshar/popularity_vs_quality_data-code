I LOVE THESE COVERS! When we started cloth diapering we tried several different things. We tried pocket diapers. Not bad. We tried the AIO from BumGenius. Those are good until your kid has a poop, and then are impossible to clean properly. We tried Ozycozy better fit trifolds with snap covers from Rumparooz and Thirsties. Again, good unless you're dealing with poop. Rumparooz didn't leak, but Thirsties did. But those trifolds made a mess no matter what cover we were using. Then, I found the Clotheez Work Horse and these covers. Life changed. It's my favorite system hands down.I ordered one cover and two work horses just to try. Within 48 hours I ordered a dozen of the work horses and 4 more of the Loveybums. These do not leak. These dry very quickly if any urine gets through the diaper. The work horses have completed contained any poop, so I've never even had to find out if these covers can handle it.Cons? This is the most expensive system. But my 15lb 5 month old has plenty of room to grow in the medium. They're good for up to 22lbs, but my son is long and lean and often fits into things for much longer than the tag says he will. (Still comfortably in size 1 Pampers/Huggies we use for back up on day outings). I'm quite sure that we'll be able to use these until he's completely out of diapers.I have included photos of the French blue, seafoam, green tea, mango, and sunflower covers.  The colors are much lighter than I was expecting. But still cute. Definitely less bulky than any other cloth diapering system we've tried, too.
