My sister added these to her Amazon baby registry, and since I'm a wonderful sister (and now aunt), I purchased them for her for my nephew's Dr. Seuss themed room.  I think they are a great, colorful 'neutral' - they would work well for a boy's or girl's room.These bedding pieces cover all of the basics:  they're adorable, they fit well in the crib, they are quality construction, the colors haven't faded or run, they are easy to clean, etc.  They're fantastic.But the real reason I finally felt like coming back to review them, a little more than a year and a half later, and give them five stars is because this was my sister's Facebook post earlier this week:  "Not sure what to be more excited about...Jack-Jack sleeping in until 9:45 in his own bed or how I heard that he was finally up when he started saying the different letters that are all over his sheet!"My 1 1/2 year old nephew actually woke up and entertained himself by pointing out the letters on his sheets and saying them.  I'm a proud aunt!So, you really can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss ABC sheets.
