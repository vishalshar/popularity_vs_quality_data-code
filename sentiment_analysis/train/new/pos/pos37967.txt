I love this bottle! My son has been using Dr browns bottles since he was first born cause he would have bad gas and those were the best ones for that. Then he refused any other bottle until this one for some reason. I am so relieved because although Dr browns are great for helping relieve gas, they are a pain to clean! I also love this bottle because I can just leave it beside my bed at night for night feedings and not worry about it going bad. I will be purchasing another! The only thing I don't like about it is my son likes the chew on the bottom of bottles for some reason, and the paint will chip. But I just have to keep my eyes on him so he don't do that!
