Ever since we got the Bundleme there has always been one less blanket to cart around.  The only reason to bring one is if you need to take the baby out of the car seat where it's cold enough to need a blanket.  It has kept my daughter nice and warm wherever we have gone this winter, and I will continue to use it for the rest of the winter.One thing to consider, however, as the baby gets a little older, he/she might free his/her arms from the Bundleme, so a sweater might be advisable when the baby is old enough to figure out how to do this.
