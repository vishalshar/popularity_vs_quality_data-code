We use the Dr. Brown glass bottles and bought these sleeves to help protect them in case of fall, but to also help the bottles from getting too slippery with condensation.  We received two sleeves, both in the light blue.  I was impressed by how easily they slip on and off the bottles, but manage to stay secure when they are on.  To easily remove them, I push with my thumbs on the glass bottom.  The wholes on the sides are on a diagonal which prohibits them from lining up with the ounces/mL reading.  However, you can see through the sleeve to see where the milk line is.  Pictures shows a Dr. Brown bottle with the secure lid we use for shaking.
