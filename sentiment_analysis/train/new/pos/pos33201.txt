We tried several different potties, but this one has been the best for everyone. The kids (a girl and boy) LIKE it, it is a good size (they're both pretty tall for their age), there is less of a mess when either of them have used it compared to other potties, and it is so easy to keep clean ONE piece and not 4. This really helped my son get comfortable potty training.Once my son was an expert potty user, we moved him to a potty seat on the toilet itself, but we keep the potty in the trunk of the car as a backup in case my son is not comfortable trying a strange toilet somewhere new. We call it his Joshua potty, because the first one we bought was the boy one and it came with a book, which the kids love. You can order that one on Amazon too, but I got this exact one with the CD for my daughter because we already have the girls' book and I figured we would try the cd. The music - meh. The neat thing about this one compared to the one that comes with a book is that it has a girl and a boy on the front sticker instead of just one or the other. Sometimes, something little like is fun for a kid. :)
