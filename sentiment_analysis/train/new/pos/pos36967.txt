I had this item on my registry from babies r us for the 9 piece set. I then found this 6 piece set with more of the items I wanted. A lot better price then with more useful items than the 9 piece set and a lot cheaper than at babies r us. Very glad i purchased this item. It's colorful and will last me through his toddler stage. The only thing I would warn about that didn't bother me but is something to consider the window valance does not cover the curtain rod because of the style. If you do not like the curtain rod showing it's something to consider. But in my opinion it doesn't really look all that bad. I would definitely recommend this product.
