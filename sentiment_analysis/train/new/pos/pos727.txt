We bought a second one of these so grandma can bring the baby in her car when she is baby sitting. The seat itself is great but the base is very convenient to install. Our car is older and does not have the anchors so we need to use the seatbelt, but her car does have the anchors and the seat is so easy to install with the anchors. There is also a plastic bit in the back that changes the seat inclination. This is important to adjust (there should be an indicator on the seat) because not all seats in cars are sloped the same way, and the carseat is tested at a certain inclination.
