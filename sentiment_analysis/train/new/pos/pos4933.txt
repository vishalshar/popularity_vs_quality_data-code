I got this toy when my baby was 7 months old, and he's now 8 1/2 months old.  We've used it for lots of local driving and a roundtrip from Los Angeles to Phoenix (7+ hours each way).  It doesn't work miracles, but it does definitely help calm and distract my baby when he starts to fuss, about 70%-80% of the time.  And I think it's more effective now than it was when we first got it, maybe because the baby has started to look forward to it. It might help that I *only* use it when he starts to fuss.I haven't had any problems with the toy working, and the volume dial is a nice feature. It does have its shortcomings, though, like some of the other reviewers pointed out: It only stays on for about 15 minutes (presumably to save batteries) so pretty much every time I put the baby in his carseat, I push the button to turn it on, just in case we need it during the drive.  It sometimes moves out of place which can affect being able to see the baby in the mirror, but it still works to distract him.  It plays 5 or 6 songs in random order, but they are all extremely short, so it ends up being very repetitive.Overall, I think it's a useful tool for calming the baby during car trips, and when it doesn't work it's generally because my baby is so tired or hungry that I don't think anything would really help except getting him out of the car.  And even though the repetitive songs can get annoying, it's far better than hearing a baby screaming while everyone is trapped in the car together!
