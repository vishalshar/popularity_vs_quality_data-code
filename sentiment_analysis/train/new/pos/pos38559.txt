I'm not going to spoil the fun and tell you what all the animals are, but there's a unicorn and a T-Rex and it is hell-a awesome. I love that the letters are stamped right on the animals, so you can spell words with them too.The only thing I'd change (and the reason I gave it 4 stars) is that the design is a little awkward with the first 3 letter pockets and animals on the front, attached with ribbons.  They should have put those animals inside, unattached.  As it is, we had to snip them off their ribbons, and just sort of stick them inside the zippered part so they won't get lost.
