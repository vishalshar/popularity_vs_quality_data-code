The Lion King bedding was well received by my 2-year old problematic sleeper.  She is sleeping better, and definitely loves having a lion-themed bed.The fitted sheet fits a standard toddler bed nice and tight.  It features a paw print design throughout.  Same with the fitted sheet.  The polyester microfiber material is silky which means it will hold up well to heavy use and washings.  The pillow has a different design on each side, the first is two baby lions (Simba and Nala), the other one has a Warthog and a Meerkat (Timon and Pumbaa).  The comforter has pawprints on one side, and the familiar baby lions on the front with the words "Hakuna Matata".The comforter seems very light weight.  This is good and bad.  Toddlers might prefer lighter covers to feel more comfortable and move freely.  However I worry that it's not warm enough at nights, which is why I usually throw an extra blanket on.Overall, the quality of the Disney bedding is good.  If your child has an affinity to baby lions, definitely go with this bedding.
