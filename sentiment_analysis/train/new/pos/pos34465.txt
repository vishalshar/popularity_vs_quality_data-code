Bought the Carters Easy Fit Jersey Portable Crib Fitted Sheet, Pink after another reviewer recommended it based on the purchase of the Dream On Me 2 in 1 Portable Folding Stationary Side Crib and then upgrading to the Dream on Me 3" mattress instead of the flimsy mattress it came with. The combination worked really well for us and I preferred it to the Pack n Play for baby to sleep in when it was possible for us to bring this instead. Also would be perfect to keep at Grandma's house.
