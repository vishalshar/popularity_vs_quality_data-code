I love the Joovy Twin Roo.  It's one of the products I would recommend the most for parents of twins.  I had heard so much about the Double Snap N Go as a great option for twin parents and after looking at the manufacturers's website and viewing the product itself, I understood that Chicco carseats would fit into the double snap and go.  They do not...or at least not easily.  If you do some searching on this topic, you'll find that some earlier model of Chicco carseats did in fact fit into the double snap and go, however the current market versions do not.  It was very frustrating to try and use the double snap and go with our Chicco KeyFit carseats so we ultimately returned the snap and go, but were left with no reasonable alternatives.Luckily, I did some research and found that the Joovy TwinRoo was soon to be released.  We ended up going 'stroller-less' for about the first month of our twins' lives because I wanted to wait for the Joovy TwinRoo...I have to say that we have been extraordinarily pleased with this product.  I think it's better constructed and has a smoother ride than the Snap and Go, and I really enjoy the placement of the carseats side by side with heads on different ends.  It's really helpful when you are out using the stoller and you want to attend to the babies.  It maneuvers very well - surprisingly so, I expected a ride that was much rougher given that it is an inexpensive stroller.Overall, we are very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it.  Just make sure you check with the manufacturer to ensure your carseat is compatible.
