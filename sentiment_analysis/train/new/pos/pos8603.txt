We foster dogs for an area rescue and needed something to help us keep them out of the kitchen at times, however the 67 inch opening ruled out most of the pet gates we'd found. When I came across this I thought, at last! A gate that would span the gap AND that looked nice. My sister-in-law had a cheap pet gate that you have to step over, and one night she didn't quit make it, fell, and broke her collarbone on a dresser. I didn't intend to make the same mistake!The gate has separate pieces that screw into the walls, and then the gate itself sets down on the wall mounts and latches into place. The walk through gate is more than adequately wide and has a self closing mechanism on it so you don't have to shut the gate behind you. To open it, you push a button on the top and then push. We have to lift the gate a bit because we didn't get it all installed perfectly level, but it works great. The way it adjusts to fit the width is by hinging on either side of the walk through, so it will angle if the gap you're closing off is less than 72".My only complaint is that when it arrived, one of the bars was badly bent. Not just any bar, but one by the gate that you use to tighten the adjustable hinged part. It still works and the damage is mainly cosmetic so I didn't want to bother with trying to send it back for a replacement. Mainly because I need it NOW. The box was undamaged so it's pretty clear to me it was bent when it went into the box. I'd still recommend this to anyone looking for a quality pet or child gate, and likely will be buying another for another area of the house.
