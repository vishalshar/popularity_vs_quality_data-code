I've been buying (and replacing) what my daughter named "B" when she was just 10 months old. She's now five and still takes her"B" everywhere. I've always had a backup, but she was on her last one. I had told her that I was not going to purchase another one since she's going to be 5 and she needs to let it go. However, when she lost it last week, I couldn't bear seeing her broken hearted, so I purchased yet another. It's the perfect size for a "lovey". Definitely over priced, but I'll probably be purchasing these dang blankies until she's 30. lol.
