I was a little worried after seeing the reviews here, but my wife called Summer and they assured us that this was the correct camera for our situation and told us they would take it as a return if it did not work.It works!We have a 15 month old son and a daughter on the way in a few weeks.  We were about to buy a second video monitor system when my wife learned about just getting a second camera for our current system and using the B channel.Brilliant.  Only one monitor to haul around and far less expense than having to buy another whole system.We installed the camera in our son's new "big boy room" and tuned it to channel B and we switch between A for the "infant room" and B for his room and it works great.The "night vision' is outstanding.  You get a "night-vision" view of your child which is surprisingly clear and sharp.  The day camera is full color and crisp as well.Occasionally if you move far enough from the camera and there are others in your neighborhood with the same camera, you will get their kid instead of your own - but this has never been a real problem for us.I also saw a review where one person was surprised there was no "scanning" or way to see two children at once.  I don't know if they had the first system and then added on, or bought the whole thing at once.  If they added on, then I'd say that it was pretty obvious that you weren't going to get a "scanner" or "see two cameras at once" view.  It is pretty clear you will have to switch from A to B with a simple switch on the side.The way we use the camera, that is perfectly fine.  You don't sit and watch your kid like it is a tv show.  You merely click on the tv monitor from time to time to check on them, especially if you think you hear something.  We've found this to be an outstanding option and thank you Summer for not forcing us to buy a whole new system when all we needed was one more camera!
