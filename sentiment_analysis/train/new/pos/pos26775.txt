There are several of this kind of hat on here and almost all have low reviews due to size. I went with this one because it has the snaps and can be easily altered to adjust for larger sizes (kind of like the hair tie trick to make pants bigger). It is a bit small. My 11 month old's head is large enough and small enough that he's somewhere between the largest and second to largest setting. So I have it at largest. So I drop a star for size.As for how it works? It is awesome. We only have a shower in our home, no bath tub, so washing his hair was awful, he'd scream and get water/soap in his eyes. But I used this for the first time today and it worked great. He didn't even get fussy. He's in that stage where he fights getting dressed and diaper changes, so it was a bit of an adventure to get it on him. I wound up snapping it before putting it on him and then pushing it down onto his head, but I'm sure it'll get easier as I use it more. I'm very glad I bought this, and I'm happy that showers will no longer be awful for him.Edit: My son is now just over 12 months old and the hat still works great for him! And I was right, it's a lot easier to get it on him now.
