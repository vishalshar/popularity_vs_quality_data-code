About a month and a half ago, my baby developed this very annoying habit of scratching me whenever I would hold her or nurse her. Those of you with babies know how sharp their little nails are, I  had scratches on my face, neck, and breasts.  I tried tell her not to scratch me and saying things like, "Oww! That hurts mama!" But she just didn't get it. I even had my husband go get socks to put on her hands when she was scratching while nursing. Then, she started pulling my hair.  Even when I would wear it up in a ponytail or bun, she would reach around and grab the back of my hair and pull it.  I was at my wit's end, so I decided to look into nursing necklaces and ended up ordering the Cobalt Blue Chewbeads.  I am very happy with my purchase!  My baby grabs the chewbeads and plays with them, instead of scratching me and pulling my hair.  I have a 6-month old baby, so most of the time I am dressed casually and these beads complement my wardrobe nicely.  Some people have commented that they don't like the way they look, if you're looking for a fancy necklace, don't buy this! Seriously, I don't know who these people are complaining about how it looks- it's a teething necklace, it's not going to look like you're wearing the Queen's jewels!  Most days I don't get a shower until mid-afternoon, so anything that distracts from the spit-up and bed head is a plus in my book!
