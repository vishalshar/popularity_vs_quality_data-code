The sound module (left "arm") broke after less than a month, but Graco was great about replacing it. I contacted them and told them what happened, and they shipped a new piece to me very quickly and at no cost. In general, I like this swing. The toy bar that goes across the top is useless, though - the clips that hold it on are not strong enough even when the swing is stationary. My 4 month old likes this swing better than the one that goes side to side.Update: I continue to be impressed with Graco's customer service. The replacement arm that they sent had a good sound module, but the swing motor didn't work (sigh). The over-nighted me a second replacement arm, at no charge of course, and it is working great for now.
