This little ducky tub has been perfect for us! My daughter just turned a year old and fits in it very well, with plenty of room to move and kick around. (She's wearing 12-18 month clothes- about 23 lbs, to give you an idea on size). I keep it in the regular bathtub and it provides the cushion and support she needs during bath time. The quality has been very good. As much as she kicks and bounces in it, it has held up very well. I don't use the "hot" indicator because it doesn't seem all that accurate, but that's not a big deal for me. I wouldn't recommend relying on an indicator without testing the water yourself, even if it did work. I like this tub MUCH better than any of the hard, plastic tubs I've tried in the past. I do have to note I probably wouldn't use this tub without one of those sponge pads if my baby couldn't sit up (somewhat) on her own. It was a little difficult to keep her from sliding around and getting her face in the water before she was sitting up better. Even with the size she is, now, the sides of the tub offer enough height and support that she doesn't fall out or turn it over when she's leaning on them or trying to reach something outside the tub. I'm not sure what the limit is, as far as height/weight, but I will use this ducky tub for as long as my little one still fits in it. She loves it, and it makes bath time so much easier!
