These pads are great for what I need -- something substantial enough to absorb leaking milk (while my body is regulating milk production).  They're a little bigger than I expected diameter wise, but because of that, they give great coverage.  They're not overly bulky either and you could easily wear them under clothes without them being noticeable.  I don't think I'll continue to use this past the first few months of breastfeeding, as leaks seem to decrease a lot at that point, but for now, they're just what I need.
