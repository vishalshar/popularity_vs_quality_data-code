After having this one I am glad I didn't order the others without the strap under my baby for extra support. Many just wrap around the baby's center and not underneath them as well. This is a better option because my baby will suddenly drop sometimes when wearing this. This harness is strong enough for me to pick him up off the ground. It works really well and he enjoys being in it.
