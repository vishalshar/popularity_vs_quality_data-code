We purchased this toy 2 weeks ago and placed it on our baby's Britax carseat.  He adored it immediately!  And it only took him 1 week of intent & excited staring at it, before he figured out how to reach out and grab it! :)  Another week has gone by and he can now easily bring it to his mouth. The way the legs are designed are absolutely perfect for tiny hands to get a hold of, and the perfect height to grab when hanging from the britax handle. I love the fact that it's soft muted colors of blue(kind of a bluish grey) and yellow color.  I don't like my baby getting over stimulated (and cranky as a result) so, so far, we've only given him soft muted colors, and he does very well with them! This is a perfect toy for this age, We are very happy and would definitely recommend it.  BTW...my 3 1/2 year old also adores this toy and tries to "sneak" it away to play with it too. LOL
