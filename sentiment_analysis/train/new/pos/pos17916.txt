I bought this stroller in October 2011 to replace my generic Graco that got destroyed on a plane trip to the East Coast. I must say that I love this stroller! It is very attractive and reasonably priced. I get comments about it all the time when I take it out (which I love after envying Inglesina and Peg perego strollers for so long). I love that it reclines so my daughter can take a nap while we're on the go. I also love the option of being able to have her facing me or outward. The basket is very generously sized, it says 5lbs limit, but I can fit my purse, diaper bag and a blankey or two in there with no problem. As mentioned by other reviewers, mine got squeaky after a few uses, but the silicone spray worked just fine. I don't really find it that bothersome. I purchased the Retro Red and the color is very vibrant and wonderful. I have a Subaru Impreza and it fits in the trunk much easier than the crappy Graco we had before. (With room to spare, no less [as long as you detach the seat]). Another plus is that the Graco Snugride we have fits perfectly with the infant seat attachment that comes with the stroller. I would recommend this stroller to anyone!The only thing I wish this stroller did/had was a second seat attachment/option like the Peg Perego Skate or the Bugaboo Donkey.
