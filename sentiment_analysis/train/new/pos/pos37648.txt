We have twins, bought two of these, have been using them since they were 6 months old - still going strong at 19 month.  Here's a day in the life of the high chair:  They roll easily: we drag 'em from dining room to kitchen counter and back, 3 times a day - so easy.  They recline to several positions: when the little ones were just barely able to hold their own bottles we siezed the opportunity - in recline they could manage on their own just fine, AND more than once feeding led to a quick nap in the same position.  Ahhhhhh.  Adjustable height: you wouldn't think you'd care, but you will.  We dragged 'em outside on nice days and ate together on the porch - shortened the seat to be chaise lounge height, they were as easy to reach as my iced tea on the other side.  Portable: OK, they don't collapse into an 8" square, but still pretty good.  The wheels lock in place, and pop off, and everything else folds to the middle.  Having the "good chairs" at grammy's made life a lot easier than making do with the flimsy boosters.  Washable, of course: aren't they all???  Who would make a high chair pad out of anything BUT vinyl, anyway?.  Safety: 5-point harness is a must for anyone with a wiggling toddler.  They are trying, but haven't yet figured out how to undo the buckle.  Customer Service: Amazing. Pads are guaranteed for a year.  The CS staff in PA are wonderful.  Complaints: wish they could make the harness straps out of teflon - wiping mashed banana out of the webbing is not a pretty sight.  The tray has an insert that pops in and out for easy cleaning, so you're washing a thin lightweight tray instead of the whole unit.  But it's the same color as the base, so often I forget to pop it back on and end up feeding on the base tray.  A slightly contrasting color would help give parents a visual reminder to put the top tray on.That's all - minor stuff.  Can't say enough good about this high chair!
