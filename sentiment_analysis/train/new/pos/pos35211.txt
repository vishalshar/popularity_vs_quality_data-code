I love these diapers! My 2 favorite things about them are: 1) They have snaps specifically to fasten the leg holes nice and snug so they don't leak half as much as all other diapers I've tried; 2) They are super soft, even when we line-dry them, so we can save money by not using the dryer. The other cloth diapers I have tried were like sandpaper when we line-dried them, so that's a big plus for the Bumkins Stuff It diapers!We just got rid of all of the other diapers we tried and switched to this type. We can use extra soaker pads for nighttime too, and they help our baby sleep longer stretches through the night.The only issue I had was that one of the snaps on one of many diapers started to come loose. I contacted Bumkins customer service, and they immediately mailed me a replacement diaper, plus a very nice waterproof bib as an extra gift.Very satisfied customer!
