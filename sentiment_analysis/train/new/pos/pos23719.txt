Our bassinet came with a thin (not going to be adequate) crib mattress and this one was just a perfect replacement. It was the right price for a mattress you are only going to use for the first 6 months and it worked for the level of firmness we needed. It also has a mostly waterproof cover which made it easy to clean up typical newborn messes.
