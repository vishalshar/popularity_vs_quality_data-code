This fits perfect over the BOB with the infant carseat adapter and carseat in place.  It keeps the bugs off my little one while we are outside and I was skeptical about the UV protection, but my baby hasn't gotten burned (not like I leave him sitting in the sun or anything).  It's hard to keep the sun off of him at all times so this just gives a little added protection.  I'm really glad I bought this.
