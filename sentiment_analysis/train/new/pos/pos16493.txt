My daughter has several bottle huggers:a duck, a turtle, and now a blue octopus. I love these things because they help her to hold on to her bottles, giving her a sense of independence and they free my hands up if she needs fed while I pump. My daughter is a very aggressive nurser so I pump and bottle feed. These allow me to maintain my vigorous pump schedule and still attend to her. The Octopus seems very well made and I have gotten several compliments on him already. I gave him a 4 star rating for 2 reasons, 1) the price is a bit steep (that being said I did pay it) 2) and octopus should have 8 legs and this guy only has six (I know it seems nit picky, but details matter and he is still just too cute).
