I actually bought this wipe pouch completely on accident...  hit the '1-Click Buy' button and when it arrived I decided to just give it a try...  this was quite the happy accident!  I was concerned after reading some of the reviews about wipes drying out or the pouch leaking...  This pouch does not leak or dry out my wipes!  I pre-soak 10 wipes and wring them out until they are just damp with the wipe solution I make (1 cup purified water, 1 tbsp baby soap, 1 tbsp coconut oil, and 5 drops tea tree oil).  I've left the wipes in my diaper bag well over a week and never had them dry out!  The only way this pouch will leak is if you put something in them that is sopping wet, obviously.  Yes, the pouch will feel cool to the touch maybe making someone think the bag is wet but it's definitely not...  also, the snap is important in keeping your wipes damp...  it somewhat seals the end of the bag.  And it's easy to leave the pouch snapped all the time because you can still unzip, reach in and pull out a wipe without unwrapping.  The pics show how I use the pouch and it works really well for anyone looking for a cloth wipes pouch!
