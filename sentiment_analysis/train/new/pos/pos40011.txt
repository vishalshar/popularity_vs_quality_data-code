These metal stroller hooks allow me to carry about 20 pounds on each side of the Bugaboo Cameleon 3 stroller. Proper looping so that the Velcro stays underneath always against the strollers metal bars both prevents the strap from slipping down the stroller handle and protects the stroller handles from scratches as it acts as a barrier between the metal of the stroller handle and the metal of the strap hook.The only caution that I've noticed is that grocery bags hang to low and hit the wheels. My quick fix is to twirl the bag and make a knot out of the neck of the bag. Groceries are then more horizontally positioned along the floor of the bag and the bag is off the wheels. For a more permenent solution I need to carry my own cloth bags with short handles.The Bugaboo has a nice storage sack underneath the pram but my diaper bag and baby essentials fill it up. The Buggygear hooks give me the extra storage I need as I perform errands. Quite honestly, these hooks make shopping even easier than without a stroller.
