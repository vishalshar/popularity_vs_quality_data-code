The latch is well made, and it is pretty difficult to open even for the adult as you have to squeeze the thing well to release.  I am more concerned with sticky pads giving up, but they can be replaced. We'll see how long they will last. The goal is to get the child to lose interest in the cabinet.The colors may indeed vary as the description said, but mine was a white one.  That would look horrible on my all-black cabinet.  The solution: spray paint it to match the cabinet color before installing.  Now you can barely notice it's there.Update:- The spring mechanism gave up in less than a year, leaving the latch easy to open just by pushing it up. Not good if the latch is not high enough. Still, because the latch was positioned high out of reach of the child, it was still acceptable.- The sticky pad lasted about 15 months before completely sliding off and leaving a sticky mess behind. That's fine, as the pad can be replaced.Conclusion: Still well worth the money.
