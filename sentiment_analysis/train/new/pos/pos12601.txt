Purchased this a few weeks ago, set up was very easy and straight forward. Its light weight and I like the color (purchased in pinwheel) I am 8mo. prego and had no trouble moving it around by myself.  I will be using this as a bassinet for the first few weeks and it fits nicely in our bedroom. I would recommend this to anyone thats on the fence about getting this or a more expensive model.
