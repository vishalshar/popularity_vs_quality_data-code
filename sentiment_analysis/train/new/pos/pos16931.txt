Great sippy. Very useful for the transition from breast or bottle to sippy cup. I used it for my breastfed baby who refused to take a bottle and was very hard to get on to a sippy of milk. I tried about 10 different cups and this is the one that worked.My only issue with it is after awhile the nipples start to leak and need replacing, same as bottles.
