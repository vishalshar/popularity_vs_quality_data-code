This is actually the second crib we purchased and I absolutely love it. My daughter is 18 months old now and this has continued to transition from a wonderful crib for an infant to a good sized bed for a toddler. The protected rails are awesome for little chewers. The wood is good, sturdy quality with a beautiful finish. The drawers open and close effortlessly on quiet gliders. We originally had two crib mattresses in this due to its depth and my height (5'2"). That's really the only downside I've found with this bed- it's incredibly hard to place a sleeping child in if you're short. I've taken apart and reassembled this crib 4 times due to moves and it goes together seamlessly each time. I LOVE THIS CRIB!! Currently looking for the toddler bed conversion kit and we will keep it until she's grown. :)
