Best potty out there!I have this and the more expensive Bjorn. I bought the similar Bjorn first at a yard sale, but I wanted a second potty for the bathroom my son uses in the morning. This potty is like a quarter of the price, and much better!The white insert can only be inserted front-ways with the pee-guard facing out, unlike the Bjorn, where my toddler tries to jam the insert in backwards.  This averts a lot of accidents, especially with boys. It is also larger and it has a more substantial back, which my toddler 2 year-old finds more comfortable. He nearly always refuses to use the Bjorn potty and will seek out this "blue potty" almost exclusively. You can see in my photo that this potty is much wider and comfortable looking than the Bjorn.I haven't had any issues with staining, but I empty and clean the insert and wipe in dry right after he uses it. It's eay to keep clean, sometimes things collect in the rim under the white insert, so I do a deep clean once a week or so.
