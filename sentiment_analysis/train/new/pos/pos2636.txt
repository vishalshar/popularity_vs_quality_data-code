Bought these backpacks for my twin toddlers when we traveled by air for te first time. Twins love them! Their own bag that I could fit a change of clothes, gauze blanket, and a few little toys without it being too heavy for them. The harness is fantastic, my twins wanted to run and explore in the airports and I could easily handle them both with the use of the harness when they decided they didn't want to hold mommy's hand anymore. That left dad to handle bags and strollers.
