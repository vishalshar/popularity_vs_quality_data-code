I made the mistake of thinking that this product included the snack trap based on the pictures and the reviews.  Don't make the same assumption as me!  I just ordered the actual snack trap.  I only gave this two stars because I can't try out the product just yet!Updated September 15, 2010After receiving the actual snack trap, I have found the snack trap to be just ok.  It holds in the snacks and is good for accidental spills.  I have filled it with animal crackers and Kix cereals, and the snacks will not come out when I shook it.  However, when my son uses it, he reaches in and somehow some of the snacks escape. We will still use it since it prevents the entire contents to be spilled if he happens to drop it.  I would give it three stars.As for the lid accessory pack, I will give this four stars.  It is serves it purpose if you are looking for a replacement lid.
