This wallet is just perfect for my everyday wallet.  I initially bought it in the brown which was nice but I just wasn't in love with the color.  I exchanged for the blue which is beautiful.  It is just a shade or two lighter than a navy.I have had serious back problems for many years resulting in 6 spinal fusions.  My back needs further surgery but I can't go through anymore of them.  On my recent visit to my surgeon he saw the size of my handbag and then he lifted it.  He said even a person with a good back would have pain after carrying that weight all day. He said "NO MORE.  IT'S TIME TO DOWNSIZE."  Thus this smaller wallet.  It is well organized and appears to be of quality leather.It holds the cards I ABSOLUTELY need on an everyday basis and the smaller wallet fits perfectly into my smaller (sigh) handbags.Though I hate to admit it, the lighter bag does relieve a lot of stress on my back especially if I am going to be out all day.To finally finish this review, this is a good looking wallet that holds all the essentials in a much smaller, lighter form.I would recommend this wallet.
