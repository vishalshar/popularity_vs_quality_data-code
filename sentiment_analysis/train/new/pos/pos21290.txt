So I had heard a lot about wall decals and when it came down to it I didn't want to paint the nursery at 9 months pregnant, so decals seemed like a neat idea.My only worry was negative feedback I had heard about them not being sticky enough or not staying on the walls, or even certain walls being too textured to allow them to adhere properly.Well, our nursery walls are mildly textured, from a paint roller no doubt, but I thought I'd give it a try.So I order them from Amazon, because amazon carried them a few dollars cheaper than in-store prices and I received them within a few days, no more than 4-5.I first took my Aunt's advice and put them under something heavy to flatten them out, since they came rolled up in a cylinder container, however, within 24 hours I deemed them flat enough to attempt putting up.They adhered to the textured walls like a dream and of course they were even more cute and whimsical in person, sometimes colors are hard to gauge from online photos but these seemed true to the pictures I had seen and after a week I haven't had any problems with air bubbles underneath or them losing stickiness.I am very satisfied and of course everyone who has come over to see the nursery has absolutely loved the wall decals, it's one of the first things mentioned.I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a cute forest animal themed nursery, they are a nice addition to a white or even solid colored wall. :)
