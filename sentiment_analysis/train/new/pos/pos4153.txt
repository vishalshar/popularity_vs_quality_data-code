I just purchased this for my two year old as a bed in our vacation home, and wished I would have purchased it for home as well! Although she is two and tall, she has plenty of room in length and width to roll over and toss in her sleep. The rails are taller than my pack 'n play, and I do not worry about her being able to climb out. She still in within the weight range to use the changing table as well, however I just set it (changing table/pad) on the bed or the floor for my convenience since I would have to remove it when she was in there sleeping. She loves the mp3 hookup- I was able to use my phone's "sound machine app" and play her white noise through it during her nap. (Was on vacation, did not have an mp3 player, wouldn't normally leave my phone in her room)Easy to assemble, very nice looking and would be perfect for a newborn co-sleeping bed (in your bedroom) or great to travel with, as it has a carrying case with a nice strap. Could check it as baggage easily and I would not worry about its frame being comprimised during airport handling.Only downside is you have to buy Joovy sheets only for it I beleive, which are rather pricey. The graco kind do not fit. But the sheet is by far the nicest crib sheet I have felt!
