What you can't see in the product picture is the non-slip "flap" on the back of this unit that you can slip between the seat and back of your carseat to keep it from going anywhere.  The front cupholders can fit a slender 16oz bottle.There are dividers on the interior and exterior.  This works great between our kids car seats for all their "travel stuff."There was a minor plastic off-gassing at first but it faded after a few days out of it's packaging.
