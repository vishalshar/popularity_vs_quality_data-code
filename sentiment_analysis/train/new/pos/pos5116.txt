My five-month-old daughter likes these teething toys.  They are size-appropriate and sturdy.  I'm subtracting a star just for the description: teething set for "boys"??  The "girls" alternative has a diamond ring teether, bracelet, and purse.  I'm not the type of person to call "inequality" on every little bitty thing, but seriously?  We're talking teethers for infants.  Why so gendered?
