We admittedly let Baby Girl sleep in her pack n play until around 6.5-7months.  She was free to bounce off the mesh walls with reckless abandonment.  Cue her moving to her own room and in her wood slat crib.  First night, she rolled and whacked her head.  Later that same night, she had got both legs stuck through the slats all the way up to her thighs.  This all happened at random, early AM times-- just imagine the crying (and it just wasn't the baby).  I know the deal with bumpers and SIDS, but Baby Girl was 7 months, can pull up, can cruise, and crawl.  We installed it and our first night-- us, the parents-- was a rough one because we kept checking to make sure she could breathe when her head was against it.  She slept, well, like a baby.  No waking up and even now she kind of uses it as a pillow (kids sleep in really uncomfortable-looking positions!).I was considering the mesh crib liner first, but I read one of the reviews where a child could use it as a stepping off point and topple out of the crib.  This bumper squishes under her weight when she pulls up and tries to put her foot on it.  It also fluffs right back up to normal taught shape after she steps on it.  It also washed up great and it is sooo soft!
