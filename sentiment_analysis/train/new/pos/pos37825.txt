I had an open wound on my nipple that would not heal despite over a month of using various ointments.  I couldn't nurse with that breast because it was so bad.  It finally healed after about 5 days or so of using the hydrogel pads and I'm so very grateful!  The reason they worked was because they keep the wound moist so that it doesn't break open when suction is put on it,  such as from pumping. I wish someone would have recommended these to me,  so I'm spreading the word!  Also,  you can cut them in quarters to save money... A quarter square is big enough to cover the nipple.
