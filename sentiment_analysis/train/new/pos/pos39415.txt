I have always hated the springy kind, but like the flexibility of them.  Ever stub your toe on a door stopper and you'll know what I mean.  Now, I haven't specifically tested ramming my foot into one of these to see how flexible they are, but I have no doubt that if they are stepped on or otherwise run into, that they will give way enough to cause too much pain.  Not only that, but due to their design, they really disappear on white baseboards much better than the white metal kind.  Their design makes them very unobtrusive for any decor.Overall, I am very happy with these so far.
