This has been a lifesaver for me as a portable footrest - I'm very short and I have a temporary back issue that requires that my legs not dangle when sitting in a chair. This has been perfect for me to carry around when I go to restaurants, the theater, etc. It folds smaller and is lighter than any other portable foot rest I could find on Amazon (or anywhere else on the Internet) and it's quick and easy to set up and put away.  I wish it were just a bit less expensive, but, other than that, it's been great!
