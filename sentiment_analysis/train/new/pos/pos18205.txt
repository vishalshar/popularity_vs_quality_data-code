My son is teething, and conventional silicone/ rubber/plastic/ fluid filled teething toys are not working for him, even famous Soffee the Giraffe. Then I noticed that he really loved chewing on wooden toys. I decided to get him a wooden teether, and came across this lovely bird pendant. The seller, Barin Toys, makes wooden toys from alder wood. They are not treated with anything, no fillers, no lacquer. They recommend disinfecting their toys in a pot of boiling water for 2 minutes before giving them to a baby (just as you would disinfect a pacifier.)I decided to get the pendant because I have been curious about nursing mom's jewelry, and hated the look of silicone beads everyone is selling now. This pendant seemed like an ideal solution.I am really happy with it. The pendant has a very smooth finish, especially on the edges, and the size is great, not too large or too small. The bird silhouette is cute.  I wear it 24 hours a day! My son holds it while he nurses, instead of repeatedly snapping my bra, which was very annoying.  He loves to chew on it. I like that it is always with me, so I can occupy my son any time, especially while we are out.The pendant is pretty and stylish, it doesn't look like a teether. I have gotten quite a few compliments on it. The best part about it? I will continue to wear it even after my son no longer needs it. His little toothmarks on the wood will always remond me of this great time. I would highly recommend this pendant.
