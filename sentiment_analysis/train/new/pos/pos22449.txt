This product is AMAZING for the price. I originally bought it just so I can make a pattern and sew my own. I was not expecting it to meet my standards for a diaper, but it totally does! & I had no idea it came with the inserts. The inside is so soft and all of the snaps are easy to use. Nothing was broken, no rips or tears, the elastic is all in place. Very impressed, I will be ordering some more to get my stockpile up while I am sewing. Oh and it came in 2 weeks before the estimated delivery date. I only gave 4 stars because it is very thin. But its a pocket style so you can stuff it to your hearts content!
