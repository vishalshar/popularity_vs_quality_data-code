I wanted something breathable for the summer. Its definately better than the double layered one I had. Print is pretty and colorful, and it entertains my baby as im putting it on before nursing and getting off after nursing. ;)Its lightweight cotton, but I dont mind trying muslin nursing cover for more air. I chose this one for the price. However, my baby still gets hot, first cus its hot weather, second she is covered under this fabric...I like that this cover is wide enough to hang over my shoulder to the back when I decide to pull down my tank top strap. Enough to cover one side of the shoulders.The rim is very rigid and nice!! The best one so far ive seen! It still folds well in half and I can store nicely inside the diaper bag.I didnt find the purpose for the ittle bag that comes with, but it's nice addition. I might store clean toys or clothes??Overall, im happy with the purchase.
