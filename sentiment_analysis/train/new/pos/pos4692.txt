This carrier is good for the price; there's no other ergonomic carrier as affordable out there. My little guy falls asleep in this thing the second he is put in it and it's a total lifesaver when you've tried everything to get them to stop crying and if you need to get stuff done and your baby doesn't like to be put down like a lot of newborns. My husband and I easily interchange use of it.Two things that could be better:- It's not the greatest for long uses. If you're carrying for more than 30-45 minutes it gets tiring on the back and the straps start to dig in because they're not very padded like an ergo or boba. I also have a bit of a belly around the middle and the waist strap "rides up" on me a bit and I have to adjust it. A wider or padded strap would have remedied that.- I wish there was a pocket or something to put my phone or keys in when we go out for walks and I don't have pants pockets.
