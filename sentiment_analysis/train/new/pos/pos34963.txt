Unsure with some of the reviews but it was worth the try. Read the instructions and try different bottles so you understand how it works. I recommend Dasani and not the generic brands. We also bought the Simple Sippy product and no longer take baby bottles or sippies when leaving home. Our diaper bag is now manageable.
