I am very pleased with the product I hesitated to get it due to the comments but I took the chance and I don't regret it. The colors are actually softer it looks better in person. I received it on time and it came with the diaper bag set. Those women complaining about it why dont you return it & take your ass to Baby's R' US and go pay 175 for a blanket and a bumper! You're the cheap one expecting super high quality for what you're paying for idiot.
