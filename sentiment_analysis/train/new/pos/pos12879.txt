At first, I thought this bib was a bit on the heavy side, but now that I have used it several times, Its well worth it. This one in particular comes as a set with the bib. One great aspect of this bib compared to your normals everyday bib is that it rolls up and is made to be more compact and easier to travel with. You can wipe it down to mild baby soap or with warm water to clean. Afterwards it quickly air dries. My baby isnt a messy eater, but she does play around and while other bibs dont catch all the food she drops, this one really does. I carry this bib everywhere she and I go, bc it makes mealtime sooo easy. I only have the one, but after writing this review I am surely going to buy another. The spoon is easy for baby to grasp and made out of food grade silicone. Also, the bib doesnt get in the way during mealtime. The arms are given rooms to free move while catching all the food that doesnt make into baby's mouth! You wont regret it and I recommend you try this product. Its a must have for every mother.
