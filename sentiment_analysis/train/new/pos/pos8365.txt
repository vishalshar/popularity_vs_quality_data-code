I cannot believe this item isn't sold in any of the major mass or box stores - love that you can find EVERYTHING on Amazon.  It is by far one of the most inquired about items we have for our children.  We use it off the back of our double stroller for our toddler.  He started using it at 1 1/2 this past summer and was very comfortable.  Love the handle bar and especially the seat belt.  He feels like he's driving.  It's easy to take on and off when putting the stroller away.  He's short enough that he doesn't hit his head on the stroller either.  It helps that our stroller had an adjustable handle so that we could walk further away from the seat.  It does stick out quite a bit.  Can't wait for spring to get out and start using it again.  So thankful for something that keeps our 3 under 3 contained!
