I am currently using these on my brick fireplace. My fireplace is a little longer than the standard size so I also bought a pack that had a few extra pieces. If you have a standard size fireplace, this should be enough. There are 2 corners included. I bought these because they are wider and thicker than most of the edge protectors that are out there. They do provide a good amount of protection but as most reviewers have stated, they do peel off if your baby tries hard enough. My baby girl sometimes pulls at them and I just press down on them to stick them back. If your baby is pretty aggressive at trying to get these off, they will be able to. But luckily my baby doesn't really try to peel them off so it's not a big deal.
