All three of my children have used an Exersaucer. My oldest son loved his and would have stayed in it all day if I let him. My daughter did not enjoy being in it at all and my youngest son will stay in it for short periods of time. My youngest seems to enjoy his Jumperoo more as he is not really heavy enough yet to "bounce" in the Exersaucer. He does enjoy spinning himself around in the Exersaucer but jumping appears to be his favorite activity at the moment. The attached toys are okay, my kids all liked the spinning toys but were not that entertained by the other toys. The Exersaucers we previously owned held up well enough and were in good enough condition to be sold at yard sales after we no longer needed them.  My daughter was a tall, thin baby and we had to "pad" the seat with a folded baby blanket wrapped around her abdomen to prevent her torso from rocking back and forth as the seat width is quite large. This does make the item good for larger, older babies. The Exersaucers held up well during use and were fairly easy to clean. The assembly was pretty easy as I did it myself in about 45 mintues. I did have to ask my husband to tighten the yellow plastic caps to get them to click into place correcty as they were a tight fit and required a lot of hand stregth. My youngest son will usually stay in his Exersaucer just long enough for me to make dinner so it serves its purpose for us!
