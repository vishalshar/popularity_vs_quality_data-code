THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE SYSTEM,THE CAMERA HAS GREAT COLOR AND CRIP LINES AND DELIVERS A VERY GOOD PICTURE,THE MONITOR WORKS ON 4 RECHARGABLE BATTERIES THAT COME WITH IT OR A 110 PLUG IN,THE MONITOR WILL WORK FOR HOURS ON THE BATTERIES.THE PICTURE IS WEAK IN VERY LOW LIGHT,HOWEVER GREAT IN CLOUDY TO SUNNY LIGHT.IF YOU HAVE A 2.4GHz PHONE SYSTEM YOU MAY HAVE SOME INTERFEARANCE,BUT I FIND THIS TO BE A GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY!!
