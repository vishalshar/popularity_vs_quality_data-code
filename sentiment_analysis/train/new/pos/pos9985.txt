Great idea for a baby toy!  These bugs are adorable.  The magnets are strong enough that they stick together, but not so strong that my 7 month old son can't pull them apart.  The magnet seems to flip over inside the bug so that they stick together on either side (they don't repel b/c of the polarization).They also have little legs/wings that make it easy for his little hands to hold them.  At this point, I usually stack them up and he likes to knock them over.  But I can see him stacking them in the future as he gets older.  Great toy!
