I have gone through several baby monitors.  I use them with my 30 year old disabled daughter.  My biggest issue has been background noise.  This is the BEST monitor I have ever used!  No noise interference.  In fact when her music is playing it does not even pick up.  It just picks up when she makes a noise.I LOVE  this monitor and highly recommend it.  My husband even uses it out in our detached garage...which would be like from a neighbors house and he says he can hear her perfectly!  So I now this Spring I will be able to go out and do yard work knowing that if she needs me, I can hear her.This would be a perfect gift for a new parent or for a disabled caregiver.
