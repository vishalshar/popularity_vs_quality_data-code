My son can't sleep without his, it works well.  I decided to get this one because it was less expensive then the charger ones, which we have gone through several.  Batteries last about a month with all night usage.  not that bad.  We have had this one for some time and it is still going strong.  Occassionally the lid where the batteries go, doesn't want to close tightly, but we have discovered this and are very careful when changing batteries.
