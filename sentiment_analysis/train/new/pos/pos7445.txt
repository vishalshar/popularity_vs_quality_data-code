We have Logan the lion and Mortimer the moose for our twins and they have loved them ever since they could hold them. Something so simple is captivating for them! They love the chewy parts and that they rattle and that they have textures! These are my diaper bag go to toy! They look like the more solid pictures, not the ones with the extra holes at the bottom.
