I have several of the popular swaddlers, but this is my favorite by far.  It can be a little tough to catch both arms when she's squirmy, and she can get her little arms out easier than the miracle blanket, but she still sleeps deeper and longer than with any other product.  The material is very soft and seems durable.  The only drawback is that you need to air dry the zen, and it can take up to 12 hours to get completely dry - so if you wait until the afternoon to wash it, you may not have it for that night.
