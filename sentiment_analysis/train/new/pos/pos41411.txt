Purple is my color. Finding this on here was a blessing! Easily $15 less than I could find it anywhere else. This obviously wasn't one of the more popular colors either so I was pleasantly surprised to find it at all! Such an amazingly well-constructed product! So much soft, organic fabric too. They don't get nicer than this!!! Thanks for having my eggplant! Can't wait for my daughter to test drive it in a couple weeks! :)
