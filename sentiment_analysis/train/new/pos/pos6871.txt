Very cute. The pictures posted show the color kind of different, so I didn't know what to expect, but its really cute, brighter then I expected. The monkeys ears aren't attached and his face is a different fuzzy material. Very cute. The lions mane is different material as well. It was a nice little surprise. :] The sheet and skirt were fine as well. Skirt could have been a lil longer, but no biggy. The bumper is NOT PADDED. That's the only thing I didn't like. I ended up lining the inside with a different bumper and using this one as decoration on the outside of the crib. Works fine. Just wish the bumper was padded and would have been 5 stars and perfect.
