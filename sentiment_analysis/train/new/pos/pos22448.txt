I love this baby carrier! I use it daily. It is not so complicated as some of the other reviews state. I'm new to baby wearing (three children, but never found a carrier I was comfortable with). I have bought several baby carriers for my two other children when they were infants, and just couldn't quite get it down to where I was comfortable enough to use them. This one was actually not intimidating. The only negative would be that the leg openings are spaced pretty far apart, but my son doesn't seem to mind.
