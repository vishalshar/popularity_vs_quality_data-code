I just received this se for my step daughters baby shower, its absolutely beautiful although the pic. it looks blue and white its actually a really lite green but its so pretty and soft not to mention all the things you get with its so worth it. A beautiful embroidered quilt same with the bumper and diaper stacker also 2 valance and a bed skirt with a little pillow it also came with a diaper bag and coin purse now if that isn't awesome enough on the in side of the carry bag was a cute little pair of booties all I can say is WOW! I would recommend this set you can't beat all the extras for the price I almost bought it on another site for double the price amazon is selling it for
