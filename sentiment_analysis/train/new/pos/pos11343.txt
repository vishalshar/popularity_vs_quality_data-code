My husband hand made our bassinet like the "Baby Bunk Infant Sleeper" so that we could customize it to fit our platform bed (and save a couple hundred dollars!)  This bassinet mattress is exactly the dimensions that it says in the description so it fit perfectly! The Babies R Us Knit (16" x 30") sheets are what we buy because they fit great on this mattress. They are stretchy enough to create a snug fit  and wraps around the edges & bottom a good bit so you don't have to worry about the sheet ever just popping off while the baby is sleeping (which is how the sheets should fit on any baby's mattress).
