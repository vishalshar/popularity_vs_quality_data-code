I've heard about this godsend from a mommy blog. She raved on how great they are. I had a cracked and raw nipples with my first child. The gel pad I used sticked to my nipples, I was in tears when I had to peel them off. So now that I have another newborn with the same bad latching issue, my poor nipples are also taking the abuse. I was skeptical to try this because they are way more expensive than the other gel pads. Boy, I'm glad I did! The consistency of the gel is super soft. I can wear them at room temperature without the sleeves to protect my nipples from friction, freeze them (they stay soft) to relieve engorgement and wear them warm to help with let-down. All without my nipples sticking to them! Thank you for inventing this. You saved my sanity and my nipples!!
