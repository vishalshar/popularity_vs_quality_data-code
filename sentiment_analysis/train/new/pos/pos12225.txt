The crib set arrived quickly and it looks exactly like it does in the picture. The only problem I had with it was when I washed it. Before you use baby products you are supposed to wash them first, which I did. I only have a top loading washing machine and after it finished drying the comforter and the little pillow was misshapen. I reshaped it the best I could by hand but for anyone else who washes it, use a front loader, go to the laundry mat if you have to.
