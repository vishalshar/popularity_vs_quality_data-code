"It took my child about a minute to lear to use it.  Loves the grip and keeps yelling... dinosaur! It has been a few weeks and still a favorite."Now having it for a while here is how it performed;  the rubber spout has held up to the chewing and pulling.  It has a little rip/tear but still in tact.  The outer part of the bottle is still like new.  However, the cap meets the bottle and now leaks bad.  The rubber stopper inside looks fine.  I never put it in dishwasher.  No matter how tight or times I try to adjust it it leaks.  A shame b/c my kid loves it.
