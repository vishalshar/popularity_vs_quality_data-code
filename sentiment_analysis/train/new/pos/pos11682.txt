I read many of the reviews before I decided to purchase these because of the price. I give 4 stars because of them being expensive. Other than being expensive these are great! My son just turned 3 and hasn't quite figured out the potty stuff. I will say if your up in the air on the sz go with the larger.. They do run a little small. I originally ordered a medium and a large. I wish I had opened the large pack first because they fit perfectly. The medium was just a little to small and that was money down the drain because they won't refund them. (He weighs 32lbs) Quality: they are soft like underwear. They hold up well and unlike regular pull-ups my son is uncomfortable after going potty in them and wants to be changed right away... Which is good!! He is learning to go potty now because he doesn't want to potty in them. I have not had them leak through on his clothing once! Big plus!! They are worth the money.. You save more not having to buy pull-ups. So, bite the bullet and buy 2 or 3 pairs and you'll be glad you did. Note: when you dry them- turn them inside out - they will dry quicker in the dryer.
