My child was a die-hard Cozy Coos (by Bright Starts) fan. We bought her one of those pacifiers when she was very small and we absolutely loved it. The Cozy Coos have become harder to find lately so when we needed to replace the pacifier I thought I'd give the WubbaNub a try. I thought that there was no way we could love it as much as we loved the Cozy Coos but we really do like it.Backstory: We had a Cozy Coos pacifier that looked like a puppy. Our dog chewed the pacifier part and we ended up attaching a Soothie pacifier to the Cozy Coos puppy.  We bought a new Cozy Coos and the dog got it again (I don't know what it is about that paci specifically that the dog likes so much as she doesn't chew other pacifiers or toys).Positives of the WubbaNub: The pacifier is a "Soothie" like the one my child is used to. These are the kinds that most hospitals provide so the transition was easy. Also, like the other pacifiers with stuffed animals attached, it helps the baby hold the pacifier and they have an easier time finding it at night or in their car-seat. Plus, when they drop it on the floor it doesn't bounce under things like the pacifier would if the animal were not attached.Negatives of the WubbaNub: The pacifier that is attached is very soft (0-3 months) which may be a good thing depending on the age of your child. The stuffed animal that is attached is very light, which again may be a good thing depending on the age of your child. This was a negative for us however because my child was used to the Cozy Coos version that was slightly heavier and more like a beanie baby. Finally, the pacifier on the Cozy Coos detaches so you can clean it and the stuffed animal separately but this WubbaNub is permanently attached.
