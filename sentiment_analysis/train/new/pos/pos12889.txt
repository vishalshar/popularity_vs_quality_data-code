I bought these and I also bought the JJ Cole reversibles. I must say these are softer than the JJ Coles. They are also thinner widthwise, which I think is a plus. However, they are also thinner plush-wise, which some parents may think makes them safer to use as they won't add any unsafe cushion to the seatbelt.  I don't mind, and actually hoped to get, the lime green. It matches the Instep Bike Trailer I bought them for. The velcro is very sturdy (also a plus over the JJ Cole as the velcro on those is a little flimsy). The inside is a plush pile like a newborn teddy bear toy, and the other side is a silky satiny shiny short-hair fur. I love them.
