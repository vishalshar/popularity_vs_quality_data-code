I have 2 year old with sensory issues and loud noises are the worst. These headphones are amazing!! They are a great size and snug against the head but I've tried them on myself and they don't pinch and are not tight feeling. Just snug enough to seal off the ears. The best part about these is that they significantly reduce loud noise, but I can speak to my daughter while she's wearing them and she can still hear me. We've used these for air shows, parades, fireworks displays, and even in a really noisy restaurant during dinner. If my daughter gets too overwhelmed she will ask us for these headphones!! To get her used to them, I put them on then turned on the vacuum. I gently removed the headphones so she could hear the vacuum, then put them back on her. She spent a few minutes taking them off and putting them back on, I'm assuming to hear the differences in the vacuum noise. Since then, these go everywhere with us!
