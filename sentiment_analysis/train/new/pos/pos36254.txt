We love these teethers! They are great size to toss in a diaper bag for when ever you need one. My daughter loved loved loved these when she was teething and now my son, 5 months old, just got his first tooth pushing through hand he  loves them. I can place them in a cup of ice water and let him have one all cold and yummy and after a couple of minutes, swap it out for the other one and he is happy and entertained once again! Great price too! I totally recommend these!
