These are adorable! I set them up almost a month ago and non of them have peeled or fallen off the walls.I wanted to give an update on this product. We moved over the summer. I kept the original packaging so I could stick these back on when we moved. They sat in a garage for most of the summer and now they are hanging in my sons nursery again they are sticking like new and they've made it through a few nights with a warm humidifier running all night. Highly recommend these decals.
