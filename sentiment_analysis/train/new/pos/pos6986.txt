Great products. The no rinse baby wash smells so good and is great for quick face body or head clean-ups. The foaming shampoo is a must have for every mom. Wish I received this at my shower. So I will consider this as a gift for others at their shower.  I remember when I first tried the product a year ago I did not care too much for the smell, but it grows on you by the time you finish using the product.
