I purchased these connectors to go with my Medela Pump in Style breast pump. I exclusively pump, so I wanted a few "sets" of pumping accessories so that I wouldn't be spending my entire day washing pump parts.These connectors work just as well as the connectors that came with my pump. Just so you know, purchasing this product means that you only purchasing the connectors. You will not receive the complimentary parts such as valves, membranes, breast shields, etc.I highly recommend.
