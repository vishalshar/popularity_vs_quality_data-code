1 Year Later, this is still our favorite bib!  I have a very messy 2 year old and we bought this shortly after she was 1. It is perfect for when she eats yogurt, cereal, soup, anything.  The pouch catches things well and I just dump it in the sink and rinse it with water. I sometimes have the issue where she leans forward and rubs the bottom of the bib in her food and then leans back and smears it on the front of her shirt. :( I think this would happen with any bib though.  I'm going to buy another one for my 6 month old girl now that she is starting baby food. I'll be so glad to just rinse off the pureed baby food instead of scrubbing it off a cotton bib with my fingernails!
