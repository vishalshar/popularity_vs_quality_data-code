OK, it took awhile to setup, probably because someone else had set it up before.  Once I figured out how to reset it, it seems to work pretty well. In my case when I first plugged in the Wemo it just flashed orange, and there was not a wifi to connect into.  Just in case you run into the same problem follow these instructionsâ€¦.unplug the wemo, press and hold the reset button on the bottom, while holding the button plug it back in; continue holding the reset button until it blinks orange fast, then you can let go.  Wait about 30 seconds then it should start alternating slow blinks between green and orange. I hope this helps someone else.  As a side note, it looks like Belkin fixed all the app issues that they had early on that all the other folks were complaining about.
