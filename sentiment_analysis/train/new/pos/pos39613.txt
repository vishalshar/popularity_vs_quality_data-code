You can put them in the dishwasher. You can rinse them off. You can wipe them off. They're easy, flexible, and hold well even when our toddler decides he doesn't want it on anymore. I wish I had found this when solid food began.We also tried the Bibbity Bobbity Bibs, and this beats the pants off of them. They're decent, don't get me wrong, and not bad for the price. They're not as flexible though, and you need to keep them straight in the dishwasher, or they'll start to their form in the hot water.  Not the case with the "Make My Day"  bibs.
