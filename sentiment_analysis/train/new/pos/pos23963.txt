First off all new cribs on the market no matter the price have to pass a certain standard to be on the market.  Therefore, the safety of this crib is not in question.  The hardware is very thick and sturdy and so I'm not worried about my baby's health using it.  My aim in buying a crib was to get something that was cute and cheap since cribs can be so outrageous.  This is one of the cheapest out there and yet attractive.You have to install large bolts all throughout the crib when you assemble it.  You can't tell in the pictures but all the bolts are visible once assembled.  I would think that little plastic inserts or something would have been easily inserted to cover the bolts.  Maybe this causes a safety hazard and that's why they are excluded, but the showing bolts give the crib a less than finished look.  Is it worth paying an extra $50-100 to have a more expensive crib that has such finishing touches? Absolutely not.Other than the showing bolts the crib looks great and is a good deal!
