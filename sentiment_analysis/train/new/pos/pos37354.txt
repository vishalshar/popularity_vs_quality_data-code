My daughter is 5 days early and i've tried different pacifier brands but she would just spit them out. They seemed to be too hard for her little mouth. When I visited my friend that just came home from the hospital, she let me try the soothie pacifier which the hospital gave her,and boom,,my daughter suckled on it like it is my own nipple. I was so relieved and had to take one home then i had to buy some online to have extra. You cant really find the brand from local stores.
