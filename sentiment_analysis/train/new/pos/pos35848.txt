I just bought this and I love it. I have owned theee other PPB styles: the boxy, touring tote and the weekender. Each style has its own merits. I love the satchel because it converts to a backpack, but is taller and narrower than the boxy. I pack what I need in clear cosmetic bags and stack them sideways in the satchel, not laying down. It keeps this deep bag organized so it doesn't become a black hole. I like the separate compartment to put my things: I have my phone, PPB wallet, cosmetic bag, kindle and planner in there. In my son's area, I have a small wet bag of spare clothes as we're potty training, a little bag of snacks, diaper/wipes/disposable changing pad in another clear container. Plus a sippy cup of water. I use this bag out and about. If anyone cares, I use the boxy as our bag that I take to the local swimming pool, as I prefer the satchel as my everyday bag.Only complaints: bag could be too deep for unorganized types, bottle pockets very small... I use our smallest sippy cups, wish there were more pockets on the inside. Strap digs on shoulder if overpacked.I recommend if you like a well made bag, cute print, clever storage, can convert to back pack, awesome enough to eventually use for adult life, not just for diaper bag.
