I bought this for my cubicle at work because my back is toward the entrance.  It works very well to see when people approach.  The fact that it is convex makes the field of view larger so I can pretty much see the whole entrance to my cube.  It's actually a pretty clear mirror and if you bring it up close you can see details well enough.  It is pretty small, but for my purpose it's great
