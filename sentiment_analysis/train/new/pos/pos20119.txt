These cotton nursing pads absorb quite a lot, and still feel thin and comfortable. I love that these pads are contoured. They stay in the right place, and do not show trough the clothes.I do not recommend relying solely on this product at night though. Put on two layers or put a washcloth underneath.I was worried how the contoured shape would hold up after washes (as other people commented in the review), but they still look perfect after several washes and tumble dry.
