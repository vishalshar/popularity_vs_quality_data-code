It is just what I was looking for, plus a little extra bonus.  I wanted a decently-priced, developmentally-encouraging activity center, neutral in color for either gender. Also wanted: parent-friendly features, like it being storage-friendly, and easy-to-clean. The "bonus" I refer to is the bar of toys which encourages reaching upwards; I don't commonly see that on these toys. Along with the other features, this made me purchase. I was contemplating buying an activity center or the floor gym with those overhead bars for that encouragement also, but with it included here, I won't have to. (For floor time, we just have the good ol' quilt on floor, add toys or parent and go. No extra cost!) Though my daughter is a jumper (in our laps) she hasn't begun to jump in this toy, but when/if she does, I'm glad it will be ready for her with it's spring bounce floor!Because the one drawback is completely fixable, I give it all 5 stars. It could be the way my daughter plays or her height, but she bumped her mouth on the butterfly toy making a half bruise on her lip. (Blue bruise was gone the end of the next day.) So, I just removed that toy. We've had it about a month now, and my now 6-month old still enjoys it! Perfect fine and gross motor skill toy.
