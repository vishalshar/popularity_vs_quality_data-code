This cover fits really well on our Graco Click Connect car seat carrier. I was disappointed when I took it out of the package, though, because one of the snaps used to keep the UV cover clipped back popped right off...I hadn't even used it. Luckily it has elastic so the snaps are kind of unnecessary anyway. It is easy to fold up and tuck into a diaper bag or back-of-seat car pocket when you aren't using it.We use this mainly to keep the hands of strangers away from our baby and it works great. They can see, but not touch, and the baby is able to still get fresh air. I wouldn't use this in the winter because it wouldn't add warmth or even keep warmth in, but for summer months, this is a nice little cover to have.
