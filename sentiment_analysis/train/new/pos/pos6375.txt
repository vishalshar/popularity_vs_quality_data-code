We purchased our first "Calmies" for my niece, who was 4 months old at the time.  Her mom reports that the baby absolutely loves it, and will reach for the Calmies first, no matter how many other items are placed around her.  It may be the shape of the thing, or how easy it is for her to grasp.  No matter which way it is turned, the baby can get a hold of it on the first attempt, which probably sets it apart from the other toys and rings.As she got a few months older, we noticed that she seemed to find interest in the different textures - the 'arms' of the spherical ring have several different textures (bumpy, ridges, etc), and little Jessica seems to find that appealing.From the parents' perspective, they like the fact that this teether has only 1 ingredient: 100% natural rubber, with nothing artificial added to it -- no stains or dyes or chemicals of any kind.  Natural.Happy baby, happy parents.  What more could we ask for?
