My daughter has been enjoying this mobile for months. She is now 11m onths, and I had to take the mobile out of the bed because she kept trying to pull it (the mobile itself and not only the hanging puppies). The only minuses I have about this product is 1) the dim yellow light of te stars and moon on the wall (although at some point it is better than a bright light if you have a baby that needs darkness to sleep); and 2) it doesn't convert to a "music-only device", i.e. the upper part doesn't come out (or I have missed the point, and of course after 11months I don't have the user manual any more). So I am now looking for a music and light "mobile" that wouldn't have the upper/hanging part. However, it is difficult to find one that has the same sweet music (Mozart, Bethoven and I forgot the 3rd one) with the soft light that lights the bed that can be turned on if needed (for a few minutes).But I love it, it is a great mobile from birth to about 11 months). I also had the tiny love mobile for my first baby, but this one is much better.
