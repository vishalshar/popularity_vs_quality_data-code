I have used this for my daughter (now 4), and have included it in every baby shower gift since! This has saved my daughter and other babies in my family from so many rashes. An absolute MUST if you have a "spitty baby" as my husband calls it. The quality is fantastic and even years (and probably hundreds of washes) later they were still in good enough shape to be handed down to the next baby. Hands down best bib I have ever used. Can't say enough great things about this bib.
