This is a great product. Although it did make my baby sweaty on the cotton side on one of our warmer days I guess that means he will be extra warm this coming winter. He is very comfortable in it for our car rides to daycare 2 days a week and out and about running erands any other time. He falls asleep alot more with the kiddopotamus than with the support that came with the carseat. I wish they made them in adult size for my lazy boy.
