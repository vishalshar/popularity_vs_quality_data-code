Worked fine, had to remove toilet set to install but was easy enough for my husband. Con was that I had to lift up the toilet lid and then this seat to use the toilet every time. I prefer one that sticks to the lid with a latch or whatever instead, a few times sat on it on accident during middle of the night runs. Also not the easiest to lift quickly, would be nice then if it had a little lift lip or something. Is nice to have it on hand at all times for the potty trainer, we don't do the seat that you have to empty and wash every time. Our other seat hung on the wall by the toilet and the child puts it on the toilet seat. So much easier for the kid, just not the adult.I don't know how great the splash guard is- we had a girl training.
