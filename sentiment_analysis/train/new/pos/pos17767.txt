Best ever!! I'm a first time, breast feeding momma and I tried all the brands. Seventh Gen were cheap on the amount of materials and no indicator line (gave them away after 2 days). Pampers worked well, and swaddlers indicator line works well (better for wet than poo diapers for line), but smelled so bad from chemicals that I kept checking to see if he was wet/dirty.Babyganics is generous with material so if you don't cinch the diaper closed well, you could get big leg holes (hence blowouts). But THEY DONT SMELL LIKE GARBAGE ! They are great at absorbency .
