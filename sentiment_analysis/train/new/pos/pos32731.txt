I've been on the hunt for an activity hanger for our little one's crib for a while. My mother-in-law, who watches our son during the day, has the perfect one for his crib at her house. Of course, it's older and a retired model! Her hanger is especially fun for him because it has a mirror and lots of stuff to spin and move. While searching for our own to hang in his crib I found a lot of the current models of crib activity hangers lack things for the baby to actually do. They have lights and sounds and moving parts that are tucked away in a case (so baby can't touch), but no spinning bits or actual parts for baby to play with.So my hunt went online where I found this Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo crib activity hanger. This one is just perfect! The lion's hair has little finger sized indents for baby to touch and then spin, the monkey moves up and down on the giraffe, the flower has a spinner, the aligator can be moved side to side, and the best part is when he hits the keys, the different sections light up with their respective colors and a soothing tune. The lights and sound can be turned off to avoid over-stimulation, but the other parts still give baby something to play with upon waking or before nap/bed. The whole thing attaches to the crib with some thick cloth, so no worries about harming expensive furniture either!I'm 100% satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to other parents looking for an activity hanger for their little one's cribs.
