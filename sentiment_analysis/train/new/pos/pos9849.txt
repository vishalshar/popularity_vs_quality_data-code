Summer Infant Newborn to Toddler Bath Center & Shower, PinkThis a great bath, it has a lot of good bath features  comes with a bath sling for newborns and  the hand held shower is great for all stages, My kiddo is 15 months now so we just use the shower sprayer as more of a play toy than anything else but it has helped to teach her to spray the soup  off by her self and she loves doing it! This was a good investment and is a sturdy and good product.I like to write reviews I wrote this review without a discount and I paid full price for this item!I like to purchase through amazon because I often find the best prices around.All my opinions are my own,  please feel free to ask any questions you may have.
