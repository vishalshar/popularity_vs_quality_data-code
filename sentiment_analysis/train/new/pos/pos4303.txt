Between my sister and parents, we have owned a few different brand car seats.  This by far is the sturdiest one yet.  It doesn't move around like those other ones.  As soon as we installed it we knew it was solid.  It's higher up than most other car seats so our baby was very excited the first time in his new seat since he could see more in front of him.  The car ride was a whole new experience for him.  He was loving it!  Material wipes clean from any food/drinks.  Make sure you buy a sturdy thick seat protector for this beast of a car seat.  You will need it if you don't want your seats to get damaged.  We installed it in our Audi Q5 and it still allows a lot of room for two other passengers next to it.  Our old seat did not!  It's very sleek and comfortable!  It's a MUST HAVE!  Worth the money too!
