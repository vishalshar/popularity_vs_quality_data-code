Upon arrival the bath mat, as others have mentioned, was difficult to lay flat in the bottom of the tub and the suction cups didn't seem to hold well. This poor hold was likely due to a built-in nonslip pattern on the tub basin. We positioned the mat so that the suction cups line up with the "smooth" portion of the basin but the mat's inherent tendency to roll up still caused problems. After a few days of marginal performance, the mat now seems to stay in place and lay flat.
