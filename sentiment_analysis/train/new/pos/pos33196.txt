I can't speak to longevity of this piece, as we just purchased it in anticipation of our baby that is due in January.  However, hubs put this together all by himself and said there were a lot of pieces but it wasn't horribly hard.  He didn't seem to like the instructions, but most of the time the instructions for furniture are often lacking--at least in my opinion.  He ended up with one extra piece but the dresser itself seems sturdy and looks good, so who knows what that is all about.  I've slowly been filling it with the clothes and other items we've gotten for the baby, and so far so good.  I like the shelves for blankets, et cetera and am currently folding onesies and socks and putting them in the drawers.  My sister in law gave me a year's worth of clothes so I am still in the process of washing and putting them away.  The drawers aren't that deep but it is baby furniture, and we luckily have a large closet in the baby's room to hang clothing and put shelves and baskets.  If you have limited storage you may wish to continue to look around--babies have tons of stuff.  So far, the drawers slide well, the door latches easily, and the kit does come with a wall support so you can keep it from falling onto a curious toddler.  We plan on using the top for a changing table, and I love the color.  It isn't an exact match to the crib we purchased (we chose the Dream On Me Violet 7 in 1 Convertible Life Style Crib in cherry), but the lines and color are very close and work together very well so I'm happy.
