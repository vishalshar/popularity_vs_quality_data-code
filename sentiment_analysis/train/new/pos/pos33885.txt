We used these with our first child and loved them! Gdiapers have a steeper learning curve than more traditional cloth diapers, but once you figure them out, they are way easier and cheaper! For these inserts, I recommend folding them in half, putting them in the liner, and then unfolding them to full size. I thought they were way too big for the diapers until I tried it this way!
