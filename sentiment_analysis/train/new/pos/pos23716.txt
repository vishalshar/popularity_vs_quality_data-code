I love having this [potty and] reusable liner!  I really wish they would make an easy pour spout to empty the contents though.  This is the potty we use when visiting family for an extended period of time.  Normally, we keep this potty set up in the back of our jeep.*In case you're curious, we do not use the disposable inserts they sell to go over the seat/leg portion of the potty.  Our potty seat came with 3 free ones, but I haven't even tried one yet.  If you've handled cloth diapers before, you won't think it's gross/weird.  If you haven't, you might be a little grossed out.  When we're on the go in the car, I use the absorbent inserts from cloth diapers with a liner over top for #2s. After the job is done, I place the wet insert into a small wetbag (zippered waterproof bag for cloth diapers) and wipe the potty bowl down with a wipey.  If there's a #2, I dump that into a doggie green bag, tie it closed, and place it in the wetbag to toss out upon arrival home.  I keep a little tote of extra inserts, wipeys, wetbag, undies/pants, and disinfectant for hands/potty next to it in the car.
