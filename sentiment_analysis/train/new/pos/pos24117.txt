These seats are very practical and comfortable, my kids love them and they just sit on as soon they jumped in the car. They are easy to install and easy to remove. You can wash them and keep them clean. Also The backrest is removable for when children grow up, that way they will much more comfortable. My kids have used them since they were 2 years up to 10 years and are still seen as new. It is a very well done.
