This is a nice teether.  I got it because my 4 month old loves chewing on our fingers and this was the closest thing I could find.  It is kind of pricey but I like that it is made in the US.  I also got the Banana Octopus for a third of the price and she can hold on to it better.  They are both the same material.  There are complaints about them being dust/lint/hair magnets, which is true, but it's not like they are immediately covered as soon as you drop it.  I've noticed a cat hair or two here and there and it's not a big deal to just pick it off.
