My kids received this as a gift from their grandparents for their first birthday and loved it! A couple years later, and they still love it so much that I bought it as the perfect gift for my niece. Her mom has had nothing but good things to say about it. The toys have held up well to the abuse of multiple toddlers. The CD is just okay - a very typical infant/toddler cd.
