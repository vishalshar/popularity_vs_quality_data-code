Loving the new G3 stroller seat! So far my favorite feature is the reversible insert for both hot and cold weather as it has been 90+ here all week. I have had it on the cool side and when I pick up my daughter, no sweat ring! So I'm sure this is much more comfortable for her. I have the G2 stroller frame and as promised, this fits the base. A sun shade DOES NOT come with this stroller seat. It must be purchased separately. There are a variety of colors to choose from but I stuck with the "slate" as a gender neutral option since I plan to sell all of my G2/G3 when we are done using it. The shade is amazing though. Its enormous and keeps my baby completely covered. Don't forget to include one in your order. The only thing I am not loving about this seat is that it does not collapse in any way. Which I knew before I purchased it. Still, it would be nice if it could fold down some how to make it smaller and easier to handle during travel. We just had to purchase the $200 orbit stroller travel bag because we simply cant fold the seat down to fit into a decent sized piece of luggage. But thats a whole other review...
