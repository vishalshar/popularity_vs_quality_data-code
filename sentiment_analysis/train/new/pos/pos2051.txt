I really like the stroller. Helps us a lot with our babies. We have triplets but decided to get a single uppababy stroller plus this one for 2. It is great, very easy to fold/unfold and being capable of just latching the car seats is great!I would like to be able to remove the seats to use the infant car seats as that would reduce the weight of the stroller. It is really heavy! especially for my wife.Anyway we are happy with the purchase. both babies travel comfortable and putting and retrieving the car seats is very easy.
