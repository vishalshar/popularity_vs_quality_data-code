These are nice bottles, but a little bit of a pain to clean.  I don't mind the work if they keep my keep from projectile vomiting across the room.  However, they did not.  The first month we used them, she seemed ok.  Then.......oh boy.. the earth shattering belches began.  We tried faster nipples and that didn't help with the gas, it just gave her a projectile to go with the sound.  So, all in all, not every child is the same and it might work for a while and then you have to go back to the store and purchase every bottle on the market and try to figure out what worked for you.  We tried making frankenbottles with nipples from this one on that one and visa versa.  In the end, we ended up back using NUK and have a closet full of bottle we can't currently use.  So, I'd say buy em, try em, and if they don't work for you, use them as sippy cups later. :)
