Every friend or family member that asks me about what they need for a baby (and I'm always the go-to gal in our circle!) gets a ringing endorsement for this product.  I'm a huge fan of these rail covers.PROS-- They're soft, durable, and a lovely off-white, so they go with almost any decor.- They've completely saved the rails of not one, but two cribs!  I purchased these four years ago for our first child, and brought them out for our second child some months ago!  You know the quality of a product is great when you can use it for multiple children.- The velcro has remained strong, also, even after several washes.- We have an extra wide crib, and these covers still fit very well on the rails.CONS- There is just a slight pilling, which is not very noticeable, and is certainly understandable with a 4-5 year old product!  I couldn't be more pleased, and we also own and use the counterpart to this product that covers the front rail of the crib.
