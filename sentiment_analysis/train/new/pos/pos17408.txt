I, and my daughter (now 4 months) adore this toy!It's absolutely captured her attention since she was just under two months old. It was one of the first toys she'd reach out for and when she's starting to get fussy it can still catch her attention and stop her cries. It's a great distraction when she's getting a diaper changed or while I'm prepping to nurse her.This guy is one of the few items that's always in the diaper bag.I'd give it a 5 if it was made of certified non-toxic materials, "natural, organic materials" etc... I'd love to buy her all natural, organic toys but they're hard to come by and, understandably expensive. As much as I love this little guy, I have to admit I cringe a teeny bit when she's chewing all over him; I just don't know what might have gone into the fabrics or the stuffing. Alas, that's the world we live in; a 100% organic household is out of the price range of most parents.
