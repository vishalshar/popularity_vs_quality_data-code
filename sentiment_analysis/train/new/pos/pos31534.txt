Got this so I could still take my 18 mo old out for a walk when it's raining.  it fits my Summit X3 perfectly.  The only reason for the 4 stars is that the black portion covers up the viewing hole so I can't see what my kid's up to.  It means I need to stop and look around more often, which is annoying.  How hard would it have been to put a little square of the clear material to line up with the viewing window in the canopy?
