I ordered two of these gates, honestly because the price was right. I really didn't want to spend of $50-$70 per gate so this was perfect. The quality of the gate is great. Very sturdy if you install correctly and use the tension mounts to hold tight.The hardware has plastic mount clips that screw in to the door frame. The tension screws on the ends of the gate clip in to the mount clips so the gate can easily be removed. The gate has an easy to use door latch.Overall, I'm very happy with this gate and it keep my 5 dogs and my young son right where they need to be.
