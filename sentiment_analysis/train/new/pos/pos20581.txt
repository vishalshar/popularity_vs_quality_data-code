My son was a month old and we were already using the Britax Chaperone car seat, when I decided on purchasing the Baby Jogger City Versa.  I was intrigued when I read an Amazon review saying that this car seat adaptor would work with the Britax Chaperone car seat.  So I contacted Baby Jogger and they confirmed that this is an approved adaptor for the Chaperone.  It is much less expensive than the universal adaptor and it is a simpler attachment.  You just need these plastic adaptors and the included stroller adaptors that come with your Britax car seat.  It clicks together smoothly and securely.I was at BRU and found a Britax B-Ready Bassinet on clearance, and it clicked into these adaptors perfectly!  The price couldn't be beat, and I actually preferred the solid shell of the Britax Bassinet's construction.  I am able to keep these adaptors attached to my Versa and interchange the Chaperone and Britax Bassinet easily.  It's a win-win in my book :)
