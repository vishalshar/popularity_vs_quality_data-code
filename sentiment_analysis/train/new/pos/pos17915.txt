Of all the hampers we own, this is hands down our favorite. I purchased this in my 2nd trimester because I needed something to hold the clothes I was too worn out to hang up. I decided I would get a child's print since my daughter could use it when she got here.I didn't expect it to last this long, though. My daughter is 5 months old and it still looks like it did when it arrived. The only thing that I'm disappointed about is that Fisher Price decided to discontinue it. I'm debating on buying another one to stash away in her closet either for our next child or when this one finally gives in.It folds up very neatly and has handles on both sides where there's mesh (which helps ventilate the laundry). On the left side, as depicted, there's a pocket which you can use for small laundry like socks and mittens or a box of dryer sheets to throw one in the basket.The material isn't as glossy as it appears in the picture and it's a lot more durable. We've filled it to the rim and it handles everything perfectly. I am so impressed.
