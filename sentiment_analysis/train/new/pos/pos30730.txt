I was rather skeptical on buying this after reading the reviews, but im very glad that i did purchase it!Upon opening it i thought the box was way to big for the toy, i could hear it moving back and fourth within the box. The toy is in more of a display box, so its not very secure, this may have been the cause of some of these negative reviews. Anyhow i wanted this as a Christmas present for my daughter, due to the negative reviews i opened it up fist to check it out, and everything was working out as it should.I thought it was the cutest! the wings flap as you pull it, its adorable and my daughter couldn't take her eyes off of it.I noticed some saying that if they pull it the owl falls face down, yes if you make a sudden strong pull it will, that's obvious.I'm very happy with this purchase, and i completely recommend this toy.
