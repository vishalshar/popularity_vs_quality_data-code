My 89-year-old mother lives in a room attached to my house.  I ordered the Glow and Go Two Receiver Monitor set so I could hear if she needed me.  One Sunday morning she was getting dressed and fell.  My speaker was in another part of the house from where I was, but I could still hear her calling me.I have always received excellent service and products when ordering on Amazon.com.
