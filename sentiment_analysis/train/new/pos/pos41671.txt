While I read several reviews about this product having an intolerable scent, I urge buyers to consider that every woman's senses are different in pregnancy. My sense of smell has been so strong that I can smell cologne on someone in a closed office down the hall from my office at work. And yet, I personally found the scent of this product to be really nice and not overpowering.I started my pregnancy at a very petite 102 lbs. I know when you are underweight you are supposed to anticipate a greater than normal rate of weight gain, but given that my eating habits really haven't changed and I am exercising, I am definitely still gaining more weight than I thought I would (14 lbs since the beginning, at 5 months now) and showing more than I realized I would be by 5 months. I've been using this cream since the very beginning, twice a day. So far, no marks to speak of and this cream is SUPER helpful for those horrible moments of itchy skin. This is the only thing that does the trick to relieve it.I know many woman naturally don't get stretch marks until later in their pregnancy, and that any cream can only do so much to offset genetics, but I will continue to use it throughout my pregnancy. I just ordered my second order so I don't run out. Even if it doesn't prevent every single stretch mark, I feel confident enough in this product that it will reduce them. I may write another review after my baby comes about the overall effectiveness of this product.A lot of reviewers on other seller sites have said it did nothing to minimize stretch marks they already have. I'd like to speak to this as well. In college, I never got overweight, but I somehow grew a few inches taller and went from having a flat bottom to a much nicer rounder one. On the sides of my upper thighs I got some stretch marks at that time from my growth spurt. I have been using this cream on them and while they are not 100% gone, they are significantly less visible.
