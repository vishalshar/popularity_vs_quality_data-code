I never thought I would read reviews looking for a baby hairbrush but thanks to all who steered me in this direction. What a great product. The perfect size, the bristles are SO soft and don't fall out.  My son has very fine hair and not much of it but he does not mind this brush at all.  He likes the way it feels on his head and kind of zones out when we use it!  He loves to hold it in his hand and look at the design on the back.  Great, portable size and love the rubber handle - so easy to hold.
