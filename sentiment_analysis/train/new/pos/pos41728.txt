This fit perfect on the edge of our dining room table. I don't want a cushion that is going to be permanent. I placed a small sliver of the tape included and popped it on. I'm not sure who took it off. Could of been the kids, could have been the dog. I just put it back on the table corner. It's sticky enough to hold without falling off. The cushion is soft enough to prevent the ouch that comes from hitting the corner as you pass.  Child or adult. Wish I had one of these at work. Can't tell you how many times I clipped the corner of the file with my hip which is also one of the reasons why I purchased these. I only had to clip the dining room table once.They aren't very attractive, but my house is functional - not a showplace. That is also why I don't have a problem with the sticky tapes. There will be times when I want to remove them and I don't want to spend time cleaning up the adhesive on the table.I'm very pleased with this purchase.
