We are ready to transition Baby #3 to a sippy cup, and while all of our current cups are in fine condition, the valves have gotten gross.  I've tried cleaning the valves with pipe cleaners and various brushes, but have been unsuccessful and even tore some of the membranes.  I was discouraged at the thought of purchasing additional cups because it seemed unnecessary when just one component needed replacement.  I searched local retailers, the big box baby store, and even the Gerber/NUK website and was discouraged when I couldn't find these valves.  I was so happy to see these on Amazon, and wished I would have looked here first.  Our sippy cups are back in business and I can feel good that Baby #3 isn't sipping mold or other undesirables!
