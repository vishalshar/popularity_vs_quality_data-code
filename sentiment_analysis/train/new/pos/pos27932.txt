Our baby got this toy as a gift at 4.5 months old.  At that point, it was a bigger hit with Mom and Dad, as it has 1) a volume control, 2) a tune that doesn't sound like a tinny baby toy, and 3) an off switch.  Besides the obvious reasons, the off switch is important because the drum lights up and plays music whenever you walk on the floor where it sits, and sometimes even when no one has been near it for an hour (which can be a bit spooky in the middle of the night).  I've never seen Baby show any interest in rolling the drum and crawling after it, so I don't know whether it served its stated purpose, but we've gone through stages of rolling and carrying the balls (perfect size for baby hands), putting balls into the drum, taking balls out of the drum, and most recently, putting everything into the drum.  Baby enjoys the silly sounds and lights when a ball, hand, or other object goes into or out of the drum.I highly recommend this toy to any parent or gift-giver; just be aware that it may take a while to earn baby's interest!
