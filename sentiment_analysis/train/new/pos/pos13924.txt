After reading the reviews I was hesitant to try this camera but glad I did. The camera I ordered previously was outstanding 1080p but had no handheld monitor and the app didn't always alert me to a moving or crying child. This cameras picture quality isn't as good but I can see my child and what she's doing (I have it mounted on the wall about four feet above her crib). The handheld monitor is convenient and exactly what I needed. It was a breeze to set up with app and handheld monitor. I will say the app needs a complete overhaul with its spotty service, even worse video quality, and you can't upgrade to add viewers or get alerts without paying more... I've paid enough for this system. But I can see my child while away from home so I give the app 2 stars. Overall it serves it's purpose and the handheld has worked well so far. The temperature readings are even accurate so it gets 4 stars. If the app was better it would be a great system in my opinion. Also the camera is super quiet when it moves so it won't disturb a sleeping child.
