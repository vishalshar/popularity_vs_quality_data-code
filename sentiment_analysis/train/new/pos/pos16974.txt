We only use the pouches on occasion, and until we found these great straws, my daughter had a difficult time eating from her pouches.  She was much more intrigued with turning the pouch upside down and watching the food trickle out than she was with eating.  The straw used on this is the same size and material as the Playtex Lil Gripper straw sippy that we used at the time, so she took right to it and now pouches are for eating and not playing, lol.  Now she's 16 months and eats table food primarily, but we find that the pouches with the straws added are great for keeping her busy at restaurants while we are waiting for food to arrive.  It's more difficult (but not impossible!) for her to make a mess with them, cutting down on the "dining with a toddler" mess and embarrassment.  I highly recommend giving them a chance.  We started using them at 11 months (when they came out) and have used them without issue on Earth's Best, Happy Baby/Tot, Plum Organics, and Target brand pouches.
