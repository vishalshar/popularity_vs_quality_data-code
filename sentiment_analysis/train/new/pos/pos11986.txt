I bought this when my second daughter was born because she wouldn't sleep well in the bassinet that rocks because it would move every time she did.  She slept well in the bassinet feature as a newborn and we still use it when we travel and she is now turning one.  She is starting to get a little snug....  It was also nice because it is a little smaller than the normal Pack and Play so I was able to keep it set up in my bedroom.  The only problem I had was that it didn't fold up as nicely as our other pack n play but it is doable.  This is a great purchase for parents expecting a new baby.  It is a bassinet and travel system all in one!
