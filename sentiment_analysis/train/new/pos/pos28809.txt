These cards are just adorable with colorful, fun illustrations. It is fun to take a picture with our baby and the card when she hits each milestone, and a handy reminder when I go to fill out her baby book after the fact. I'm sure she will enjoy looking back on these memories as well. I think they would also be an excellent and cute baby shower gift. While they are made of pretty nice, heavy card stock, my daughter has still destroyed the corners of several of the cards after just a few seconds holding them and (of course) immediately sticking them in her mouth. I have given up on keeping them in pristine condition, it's just impossible with a grabby/teething baby, but I would suggest for the card manufacturers to possibly laminate the cards or use even more heavy duty material making them in order to prevent chewed off corners. I suppose parents could just hold the cards in front of baby and snap a picture, but I wanted pictures with her holding them. They are definitely very cute though.
