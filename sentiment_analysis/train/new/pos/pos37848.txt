I swear sometimes I think buying things on Amazon complicates things more than it should. I just wanted a bottle brush for my baby's bottles and my pump accessories. I don't have time to go the store (for anything really) so yippee, I can get it on Amazon. Easy Breezy, right? Wrong. I spent way more time than I should deciding how to spend six bucks. Suddenly, nipple brushes became of great importance to me.I don't remember why I finally decided on this brush. I think because it just looked cool and chic (and probably because my brain was going into paralysis). All the reviews I read about bottle brushes have melted together now.Now for why you are reading this review. Here is why I like this brush:1. The bristles are soft but sturdy enough to scrub.2. The nipple cleaner end is not a brush (it's just the a tapered end with some ridges on it), but I still use it inside the nipples, not sure if it does anything or if it was even meant for that, but I feel like I have to do it. What I like about the end not being a brush is that I can just stick the brush in with my utensils on my dish rack to dry, and I don't have to worry about the "nipple end" getting moldy or collecting germs because it won't dry properly.3. For the mamas who think getting splattered when you pull the the brush out is the most awful thing ever, this brush is your dream come true. Just make sure the brush side is away from you when you pull it out of the bottle, and voila, no soapy splash on your face.4. If you shove the brush end at the correct angle inside the nipple and squish the top few bristles in there, it does a decent job of cleaning the milk residue out.5. No metal parts, no rusting.The only thing I don't like:1. This brush sucks for cleaning pump accessories...so, I have to use a nipple brush part of an old bottle brush to clean my pump accessories.It's a cool brush. Get it. It's just a few bucks. Your time is worth more than that. Don't get Amazon Review Syndrome.
