When deciding on a diaper bag, one of the biggest selling points would be that it might be something that held everything we'd need for a baby, and something my husband would want to be seen wearing. Sure, we could have gone with a diaper dude bag, but this bag caught my eye immediately: basic black without designing frills, roomy, nice amount of features.We have been using this for 9 months now, and it has not disappointed. It has so much room for necessities that it doubled as a suitcase for baby's stuff on a trip we took a few months back. It can easily hold a dozen diapers, 2 spare outfits, and everything your baby could need on the road. Of course, fully packed it can get quite heavy, but it tolerates the weight well.The bottom tray has also come in quite handy as our baby has been growing. It has enough compartments to carry up to 2 bottles with an ice pack, plus solid food pouches for baby and snacks for parents, as well as side pockets where you can stash a water bottle and your stuff.Simply put, once we got to using this, I ditched my purse, and started stashing my stuff in the side pockets (aside for keys and a wallet, do you really need most of the stuff you stash in a purse? I didn't). I'd recommend it to new moms in a heartbeat.
