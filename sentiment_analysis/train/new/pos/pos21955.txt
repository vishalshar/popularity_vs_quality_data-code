WOW!!!!! All I can say is wow!!! My daughter is 5 days shy from 15 months and was only walking when her hand was being held. I wasn't worried at all and wasn't trying to push her into walking because I was confident she would walk on her own when ready. However I also wanted to provide her with the opportunity and practice to be able to reach her potential. Therefore after reading the reviews I felt like this would benefit my daughter. I Am so happy I went with my instinct. I am happy write that 15 minutes ago as I arrived from work my daughter walked towards me unassisted for the first time! We've only had the walking wings for ONE week!!
