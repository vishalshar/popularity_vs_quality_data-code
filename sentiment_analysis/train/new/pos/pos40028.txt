We have used Born Free glass bottles (with stage 1 nipples) in addition to breastfeeding since our baby was 2 weeks old. At 19 weeks of age, it was time to switch to the stage 2 nipples (as our baby wanted to eat at a faster pace). He still has no problem going back and forth between the breast and these bottles. Both stages of nipples, as well as the glass bottles themselves with the ventilation system, have worked excellently with our baby at all stages of development. The bottles themselves, as well as the ventilation pieces and nipples are easy to clean and sterilize by placing them on the top shelf of the dishwasher. We have 5 bottles, 4 nipples, and rotate thru them. They never harbor that plasticy-bacteria smell that other plastic bottles/nipples get and we rest assured knowing that Born Free makes top quality toxin-free products.
