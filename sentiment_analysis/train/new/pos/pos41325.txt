I bought this and two Medela hands free bras.  I like this a bit better than the Medelas, but this has its own issues for me.  The Velcro stumped me at first but I've since become  comfortable with it.  However, my problem was that it would scratch my back so I just have to make sure I have it on correctly so it's not touching my skin.  The holes for the pump are not obvious from the inside; I would like some marker to help me with that.  I may sew a ribbon on them or something since that's easily fixed.  The straps are nice but not necessary; if you tighten it enough--which you should as they are supposed to be tighter than regular bras--you don't need the straps at all.  All in all, glad I purchased this and it fits well.  The back has enough length to adjust for different sizes.
