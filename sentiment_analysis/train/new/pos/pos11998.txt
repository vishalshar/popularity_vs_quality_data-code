This has been a very handy product for us. We bought this when our baby was 4 months old and are still using it now 3 months later. Our baby has never been a huge fan of swaddling, but we wanted to keep him warm at night and pajamas just weren't cutting it so we got this. He loves having his hands free. It's really easy to change diapers in-- that was a huge plus for me and probably my favorite feature about this. I do have a couple complaints though. After 3 months of use it is starting to tear a bit along the seam by the zipper, granted our baby is a kicker and fights bed time constantly. If you have an active guy like ours you will just have to keep that in mind. We still love it though and continue to use it. The other thing I don't love is that since the item wraps around their chest I can feel at night that sometimes his chest is really warm and his legs get a bit chilly. Overall I would recommend this product.
