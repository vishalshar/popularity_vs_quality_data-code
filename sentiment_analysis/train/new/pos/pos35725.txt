This carseat is way higher quality than the pictures show. The fabric is nice, the detail to sponge bob is perfect. Besides the cure design the seat is sturdy and safe. The headrest comes out to the side so my sins head rest while he's sleeping rather than bobble around. The cup/snack holder is awesome. The straps come with cushion around them so they don't dig into the babies skin! This to me is wonderful for the price and just wonderful in general really. Very well made, safe and sturdy! 5 stars from me.
