I red a lot of reviews before ordering my carrier since I didn't want to by four or five to fine the best fit. This is one of a few that fit my two requirements, carrying face forward and a decent hip belt. We started with a moby wrap, and while it was nice in the beginning you do carry all the weight on your back and why break your back when you don't need to. The fact that the little one almost immediately tried to get a better view either by pushing her head back or trying to turn around was also a problem.I chose the Lillebaby 5 position Everywear Baby Carrier Organic after reeding a review here that they wished they bought the organic because of the extra padding.I like this carrier a lot, it fits perfectly (I'm 5'5"). I don't know if the lesser padding on the non organic once would have been fine and I don't find it two be too bulky with the extra padding. My daughter loves facing forward so thats the position we use the most, but when she is tired she faces in to sleep.My husband however says that he prefers the moby wrap but he never takes the time to adjust the carrier to fit him well and he puts the hip belt at the waist instead of on the hips. He is taler than me so that could be an issue but I don't know that since he is to much in a hurry to adjust it more than that he can get it on him and the carrier have to be properly adjusted to carrie comfortably.
