When I first purchased this product I was sure that it was going to be a gimmick.  My nanny was complaining about using regular dish soap on the bottles because she didn't feel that she could not be sure that she was getting all the soap off. I bought this to placate to her and to my surprise this product does a fantastic job removing milk residue from bottles.  i run a little hot water with soap and let soak for 15 minutes and this cleans it right off and washes away clean.  This is a great product!
