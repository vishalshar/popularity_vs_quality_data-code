I bought several of these bags and use them daily, so much so I've had the same box of plastic baggies in my drawer for well over a year.I just bought another pair for my son to use and noticed the tag now reads "designed in the USA. Made in China" and I find this REALLY disappointing considering the lack of regulation in that country and one of the reasons I went with Itsy Ritzy in the first place was that the products were made here. For this reason I didn't give it five stars, like I would have with my older bags and I'm not sure I'll be buying anymore, despite the new bags working just as well. :0(
