I had added this to my cart on a whim and when the price dropped from about $7 to $4 I decided to buy it (free shipping with Prime). I think you could easily get a mesh lingerie bag from someplace like Wal-mart for less that would serve the same purpose. Having said that, it does have a couple of nifty features: the loops on the corners increase the functionality of this bag by allowing you to hang it from a doorknob or crib post. I like that there are two separate compartments for lights and darks and that the two bags can be zipped together or can be unzipped. Seems to be well-made. It's a decent size for keeping track of and washing small items like socks/bibs. Don't expect to be able to wash blankets in here. Did I absolutely need this? No. Will it come in handy? Probably. I wouldn't pay $7 for it, though.
