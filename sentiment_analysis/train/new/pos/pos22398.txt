Got this on a whim as my 5 mo's old loves mirrors. She instantly took a liking to this toy. She's also teething, so the crinkle tags and other pieces she loves chewing on. Its small enough for her to handle easily  and love the addition of the mirror- she has fun with it. We haven't had any problems with this and would recommend it!
