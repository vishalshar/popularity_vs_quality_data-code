I love that amazon was carrying this product. I've been searching at Baby Depot for this last place I bought it. Couldn't find it till my husband said "Have you tried Amazon?". So I was shock to find it here, little expensive but it's all worth my money to keep my son safe in our vehicles. I bought one for my sister so she is snug tight when they give her a ride in other people cars. I love how you just have to slide the belt into the belt tightener and left the yellow handle up and down to make it a snug fit for your child car seat. I got this cause my suburban is an older model and doesn't have all the metal loops to fasten all the belts down. I will be buying more in the near future maybe for gifts. I give this product two thumbs up.
