My daughter seems to not mind the flavor, but it's also not something she gets excited about and wants to brush her teeth (I did find a way that got her to let me brush her teeth which I will add to the bottom).  I like that its organic and it seems to have helped the staining on her teeth from taking iron supplements. But the reason for the 4 star as opposed to 5 is the blueberry flavor has a strong smell that doesn't smell natural. I purchased the raspberry before and that one smelled much better. Once this runs out I will definitely be purchasing the raspberry flavor one again.Now onto how I got my daughter to enjoy brushing her teeth:I have an 18 month old and she hated it when it came time to brush her teeth. It came to a point that when she heard the snap of the toothpaste bottle she would run as fast as her little legs would allow her in the opposite direction.  But I was worried about the staining the iron supplements were causing.  It was stressful for both her and I. Now I know some parents won't agree with my method but it worked for me and in my opinion the pros outweigh the cons. I would pull up " Elmo teeth brushing" on youtube on my phone and let her watch it. This distracted her enough to let me brush her teeth for 1 and a half minutes (the length of the video).  And now a month later she will mimic the video and open her mouth wide and even stick out her tongue to let me clean it.  Just thought I'd pass on what worked for me if there are any other parents struggling getting their child to stay still.  HTH
