This is an awesome bowl!  The suction cup is incredibly strong, it's virtually impossible to rip off the table if installed properly.  It does take a few tries to figure out the best way to attach it and to disassemble the bowl and suction cup afterwards but once you get the hang of it this bowl is really wonderful.The bowl does come off very easily if the suction cup is not installed properly so I always check before putting food in it.  If it's not suctioned properly, just take it off and re-do it, it takes exactly five seconds.  Small price to pay for not having to deal with full plates of food on the floor.UPD:  I'm back to order another one and I read some negative reviews out of curiosity and I would like to respond to those.  You have to figure out how this bowl works and then you'll never buy another one.  The suction cup must be attached to a CLEAN AND DRY surface (and the suction surface must be clean and dry as well), otherwise it won't hold.  If the bowl does come off while still attached to the suction cup, put it on a CLEAN AND DRY surface (and dry the suction surface too!) and twist it off while applying quite a bit of downward pressure.  It's really pretty simple.
