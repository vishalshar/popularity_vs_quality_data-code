These are great food pouches. We love having these pouches. They are easy to fill and easy to clean. I love how the opening it on the sides. They are easy to clean in the dishwasher or by hand. We have put pudding, applesauce, and our homemade baby food in these. I have even put these in the freezer. After 3 years they have held up great and look brand new.
