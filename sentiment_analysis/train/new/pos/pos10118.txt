This set is adorable. The colors are bright and they are fun to look at for young toddlers. I bought it for my one year old's monster birthday party. I accidentally dropped the fork in the garbage disposal and turned it on. It has a few dings, but is still perfectly fine. Didn't crack or break at all.I would highly recommend for your little one learning how to use utensils.
