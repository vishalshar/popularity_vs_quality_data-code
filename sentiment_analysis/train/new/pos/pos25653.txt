Since I exclusively breast feed, I was really hesitant about giving my newborn a pacifier. On day 3 my newborn wasn't happy with anything I could give or do to comfort him. After hours of screaming I broke down and opened a pack of pacifiers... Although I've read it's best not to introduce a pacifier within the first several weeks for breastfeeding babies, I couldn't take my baby crying anymore... The newborn MAM pacifier was the trick! It calmed him down and I never looked back. This pacifier didn't confuse my baby as he was able to continue breastfeeding with no complications. We tried several brands but he only favored this one.
