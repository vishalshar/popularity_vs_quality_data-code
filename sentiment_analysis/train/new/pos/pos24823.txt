Works great!  I had a highchair that said it had a "5-point harness" but the 5 points all met at the waist, so my baby would just have to lean forward and he could have fallen right out of the highchair (if the tray was off).  I attached this clip across his chest and I feel 100% secure now that he will not be able to escape or fall out.  BUT I will say that he's only 6 months old and I can definitely see that older children would easily be able to figure out how to undo this clip.  It serves my purpose perfectly though, and I even plan to take it with me when we travel so that I can make other seats safe along the way.
