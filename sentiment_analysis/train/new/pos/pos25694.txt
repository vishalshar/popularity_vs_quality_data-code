At first, I wasn't sure that I wanted to pay for this diaper bag. It's a little pricey when there's so many other things to purchase for baby. I looked into several other options, but wasn't satisfied with anything else. Other bags had lower quality material and were not as functional. The difference with this bag is definitely the fabric. The glazed finish is awesome and will help the bag last longer. It wipes clean easily and I absolutely love the print. There are lots of pockets on the interior that make things easy to find. The stroller straps are great for shopping trips. You won't be sorry you bought this bag!
