This is a great product. It fits my jogging stroller well and really provides a lot of shade on a hot and sunny day. Stick a stroller fan in there and baby will be nice and cool all day, and hopefully even take a nap! As in the photo, it fits over the shade part of the stroller, not the handle, so there is a gap where Mosquitos/etc. could get in, but that's not what this product is for, and the gap is small.
