Still haven't found the perfect bibs for my 3 month drooler, but these are ok.  She is huge for her age (18.5lbs) and they fit fine, even though they shrink a lot in the wash and are smaller than the Gerber terry ones sold at walmart. The closure is not that terrible scratchy kind, but I agree with another review about side closure being best.
