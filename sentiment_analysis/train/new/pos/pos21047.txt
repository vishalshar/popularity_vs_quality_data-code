My son loves these straw cups and I have had a hard time finding them in the local stores. I was so excited that I found what I thought was a 4 pack of them but instead it had to sippy cups and two straw cups... I guess I should have read the fine print a little closer. Another thing is the cups will leak if you do not get the straws in there just right. Some days they are easy and some days I can't seem to get it together right. Over all the product is great and seem to last a long time.
