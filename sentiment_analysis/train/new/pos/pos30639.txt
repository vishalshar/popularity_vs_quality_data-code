My 4.5 year old boy loves this "skateboard". Not easy to fold up the stroller and lift it with it attached. Expensive for what it is, but fit our need perfectly. No problems that others have said about his head position. He is all over the place with it. Turns around, sits, kneels. We have no regrets.
