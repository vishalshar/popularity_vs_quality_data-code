I love how soft and comfortable the plush cover is. I first bought a Boppy with a standard cover for my first son almost 2 years ago and had no idea what I was missing until I bought this for a newborn. It is so lush. If any spit up or breastmilk gets on this cover, you can wipe it off easily with a baby wipe and not have to worry about it getting absorbed or needing to be ran through the washing machine immediately. My one complaint is that the pretty white dots pick up color VERY easily in the wash and are now more of a light blue. Perhaps that's my fault for washing the black and white cover with a pair of blue jeans, but this was the only item in the load to pick up any color from them so who knows? Otherwise this is my favorite cover and for the Boppy and I definitely plan to buy more of the plush ones for myself and as gifts for friends!*attached pic is BEFORE it changed colors. Will try to remember to upload one of how it looks now.
