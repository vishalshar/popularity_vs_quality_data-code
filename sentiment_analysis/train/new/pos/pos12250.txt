Really, really pleased with this. I need something small to take on a plane with an almost-one-year-old. I decided to give it a test run and found that what one reviewer said about not being able to fit five diapers in this bag was a gross and silly exaggeration.This is a list what I just put in this bag with a few inches to spare:An iPad with a slim caseA Kindle with a caseFour size 5 diapersA mostly full pack of wipes (a full one would have fit I was just too lazy to get one.)A large sippy cup (which I was only using as a space filler and won't even need.)A cell phoneA walletTwo 4oz Evenflo bottles or one 9oz Avent bottle in a pocket with a cool easy pull zipper design and an insanely convenient and sturdy magnet closure which is accessible both from the inside AND the outside of the bag.A waterbottle for myself in an insulated side pocketA set of stacking cupsA handful of foam animalsChapstick, a thin notebook, various other small items from my regular bagIf you only need a bag for a few hours, this is a great buy. It's the tops blooby. If I find any disadvantages on my trip I'll update. As of now, a billion thumbs up for usability, price and not being totally ugly and cheaply made.
