I actually bought this by accident. I was looking for the bathtub stickers to helping with slipping when my LO is standing up and trying to walk.  Didn't realize I had bought a bathtoy. With that said, it's a decent bath toy. My LO enjoys stacking it and trying to stick it on the tub wall.  Unfortunately, our tub is oval and freestanding. It has barely any flat tub space so it's tough for the shapes to stick. I'd imagine it'd work well on traditional tubs and walls.We stand up the toys after his bath to let them dry (they're pretty thick). No mold or issues with it yet. My LO tried to bite one and it didn't leave a mark but it probably would not withstand chewing if he really meant it.
