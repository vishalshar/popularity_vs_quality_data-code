I have flat nipples and I really notice a difference when wearing these. They make it easier for my son to latch on (with less pain - it almost eliminates the "60 second sizzle") and keep my nips from running my shirt.Only issue is they're small so my leaking milk fills them up relatively quickly. I have a larger set I like better for that reason. Other than that, great product.
