My daughter is EBF and finding a bottle that she would take was a nightmare. I have the Lansinol pump, so we tried those. My son loved the Medela so we tried those. I Googled and found a super expensive active latch bottle that was the highest recommended bottle. She refused all of them. I remembered having these with my son, so as a last ditch effort bought them, paid for same day shipping and prayed our date night wouldn't once again be cut short. She took them, no problem and we have been with them ever since. Will be buying more!
