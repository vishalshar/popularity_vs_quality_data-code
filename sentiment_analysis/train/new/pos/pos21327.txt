I installed this into my Subaru when I was 8 months pregnant... It was quite a bit of a struggle to get it at the perfect angle, but once it was set, the ease of getting my child's car seat in and out of the car was worth the struggle. I do notice the car seat needs to be wiggled a bit in order for it to be locked into the base, but that is not an issue.
