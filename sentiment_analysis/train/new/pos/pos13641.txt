This bathtub is one of the best things we bought for our baby before she was born. We started using it at 3 weeks after her umbilical cord fell off.I did a lot of research on bath tubs and this is the best one I found for the following reasons:- Primarily the bump in the middle!!! Not many baby baths seem to have this and it is the best part of the bath! The bump in the middle stops the baby from sliding down - it leaves you with hands free to wash her, play games, squirt shampoo etc.- The bath tub has hilarious Caribbean style tunes - awesome for Mummy and Daddy to rock out to the tunes and have fun with baby.- The bath tub has an easy drainage plug hole - so that if you have the tub on a bench next to the sink, you can easily drain the water down the sink after the bath.- The bath tub is not huge and is easily stored in a cupboard.- The bath tub will last you a while, our little one is currently 4 months (and long for her age) and should have at least another 3 months or so in this tub before we transfer her to the big bath.- Has two seating areas - one for baby who can not sit upright yet (up to 5/6 months) and one for baby who can sit upright (5/6 months and older).Cons:- The musical tunes are not waterproof and frequently stop mid-tune or won't start. I am tempted to buy another bath tub in order to get the little musical box as the tunes are so much fun for parents/baby.- The temperature gauge peeled off and stopped working after just a month or so. We use the inside of our elbow to test the water temp now.- We did not use the sling - I think it is pointless.- This does not come with a hose to fill the bath tub with water from your sink tap. We have to fill the bath tub in the large bath tub, then carry the bath tub to the bench or floor. It's hard on your back.Despite the cons I highly recommend this bath tub!!!!
