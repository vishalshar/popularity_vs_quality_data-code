I recently bought a Toyota Venza and splurged for the leather interior after many spills, pukes, etc, beat the crap out of my poor Forester's cloth interior.  The Venza is great, however, the second row seats are VERY deep and both my children's feet naturally swing forward, kicking the seat back.  Although the leather wipes up nicely, it was frustrating to be constantly cleaning the scuff marks.  I didn't want to get seat covers (which saved my Forester!), so I was thrilled to find these kick mats.  THEY WORK PERFECTLY.  I had no issues installing them- my seats are fairly big so I was concerned.  They very easily slipped over the seat.  The bottom strap tucks in nicely.  They don't stand out as "mom gear"- they are very subtle.  It was a cheap and effective way to keep my car looking nice.  It also reduced the "Can't we ever have anything nice for more than five minutes?!?!" feeling.  Everyone can ride happily- my car stays cleans and the kids do not have to fear crazy mom when they accidentally kick the back of the seat.  A true win-win.
