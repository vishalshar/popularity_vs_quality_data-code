These are overnight and thick.  They came with two regular pads on top. You have to pinch and pull apart the pads because they are stuck together folded in half.  I got into the pool by accident wearing them. They can hold a baseball full of liquid.  Those suckers were huge when completely saturated. I wear them a couple days at a time not just overnight
