I am 5'3", and this stroller is perfectly fine for my height.  I have used this on concrete, grass, pathways and more and not had any issues steering or redirecting as desired.  It is very light-weight and works well for my needs.  It goes down and pops up very easily too.  For the price I paid, it is not comparable to anything else - including thrift store.  I purchased 2 - one for me and one for Grand-ma's home.  Much easier and cost effective than buying one for more money and having to transfer from car to car or car to home (+ baby + carrier + diaper bag +................)
