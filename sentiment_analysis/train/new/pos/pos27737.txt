We got this as a gift from a family friend and it turned out to be an essential household item.Our baby girl, Victoria, absolutely loves it. Next week, she'll be 4 months old, so she's only just starting to show interest in the toys and moving parts, but she's been using it for about a month now and she just loves bouncing around in it.We haven't experienced any problems with it so far. She's bouncing around quite a lot, but she's still relatively small (14 pounds and 25 inches long), and the saucer seems sturdy enough to support her weight at this point. No broken springs or falling apart toys thus far.There are two interactive elements that she seems to favor most. She just LOVES smacking the elephant and making it *scream* (It makes elephant sound when touched or moved around), and she really likes staring at the little green leaf mirror. There's another element that is very fun and interactive (3 different melodies and flashing lights), but she hasn't been able to turn the little pages that set off the music yet.Victoria started using her ExcerSaucer at about 3 months old, but keep in mind that she's a pretty strong baby. At 3 months old, she was already able to fully support her head and lift her upper body while lying on her belly.I strongly recommend you wait until your child gains full control of her neck and head. And even then, the seat might prove to big and spacious for your baby to make her/him comfortable, so I suggest using a blanket as an extra padding. We still wrap her up in a sort of a blanky-belt when she's in her ExcerSaucer, which ensures she's more stable and comfy.Overall, this is a great toy. And not only for the baby, but for any stay-at-home mom, too, in that it'll give you 15-30 minutes of hand-free time to do dishes, tidy up the apartment, or simply sit down and have a cup of coffee.
