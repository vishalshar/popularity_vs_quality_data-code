I was lucky to get a sample of these pads from a doctor's office. If I have not tried them first and just read the reviews I would've never purchased them. But I really like these pads. I don't have a lot of leakage and they do the job beautifully for me. They are thin and lightweight. They attach to the bra at one small spot and don't move around until I take the bra off.I completely disagree with other reviewers about the pads sticking to the nipple. It does not happen to me at all. I feel secure and comfortable. I am planning to use them all the time I am nursing.
