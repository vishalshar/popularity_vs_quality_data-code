Very cute and works well.  The downside is that it will not work very long as baby gets longer and weighs more.  My grand baby weighs 14.4 pounds and is 24 inches long at 2 months 1 week.  Perhaps Fisher Price should make this item at least longer or re-position control dial so that baby's feet do not hit the panel.
