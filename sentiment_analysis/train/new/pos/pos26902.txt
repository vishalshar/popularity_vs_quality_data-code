We bought this mini crib originally in November 2013, as we lived in a townhouse. We decided to convert our master bedroom walk in closet into the baby's nursery. We used this crib until our daughter was seventeen months, and then decided to transfer to the toddler bed because she was trying to climb over the front rail. I have enclosed photos. The only thing I didn't like about the crib originally was that the top height setting was still too low. Had my husband rig it so that the arms holding the mattress were flipped upside down to make the mattress even higher with my newborn so I wouldn't have to lean down as far after having surgery. Our baby still fit into the crib at seventeen months. We bought the cherry finish and loved it. It was beautiful, lightweight and easy to move around. We put felt pads on the bottom of the feet so that we could slide it on our wood floors when cleaning and moving. The only drawback to this size was that I could only find the crib sheets on Amazon. I made my own baby quilt, and we didn't use bumpers. It was perfect! We loved it right up until we sold it to other expecting parents on Craigslist. Wish them all the best!
