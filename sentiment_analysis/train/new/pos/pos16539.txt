I purchased these about a month ago for my 26 month old son.  He has loved them from the first time he played with them in the bathtub and has played with them every night in the tub since then.  He loves putting all the letters and numbers all around the tub.  They stick well to both the tile and the tub.  I was also very happy with the size.  They are large enough for him to handle easily.  I also like that they are solid colors which makes it easier to identify the shape of each letter.  My only minor complaint is that the "M" and "W" look very similar and neither letter is the appropriate shape for a learning toddler.  Despite the "M" and "W" I am still very happy with the product and have already purchased another set for a gift because my son loves them so much.
