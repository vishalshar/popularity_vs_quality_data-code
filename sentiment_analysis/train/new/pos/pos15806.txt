My boys are 11 and 14.  They were still taking their spill-proof sippy cups, with cute little brightly colored images on them to bed at night because it is easy to drink lying down.  But my husband also makes then take them in his car because he doesn't want them to spill.  So, they told me they were embarrassed if their friends saw them.  Well, I can understand that!  So, I saw these and thought I'd give them a try!  They'd be a bit better if they didn't have the polka-dots around them, but at least they are the same color.  Also, the lids do not match the cup.  All our cups are red and blue and the lids are yellow and green.  It would be nicer if they matched.  Another reviewer said that they do leak, but really not much.  My son turned his completely upside down, and after 1 drop, nothing more came out.  So, I recommend these for kids of all ages.
