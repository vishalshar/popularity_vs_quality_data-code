My little one is only 1, so there's not much flinging of food going on just yet. Other reviewers indicate to many nook and crannies to clean. I can see their point, there are a lot (under the padding), but I've been very fortunate so far. While food does fall, it does not often get into these nooks/crannies, and when it does, I vacuum it out. Cover cleans extremely easily. I chose the older model on purpose (harder to find), because I did not want a separate pad design for the headrest. The never model is a two-piece, thicker padding. Only bad thing about this chair is that it does not lock in place when folded. Never had an issue with it opening up accidentally, but lock would add peace of mind...
