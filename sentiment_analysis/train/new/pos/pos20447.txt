We've had one of these for our son from the very beginning.  He loves to rub it on his face as he falls asleep.  I bought two extra, and send one to daycare.  It is perfect for the summer months because he gets the soft fleece blanky to snuggle with, but because of its small size, he doesn't get sweaty or overheated.  Perfect!  Also, easy to care for.  We throw it in the washer and dryer with the rest of our clothing.  Never had a problem with the fleece pilling or getting matted.  Looks like new every time.
