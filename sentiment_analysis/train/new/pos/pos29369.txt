I use these fans for my dog stroller in the hot Florida summers.  They also work perfectly on child strollers or just sitting on a table.  Perfectly safe with the foam blades, it does not hurt if you grab them.  The usb is a nice addition if you want to use rechargeable batteries too.  Very inexpensive.  Took a bit of time for shipping, but you were told that when you purchased them.  Love them and would buy them again.
