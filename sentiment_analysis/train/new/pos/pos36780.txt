I love this bouncer! We got this for my son when he was around 4 months old in an attempt to keep him off his back a little more because he didnt like tummy time and was getting a flat spot on his head. He uses it multiple times a day still (he is 8 months). All of the toys were very stimulating to him and he can still sit there for a while and be entertained by the toys attached. The lower platform allows us to move it down lower as he grows and we can take it outside without having to put some thing under his feet so he isn't standing on the ground. I really like the bungee platform because he isn't pushing against a solid flood with no leverage, I feel like this is better for his legs (IMO) Overall though it is an amazing bouncer and we are definitely getting out moneys worth out of it.
