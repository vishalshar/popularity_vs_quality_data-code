This review is late in coming, as I typically like to see how a bigger ticket kid item holds up over time before reviewing.Have to say, we are still really happy with this stroller.  When second kid came along, or original plan was to just get the rumble seat for our UppaBaby Vista (a really great stroller, too).  Upon further digging, however, it seemed like the UBV was an inferior option in that respect (one of the kids will always have an obstructed view..plus the weight limit on the rumble seat is 30lbs).  Definitely go to the respective sites and see for yourself the various 2 seat configurations.  As much as I used to be a UBV loyalist, the City Select just has a lot more flexibility in this respect.Another plus here is the great range of add-ons.  We really like the basket cargo cover, in particular.  The rain cover is good too.  It doesn't rain a whole lot where I live...but on a drizzly day at Disneyland, these add ons saved the day.  The only upgrade I really don't like is the snack/drink tray.  It's hard to get on, but ironically easily pops off.  The UBV is way better in this respect.It definitely is a little SUV-ish and does not turn on a dime.  But the stadium seating (vs side by side) make it narrow enough to get through doorways, etc.  Think of it as the Honda Pilot of strollers....not sporty, but a lot of thoughtful functionality.
