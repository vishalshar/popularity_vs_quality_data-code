These are great pacifiers. My two and half month old daughter loves them! We tried several brands like MAM, Nuk, Munchkin and Dr. Brown's. At first we thought Dr. Brown's would work better because we use their bottle system. She likes Dr. Brown's but she likes MAM even better. MAM's pacifiers look very cute and we also combine with the pacifier clips. The clips have bright color so you can easily identify where it is and the flexible clip allows you to adjust the tightness to thickness of baby clothes easily. We are very satisfied with the purchase and highly recommend these pacifiers to all new parents.
