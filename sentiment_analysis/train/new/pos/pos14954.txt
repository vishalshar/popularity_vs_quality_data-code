We really love this car seat and it seems our baby does too. The extra infant padding needs to be taken out for the baby to stay comfortable...probably when the baby is around 10 lbs or a little before then. Otherwise you will get a fussy uncomfortable baby who doesn't appear to fit very well in the seat. Make sure you adjust the straps too as the baby grows and everything will fit great for the baby.We've had our baby sleep in it during the night too on occasion...going 6+ hour stretches sleeping in this seat. Definitely is a great seat!
