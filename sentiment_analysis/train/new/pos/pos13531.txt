My daughter is a horrible teether. Her teeth take forever to come in, she slobbers like crazy, and is just downright grouchy. Within 24 hours of putting this necklace on her, her shirts were not wet from slobber any more. The entire time she's been wearing it, she's not had anywhere near the fussiness or drooling usually associated with teething - and she's currently getting 6 teeth at once. Yes, 6.No need to worry about swallowing the beads if the necklace breaks. The string is knotted in between each bead, so the most that can come off at a time is a single bead. This had been a huge concern for my husband, but he felt much better when he discovered the knots.Our first necklace broke after almost a month of wear. The necklace pulled loose at the clasp, so I wasn't able to fix it myself. Probably not something that happens often - I have lots of friends who have these for their kids, and they've never once had an issue. Props to Amazon and the retailer, though. They replaced it, no questions asked, and paid for return shipping. It was as painless as a return could be.I only wish I'd had one of these five years ago for my son!
