I have been using this brand of pacifier clips for the past three years (through multiple children) and out of all the others I've tried, these are my favorite.Pros:-The fabric loop is long enough that it's quite simple to attach & remove a pacifier without too much hassle. I have tried another brand with a similar loop, but it was too short and made it quite difficult to remove the pacifier.-The designs are adorable. There's something for everyone's taste.-The clip is small enough that you can attach it just about anywhere on the child's clothes and it won't be obstructive. Other brands have large plastic clips that are difficult to find a decent spot that won't be completely in the way (bibs, car seat straps, jackets, etc...)-The alligator style clip is strong enough that it attaches firmly to even thin clothing. It is also easy enough to be opened without hurting my fingers, but a baby definitely couldn't do it.Cons:-The clip does wear out eventually, unfortunately. It starts out by not hanging on to thin clothes that it used to, until it stops staying attached to pretty much anything. This normally doesn't happen for months, though.Overall, I will continue buying this brand of paci clips over other brands for as long as I need to.
