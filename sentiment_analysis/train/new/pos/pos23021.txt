First let me say that I was looking for a lite weight stroller so that I could travel with my 8 month old son around town catching a bus and a ferry boat while my husband is at work. (I love my Metro lite by Graco, but that was not going to cut it) So, after weeks of looking everywhere, b/c I am a bargain shopper... I found this, and I am very satisfied with it.  I needed a lot of features on my umbrella stroller and this does it for me, AND I don't have a problem holding my son and setting up, or breaking down the stroller when its just me and him.Prosvery lite weight; compact, carrying strap, love the padded board for my son's back, so he is not slouching, recline position is good, for an umbrella stroller, easy material to clean, good canopy with pockets to store stuff, and even a basket underneath, 5 point harness is great especially since my son thinks he has wings, so it keeps him secure, and keeps me sane; with a little practice you can hold your kid in one hand and set up or break down the stroller with the other.These are the things that were a must for me to purchase an umbrella stroller. It is also durable and I will have it for years to come. My husband likes using it too.Also it comes with a matching carrying case (bag), although I never use it, I do use the clear plastic bag that it came in (about the size of a small purse), that attaches to the stroller.  Its great, I keep my infant soft carrier in that, and we are still mobile if I need my hands free on the bus or the boat.ConsAnyway, I really like this stroller, but  I do hit my feet on the wheels sometimes, because I think the handles could be a little bit longer, and I am only 5'2", also, the other con is the handles could be padded, but hey its only 50 bucks, I mean thats getting a little greedy. And this is coming from a picky person.Works great...and NO Assembling required!!
