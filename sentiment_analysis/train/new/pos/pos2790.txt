I am a Childcare Provider. I have 3 wooden cribs, but no room for one more. I had to purchase another crib, for a new child, because the play yard that I had was considered not safe by the State of MA. It all had to do with the way the old one closed up. Frame closed to a V and the possibility of a child getting their neck caught in that V and chocking was a very real possibility... Well this Foundations Elite Crib fit the bill perfectly. Price was reasonable, the play yard or portable crib, as it is sometimes called, was a good size and closed safely... I'm happy!
