I purchased this for someone who recently had a baby. I really like Woodours products for their quality and educational value. This bear has a cute silly face and is small enough for a little kid to hold with his/her own grip. The different patches of fabrics used on this bear are nice, too. Pull on the fish and it plays a song when it retracts back to the bear. I wish it had a soft body, but I guess in order to contain all the mechanisms for the music box, it needed a hard casing.
