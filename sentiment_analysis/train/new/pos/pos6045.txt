I first purchased Gerber's flat fold diapers (a huge disappointment).  OsoCozy's diapers are made of a thick (but not too much) birdseye weave.  They are significantly higher quality and perform well.  I've found them to be very absorbent and soft.  The edges are folded over twice and sewn rather than surged which may be an advantage to some, but are the only reason for my four star rating instead of five.  These seams create a lot of bulk in areas with certain folds--especially the origami where all the edges pile up along the back.
