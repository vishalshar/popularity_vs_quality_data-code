I fell in love with the Laguna collection while looking for fitted crib sheets. When I saw these decals, I knew I had to have them! But I was discouraged by the poor reviews and figured, as much as I love them, it wasn't worth the $18 if they weren't good quality. However, I couldn't find anything I loved nearly as much and I definitely couldn't find anything decent that was at any better price. So, I decided to take the chance and order these anyway.And I'm glad I did! They are too stinkin' cute and match his bedding perfectly. They're a lot bigger than I thought they'd be too. However, I was disappointed that the sheets were folded into thirds, which made big creases. Sitting a heavy book on them for a while worked alright, though I wish I hadn't needed to. You can't tell that the bigger stickers were folded if you smooth them out well. One of the leaves, though, won't stay flat because of that bend. As for sticking, they've been up for several weeks now and all are still firmly attached to the wall, so I'm not sure why other reviewers have had such problems with these. I can recommend that you know exactly where you want to put them--because they're not so super sticky that I can see them being a problem if you were to apply them, then peel them off and try to put them back down. If your walls are smooth and you clean and dry them--like the package says--there shouldn't be a problem.
