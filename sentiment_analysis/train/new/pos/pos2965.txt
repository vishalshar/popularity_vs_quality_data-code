I was a bit worried about buying this product when I read some of the reviews but I'm glad I did.  Firstly you really need to experiment with tying it in different places to find the right fit for your pram.  Once fitted properly on your pram it will do it's job and keep out the sun and the wind (unfortunately we can have both at the same time down under).  My canopy is rather small but it lifts up at the end which i why this hood sits so nicely on top of it.  I'm also lucky enough to have a parent tray and so when I want to lift baby out I just push the hood backwards and under the parent tray and its sits nicely (I don't think I would be able to get baby out easily if I could not push hood back, although I did think of using a peg or bulldog clip to hold it back before I discovered it sits nicely under the parent tray).  Overall, I am very happy with this product and I don't think it looks as daggy as some other reviewers have mentioned.
