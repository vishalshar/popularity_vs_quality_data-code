The little froggies are awfully cute. My daughter loves them. All of the pieces are of good quality.My only problem with the set is that it is nearly impossible to get all of the water out of the large frog. I ended up hot-gluing the holes in all of the frogs shut to keep them from getting moldy and gross inside.
