I needed a head positioner for my son's car seat because his Britax Roundabout did not offer any real head support.  After looking around at all the different pillows and supports, I came across the Snuggin Go.  It works very well to keep my son's head upright when in his car seat.  I had a hard time knowing if I should buy the infant Snuggin Go or the Snuggin Go Too for toddlers.  I looked at the weight suggestions, and went with the infant positioner (even though my son is a year old) because he is only 18 pounds, and the Snuggin Go Too is for children 30 pounds and up.  It fits very nicely in his car seat, and he seems very comfortable.  It is so much better than the rolled up blankets I've been using!!  When I looked at the pictures I thought that the pillows might be uncomfortable for him on his back, but they are made with memory foam, so they flatten out when he leans on them, so the pillows do not push him forward.  The pillow behind his shoulders makes his head lean back, so it doesn't tip forward when he falls asleep.  This is a great product!
