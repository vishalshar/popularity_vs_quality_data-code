We purchased one at a local store and loved it so much we got a second one off of amazon.  This was even better than the previous model.  First, the six or so dollar price was way better than what we paid in store - thank you amazon.  Second this dry rack is squarer so it takes up less space on the counter.  Third the stopper holder slots in the front has deeper groves on both sides - which eliminated the weird tiny prongs on the previous version that were a pain to get the stoppers to stay in.Why these work Dr. Brown's bottles...  on the tall spokes we place the circular rings and the the bottle on top.  On the first row of short spokes we place the blue internal part that allows air to move.  We place two upright, one upside down, and repeat the pattern across the row.  The second row of short spokes holds the white inner parts.  We poke the tip into the round holders at an angle so fluid can drip out if need be.  You can fit one in between each spoke and one at each end.  I then place the bottle nipples on top of these spokes.  In the very front, goes the stoppers into the slots.  I place the bottle caps on any open spokes and on top of the stoppers if stable.  So one dry rack holds 5 complete Dr. Brown's bottles.Why we got a second dry rack:  to hold the bottles, stoppers, rings, and other parts used with my breast pump.  Plus hold small bowls used for cereal and we intend to continue using these with sippy cups etc.  We don't put anything plastic in the dishwasher and do it all by hand so these dry racks will be used for a long time.The only con is.... it was a pale purple not white.  I can live with the purple, but its odd.
