If portability is important to you, buy this high chair. It folds down very small, has it's own carrying bag and is very lightweight. That last part is actually why I give it only 4 stars. For the price, I expected the side rails, on which the back folds and the tray attaches, to be partially made of metal instead of all plastic.That being said, it has some great features. It can be easily attached to any regular kitchen chair instead of having an extra chair in the room to trip over. It can be used with or without the tray to allow baby to sit at the table with the rest of the family, but the tray does require 2 hands to install or remove. The chair can be raised or lowered to the right height as your child grows so they're well-positioned at most any table. Everything wipes down easily. I might have made the seat and back pads flush with the rest of the chair to avoid crumbs in the crevices, but they are removable for a more thorough cleaning.All in all, a good chair
