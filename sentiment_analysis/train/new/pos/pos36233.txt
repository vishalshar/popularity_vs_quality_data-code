I purchased this to help with ammonia issues I was having with my toddler's cloth diapers. I used it to "strip" our microfiber inserts. It took away the majority of the smell and made everything look very white. After a couple more normal wash cycles, the ammonia problems were completely gone.I used it with a front loading HE washer and we have hard water, so I did several rinse cycles after using the RLR. Also, I did not use it on any PUL covers.
