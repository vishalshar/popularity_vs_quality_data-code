We originally purchased the Diaper Dekor as a cheaper alternative to a Diaper Genie based off of a cousin's recommendation, and have been very happy with it.  These refills are durable, trap the smell of used diapers very well, and are easy to replace.I had trouble replacing the liner the first time I attempted it, but only because I tried to do it myself without following the instructions.  The instructions are simple, and make it an easy, quick process.
