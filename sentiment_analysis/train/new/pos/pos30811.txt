We are currently using these bottles for baby number two. When our first was on the way, we registered for these bottles because we wanted glass and because Born Free was recommended to us. We loved them.Both my girls are breastfed and I pump once I go back to work. They both had no issues going between breast and this bottle. I did, however, keep them both with level one nipples for the duration. My oldest used these bottles for two years (she wouldn't drink milk unless it was in the bottle). We had to replace the vents near the end because some started leaking.We have had a couple break, but that's from having a toddler chuck them onto the wood floor.Overall, I'd definitely recommend the Born Free brand and these bottles.
