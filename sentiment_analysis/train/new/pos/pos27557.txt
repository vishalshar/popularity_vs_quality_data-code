I was very happy to find these bibs on amazon.  We had several of these bibs bought in 2007/2008 at Walmart for our older two daughters.  Now that number three came along several years later, I was no longer able to find them there or at any local stores.  These really work the best for messy eaters.  And I've used several different kinds over the years including baby bjorn and bumpkins.  These bibs are super easy to clean as long as you clean them right after the child eats and don't let the food harden on them.  I will occasionally put them in the wash and hang to dry and they come out perfect.  My only complaint is that one snap on each of the two I bought were broke when I got them.  So one side of the bib comes apart easily.  Kind of disappointing since these are not cheap bibs.  But they still function better than other bibs I've used.
