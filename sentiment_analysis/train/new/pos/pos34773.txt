I really like these cups:D!  The caps are threaded so that they screw on to the top of the cup, and now I don't tear my nails out trying to pry off a snap-on lid, and there's no leakage with slight tilting (man, I HATE the Disney snap-on lids with straws!)  I find that the lip of the lid is easier to scrub out than the much thinner lip of most snap-on-lid cups (HUGE plus considering I don't have a dishwasher).  This is not great for kids who haven't learned that you don't tilt cups with straws because, as another reviewer put it, these are hard to get ALL the liquid out of the bottom if the child tilts, especially since the straw is cut at an angle at the bottom.  On the plus side, I have found that these leak LESS with tilting as compared to the snap-on lid-cups.  I don't have a problem with my kid so far, but then again, she'll do ANYTHING to get that last bit of chocolate milk.I DON'T like how my kid gnaws on the straw end, but these straws are pretty darn resilient, and haven't cracked yet.  I like that I can interchange these lids with the sippy cup lids of the same line.  I'm also EXTREMELY happy that Munchkin has Diego cups, and that they include a picture of Diego's sister, Alicia.  I had gotten the Dora sippy cups before, but now the Diego ones are all she uses.
