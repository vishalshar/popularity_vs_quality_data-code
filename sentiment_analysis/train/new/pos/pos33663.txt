It is an aweseme little umbrella stroller. The basket can hold 4 jackets or a purse nicely, and the handles are great for me since I am a little taller and usualy stuggle with umbrella strollers that are too short. the cup holders are cloth and held our little straw cups for the kids nicely. The fabric is thick and seems durable. The down sides are that it only has a lap belt (no shoulder harness) so be careful with little kids that they don't flip forward. And the seat doesn't recline at all, which isn't a big deal since most umbrella strollers "recline" is worthless any way. The biggest complaint I have is it doesn't come with a shoulder strap. That is of utmost importanct as we are dodging through airports and subways, etc., with full hands. Oh well, still glad to have found it for a good price.
