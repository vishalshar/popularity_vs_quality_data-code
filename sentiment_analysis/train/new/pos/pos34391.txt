As others have mentioned this seat receives high marks from the IHS and Consumer Reports. It is a nice light weight seat that does the job it was designed to do.We have one in three different cars (mine, wife, and grandparents) but it so light weight we probably didn't need to buy the third for the grandparents as transferring between cars would be easy. Then again, at less than $40 the hassle factor may be worth the third seat.My only complaint is a caution to other purchasers: The shape of your back seat has a lot to do with the ease of use of the seat belt. I drive a Honda Civic with a back seat that has bucket-like seats. Getting to the seat belt latch can be difficult and because this seat has no tethering system it tends to 'float' toward the middle of the car making the seat belt access problem even worse.My father-in-laws car has the older bench style seat and getting to that seat belt latch is not a problem.
