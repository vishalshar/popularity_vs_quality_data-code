This is the PERFECT toddler bed - it's inexpensive, it's sturdy, and it's absolutely adorable!  If you search the 'net, you'll find dozens of other rave reviews about this particular toddler bed.We just bought this a few weeks ago for our son's 2nd birthday.  He loves it!  It's close to the ground, and he can get in and out of it with incredible ease.Like some other reviewers said, the instructions were a little vague.  Like the pictures won't show you which way to put together each piece.  You need to think it through a little and make sure the holes for the side rails are both going the same direction, etc.  Just think ahead and anticipate what goes where, which isn't hard by any means.  If you've never put together furniture before, I can imagine it might be a little more difficult.But my husband and I having put together cribs, dressers, changing tables, etc, we found this one of the easier baby items to assemble!All in all, it's an awesome product, and I would definitely purchase it again!  Do NOT buy the cheapo ones at walmart, etc - those are poorly made, plus with amazon, you have the added benefit of no tax and FREE shipping, meaning you don't have to lug it out to your car and then to your house - they deliver it to your doorstep!I searched for hours for the best online deal for a toddler bed - this is it!  You won't find a better product for a better price!  Buy it and you won't regret it!Thanks amazon for yet another great buy!UPDATE 1/8/2010:We've had this bed for a year and a half, and it has held up FABULOUSLY!  As hard as our toddler can be on furniture (I'm sure you all know!!) I was surprised at how well it's held up.  He still fits great in it, and he loves that he has a bed sized right just for him.  :o)  A year and a half later, I would still definitely buy this again.  A really great toddler bed, especially for the price!!
