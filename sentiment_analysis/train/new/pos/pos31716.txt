We have a pirate themed room and this valance really completes it.  The flags are a cute and unique idea.  We have a couple of the other coordinating NoJo products but this piece is my favorite.  We bought two to put together because we have large windows but one would have fit by itself if we left it stretched out completely.  Instead we scrunched them together to create a more ruffled look and I'm glad we did.  Two fit together nicely and look seamless.  The fabric is soft and thick too.  Nice product.
