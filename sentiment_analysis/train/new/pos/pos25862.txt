This is a two pack of liners to protect car seats or strollers from potty training accidents.  In the several weeks that I have had them, my son has only had one or two accidents but it wasn't so much that it pooled outside of the liners as some other reviewers have mentioned.  Perhaps that is because we have been really good about getting him to go often so if he has an accident its only a little bit or it could be that the piddle pads are working excellently, its hard to know.  So far, I've been happy with them and hope to continue to.  I'll update this review if down the road in our potty training journey we have leakage through these pads.  I'm happy that I have two.  I keep one in my car and the other in hubby's car.  If we go on a long trip, I can bring the extra with us just in case.  So far, I recommend these pads to others.
