This little bag of grocery items is so cute! It comes with a banana that has a velcro peel, an apple that has a bell inside so it jingles, a lettuce that makes a crackly crunchy sound when you touch the leaves, an orange that opens and closes, and a milk jug that has a small mirror when you open the flaps. This is a small bag, but the perfect size for my 16 month old who likes to walk around with it and put the bag and the fruits in her play shopping cart. The only downside about this is trying to handwash the items (hosting playgroups makes cleaning these every now and then a necessity!). The color from the fruits bleeds (especially the orange!), so be careful when spot cleaning. Also, this isn't the best "play pretend shopping" set if you are going for realistic (since you can see from the photo that the fruits/veggie have smiley faces), however it is adorable and fun for babies/toddlers.
