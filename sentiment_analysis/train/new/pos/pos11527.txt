I was sick of hanging out with a baby. I missed hanging out with the Bros but I traded them in for a little baby girl. This mustache makes it feel like I'm not hanging out with a baby watching the game anymore but a quiet gentleman. I put my baby in a suit, give her the mustache and I feel like I have a very fancy friend. I used to drink beer out of a bottle but now I have fancy mugs to meet up to my fancy baby's standards. How can I look like a slob next to this eliquent guest? This binike changed my life and really cleaned up my act. I reccomend to anyone sick of hanging out with a baby, I feel like you usually act like your friends. And when my friend has cherios and drooling all the time it puts lower standards for me and let's me walk around with stains and cheetos  in my hair. Not only is my baby now a gentleman but so am I. I reccomend, cheers! (I'm american but I say cheers now)
