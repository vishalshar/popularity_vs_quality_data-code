My boys love spinning the steering wheel on this little toy!  It seems very durable and obviously is a plus that there was no assembly required.  If I had to complain, I would say that I wish it did a bit more than just constantly, and annoyingly, sing the abcs and starts over if you push a button while it's doing so.  I also wish the gear shift did something other than say up or down.  It does get a bit annoying hearing up up up up , down down down down over and over!  Otherwise a great toy for your infant sons or daughters,especially if you're a speedy family :)
