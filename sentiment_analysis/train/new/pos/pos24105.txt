I love these multi-use pads. They are easy to wash (cold water, low heat dryer), but get a few if you're going to use them as I do (to protect the pretty changing pad or cover a cold plastic covered changing pad). I've washed them multiple times and yeah they get fuzzy, but I purchased for function, rather than looks.That being said, as other reviewers have mentioned, this item is listed incorrectly. The same item sold by a major baby retailer lists these correctly as "Carter's Keep Me Dry 2 Pack Quilted Multi-Use Pads - White." They are not crib pads.I knew what I was looking for, so I knew these were not meant to be the size of a crib, fitted mattress pad, etc.
