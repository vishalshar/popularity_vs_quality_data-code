I thought I would never need a bottle warmer. Why would I need something like this when I can just as easily warm a bottle myself with hot water? I BF and supplement with formula due to low production. Every supplement I would fill a glass measuring cup with the hottest tap water and have to refill 3 times to get it warm. Very time consuming when you have a screaming, hungry child! Then I tried filling it with water and microwaving the water. I found this got my bottles too hot at times if I couldn't stand over it to watch them temp. I decided to try this warmer because it had lots of good reviews that outweighed the bad. It works great! I fill the attached measuring cup 1 full time per every 2 oz and it heats perfectly! It heats fast enough and has an automatic shut off when it is finished. It's small so it takes up little space on my countertop, but has a wide opening that fits my fat Similac bottles, minus the ring attachment. It comes with a basket to heat jarred baby food when that stage comes along. I spray the inside with Simple Green once a week and wipe it down. I've yet to see any rust on the heating element. For the money it's definitely worth the convenience! The only downside is the heating element is wearing a bit on the bottoms of my bottles.
