I never thought I'd be the parent who co sleeps. Always thought very negatively about the whole subject, but when your newborn doesn't like her bassinet and us as parents need as much sleep as we can get, I changed my mind. But I didn't feel like she would be safe without something somewhat protecting her. I don't like that the mesh sides aren't more sturdy. Our daughters legs hang off all the time. In no way does she roll out, it would just have been nice if the sides were better. But overall I like it and feel safer co sleeping with our daughter!*UPDATE*I would drop this to two stars instead of 4. The mesh sides at the bottom did not hold our daughter in. Woke up and she was hanging off the side face first. Have no idea how she did that, but because the bottom mesh siding is so flimsy and doesn't have something to firm it up, she somewhat rolled out. So for safety reasons, I would drop the rating.
