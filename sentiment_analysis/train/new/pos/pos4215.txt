Nice swim diaper, firm elastic, cute prints (with ruffle in back on girly ones!), snaps are helpful.As mentioned by other reviewers, runs two full sizes small. The weights listed on their size chart are way off; my 22 lb toddler is wearing a size 2x, listed for 30-40 pounds. However, the body measurements on the chart do seem to be accurate, so if you can measure your kid you may get a better sense of what size to order. My child has a 19" waist and 12" thighs and the 2x was a good choice of size for her.
