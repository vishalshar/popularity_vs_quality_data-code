I can't count the hours this has kept my baby occupied from 4-6 months.I went for this particular design because I liked the round edges for gripping onto as well as the option of the soft and extra soft version.  I was able to use the extra soft version until baby's first tooth came in, and then switched to the other one.  I also found that the loops were easy to attach to a pacifier clip.Yes, this is pricey for a toy, but for a good two months (maybe more), this was literally the only toy I carried when going  out because all others paled in comparison.
