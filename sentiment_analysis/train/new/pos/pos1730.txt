I love how light weight this is.  And so many compartments to organize your stuff.  I use one of their smaller bags that comes with the bag as my wallet or clutch...I've over-used it to the point that the loop on the side broke off at the seams.  Either way, it's great to grab and go if you're just dropping off the bag with a care-taker or throwing it back in and not carrying too many bags around when all you need is the diaper bag with your necessities in a smaller pouch.  Love the insulated bag too.  Keep all my ready to go formula bottles and nipples in there.  Outside side pockets great for sanitizers, front pockets great for quick easy to reach and find wipes (hand and face wipes, pacifier wipes, and dry Kleenex tissues).  Other front pocket for my sunglasses, keys and phone.  My husband thinks I'm crazy for carrying a heavy bag, but I think it's already light weight to begin with so all the stuff I'm packing in are the items "necessary" to the added weight.  Like water bottles for those powder formulas as my back up feedings (that's in one of the inside side mesh pockets).  Extra change of clothes, extra mesh pockets for diapers and bibs and burp cloths.  The inside is so roomy, you can pack a loose blanket and toy blanket and other toys in there.  Definitely a great deal for the price below $100.  Would definitely recommend if you're like me into organizing and carry every essential item for your baby.
