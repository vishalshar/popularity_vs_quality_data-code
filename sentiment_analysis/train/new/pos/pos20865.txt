This is a great carrier. It's easy to use and I used it with our infant and still using it two years later. It is so convenient and a life saver when we're out and we don't have a stroller for him to sleep in. At 2 years, he loves the saddle straps to put his feet in and am confident it will have use a year down the road as this carrier supports up to 45 lbs. My sister has an Ergo and she tried my Boba, and she actually prefers my Boba 3G. There is more fabric for back support, another reason I like this carrier.
