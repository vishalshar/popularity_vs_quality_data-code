This is a very sturdy lock, and worth the price I think for the ease of use alone.  You need to press two buttons and the lock pops open, so much more sophisticated and quick than the traditional slide cabinet locks.That being said, I can only give this lock four stars because it will not fit on every cabinet door.  The under-the-sink cabinet doors in our kitchen and one bathroom are too thick (about 1") for the brackets to reach around and sit flush.  I think this is because the doors are beveled on the edges with a decorative cutout design.I was able to make this work in one bathroom, and as a previous reviewer said, it was tight enough that I may not even need to use the screws. Those doors are just slightly less 3/4" thick.My suggestion would be to measure your doors before buying!
