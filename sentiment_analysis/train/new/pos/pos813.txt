It does exactly as advertised.  Its padded for comfort.  Its weather/water-resistant.  It gives you somewhere protected to lay when in an open field.  Still... I want bigger.  I have to share this space with my husband when we go out.  He's a big, merciless, territory-encroaching guy.  If you're OK with the dimensions, then great product.  I will be looking for larger.
