I bought this stroller months ago in anticipation of having a newborn and a toddler to cart around. Well, I used it 3 times with my toddler while still pregnant and it was great, it unfolded/folded really easily and assembly took mere minutes. I was easily able to maneuver it by myself even though I had major back issues while pregnant.I waited to review this product though until my newborn came along and I could see how well it worked with the two of them. And I LOVE it. It's the best investment I've ever made for my kids...well, equipment-wise that is. It has many different pieces in using it with a carseat and regular seat however, each piece fits nice and securely and I've never had to 'fight' with this stroller to get it out of my car or put it away. This stroller actually makes me want to go out on walks with the kiddos, every time I use it I smile! Thank you Baby Jogger for making such an awesome stroller that's not a side by side nor does it regulate one child to sit below and stare at the bottom of the seat in front of them. LOVE!
