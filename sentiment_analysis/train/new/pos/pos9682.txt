We have a Sunshine Kids Radian carseat for our 2 year old, it does not have cupholders.  We use take and toss straw cups with glad bendy straws.  She is fully potty trained, so I wasn't looking for a "piddle pad".We have had a potty accident, water spill, etc here and there and while this isn't water tight, it does help minimize the damage. She uses the pockets to hold her drinks and maybe a toy or two.  Only annoying part is the velcro pockets, when she's bored she sometimes rips them off and I wish she couldn't do that, but I do like that they are adjustable to fit your carseat...so it's not that big of a deal.  Velcro is strong, cups don't fall or anything.  I've washed it in the machine once or twice no problems.  Just no washing tabs for the velcro, be careful what goes in with it.Glad we got this.
