These are really ingenious. I use them for poopy diapers, soiled clothes, wet swimsuits, dirty spoons and used food container, and more. You will find more uses than you can imagine. They are quick and easy to cut off with the incorporated blade and then tie off to any size you need. The refills are reasonably priced, and each one lasts a good long while.
