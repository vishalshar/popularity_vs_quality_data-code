This is beyond precious!  It was a EXACTLY what I was hoping for.  I would highly recommend it.  One suggestion--definitely practice the hand print with the ink stamp they provide before using the paper in the frame.  Our ink stamp was very light and hard to see so we had to use a different one.  This frame again, is lovely and I would buy it again in a heartbeat!  Another plus??? It arrived much quicker than expected!
