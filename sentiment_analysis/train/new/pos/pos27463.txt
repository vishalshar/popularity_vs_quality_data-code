Advice to all parents that are potty training: don't use pullups for daytime!  Use these!  They are super thick and will relatively hold a small to normal size pee accident without getting anything too messy.  And, the child will feel the wetness and let you know!  No, they are not waterproof and will not hold big messes; however, unless you want to extend potty training by 6 months to a year, don't buy pullups!  They are a waste of money for daytime and your child will see no difference in those or regular diapers.  I still put my 27 mo old stepdaughter in a pull up at night but during the day these are wonderful.  She pretty much had the routine down in less than a day but I keep her in these and just a top while around the house so she can easily and independently toilet herself.  Even though most 18-24 mo clothing fits her well, I purchased the 3T training undies to make sure she can raise and lower the undies without any frustration and I'm glad I did.  I would recommend the same to any parent who is potty training.
