Ok, I think the product description says ages 3 and up, but for anyone who's wondering, these are juuust wide enough to not fit through a cardboard tube, so I'm calling them toddler safe. I got them as an Easter gift for my not quite 2 year old son (who still has the tendency to stick toys in his mouth). They are wider than the 2.5 inch Darice eggs I saw at Pat Catans (local craft store like Micheals).If I had one complaint it would be that they are a little too symmetrical to be really egg shaped (you can see this in the product photos) but I don't think any small child will care (or notice) and I don't mind enough to knock off a star. I did see some wooden eggs on etsy that were more classily egg-shaped, but they were a bit more expensive, and I don't really trust etsy sellers as a whole for shipping (takes too long if I get it at all). I got these eggs within a couple of days of placing the order. Now I just need to decide whether I want to decorate them...
