My pump tubes got water inside them and I dried them as instructed and then I thought it would be good to have back up tubes in case those ones got ruined.  I read the reviews and had good expectations, but still worried they may not work as efficiently as my original tubes.  When they arrived, I tested them with my Medela pump in style advanced pump.  I checked and double checked before ordering to make sure I was getting the proper tubes.  The fit perfectly, the tube end with no plastic tip fit more snug on the pump then my original tubes do.  It helped give a better suction while pumping with the tighter fit.  I am very happy with the tubes and that I now have two extra sets and not just one.  If you need replacements or just extras to have around, these are 100% worth the purchase, you wont be disappointed!!I purchased this with my own money, I was in no way obligated to leave a review.
