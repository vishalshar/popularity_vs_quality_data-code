I bought this for my 14 month old daughter's bedroom. I was getting tired of her brothers waking her in the morning when they got around for school and my husband's alarm waking her every morning when he got up, so I bought this. I researched these to death and finally decided on this one because it has a little bit of everything. White noise, soothing nature sounds, a few lullabies, and the option to use an mp3 player. I haven't used an mp3 player yet, but it is cool that it has a "hidden" spot on the bottom where it connects. So far this is working very well for us and she is sleeping so much better now. We mostly use the nature sounds. I also like that it can be turned down very quiet, or get pretty loud. I've only had about a month now, but so far this is working extremely well for us and I'm loving my purchase.
