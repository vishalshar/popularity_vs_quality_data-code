With the rising cost of gasoline, I just bought a small compact car for local driving with my son's lessons and games.  I orginally had two Britax booster seats in my minivan and took one out and put one on new car but needed extra car seat that I could store in the trunk since the space of car is limited and I don't want the bulky car seat taking more room.  (Britax booster has full back support so it cannot be stored in the trunk.) I looked around and figured Cosco Ambassador would do the job since this is a guest car seat.  I tried on my son (tall 6y/o) and works fine and give enought height boost so that seat belt feels comfortable for him and most of his friends are 7 y/o so should not have any problem, not giving enought height.  I knew this is $16~17 at local walmart but I ordered this through Amazon to get free shipping with Duncan yoyos my son wanted.  To my surprise this car seat arrived within 24 hours of ordering eventhough I used free shipping service.  Thumbs up to Amazon for fast shipping~!
