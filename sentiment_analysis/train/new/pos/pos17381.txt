Would give 10 stars if i could! Best deal and well made! I like that 95% of this is metal and the small plastic parts can be replaced if needs be. Super easy to use. It does weight more than i had hoped for at 15-20lb and is taller than the descriptions. It stands at 28  1/2in high. The gate is 16 1/2 wide, each panel is 25 1/2in wide counting the joints. The spaces between the bars are small at only 2 1/4in gap. remember to read directions before pulling the gate apart as the plastic joints need to be loosened first. You can remove panels, which i like in under 1 minute!. The wall connectors are attached to the gate when you get it, so don't think they forgot them. You can make this into an octagon/circle, square, or a rectangle, L- shape, and probable a triangle! The gates opening is a little small it you are blessed with nice size hips, but it is workable for me and my family that range from 125lb to 230lb. This will work great for my puppy! please check out my photos! This is the best deal you will find online!
