These organic T-shirts are incredibly wonderful.  I was hesitant at first to order them because the largest size is 3-6 months.  But they run large and very generous.  They are soft and excellent quality.  Even though my baby is 4 months old and on the larger side - these t shirts will last a long time as they are made loose and comfortable. I think they will last to 12 months.  I love that there are no snaps going all the way down as it makes the t-shirt more comfortable.  The t-shirt doesn't ride up as it is on the longer side.  They are certified GOT 100 % cotton.  I love them and will order more.  Worth every penny and wish I had gotten them from the start.
