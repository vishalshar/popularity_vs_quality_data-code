When I pulled this playard out of the box, it was packed in the carrying case, When packed down, it is an easy shape and size to maneuver. It's a bit heavier than I anticipated but none the less, packs away nicely. Secondly, I was very happy with the colouring. Sometimes things will appear darker or lighter on line and this was bang on. Upon setting it up, it was a bit tricky to lock into place but I believe it will become easier with practice and time (the fabric covers the unlocking buttons so you are going by feel).Overall, I love it and was happy with both price and product.
