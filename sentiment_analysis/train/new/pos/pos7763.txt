My 6 month old daughter just loves this toy. Easy for her to hold, easy to take on outings. Nice size, not toobig and not too small. Perfect for tiny hands. And I like that there is nothing to poke her in the eye like someteethers do b/c of their shape. Nice smooth feel too. The light is cute which my dtr likes to look at when I push it but she mostly likes to mouth it. I washed it up really good with warm soapy water and it has been fine. No smells for us like one of the reviews mentioned. It is brightly colored and much nicer in person.
