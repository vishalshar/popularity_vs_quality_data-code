Like many parents we tried a few different models before finding this one and it works great!  We can clearly see our daughter in her crib at night.  This does have a few quirks like you have to adjust the brightness setting in the day or night otherwise your baby will look like a white blob at times.  Also, we live in a townhouse so there's lots of interference, this picks up some static but can be easily fixed by using the snap together Ferrite Choke Core from Radioshack and changing the location of the monitor.
