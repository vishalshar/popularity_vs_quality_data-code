My daughter just turned two and she loves scooting around on this thing. We eventually want to get her a balance bike, but she is a  bit scared to get on of those, so we thought this would be a good first step. I love how it folds up and takes up virtually no room in our small condo or in the car when we take her places. She can also pick it up and move it very easily, so she doesn't need any help from us when she gets stuck somewhere.My only complaint is the age range for this product is misleading, as this trike is pretty small for her already. She's an average sized two year old and her knees are bent at more than a 90 degree angle as she scoots along. I wish I had purchased it earlier as we'll probably only end up getting 6-12 months use out of it, but that's fine for the price we paid. I would definitely not recommend this product for any kid over 2 years old or 36 inches tall.
