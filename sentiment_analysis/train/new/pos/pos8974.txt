We bought this mirror because our almost 3-month old son hates being on his tummy and lifting his head up.  He can do it, but he hates it.  If we use this mirror, it seems to help!  It's great because it stands on its own, has toys on the side that baby can grab onto, and the musical fish is genius - the sounds usually persuade him to crane his head up.  The only thing I dislike about it is that the black fabric of the penguin attracts dog hair like the plague.  Overall it is a great product for tummy time, and playtime in general.  Something about those mirrors, babies love them!!
