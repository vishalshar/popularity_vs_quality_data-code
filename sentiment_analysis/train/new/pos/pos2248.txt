My kindergartener loves this back pack.  It fits her well and is just large enough for her take-home folder, which measures just under 9.5"x12".  Her lunch box also fits nicely and there's enough room left over for her jacket.  She has used it for over a week and I haven't noticed any quality issues.  I would recommend this for a gradeschooler who doesn't need a huge back pack but still needs to be able to fit a large folder.
