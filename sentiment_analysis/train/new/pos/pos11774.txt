These were just what I needed to replace the lost ones for my "grid system". They fit fine, and are secure (as in I needed something to tap them to come off when I moved the grid). Since it is easy to lose these when the grid is in storage (such as in my black hole of a garage) it is great that they can be replaced at a reasonable price.
