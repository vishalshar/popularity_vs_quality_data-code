My daughter is obsessed with these blankets. At our local store these are $45, so I thought this might be of lesser quality. It is the same one, but for half the price. For us it was important to air dry them to keep their softness, but after five years of heavy use her old one was looking a bit rough despite the care we took. The satin unravels after awhile and it just isn't as soft. But I chalk that up to being snuggled with daily and every single night. Seriously kids love these things, so much so that at times it is annoying.
