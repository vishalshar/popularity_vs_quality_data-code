This is a good quality base and it came in looking just as white as in the picture. I ordered this as an extra base for my infant maxi cosi prezi car set because I use multiple vehicles. I would recommend this item to others who want an easier time transporting a baby from vehicle to vehicle without having to purchase a complete 2nd one. I love how easy it locks in and out of place; a major plus for a new mothers back and tummy.
