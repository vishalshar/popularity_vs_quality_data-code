This item is brilliant.  I have used it as a temporary crib outside of the nursery, a bassinet in our bedroom, and we have brought it with us to travel as it's much smaller and lighter than the pack and play.  The Graco sheets that are designed for it though are pretty thin and low quality.  Other sheets are hard to find for it but I found that Carters changing pad covers are perfect. They fit well and are really soft.I hope this helps. If it did, vote my review as helpful to pay it forward to others.Cheers!Here is the link to the carters cover.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016LVEGQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0016LVEGQ&linkCode=as2&tag=stupisms-20
