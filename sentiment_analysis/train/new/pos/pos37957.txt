I'm really liking this necklace!  It's lighter than a silicone necklace, which is nice, and I like that it's natural for my little one.  My baby is not quite to teething, but has already started to grab this and play with it, so I'm looking forward to some pretty good munching.  It's a good size and shape for baby's hands and mouth.  I've even worn this to work as a part of my outfit, since I do really like the look and it's not immediately obvious that it's for teething.  I've received a few compliments on it so far!
