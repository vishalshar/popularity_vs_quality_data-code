Great teether. I was originally turned off by the high price of this in comparison to others on the teethers on the market for a fraction of the cost. As soon as I removed this teether from the package my nearly 7 month old was intrigued. She reached for it and immediately pulled it to her mouth. She seemed to especially like to "cool" metal stainless steel disc part.On the package it says that you can cool the teether in cool water or the fridge, I have not tried this yet. Maybe for the warmer summer months or when her gums really start to hurt.Later that night, she continued to play with the toy and continues to gravitate towards it.
