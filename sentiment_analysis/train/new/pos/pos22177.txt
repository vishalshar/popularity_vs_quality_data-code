Had this lunchbox for about a month. It is extremely well made and designed.Specifically, the lid opens right back (so no flopping back when you let go). The integrated compartments are very useful and can be individually removed for larger items or washing.It was rather expensive, had to pay in $us plus shipping but I think it's worth the extra money.
