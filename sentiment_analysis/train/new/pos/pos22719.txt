Ok. So we bought this and read all the previous comments on how the adhesives didn't last long.First, we installed it opposite wall of from the faucet so there's minimal water contact. It's still above tub and we figured that our kid didn't need to necessarily get it themselves so it doesn't have to be within their reach. It lasted fine. Then we moved.At the new house our bathtub doesn't have a shower above the faucet so this time we installed it above the faucet. And because my wife threw out the original adhesives while we were in processing of moving, so we got those 3M removable adhesives for hooks and such to install the toy organizer. Granted we had to use 7 of those stickers, it's holding fine and actually you really got to yank it to try to remove it.Bottom line, just install it away from the shower heads and we think it will hold like ours does. It's a great bath toy organizer to prevent water molds in toys and such.
