This product has done very well for us in what has now been over a year of use. It washes out very easily if there are ever any spills (and let's face it, all toddlers spill!). I wash ours inside and outside with dish soap with no problems. I will say this, we don't use the container it came with very often. Because of the shape of the top compartment, which is tapered a little at the top, I find sippy cups work better in the bottom compartment, laid sideways. I got a different sandwich container to put in the top with a cold pack. I wish it was just a TAD bit bigger, but overall it's been great. I have a small kid with a small appetite, though, so if yours is a big eater you might want a bigger lunchbox.
