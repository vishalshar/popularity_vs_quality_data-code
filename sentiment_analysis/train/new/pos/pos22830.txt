As others indicate it can be prone to tipping, but any conscientious parent who is there supervising their child's entry and exit from the vehicle should have no problem guiding them through it the first few times without incident. The seat fits well and is fairly lightweight. It has enough cushioning and can support a lower weight/height threshold than the normal 40 inch/40 lbs rule. Worked perfectly for us when we took it on the plane and could fit underneath the seat in front of us.
