My 7 month old likes this toy, it's not in his top faves but he likes the music and sounds it makes and of course loves to chew on it. We have had it for several months now and it's still going strong. The reason I knocked off one star is because it's very sensitive and doesn't have an on/off switch which is very annoying flaw. I have to set it somewhere it won't get bumped or moved just in case the baby is sleeping because it has woken him up before- and a woken up baby is a big pain in the rear. I was tempted to give it only 3 stars because of that, but it's a good toy and my kiddo likes it so we will leave it at 4. If I knew that ahead of time I may not have purchased it but we will keep it around for now. Also want to add sometimes he gets it around his arm and has to have help getting it off, it's not tight on his arm and doesn't hurt him at all but seems to annoy him that he can't get it in his mouth anymore, lol, but this happens occasionally with any ring toys. As long as you have a safe, movement-free place to set it I'd say go ahead and get it.
