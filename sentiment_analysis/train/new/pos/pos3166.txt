I absolutely love these blankets. I first found them almost two years ago. I found them at tjmaxx for really cheap a 5 pack for about 16 dollars. Never seen them again in any stores, looked everywhere. They are very durable, my daughter drags it everywhere. Great in the washer, the tag stays on which is most important in my house.
