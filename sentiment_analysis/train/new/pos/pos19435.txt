We wanted a safe mirror for our little one to play with (5 months).  This fits the bill perfectly.  There are a few things that might be minor annoyances, but are good for him.1st pro/con: it folds flat/it collapses!  This totally depends on your point of view!  Those medium blue colored triangles are simply flaps of fabric.  This is great for storage, but... I honestly thought it might be a pillow wedge thing, and it isn't.  There isn't anything interesting on the second side either.  (and there is no third side of the triangle.  And yes, I recognize that the flaps are technically two additional sides... just go with it!)2nd pro/con: it has taggies!  Each of my children has LOVED tags on their toys.  Steiff? Tag in ear? nom nom nom!  Cheap plush with tag?  nom nom nom!  Random shirt from the laundry with tag? NOM NOM!  So I knew that the Taggies concept would likely be tag overload, but in a good way.  However...I noticed it 8 years ago, and it's true for all the subsequent children, too.  No matter how many tags, they will ALWAYS go for the product tag.  The one that is a little different, that isn't the ribbon.  It usually has the washing instructions on it.  That tag gets the most chewing.3rd pro/con!  It's lightweight!  So, my 5 month old can manipulate the whole thing.  And my 5 month old can easily knock it over and lose interest.  This kinda cycles back to the fold flat thing.  A casual swipe and it's folded flat.  Out of sight out of... SQUIRREL!Finally: the "seahorse" on the left of the mirror has the crunchy sound.  The fish on the top right has a quiet rattler in it.  The green whale at the bottom right has a squeaker that my 5 month old cannot manipulate in it.  But hey, it gives me something to do.
