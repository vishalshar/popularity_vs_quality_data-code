This product is exactly as described - a car seat COVER that fits most STANDARD car seats!  My 2 year old was devastated when her older twin brothers got new booster seats and she didn't get a new seat for the car.  Since she is a huge Dora fan I got this cover, put it on her seat and voila, she thinks she has a new seat and is so excited every time she gets to sit in her new Dora seat!  We have the Britax Advocate which is a huge, oddly shaped car seat.  I was able to make the cover fit by just covering the inside of the back of the seat and then it fit fine on the bottom of the seat.  It will not cover the entire back of the seat but it works and looks fine.  The material is thin but for the price I wasn't expecting anything more.  I am satisfied with the cover and my daughter loves it.  Her excitement over having Dora on her car seat made it worth every penny!
