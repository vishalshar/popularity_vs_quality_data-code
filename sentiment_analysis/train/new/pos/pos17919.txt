I love this ice pack for keeping my breast milk cold!Pros: It does last for about 12 hours. The only "fyi" is that depending on the position of the ice pack to the bottles,  some bottles will be colder than others. Also note that after about 9 hours or so, the ice pack may leak a little water, but nothing substantial or damaging to my ice cooler bags.How I use this ice pack:1) I use this ice pack with my Medela SymphonyÂ® Cooler Carrier Black - Medela 37002 to store 4 5oz breast bottles. I leave to work around 8 am and arrive home around 6. The milk I pump at work remains cold all that time and once I arrive home, I place the milk in the refrigerator.2)  I also use this ice pack with my Medela breastmilk cooler set for leaving breastmilk/formula overnight next to my bed. This really helps me avoid having to get up at the night to go to the kitchen and because the milk is not as cold as leaving it in the refrigerator, my infant has an easier time consuming the milk.3) You can take this icepack with you when traveling via airplaneThe product is exactly as pictured.
