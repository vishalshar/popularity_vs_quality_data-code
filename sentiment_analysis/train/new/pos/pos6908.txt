After my DS dropped all 3 pacifiers we had when we went out, we bought this Paci Bungee to hold onto his pacifiers. This bungee is made of silicone and so it is very easy to wash. However, the clip does not close on very thin items (I uploaded a photos) (I removed the photo because this was defect... see update below) . The end that connects to the pacifier is a nylon cord which can be attached to any pacifier. Being able to attach to any type of pacifier is great since not all pacifiers holders work with all pacifiers.PROS:1. Can be attached to any style pacifier backing2. Easy to washCONS:Cannot be attached to very thin articles of clothing (this apparently was a defect, see update below)Update 01 April 2012After posting my initial review, which was by no means a negative review of the product, the president of the company left a Comment indicating that i may have a defective clip which was my only complaint about the product. The company offered to send me a new one and indeed the clip was fine on the replacement. Now I have changed my rating from a four to a five. I wish all companies were concerned about standing behind their product as this company surely does and does it proactively to boot.In addition... I have found an additional use for this pacifier clip, I have found that I can also attach light toys that have a loop for the nylon cord to attach to. This way I don't have to keep washing the toys that fall on the floor either. I also fully acknowledge that I am using it not for it's intended use when I use it to attach to toys.
