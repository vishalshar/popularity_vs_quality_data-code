I absolutely LOVE this necklace! My daughter is now 7 months old and wants to chew on everything, so this necklace is GREAT for when I'm holding her! She loves both the bigger and smaller beads. I noticed other reviewers mentioning how the necklace smells. It did smell when I first got it, but after I washed it and it sat out for a couple days, I didn't notice the smell anymore. You can't really get around silicone having that "smell." Some reviewers pointed out the necklace was "too chunky" or "heavy" but I don't feel that way at all! I have gotten several compliments on it, so no complaints here! Very happy with it :)
