Wow! This beats the genie any day of the week!We just switched from disposables to cloth diapers, a friend suggested the Dekor for cloth - and I'm so glad she did!  I love that the lid opens hands free, so I can pull the liner from my diaper and simply slide both pocket & liner into the bag.  We use the Planet wise wet bags, rather than the Dekor bags the bin came with - (if you go that route, order an extra so you can be washing one and using the other).  The bag fits perfectly inside the Dekor liner and creates no friction  or problems with use of the Dekor system.A feature I'm not using yet - but will appreciate when my little guy is a little older and getting into everything... is the little lock on the flap.  I can lock it, he won't be able to add his toys and other treasures to the diaper bag... that is an excellent feature.  Future 'missing phones / keys / remotes will not be found in the diaper pail - as the little lock makes it kid proof!  (whew!)I've been using the diaper genie for 6 months with my disposable diapers... a great system, however if I had know about the  Dekor... I would have preferred this bin for my disposables as well.  (Just my preference).While we use reusable wet bags - I do like that the Dekor liners pull thru and can be cut as needed.  As other diaper pails, the bottom opens up and there is a bag cutter attached inside - clever!We are really happy with our purchase, and would suggest it to anyone in the business of diapering. (I empty ours every 2-3 days and have never detected an odour from it).  This is a very well thought out pail - and you are really getting value for your dollar.
