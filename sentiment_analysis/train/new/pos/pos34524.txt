This product helped my newborn son and I to get started breastfeeding from his first day here.  I pumped in the hospital to help my milk come in and once it did at home I was glad I had my own pump.  It made nursing easier the first few days if I pumped for 5 minutes first and then breastfed.  I am a medical student and this pump is a necessity for when I return back to school fulltime.  BUT I recommend it even for women who are not planning on being away from home but want to breastfeed...mainly because it has been a great bonding experience for my husband to feed our son a bottle once every evening and we didn't have to switch to formula for him to have this experience.  4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it came with a "holder" instead of having to buy it separately...You really can't do anything if you are pumping both sides at once.  Still, all in all a great product.
