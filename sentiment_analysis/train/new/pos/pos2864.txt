I adore these camis. I have 3 (two of this version and one full coverage) and I can't sing its praises enough. I keep telling everyone who is exclusively pumping about them. I spent quite some time trying to find something that was easier to use than a tube-style bra and yet could be worn out and about. I remember thinking one day that a cami for pumping would be perfect so I came on Amazon and found these. I wasn't sure about them, especially with a nearly $50 price tag, but decided to try one, and I'm so glad I did. I was a 38 DDD prior to having my baby in February and honestly have no idea what size I am now, but the XL fits just fine. The material is thick and the camis are very well made. After using them once, I immediately bought two more and wear them constantly. They look similar to a regular cami (only difference is really the gathering in the center) and they're incredibly comfortable. I wear them when I have to pump in the car and they cover everything very well.There's a lip at the bottom to hook the flange in and then a fabric split to support the sides of the flange and then the cami can be pulled back down to cover the top of the flange (it sounds way more complicated than it is). I also like being able to pump at work without having to practically undress. I'll likely be purchasing more because they're just so convenient, well-made and comfortable that it really doesn't make sense to wear anything else (at least for me).
