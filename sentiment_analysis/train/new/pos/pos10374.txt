I bought this pillow for my special needs son who is 5 and cannot sit up. I am always nervous about spending so much money on something that probably won't live up to our expectations but this pillow does!  My son is 5 and about 40 lbs and fits snug and comfy in the pillow. He can recline in it and watch tv perfectly. It snuggles him providing a lot of comfort. He fell asleep in it last night and slept the whole night through in it! The plush cover is soft and very comfortable. It zips on and off to wash it. The bottom has a large velcro strap which you can undo to make the pillow looser and flatter at the bottom. When you strap it up it makes the pillow have more of a hollow in the center for snuggling down into for little ones. Also, what I couldn't tell in the picture is that the bottom center of the pillow has a white stretchy material so the kids are not on the carpet or hardwood floor. I highly recommend this pillow!
