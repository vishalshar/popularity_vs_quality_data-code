We bought two boosters for my daughter: this one, and a Graco for our second vehicle, and are honestly very pleased with both of them.  This one was a little bit lower priced but I think it is just as good a seat as the Graco.  In fact, the cupholders are better because of the additional space (I think they're called snackholders).  We also have taken it on a long trip and my daughter seemed comfortable the whole time.  She loves the cute design; my husband and I love how easy it was to put together, install and adjust to her growing height.  It hasn't needed washing yet but I love that the cover is machine washable, and seems like it will be easy to remove.
