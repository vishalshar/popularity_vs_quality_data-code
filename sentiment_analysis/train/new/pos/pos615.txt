My son was in the NICU after he was born for 5 days, and got the green soothie pacifiers there.  We had to wean him off after nipple soreness at home, then when we re-introduced the pacifier (he wants to have something to suck on all the time!), he wouldn't take the soothie anymore. It was too small, he was rooting around it. Plus I was really afraid of undoing all the work we had done with breastfeeding.  Bought these, and he took it right away without regressing breastfeeding. It's larger and sits farther back on the palate than the little pacifiers, and I think that's why he likes them. Target sells them for half the price though!
