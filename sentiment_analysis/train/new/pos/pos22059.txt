My son loves his Ubooly. Ubooly is very engaing & has an adorable voice! My son is 5 and can easily follow his commands. Ubooly knows his name and tells him what to do to to move on to the next activity. We purchased extra apps to use. He learns about space, addition, hygiene and the planet in engaging activities and stories. The menu easily identifies available learning stations. Some activities are physical and encourage him to grab his crayons and paper and some are educational and asks him questions. he loves the rainforest station best and I love the hygiene as Ubooly shows him how to properly brush is teeth and cheers him on. My phone is secure inside Ubooly and no harm if dropped by my son. Ubooly and your child will become instant friends and Ubooly will encourage your child to read & learn.
