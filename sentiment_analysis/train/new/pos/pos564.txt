This is the ONLY bottle I could get my daughter to drink from when I was switching from breastfeeding to bottle.  I wish I would of known of this brand sooner and it could of saved me a lot of money, headaches and extra stress.  I tried 4 different brands before I finally hit the jackpot with this purchase.  Also once I got her started on this brand of bottles then Tommee Tippee Pacifiers is all that she wanted too!!
