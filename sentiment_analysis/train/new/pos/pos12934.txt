This serves its intended use perfectly - to provide a way to attach a "pop top" package of wipes to a stroller/car seat/car seat headrest, diaper bag strap etc. for easy access. It will hold a completely new, full "pop top" style package of wipes (I've used Pampers and Huggies). Not sure why people think the blue lid comes with it - I guess since I use Pampers wipes, I recognized the lid.  To be honest, I find it easier to use pop top packages on the go than to constantly refill a much thinner portable wipe holder from my stash of wipes in the house. Therefore, this item is perfect in transforming a pop top package into something that can be more easily accessed on the go.
