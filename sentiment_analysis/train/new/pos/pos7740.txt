I was looking for a larger tub for my 11 month old because he no longer fit in the Babysrus infant to toddler tub and this is exactly what I had in mind. He's already too big for the first two stages so I was only able to try it in toddler mode. I love how you can take out the plastic insert for unstable sitters and you are left with a roomy tub. I was also pleasantly surprised that even when he was moving around he did not slip at all. He loves the little cups that are included, especially the turtle with holes. He was belly laughing when I held it up for a shower effect. The hook for hanging the tub to dry is very practical. No more leaving it in the bathtub upside down and having to tuck it away in awkward places in between uses. My only complaint is a minor one: it was difficult to attach the legs because there's no way to tell if the screws are aligned, but I was able to do it with a little determination. Still the best tub ever!
