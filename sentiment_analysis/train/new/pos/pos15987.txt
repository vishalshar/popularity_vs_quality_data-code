We bought this playard because after looking at the different ones in stores this was the only one that had the diaper changing table supported on all four corners instead of just two corners. We expected and got a big baby and two and a half months and fifteen pounds later we still use it for practically every diaper change. The playard itself is incredibly stable so we feel really safe putting our baby in it. The only downside is that it is kind of bulky and heavy so it is not as portable as some of the other models out there, but we just figure that is the trade off for the kind of stablility the Chicco offers and wouldn't buy a different one if we could go back and do it over.
