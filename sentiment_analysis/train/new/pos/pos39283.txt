I bought them for my baby to use when she turned 8 months old. These spoons made from flexible yet durable BPA and phthalate free plastic, which non toxic materials are safe for my baby. The special handle is ergonomically designed are very comfortable in your hand when using them. The spoon is just the right size and shape for my baby's little mouth. It's the perfect length, depth, shape and grip, these spoons are wonderful compared to the other ones I had. Furthermore, each set includes six spoons with attractive and bright colors. These spoons are durable and very inexpensive. Would buy again and would recommend to anyone who have little baby!
