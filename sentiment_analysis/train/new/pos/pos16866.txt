I'm a full time working mom, and I pump 3-4 times a day at work. The most absolute best part about this product is the time you save when you use it. There is NO undressing. Just lift your shirt, let down your bra snaps (if you use a nursing bra, which I suggest) and hook it on over your clothing. Way better and way easier than any pumping "bra" that is out there.Pro's:Goes over your clothesAllows for breast massaging and compressions, which is mandatory for a serious pumper (you can't do this with a regular pumping bra).One size fits out. No fidgeting with the size once you have it set for you.Easy to storeSaves timeAllows you to to remain fairly modest while pumping.The list can go on...Con's:It takes a short time in the beginning to learn how it works. It comes with very simple instructions...read them!The metal clasps can become uncomfortable on the back of your neck if you do not adjust them to the "flat" side. Once you do this, you'll hardly feel them.It is a pretty simple design, and you could prob make your own. But for $10, its worth the time and energy NOT to, and to just buy.If you are a serious working mom who pumps...skip out on the fancy patterned pumping bra and buy this handy contraption. You'll be glad you did!
