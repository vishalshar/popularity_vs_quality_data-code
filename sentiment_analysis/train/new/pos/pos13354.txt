We bought this for our child who had colic and it worked well - in the way that if you put the baby in the crib when she is asleep the soother kept her sleeping; however, if the baby is wide awake, crying and/or agited it will not put her to sleep. We kept vibrating unit under the matress and the unit on the crib rail and worked without any problem. It does have randon brakes and sometimes it takes a long, unexpected break and the baby may wake up a little but will fall back to sleep again. It works only for 10 minutes at a time so you need to watch out if need be for another run to start it again. We bought the "SleepTight" as well and found out that is much louder and is basically just an engine that runs continuosly but not very useful. Probably the intermittent run of the crib soother is more closer to the car drive mode. Definitely one of the most useful items we bought; we are using it even now when she doesn't have colic to put her to sleep. I would definitely recommend it.
