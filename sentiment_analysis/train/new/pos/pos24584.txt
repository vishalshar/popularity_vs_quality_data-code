I'm embarrassed to admit how many diaper bags I've owned in the last 3 years since we were expecting our first daughter, but after finding flaws with each of them, I finally decided to go ahead and try out the JJ Cole Caprice. We are expecting our second baby in April and plan to exclusively cloth diaper him as we did our daughter for the first year, meaning we need LOTS OF SPACE. We also need room for our toddler's snacks, sippy cup, diapers, tablet and random toys. Most diaper bags will not accommodate all of that; this will.I am able to fit my Contigo water bottle AND coffee mug snugly in one of the insulated pockets, with room for a bottle and sippy cup in the other. This is not something I've found possible with any other bag I've owned, and believe me, it's important. Easy access to my caffeine? I'm hooked.The quality seems very high, too, which surprises me at the price point. I bought the heather gray for $40. I half expected the material to be cheap and tacky looking in person, but it's not. It's wipable (woohoo!) and feels well constructed. Nice hardware and comfortable handles. The strap is a bit wide for my narrow shoulders but my husband is very broad shouldered and should love it; while I've enjoyed backpacks, our totally different sizes make them a pain to share because of the constant need to readjust straps. This bag has a good option for each of us.I can't wait for my son to arrive so I can switch over to using this regularly. I'll update my post if I find anything notable to say after some time has passed.
