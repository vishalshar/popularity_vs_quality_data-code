I have been looking for an item like this for my daughter since she's born. Many of them are soft foam like. This is the first I found that is not. My daughter is 6 month old. She's on the small side for her age. Her head is less than 50 percentiles. And she's really active so it's kinda hard to wash her head sometimes since she moves a lot. I was so excited to receive this so fast in the mail. It came unfolded in a nice plactic bag which is great because if it were folded, it might create a crease that might make it leak when used. I then tried it on my daughter right away. When I first tried it, it looked a bit loose and fell of so easily. I almost gave up. But I decided to give it another try when I was giving her a bath. I put through her head, just a little half way through her forehead and just push the back part all the way down to cover the whole head in the back. So this made it sitting just right on her head, right above the ears. I tried pouring water on her head. NO LEAK whatsoever. From time to time, there's a drop or two of water drip down her face or on the side of her face but that's still way better than getting all water in her eyes or ears. After you're done, you can just leave it to dry which is very fast. My daughter doesn't seem to mind it that much. She will try to pull it out sometimes but most of the times, she's distracted with the bath toys. And I try to finish her head first before shampooing the rest of the body so I can get this out of the way. Overall, I'm really satistfied with this purchase. And I can see it last it for many years to come because of the flexibility of the band. Good quality.
