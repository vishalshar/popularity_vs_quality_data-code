Our toddler loves bees, and she's been carrying around this little guy all day since she got him. She even takes him to bed- NO ONE goes to bed with her but her dolly. She's been sleeping with her dolly and the bee every night!Just one thing- he didn't come with wings. I cut out some plain white fabric wings and sowed them on before giving her the bee.He is also very machine washable and dryable- the fur doesn't even get matted. Put him in a pillowcase or a lingerie bag to keep the eyes from getting scratched.
