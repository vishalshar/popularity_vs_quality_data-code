When I first got these I was skeptical. I had been using the medela 27mm flange with some sizing issues. I had issues with suction and using them correctly but u watched a few videos and now I pretty much only use pumpin pals shields. I have normal sized breasts and I use large during the day and xl in the am when I am super full (I have low supply so I never get engorged or super full). I can't say if they increase pumping output because my supply has been low and I've done everything in the books to increase it and it just does not budge. They are pretty comfortable to use. I do wish the plastic was a little thinner. Also if you do breast compressions while you pump these are very difficult to do so because the way the flange is shaped. You end up pumping one while massaging the other then switching. Overall they are pretty good for pumpin. I don't think there is a perfect flange to pumping because let's face it pumping sucks (pun Intended) and nothing can change that.
