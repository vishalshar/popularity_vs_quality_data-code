I love this seat, I have one for each of my children. My four year old daughter, and my one year old son. The easy adjusting height cgange is great for different kids, love that the cup holder comes off, love the 3 diff options for the button that the straps hook into. LOVE the easy clear weight and height requirments, and the reclining feature. The one thing is if your putting more than one of these seats in a car or small suv def measure first or try them out before buying. I have a 2000 subaru forester and cannot fit an adult of third car seat in the back of my car, also if my car was ANY smaller I would be advised by a certified car seat inspector to get a different car seat because this one would be obstructed by the front seats pushing on it when they are slid back to give my husand room to sit...until its front facing anyway. Love it anyway, although not machine washable both this and the light brown and pink one my daughter have, spot clean perfectly, which is VERY important to me.
