This co-sleeper was really easy to put together and is great for the convenience of having a "smaller and portable" crib alternative.As for the co-sleeping feature, here is where I was somewhat disappointed:-It is not recommended for beds that extend beyond the mattress (and mine is). Bad on me for not researching further.-Attaching this to your bed, as the instructions suggest, will make it easy for you to turn to your side and reach your baby at night BUT it will be EXTREMELY HARD for you to get out of bed (which you will have to for diaper changes!), because you can't simply turn and get up. You'd have the scoot down past the crib in order to get up. If you had a c-section, you will definitely not be able to do that for at least 3 weeks when you gain some core strength.I ended up having it next to my bed, unattached, and I have to push it away when I need to get up - which is a bit hard to do if you have carpet.- You can't just roll to your side and pick your baby up. You have to sit up, and it's still hard to pick baby up from your side. I always have to push the sleeper away from my bed so I can pick the baby up.After all, I think for being a first time mom, I didn't think of all the challenges getting this thing to work "perfectly" like in my idea.If I had known better, or could give advice to the new moms out there, just get a Pack N Play (if you have space in your bedroom). It is just as portable, and you can use for a lot longer as your baby grows (the co-sleep would be too small in 3-6 months!). You can even buy the Pack N Play with a diaper station option, so you don't have to go too far for diaper changes!
