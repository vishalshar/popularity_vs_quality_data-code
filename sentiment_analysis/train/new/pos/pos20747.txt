I love this bib for its ability to hold its shape and truly catch most of the food my son drops while eating. Some of the other kind, the coated-cloth bibs, have a pocket that basically lays flat and isn't very effective at all. This one sticks out plenty and does its job. The material is easy to clean, quick-drying, and rolls up to stick in the diaper bag. The only downside for me is with the width at the top of the chest, and the stiffness of the material, it does prevent my son from using his arms to the fullest during eating. The sides of the bib kind of press into his upper arms when he tries to reach forward, and he has to move a little awkwardly to make up for it. Overall though he does fine.
