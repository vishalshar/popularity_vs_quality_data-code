As the other reviewers have stated, this is a gorgeous crib. We researched many cribs, and as a petite mom, I was looking for something on the lower end with multiple mattress heights. Of course, we also needed the crib to be safe from a chemical and paint perspective, while meeting our aesthetic and budgetary needs. Not exactly a short order! The Robin crib ended up being a great solution for us. It looks beautiful and we plan to buy the conversion kit later on.Have to say I was pretty disappointed in delivery, however. The box came with a gaping hole in the bottom, through which we lost about half the screws and bolts. Oeuf was great and sent us a new package -- but even that didn't have the right number of parts! In the end we were able to assemble the crib using both parts packages, but are still waiting on a few more from Oeuf to cover holes, etc.I order from Amazon often, and this was the first time I experienced a problem with packaging.
