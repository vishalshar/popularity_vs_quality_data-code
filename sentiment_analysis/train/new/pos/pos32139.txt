I bought these bibs about six months ago for my 17 month old twins.  I basically bought them because they had the silicone pocket and they were cute.  I also had the Tommy  Tippee silicone bibs.  I like these better.  The silicone on these bibs is easier to clean and stains less.  My Tommy Tippee bibs are now peeling where the silicone creases and they are all stained.  My ulubulu bibs still looks brand new.There are some minor things I dislike about these bibs.  First, the neck hook is kind of hard to put on.  That is good and bad.  It's bad for me since I'm putting the bibs on my toddlers... although I quickly got used to it.  It is good because my boys cannot take the bib off.  The neck hole is a bit larger than needed.  There are times where their shirts still gets messy at the top since the bib has such a big neck hole.  The surface area of this bib is a bit smaller than other brands, but it hasn't caused me any problems.  Overall... I love this bib.  I would buy it all over again.
