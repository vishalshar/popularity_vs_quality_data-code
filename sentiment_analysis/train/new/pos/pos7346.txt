I absolutely love these dish washer baskets for these bottles!  I just started using Dr. Brown's bottles.  My husband bought one at the super market in town to try with our newborn.  The bottle worked great but was sort of a pain to clean.  There are several pieces to each bottle.  I used the Munchkin Dish Washer Basket that I had for my other bottles but it really did not hold the bottle pieces like they need to be held to really get clean.These Dr. Brown's Dish Washer Baskets are awesome for these bottles!!  LOL...they keep all of the pieces together.  I bought 2 of them and they fit on one side of my dish washer and the bottles stand next to the baskets.  2 baskets clean 6 bottles....but I may need 2 more because I find myself washing a tiny load of dishes just to get clean bottles.I included a picture because I have seen some of the reviews complaining about the baskets taking up too much room.  They are made to stand up on end so the water gets sprayed up through all of the pieces and they get very clean!  They say "This Side Up" on the top so you place them in the dishwasher correctly.It's a no brainer to me....THESE ARE AWESOME!!
