Ordered two of these for my small son who is now up to 45 lbs and is about 44 inches tall. They are easy to install and include removable and washable seat covers and arm rests and nice cup holders. The arm rests can be set to one of two positions and the entire unit is pretty stain resistant. The only thing not included is a latching hook from the back of the booster seat to one of the steel rings inside most models of car's rear seats. In the unlikely event that an accident caused a car to flip or roll, a hooking latch would enable the car seat to not come loose from back seat. Other than that, and these booster seats are just fine.
