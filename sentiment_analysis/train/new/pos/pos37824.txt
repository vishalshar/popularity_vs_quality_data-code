Having dealt with returns and warranty issues, I was not looking forward to calling Fisher Price about an issue I had with this product.  the transmitter and one receiver worked well, the other receiver would show interference once you walked out of the room the transmitter was in. I called Fisher Price, got through within minutes to a live person, and after walking me through some trouble shooting we determined it was a faulty receiver. She sent me a new one, and I didn't have to return the one that wasn't working, nor show any proof of purchase.  I will continue to buy from Fisher Price for that very reason.  all in all I am happy with the product, and would buy it again. I give it 4 stars for the "inconvenience" of having to get a new one, but the inconvenience was minor!
