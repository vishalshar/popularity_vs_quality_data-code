I swore I wouldn't own tons of "useless baby gadgets" and I hereby retract that statement.  Though, to be fair, this "baby gadget" is far from useless.After cheerfully handing my baby large chunks of food (yup, I'm THAT parent), loudly proclaiming my opposition to pureeing any sort of food, and having my horrified husband constantly finger-sweeping choke-sized chunks from the baby's mouth (them gums be pretty dang productive at choke-chunk-ifying food!), I finally relented (we won't discuss how reluctantly, something about "natural parenting" and "learning the choking reflex") and purchased on of these.And then, say, five bazillion more.1.  cloth nets suck (these are silicone, see #2).2.  these are super easy to clean.  I bought a cloth net thing to check that out (different product), and after picking brown banana bugers from it for far too long, I'd like to repeat:  easy to clean.3. Baby is officially less covered in a thick film of slobber-and-food mixture, so the baby is easy to clean4. Because of this product, I do not spend time pulverizing, then spooning carefully pulverized food into said baby's mouth** totally cool if you're into that, no judgement, just sayin'.5.  Baby's favorite toy.  New food + kidsme+ airplane= happy silence and less baby hate.  And really, don't we need less baby hate in the world?Conclusion:Kidsme + food = less food pollution and less baby hate**not that anyone EVER hates babies.win.
