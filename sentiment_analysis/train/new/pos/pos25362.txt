This kidco configure gate is worth every penny if you need to enclose and odd shaped space!  We needed to block off a hallway in our basement, but had uneven walls, and this gate works perfectly.  The installation was a little bit involved, since you have to screw the brackets into studs in the walls, but it only took about 20 minutes and we had it up.Some tips for installing the gate:1.  First, read through the entire instruction manual before you start.  The way the manual is structured, there are instructions in several languages in the front, and then reference pictures in the back.  If you read through the manual and flip back and forth until you understand the pictures before you start, it makes the installation go pretty smoothly.2.  Try to mount the brackets to studs in your walls.  Since you can configure the gate to any length/angle by changing the angle of each joint, try to configure it so that you can mount each bracket to a stud in the wall, so you don't have to worry about energetic kids pulling them out.3.  Try to configure the gate so that each joint is at least at a 10 degree angle.  If you put them straight across, the gate will flex a little bit.  It doesn't really affect the stability of the gate since it is anchored to the walls, but the flexing will go away if you angle each sectionOverall, this gate worked for enclosing our odd shaped space perfectly and I would highly recommend it!
