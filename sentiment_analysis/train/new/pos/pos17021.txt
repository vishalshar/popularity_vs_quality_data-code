Works well... if you want to bring more snacks with you, Talenti brand gelato @ the local grocery store comes in a plastic pint that is compatible with this lid as pointed out by a different Amazonian (see picture), so your extra snacks can travel with you in a $4.00 galato container that you get the bonus of enjoying first!The Bugles in my customer image are a joke by the way... please don't feed your toddler Buggles :)This mug doesn't spill at all (and it better not for the price!), but in the car seat there is still a pile of Cheerios or peas at the bottom of the car seat on a regular basis.  I can't believe the 'stuff the entire hand in the mouth' method doesn't work better!
