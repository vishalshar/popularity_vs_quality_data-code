We have a 1 year old and a 5 year old. When planning our trip to Disney World we knew that the 1 year old would require a stroller with the following items:- ability to recline for nap time- large canopy for blocking sun- food tray for eating snacks while walking around the park- easy folding for getting on and off of transport trams- storage for snacks, diaper bag, other items- place for the adults to put water bottles or other items- easily maneuverable for getting through crazy crowdsThat's a lot of "must have's"! We also wanted something that would allow for our 5 year old to take a break when needed. It was also nice to help contain him in heavy crowd areas.This stroller did it all! Both of my boys loved riding around in it and I never had a single problem with the stroller. The basket is big and whatever we could not fit below we hung from the back bar. The side pockets in the bottom bag is also nice for getting at things quickly. I could push the stroller and turn corners by only pushing with one hand it worked so well. We also looked at the Joovy Ergo stroller but felt it was too large to handle and not allowing the baby to recline was a deal breaker. Long days at parks mean the baby has to have a place to take a nap at some point. I found the shade helped a lot but I also used a light blanket (aden and anais swaddle blankets are perfect) over it as well to help block breezes and other distractions. My older son was jealous of the cool "fort" that it created.We also purchased the sun cover and the rain cover. Neither of which we ended up using but do fit nicely on the stroller.The stroller was great for traveling through the airport as well and was simple to fold and open with one hand.Overall I would recommend this to anyone with two children especially for traveling through big parks like Disney World.
