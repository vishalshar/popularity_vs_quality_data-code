I don't know what it is, but every baby I know who has one of these adopts this as their go to security object. My 13 month old son loves this blanket. If there were only room for three of us in the life raft, I think I'd be waving to my wife and son and this damn blanket from the sinking ship. I'd be tempted to try to enumerate all the great things about this, but frankly, I have no idea why babies love these. It's soft, but I'm guessing there's more to it than that, and we'll just have to wait until somebody makes one of those speaking gadgets for babies that they had for the dogs in "Up" before we'll really know what the deal is.But I can say this: for the love of God get at least three. You'll need some in reserve, because eventually one will get barfed on or lost and you'll be really glad when your child's security object needs are still able to be met with nothing more than a quick little switcheroo. You may need to rotate in the second and third string blankies for a while to get them all smelling like you. That way, when the need truly strikes, the blankie you call in from the bullpen will not smell like the factory. My kid doesn't seem to care, but I've heard that some babies are not so easily fooled.
