This seat is awesome.  It looks modern in our house and my son looks comfortable when he's in it.  My son is 10 months old now and we're not using the straps yet.  Not sure if we'll need to because it seems like if you put the tray back to his chest he shouldn't be able to get out anyway.  We'll find out someday.  Some negatives about it is when I go to put my son in the seat and go to install and slide back the tray, I have to be careful not to pinch his fingers or arm in either the connection spot or when sliding the tray back his arm can get pinned between the tray and the back of the seat.  I found that there are two widths you can set the tray at.  If I leave the tray in the farthest out position, I can put him in the seat with the tray attached and just scoot the tray one click closer to him.  Even though it doesn't have wheels, I don't find it very hard to slide it around anyway.  I hope one day he'll still like it when he's older.
