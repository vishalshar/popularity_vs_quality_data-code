This is the best swing ever!Ours is hanging outside.We live in the hot desert and the fabric seat allows for swinging even in the hottest part of the day -- no plastic or metal seats burning legs and bottoms.The seat is weighted and cushioned and is comfortable to sit in.It is stable and well-balanced:  the child feels secure.The colors are bright and happy.Haba excels when it comes to children's toys.
