Our youngest son is very sensitive to the sunlight in his face and the suction cup shades just don't cut it. This was PERFECT! It attaches to the window (with about 45 min of work to trim and fit) and we put the window up and down frequently without any problems!! There were a few wrinles and creases in the shade to begin with, but after a few days and some time in the sun, the wrinkles relaxed and they are gone now!! We have had this on for months without any problem and it blocks the sun just enough for him. It was a little difficult to adjust to the shade in the beginning when checking my blind spot, but I don't even notice it now!! I HIGH RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR PARENTS OF LITTLE ONES!!
