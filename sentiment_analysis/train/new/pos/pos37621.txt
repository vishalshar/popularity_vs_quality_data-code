So I was skeptical to buy this for my 2007 Bugaboo Bee after reading a review of someone who stated that it did not work and was wobbly. Well I decided to give it a try anyway and it is compatible with my Maxi Cosi Mico AP. If anything is a little wobbly, it's the connection from the adapter to the carseat itself however it is minimal and I feel that is secure and safe for my little one. I am so excited about the convenience of this product and that I no longer have to wake my baby to transfer him to the stroller!
