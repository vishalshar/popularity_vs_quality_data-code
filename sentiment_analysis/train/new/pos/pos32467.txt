I have a large Delta Play Time Jungle Ricking Bassinet and the piece of foam that came with it was totally unacceptable as a surface for a little baby (or anybody) to lie on. Babies need mattresses that are firm for support to their little backs but at the same time not hard and uncomfortable. The foam that came with bassinet never stretched out fully in the bassinet but instead bunched up and created an uneven surface for my baby to lie on.I ordered a mattress pad from another seller on Amazon but unfortunately despite having an oval mattress pad displayed as their one and only product image, they sent me a rectangular pad!Well of course I returned it but I was still without a proper mattress for my baby UNTIL I found the Cub Club product here! At less than half the price of the other offering, this pad more than satisfied my desires for my baby. I now have the perfect bassinet and sleeping is now a lot more comfortable for my baby!
