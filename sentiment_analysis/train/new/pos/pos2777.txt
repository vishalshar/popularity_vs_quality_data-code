Got this gate extension for the KidCo gate we bought six years ago for my first daughter. Fit perfectly with the original gate. Also fits perfectly and snugly into the 47.5in doorway space in our living room. Didn't get some of the other gates because the reviews commented on how the fit isn't right if you're more than 46in and less than 48in. Has a slight amount of "wiggle" at the attachment joint between the gate and extension, but the whole thing is very sturdy. My 10 month old pulls up to stand supported on it and we have no worry it will tip over or come loose. One thing...the tension bolts do tend to loosen over a few weeks, but all you need to do is re-tighten them from time to time and it's fine. You can even do this with your fingers most of the time. We are very happy with this gate.
