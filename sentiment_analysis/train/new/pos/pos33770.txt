We bought this seat for my car (secondary) and a Britax Marathon for my husband's car (primary).  The Britax had some advantages: nicer padding, easier growth adjustments, and easier Latch clip release. However, one of the complaint of this seat was that the straps twist up and we have had just as much problems with the expensive seat.  Also, the straps on this one loosen significantly when getting the child in and out, which is great when you are trying to get a squiggly toddler into it.  The Britax only loosen about 1/2".  Some reviewers complained that it was difficult to tighten the seat into the latch, but that didn't seem to be a problem for me and it fits OK rear-facing behind the driver seat of a prius (though the driver seat is fairly far forward so it wouldn't work there for a tall driver: >5'7").  For the price and difference in features, we now wish we had bought 2 of these instead of the other expensive one.
