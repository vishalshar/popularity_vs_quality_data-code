I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  She absolutely loved it.  But after the first recharge, it stopped working (similar to many other complaints).  So I was about to return for refund when I happened to come across the users manual.  It turns out there is a very small reset button on the bottom of the device.  The manual says to use a paper clip to press, but it required something more narrow, like a pin.  When pressed, the toy went back to normal.  I don't know why the manufacturer hasn't made it more obvious - like placing a sticker on the forehead...Hurray!  It is a very nice toy otherwise, holds a long charge, and as I mentioned, my daughter loves it, especially the changing colors.
