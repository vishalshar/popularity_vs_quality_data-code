I purchased this changing pad cover to coordinate with some other Carters products and ladybug stuff from Tar-get.  The cover matched perfectly and feels softer than a teddy bear.  Cover survived its first wash and retained its softness.  Love, love, love!Update: this changing cover also perfectly fits Graco Travel Lite Pack n' Play.  According to reviews, the smaller bassinet size had proven challenging to find a cover, some even suggested a pillowcase.  However, these changing covers fit amazingly and are super soft. We plan to use the small pack n play for first two weeks in the evening, and slowly transition her to the crib during the day.
