This is the cutest nursery lamp ever!  I am so happy I got it, it looks just as cute if not cuter in person and arrived in perfect condition.  I was worried at first because when I put the lampshade on, I could see the top of the bulb sticking out and it looked weird. But then my husband looked at it, flipped the lampshade upside down and tada, it looked just like it does in the picture with the bulb perfectly covered. The amount of light it emits is bright enough to light up the room too.  I highly recommend this lamp, it's so very cute and the perfect addition to any little boy's nursery.
