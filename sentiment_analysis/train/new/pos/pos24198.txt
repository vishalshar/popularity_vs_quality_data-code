my kids and i love the sili squeeze! i have tried other reusable pouches but not one of those brands compares to the sili squeeze. they are easy to fill and easy to wash. they are extremely durable and seem to be able to last a long time and withstand daily use while still looking brand new! i also like how the cap is attached with an elastic-like string so i never have to dig through drawers looking for the lid before i run ot of the house. i love taking them with us any time i know my daughter will have a healthy homemade snack that costs pennies instead of the expensive store bought kind. and i love love that they do not leak or pop open! even if they are tossed in a tote or bag. the only thing preventing me from giving it a full 5 stars is it is sometimes hard for my 3 year old to get the last bite or two out of the silli squeeze. my 7 year old has trouble too, though not as much. over all i would absolutly recommend these to any mom i know and will be buying two more!
