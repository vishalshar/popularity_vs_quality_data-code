Never had a body pillow before and thought I'd try it since just diagnosed with DISH disease and fibromyalgia.  This is a very large pillow (obviously) but it stays in place and basically took up my side of the bed and did not disturb my husband's side at all.  It is a nice medium firm, and allows you to nestle in and feel all cozy.  It seemed like a quality pillow to me, and the head area kept my neck at a nice level.  Unfortunately I returned it because although it was comfy I just could not sleep when using this.  I tried it for 1 week and no improvement.  I'm giving a good review because I think it's just my body/mind, and nothing wrong with the pillow.  I would recommend trying it because if my mind would've accepted it I think I would've been happy with it!  :)
