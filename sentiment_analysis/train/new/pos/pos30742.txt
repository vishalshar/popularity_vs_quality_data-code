If you are someone like me that barely makes 1-2 oz per pump per breast these bottles are perfect to use with your Medela pump. It was so much convenient to use them more than the 6 oz bottles where the mere sight of seeing 0.5 oz or 1 oz in a 6 oz bottle will disappoint you. I also highly recommend it for carrying around milk in diaper bags. The lids are very secure and you will never have to worry about spilled milk. I used them in conjunction with 4 oz bottles and basically these were used to pour extra milk if my LO was not content with his feed. They were perfect size to thaw and use and less stress of getting wasted.
