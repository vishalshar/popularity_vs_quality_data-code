I use the Prince Lionheart Hot and Cold Gel Packs with my Pyrex Portable container for transporting food when it won't be served right away.  I was unable to find the exact duplicate of the hot and cold packs that came with the Pyrex Portable container (one was lost, the other burst in the microwave) .  I like that these gel packs can be used for both hot and cold.  It only takes 45 seconds to heat the gel packs in the microwave.  Both packs fit perfectly into the Pyrex portable thermal container which can be used for dishes up to 9" x 13".  They kept the food hot for 3 hours.  I haven't used them in a frozen state yet. The Gel Packs arrived within a week after I ordered them.  The instructions for use are concise and easy to follow.
