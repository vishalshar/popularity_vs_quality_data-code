As grandparents we only need our cabinets and drawers to lock when we have our little grandson over.  After spending the last year constantly  removing and reinstalling the standard child safety latches, these things are a godsend. The fact that you can simply switch them off makes them worth their weight in gold.  And they are no more expensive than the fixed ones and do as good a job when engaged.  I wish I had found them sooner.  I plan to replace all the latches with these except the one for the medicine cabinet.And that brings me to the only possible negative of these latches and only 4 stars.  If you have small children in the house every day, you may as well go with the latches that can not be turned off.  All it takes is one time forgetting (and you will) to re-engage the latch and tragedy can follow.  That's why my medicine cabinet will never have one of these. That being said, for us occasional child watchers, nothing can beat these things.As for those with problems with the instructions or installation, really?  I never opened the instructions and had the first one installed in about 1 minute.  I don't know how much simpler it could be.
