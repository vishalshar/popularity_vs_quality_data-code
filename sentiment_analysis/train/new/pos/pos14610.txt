I bought the swing for the simple reason that my 1st Great Newphew would not sleep in his  bed and wanted to stay up all night and sleep thru the day. when my Niece recived this swing she put him in it at 8pm and with the motion of the swing he slept all night. What a blessing for her. For she goes to Collage during the day.She studys at night. Not good when a two week old baby want sleep. I recommand this for any new mother.
