Found this high chair on amazon while doing a search for high chairs for my daughter. Her nursery is lady bugs and couldn't believe I saw a high chair with lady bugs on it. So I did some research on the high chair and decided it was a good fit for us, especially for the price! It was SUPER easy to put together and it is SO stink'n cute!! It's light, so it is easy to move around the kitchen, and has a 5-point safety harness to keep my baby in place. The tray doesn't always "click" when attaching to the chair, but it is attached. It has a removable piece on the tray that can go in the dishwasher and a cup holder in the tray as well. The back legs stick out kind of far, so my husband ALWAYS trips over it, but I have only tripped on it once (men! Ha). All in all, I am very pleased with this high chair and so happy I bought it!!
