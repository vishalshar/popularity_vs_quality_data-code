I purchased this after looking at many, I could not decide so I went with this one for the price. I was a little nervous as my Jeep Liberty doesn't have adjustable heard rests. NO problem, this was a secure fit and it doesn't bother front seat passengers. I read the reviews where people complained about the sage , I found that if you secure properly this isn't a problem. I store everything , from snacks, toy cars , books , a leap pad , napkins , crayons and pad of paper, pencils. It has freed up tons of space on the floor board of my car and there is no need to pull over the reach something my son wants, He can reach it all himself. He loves it and we have added wipes, a zip lock bag full of Legos, so much stuff can fit and he is still comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to take a minute to follow the directions and install it.
