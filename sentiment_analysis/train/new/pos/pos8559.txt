Great product.  Bottles on the bottom rack, and everything else just goes on top.  It is hard to see based on the photos, but the blue plastic rack which holds everything is adjustable.  I'm able to put 6 Munchkin Latch bottles, which are wider than the Dr. Browns I have, on the bottom rack.If your wife pumps, and the instructions indicate what parts can be placed in it, this is also good for sterilizing those items as well.  Just throw them all on the top rack, and you can put the breast milk storage bottles on the bottom.A couple of things regarding this product:1)  I read a lot of reviews on this product regarding discoloration and rust.  This actually made me hesitant to buy this.  After reading up on other electric sterilizers it seems to be a recurring complaint not specific to just this make and model.  I took the risk, and have use the item so some time now and still no rust.  I use plain old tap water; no distilled, filtered, or bottled water.  The instructions indicate to clean the item once a week, and we do it every three weeks.  All you do is throw some white vinegar in there and run it for a dry run.  Then wipe the interior after it cools.  Really simple, and vinegar is cheap.2)  When you buy the item don't be alarmed if it turns on and you are not ready for it.  While it isn't in the instruction manual, there is another piece of paper taped to the side of the box indicating this is normal.  I thought this was a problem and read the instructions thinking the item was faulty until I found the paper to see if there was a registration card or support number to call.3)  This item is tall, so don't run it while it is under a cabinet.  Especially if your cabinets are wood or particle board.  The steam will hang out and collect under the cabinets.  This could ruin them.  I really wish the port for the steam exhaust was towards the front instead of the rear.  To accommodate this we turn it around so the exhaust port shoots away.
