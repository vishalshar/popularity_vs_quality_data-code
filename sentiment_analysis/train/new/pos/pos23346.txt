SIDS is something we are afraid most...If it comes to the point, baby is moving and may turn arround and end up laying face-down.In Germany we have seen a lot of mattresses what are fully breathable. Here in California we just found out that all promote with "water proof" what mean actually... there is a plastic/rubber/silicon-layer, what protects your mattress from pee-pee and other fluids. But isn't it the baby what should be protected most?This smal airflow mattress fits perfect in our standard crib and easily under the fitted sheet.I tried to "breath through" and its "works" perfect. As well it feels like a kind of  "pillow-top" on the mattress without being too soft.Another advantage seem to me, that you have a kind of "permanent airflow" and that may avoid to much sweating of the baby even if the material is warming itself easily by body warmth.The workmanship is good so far... the edges could be done a bit better in the seam.The "round corners" make it easy to put it under the fitted sheet.We washed the mat in out machine and it was same (means no threads or deformations) as before. Just the new (little bit platic) smell is gone... :-)In my eyes its worth the Money to protect our Baby, even if the material and amount of work may not cause those $ 70. :-)UPDATE:Unfornutally AMAZON decide to remove the photo-feature... so my photos will not longer shown.About the question concerning the thickness: Its about the same thickness like a pen. May be a bit more. Just to get an idea. Reply this Post if you like to get sent a small photo about that.
