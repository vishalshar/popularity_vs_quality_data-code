My granddaughter is five months old and wears bows all the time. These are very nice since the headband is very thin...which is very nice for this hot weather we've been having. She has not had a chance to wear all of them yet but she will. The only problem is that you need to double check the back side of the bows because some of them have a bad spot where they were connected and have a pokey spot on them. We were in a hurry so I haven't had a chance to see what I can do about it of if I'll have to contact the company but overall we love the bows.
