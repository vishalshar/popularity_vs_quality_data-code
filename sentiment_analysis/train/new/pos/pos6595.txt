I bought the owl set for my cousin's baby and wanted some bookends for my son's bookshelf since the book collection is quickly growing. I looked high and low, and found many reviews on others stating the bookend wasn't heavy enough and although cute was a waste of money.I decided on these even though they didn't match with my son's Winnie the Pooh nursery, and I'm very pleased. The weight (like beans) is in the body of the dog and looks exactly like the shown picture. I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for bookends for their child's room.
