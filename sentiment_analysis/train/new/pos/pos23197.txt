We bought this item to go in our nursery to match the Jungle Jill theme already there.  It is so adorable.  There is a mesh insert that you can remove to carry the dirty clothes in!  The frame is not super sturdy, however we only put her clothes in it and it does just fine.  I have had it full of clothes, blankets, and sheets and it stood solidly in place.  There is also a flap the covers the top of the hamper, this could be to keep light things from falling in or maybe just for decoration.  We don't use the cover flap but it is cute.  I don't think I could be disappointed in this purchase.
