I purchased this stroller for our 3rd daughter.  We needed something easy to push, easy to put in the back of the SUV, and something that could go to ball games with us.  I also am picky and wanted something stylish.  This is it!!  My 5 year old can push the baby in it and it is incredibly easy to maneuver and store.  I already had a Peg Perego carrier, so I bought the adapters to use it with this stroller frame and it works wonderfully.  The red is gorgeous and not too girly.  Although I loved the purple, my husband wanted the red.  The black is pretty, but I thought it might be too hot in the midwestern summers, so red it was.The basket underneath is huge and I am able to use it on shopping trips.  I highly recommend this stroller.  It is pricey, but if you are in the market for a luxury stroller, be sure to take a look at this one.  I wish I would have had it for all of my children.UPDATE:  I have now owned this stroller for 7 months and am still extremely glad that I purchased it.  Being a stay-at-home mom, I walk with the baby an average of 3 miles a day.  This stroller is the best and has held up extremely well.  I can also push it with one hand, allowing me to walk the dog with the other.  Do NOT hesitate to spend the money on this if you think it's the stroller for you.
