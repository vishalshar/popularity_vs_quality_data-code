I'm an avid runner so when we knew we were having a family my task was to find a jogging stroller.  After reviewing all type for months on the internet I finally went with the Reebok.  I was able to start running with my daughter when she was three months old because the Reebok was one of the only strollers that could recline.  It has a front zip on pocket that catches any toys that are dropped instead of them falling on to the road and it also acts as protection against the sun in the summer and the cold of the winter.  It's nice and compact in the seating area so when out running in the winter with the plastic cover on (included with the stroller), heat loss is minimal.Yes it did pull to one side but it doesn't take a `rocket scientist' to realize how to correct the problem with out reading the instructions.  I'm not a big muscular person and I find it easy to run while controlling the stroller with one hand.I've now had the Reebok for just over a year, I run 3 - 4 times a week with my daughter and I'm about to pass the 2000km mark using it for running only, not including any walks we do with it.  I've never had a deflated tire or a bent frame...I don't know what one does to bend the frame!!Would and have recommended the Reebok, great jogging stroller.
