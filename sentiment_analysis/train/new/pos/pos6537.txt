I've had my case for over 4 years now. I use it everyday to hold my ID as well as debit, credit and membership cards. Whenever I pull it out I get compliments. People want to know where I got it from and tell me that it's super cool and unique (even after all of these years). The quality of the workmanship is excellent. If you want a functional, sturdy, unique case... get it. Yes, it is LARGE, but if you have a purse you can stash it there... It's smaller than a wallet. I haven't had a wallet in my purse in years! Dude: It could even go in your inside suit coat pocket... It's no heavier/bulkier than an iPhone!
