Glow in the dark = fast & easy to locateFinding sucky fast = baby sleeping longer/staying asleep-It does glow in a dark room after being exposed to a reasonable amount of light-Doesn't glow so brightly that it keeps baby awake-Whatever chemical makes it glow is in the 'button' part - not the part in baby's mouth-Helps to find lost suckys - just wait till it's dark and go look in car/under bed/outsideVerdict: Awesomesauce.My only question is: Why didn't we get these from the start?
