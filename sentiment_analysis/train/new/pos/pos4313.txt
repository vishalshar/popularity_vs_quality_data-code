I first purchased these for baby 1 in 2009. Our dentist gave us a different brand as a sample and my fingers felt slimey and sticky at the same time.  These have a mild taste and do not leave a sticky residue on your hands. They have texture to them so that they can remove debris from the tooth's surface. I highly recommend these for babies that have teeth but aren't quite ready for a real tooth brush.
