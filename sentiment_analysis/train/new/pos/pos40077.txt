After writing this, it will probably break tomorrow (ha, ha), but after owning and actively using this music box for about 14 months it is still going strong and working well.  I thought it was so cool when we first got it and I saw how the lights lit up my daughter's room, though I warn you it looks disturbing on the video monitor -- like fire.  She loved it and it calmed her for the minute or so that it played (it has a kind of short cord which is my only complaint).  On the good side, the velcro is nice and strong so my daughter can remove it some of the time, but not all of the time.  She has learned to pull it herself from around 1 year old (she's 18 months now) and there have been some mornings when she has pulled it umpteenth times.  I guess we just got a good one as the lights all seem to still be working, and it's my favorite music box now that the owl has bit the dust.
