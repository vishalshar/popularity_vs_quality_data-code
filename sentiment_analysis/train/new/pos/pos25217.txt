I got the Ameda Purely Yours breast pump through my insurance, which came with the standard size flange. I used the standard once and it hurt due to being too big for me. These inserts help quite a bit. They are still rigid, hard plastic, so feels pretty different than baby's mouth, but they seem to work. They fit right inside the standard flange and if you push it in all the way, it's a pretty good fit and doesn't slip out like some other reviewers said, at least not in the 3 or 4 times I've used them so far. I'm unconvinced that this insert reduces the size quite enough for me personally, so I also have ordered the "areola stimulator" insert to try.
