The first one we received was damaged,  There was a crack in one of the wood brackets where the legs attach to the table top.  The company promptly sent me a replacement and it worked great.  It looks very cute in my daughter's pink princess room.  It is also much larger than most tables in this category, and provides excellent functionality.
