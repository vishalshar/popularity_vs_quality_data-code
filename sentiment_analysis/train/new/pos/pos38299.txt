This is the second one I bought. I also have the blue one for my son. You can go to jackscrapbooks.com and order more refill pages, which come with album extenders (for more room). It's a hard wood cover and very sturdy. I am confident that this book will stand the test of time. It's large and there is plenty of room for scrapbooking extra keepsakes. No pockets, but I do recommend purchasing the extra refill pages, which are blank. They have the moon and star graphic in the corner but nothing else. I am bringing this second book to the hospital with me like I did with my first child. They'll put her inked footprints into the book for me.
