My daughter is 6m old and still not liking the eating from a spoon thing. Because we're trying to get her to gain weight, I decided to try this product. It works great for her. I'm buying another set. She eats a lot more food this way, and can easily hold it herself since it's small. I haven't noticed any issues with leaking or being hard to eat, but she is 6m and not a tiny baby. She also has mastered sucking, so maybe she's got a stronger hold on it. The only thing I will warn about is you don't want to put this in warm water to heat the food or shake it. I mix and warm the food first, then pour it into the feeder. That worked better for me. I've used it for cereal w/BM and with regular jar food, and it's worked great so far.
