I found this brand to be the most sturdy and useful.  However, it was much more worth it for the price of 11.95, withouth shipping and handling.  The increase in price is absolutely uncalled for.  Like most disposable pads, they are only good for one use (unless you have no mess) which makes the current price for the package far from economical.  You can by sturdy cloth ones that are thick and generally don't leak through for about the same price for 3 which you can use over and over again after throwing in the wash.  Sorry, I'm a big fan of this product, but the retailers/manufacturers need to stop being greedy and leave the price alone!
