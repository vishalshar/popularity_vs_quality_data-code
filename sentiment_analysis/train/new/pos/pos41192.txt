This little hamper is great for its price tag! It comes with 10 screws and is very easily assembled. It's not the most durable piece and can't - for instance - take kids climbing around on it, but as a simple and cheap storage solution it is excellent. We're using this in our nursery for a little added room to stuff things and for that it's perfect!
