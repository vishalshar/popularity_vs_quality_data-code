These pacifiers are very similar to the ones provided in the hospital NICU.  (In fact, we have been in two different hospitals and both NICU's utilized this brand of pacifier).  The only difference is that the hospital versions were vanilla scented and these are completely unscented.  Our baby seemed to prefer the vanilla scented when they were new, but of course that wears off quickly after a couple of cleanings or a sterilization.  Our baby spent a couple of months in the NICU, so it was important to find a product similar to what the hospital had been providing.  The hospital versions were all green in color, so the blue made it easy which ones we had brought home and which were brand new.  Overall, these have been a suitable replacement for the hospital versions.  Also, these things do bounce like a super ball, so they will disappear under furniture, out the window, on the roof, etc.  (I have seen week old preemies magically send these things flying into orbit down hospital corridors).  So you will definitely need a few of these in reserve.
