My wife and I just had our son and the monitor we had for our daughter was on it's last leg. We went to our local stores and checked out the monitors and got a Graco brand with two handsets the talkback feature and vibration. This set was TERRIBLE, we couldn't go down the hall or upstairs without it losing connection constantly and this was an expensive monitor and supposed to have a range of 200m. Our old monitor from our daughter always ended up getting static from all the wireless devices in our home and we wanted something solid, I started looking online when we got back from vacation and saw this Philips monitor but thought it was a little pricey for just a single monitor and put it to the side and did more research. The more I read online people loved this monitor but thought the price was a bit high at 119.99, so Amazon had it for 97 with free shipping. I jumped on it due to the reviews and figured I'd give it a chance.. boy am I glad I did. We have quite a few wireless devices in our home with our neighbor also having a wireless router and the audio is CRYSTAL clear. I can't believe it's honestly that clear. The whole unit is quite small which I was very surprised to see, the base unit has a spot for 4 AA batteries if the power goes out it also has built in music and it's quite good quality. There is a light on the base unit that's pretty dim for a dark room but I'm surprised to see that addition on there. I tested the range by carrying this with me when I brought out the trash and went over to the neighbors and not a single disconnection and still having no static or feedback. The talk feature is very nice and works extremely well and is crystal clear on the base too. Fantastic is all I can say.This monitor is well well worth the money, it would be nice if there was a way to add an additional handset. I know the price is higher but trust me it's so worth the price!
