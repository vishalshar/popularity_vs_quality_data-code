I bought this for my toddler. I thought he might like it since he is always trying to figure out how things work or move. This ball kind of frustrates him at times though. Whenever he tries to grab a smiley face it hides from him! I think it's a cute ball and he still likes to see the smiley faces pop out as it rolls around. I think it's well made. It's stood up to months of being thrown around on tile flooring without breaking or chipping paint. Cute toy for curious minds.
