Our biggest hurdle with potty training has been consistency.  Our daughter will be three next week, and we've been toying with potty training for about 6 months now, but never consistently because we travel a lot, so sometimes diapers are just easier for long car rides, long plane rides, long hikes, etc.  This watch kept me, my husband, and our daughter all on schedule.  We started using it on a Tuesday, and as of the next Tuesday our daughter was fully potty trained.I had an app on my phone which was a similar concept - it would send a notification every 45 minutes, or whatever time interval you wanted, and it even had a little game she could play after using the potty, but she didn't really care because it wasn't hers.  The watch gave her ownership and responsibility for her body, and she responded extremely well to that.I don't know that it would work for everybody, but it worked great for us!  The only bummer is we only used it for a week, so now we don't need it anymore.  Guess I'll hang onto it for one of her cousins to use later on.
