I planted a number of seeds not knowing if they would germinate. I still have more than half of the seeds left for the future. Well, it seems as though every seed popped. I have a pot filled with little basil plants. I plan to transplant them and give them to friends and family because we are approaching winter and they cannot go outside.8/222/2015 An update to my original review. I planted them in the spring. Wow! The most beautiful and healthy Basil plants I have ever grown!
