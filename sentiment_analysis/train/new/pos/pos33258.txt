This is our second one we've bought (for two different babies), it's such a great tool in helping bath time be fun and safe. I'd still never leave a baby alone in any type of bath,but with this you can feel safe knowing they can't fall over and get hurt and the water level is what you choose. The indicator on the bottom that says cold or warm or hot is awesome! It's been blown up once and held the air for months. This is really an awesome bathtub!
