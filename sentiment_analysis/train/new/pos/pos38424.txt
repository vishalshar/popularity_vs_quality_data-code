Bought this for our daughter when she was four months old and in the 25th percentile for height and weight. We wanted something her feet touched the floor in and some reviewers said their smaller babies did touch. My daughter was able to touch the floor right away. At nine months she still plays in it. However, the toys are not easy to get on and a few fall off often but can be put back on. We usually give her other/additional toys to play with and there is open tray space to set those on. We use this in our bathroom and laundry room to keep her stationary while we do whatever we have to get done. Others complain this isn't very bouncy -- and they're right -- but this isn't a bouncer. It's meant to be a safe place you can put baby where s/he can play with toys and bounce a bit and keep them occupied while mom and dad do what they have to do. Bottom line is that it doesn't look much different than the others like it at the store which are upwards of $80-100 and this does the job just as well. My daughter is happy enough with this saucer. I'm really glad I didn't waste my money on one of the more expensive ones.
