So far this wedge has been fantastic for my 5 month old!She has hated being in a flat position to sleep since the second she was born. We even took our Rock and Play into the hospital to help her out. She's slept in the R&P but it so mobile we needed to get her in her crib ASAP so she didn't Houdini her way out of the R&P.Being flat, every night was a crap shoot whether she would sleep 1 hr, 4 hrs, or 12. Normally she would wake multiple times a night on the flat mattress.We put the wedge in under the sheet and she has slept in her crib for almost a week now and for 8-9 hours at a time.The wedge is very firm, in two pieces (which will help when we travel for the holidays)---into the luggage it goes!Seriously, this has been great for our family!
