Potty training is the pits, so I jump at anything that helps the whole process. Being a mother of 4, including a newborn, and trying to potty my third just before heading on a long trip was maybe not the best plan, but my sister-in-law had a traveling potty for her son, so I thought we'd try it out. My first 2 were girls, and were relatively easy to train. But my son was not easy. When he had to go, he had to go RIGHT THEN! The potty chair I purchased came with some of these, so I bought some more as replacements. We love them!The first time we used this, we had pulled over to the side of the road off an exit because he just couldn't make it further. It was quick and easy to put on the potty, and I just tied it up and threw it away at the next stop. No leaking, no mess anywhere! I was shocked. A few months after tha trip, I still had it in the car and we were meeting up with some friends. We were in a hurry to get going somewhere that didn't have a bathroom, and of course my son decided he had to go right when we got there. He used the potty and I forgot to clean it up. We weren't gone long, and I remembered the minute we got back, and I was so nervous the whole van was going to reek. I was shocked that not only was there no scent, but it had absorbed all the urine! I know others mentioned you could use disposable bags with towels lining them, but these must have the absorbers like in diapers, because they are extremely absorbant! It's been several months now, and we still keep this in the van for emergency uses. Highly recommended!
