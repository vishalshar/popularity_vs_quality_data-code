I had read that the best time to start giving a bottle to a breastfed baby was between 4-6 weeks. SO when my daughter turned 5 weeks I wanted to find a bottle nipple that would most resemble the nipple of a breast so I wouldn't confuse her. I was nervous about trying this one only because when I was breastfeeding my son (who is now 23 months old) I tried giving him a NUK bottle that had a nipple that was supposed to mimic a real nipple. WELL- all it did was confuse the mess out of him! He took in so much air and when I tried to nurse him later all he did was SCREAM because he was so confused! Well, having had such a bad experience with my son, I was reluctant to try just any nipple. I had done a lot of research and this was the nipple that a lot of breastfeeding moms recommended. We tried it for the first time last night and I was amazed! My daughter (who is 5 weeks) took to it like she had been bottle fed her whole life. I was expecting her to at least hesitate when the nipple was put in her mouth but there was absolutely NO hesitation! Immediately, she started sucking and drinking the breast milk. Well that was half the battle the next test was seeing if she would nurse later. She had no problem going back to the breast!!! (Much to my relief :)) I hate that this nipple is hard to find in stores but I am happy that I can at least get it on Amazon- and it's cheap! If you are feeling reluctant about trying this nipple for a breastfed baby- you HAVE to give it a try! And hey- if it doesn't work out, you only spent a few dollars on it anyway.
