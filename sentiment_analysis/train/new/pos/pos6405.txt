Light, free of many harmful chemicals/products, and responsibly made compared to most mattresses. Although, the baby hasn't arrived yet I am very pleased with the mattress.  At first I wasn't sure if I like that the mattress had the waterproofing around the whole thing, I thought it would be uncomfortable and loud. However, after putting on a mattress cover (also waterproof) and sheets it is going to be perfect. The dual firmness is a bonus and it seems that the mattress will last quite a while - it doesn't seem flimsy or poorly made.
