This product is just the right size for baby to play and grow. i can't wait for our daughter to be able to play on it the only thing we didn't like is that the patter repeats on both sides more than once so it looks like the alphabet is jumbled up but that's why we're here to teach her the right order i guess. this product boast easy clean up which i'm looking forward to. come in great space saving case that we can place in the corner and material is really squishy which is great because we have hard wood floors. can't wait to actually put this product to use, better work for as much as they charged :)
