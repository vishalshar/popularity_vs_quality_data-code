Love this organizer for my car! Wish I bought it sooner.  Top section is perfect for a couple books, enough pockets for a couple small trains/cars, snacks, can hold a diaper or 2 and some wipes.  The best part is the cup holder.  My 2 year old can easy reach the water cup when needed and put it back with no problem.  Saves me from having to keep reaching back handing my child drinks while I'm driving.
