I got this multiple pack of toys so that I could keep a couple for my daughter and use a couple as shower gift decorations.  One of them in particular sounds like a cat toy, but my daughter loves it.  Glad that I was able to get 4 in a box... made it way more cost effective than if I would have had to buy separate toys.
