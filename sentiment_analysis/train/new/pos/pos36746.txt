We love this mattress.  I was very worried about buying a mattress for my 2 year old because in the past when I've bought traditional mattresses, the off-gassing took months (that was before I knew better about the horrible chemicals in mattresses).  My son had a Naturepedic crib mattress and the transition to the Naturepedic twin mattress was a good choice.When the mattress was delivered we set it up in his room and he was able to use it that very night.  No off-gassing horrible chemicals, no bad smells.  What a relief!  I'm very sensitive to chemical smells so I was happy to not have to deal with that here.We started off on the firm side of the mattress for my 2 year old, but it was very hard.  He's been sleeping on the firm side for 1 month, but he keeps waking up at night.  We also found that he was trying to put his entire body on his pillow, so we thought he would prefer a softer feel.  A few days ago we flipped it over to the quilted side and that feels much better.We still need to get a waterproof pad for it, since the quilted side is not waterproof and he's not yet potty-trained.  I would not hesitate to purchase this mattress again.  It was very expensive, but if he uses it for 10 years, that's only $75/year.  Well worth the peace of mind.
