This are great! They are thin. I expected that but they are wonderful burp clothes and great folded up as a soaker in a cloth diaper. Yes, there are some loose stings but for what I paid and the use I am getting from them I simply clip the string and use them. They are a great deal and really nice colors and designs. These would also be lovely for lint free cleaning.
