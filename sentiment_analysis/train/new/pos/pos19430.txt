This car seat has stood up for two of my babies now and still in fantastic condition. I'm so glad I splurged on the pricier leather option since it has been SO much easier to clean and care for than the all-cloth seats I've used. It also looks great. It's a bit awkward and heavy to lug around (aren't they all?) but I avoid doing so anyways, preferring to baby-wear as much as possible.
