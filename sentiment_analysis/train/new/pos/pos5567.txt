Purchasing these bottle nipples here is a bargain compared to buying them at BRU stores in individual 2-packs, but in my experience it comes with a somewhat minor inconvenience. I'm not sure if it has to do with the new Dr. Brown's bottle design being incompatible with these nipples or something else, but I have noticed that the nipple doesn't fit properly into the collar piece. It's almost as if the base of the nipple is too wide for it. Quite often, formula or breast milk will become trapped between the nipple base and bottle collar and then drip down the sides of the outside of the bottle. It doesn't happen every time, but when it does, it's messy. I still enjoy the brand and recommend it highly, I'm just not sure what's going on with the incongruous fit.
