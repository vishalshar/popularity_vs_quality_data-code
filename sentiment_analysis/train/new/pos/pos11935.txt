I am one of those persons who are not very good at assembling big stuff, but being my first son, I though It was worth it to give it a try. I spent about 45 minutes, the instructions were crystal clear and boy is this crib beautiful! It looks great in our baby's room. We are yet to use it for the first time as we are still expecting but so far so good!-Easy to assembly-Looks beautiful-It feels strong and quality materials.
