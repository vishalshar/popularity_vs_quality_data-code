The width is slightly wider by half an inch but makes the mattress fit snugly. I had read (and heard of 1 person I know) tell me about the bedbug issue in one of the models of Dream on me mattress so got nervous. This Colgate mattress is not only made in USA, it is the right amount of firmess and thickness but not rock hard. The outer layer is plastic (so can be wiped down) but did not have the plasticy smell I read in other reviews either. I bought 2 of them for the Da Vinci Emily mini cribs for twins.
