I bought this a couple months ago when my daughter was learning how to grab and throw her toys. She would grab something, then flail her arms and smash whatever toy into her face, then (unsurprisingly) start crying. I thought a soft rattle would be ideal, since she can't really hurt herself on it, and it makes noise!At first, she was not amused - maybe a different color would have grabbed her attention better. Over time, though, she has discovered that the puppy's nose and ears are great for chewing. The toy is well crafted, and should stand up to whatever abuse she'll throw at it. I'd buy it again.
