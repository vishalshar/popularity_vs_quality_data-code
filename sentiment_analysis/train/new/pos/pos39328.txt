I got this set of utensils originally for the forks.  I didn't want anything too sharp for my 9 month old to learn with and these work out great even now that he's one.  Yes, it is a little difficult to get tougher pieces of food to stay on the fork but I'd rather have my son use this fork than a sharp one so I know he can't hurt himself.  Also the spoons are great.  You can fit a lot more oatmeal, rice cereal, applesauce, yogurt, etc. on them.  My son is to the age that he can take bigger bites than a lot of "baby" spoons will allow.  The only bad thing is that they have to be hand washed, but I'm willing to make that sacrifice for the safety of my son. Overall excellent product!
