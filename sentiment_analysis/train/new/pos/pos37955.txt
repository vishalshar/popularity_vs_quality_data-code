The video of this carrier was all over facebook and as soon as my husband saw this carrier, he wanted it right away. This is two separate pieces. My daughter is very large for her size, but she is only a little over a year old, so she does not fit onto the orange saddle. We only have used the leg straps on her. My husband is very large. He is over six feet tall with broad shoulders and a broad back. He has carried her on his shoulders for months now. She has a very strong core.If you are not a man that would normally carry your child onto your shoulders, this child carrier is not for you. I doubt that many women could even use this carrier. This carrier is very well made. It is very simple to use and you can use just the leg straps or you can use the saddle with it also. If your child does not have a strong core, this carrier is not for you.We bought this carrier because my daughter loves to ride on my husband's shoulders but his neck and shoulders hurt after wearing her for only ten minutes or so on his shoulders. Now he can put her on his shoulders and we can walk around for extended periods of time without any issues.
