I love this monitor.  I was using one made by sony, and before that one made by another company (can't remember the name).  This one blew me away with the features at this price point.Pros:Can use batteries in either of the parent unitslighted indicator to demonstrate when the child unit is transmittingVERY portable slim design on all the unitsCons:The blue light on the parent unit is a little bright-- I've had to put something over it so my husband can sleep at nightThe volume doesn't go up quite as loud as I'd prefer.
