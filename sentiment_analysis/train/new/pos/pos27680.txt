If you're considering buying this placemat, check the size first, that way you won't have to return it and come back here giving it 3 or 4 stars because you didn't check the size (sorry! had to say it!)Now, we use this mat only when we eat out. We place it on the table and use it as plate for our baby (now 18 months, she's been using it since 14 months). We'd put bits of meat, veggies, anything on it while eating out. When she's done I'll wipe it, roll it and clean it with water once we get home.Don't expect to find a mat that stays in place for a child beyond 12 months. The ones with suction cups don't really do a good job since they're raised because of the cups and they're also bulky, with bass or high relief motivs engraved on them and basically not so practical. Suction cups won't work on tablecloth either. So this silicone placemat, with no suction cups, does a fair job. It won't skid, but if your child grabs it by a corner, of course it won't stay in place.This mat also dries really really fast which is an advantage.
