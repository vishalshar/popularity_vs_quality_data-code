I have used Ameda, Medela and Lansinoh bags recently, and figured I would post a comparison of the 3.Ameda:Love the pour spout, but haven't really had a spill issue with any of the other bags so it's more of a nice to have than a must have.  Good, thick plastic, and bags stand up on their own quite well. Zipper seems secure, although sometimes its hard to tell if it's closed. Has the smallest zipper of the 3 bags. Also, very disappointed that this listing was for the bags only, and did not include the adapters to pump directly into the bags. Luckily, with a little finagling, I was able to use these bags with the Medela adapters.Medela:Similar to Ameda in plastic thickness and design. Also stands up on own easily. Zipper seems a bit more reliable than Ameda. I liked that the adapters were included in the box and these are easy to pump into.Lansinoh:The thinnest plastic of the 3, and don't really stand up on own easily. These have a double zipper though, which is great, and it's easy to tell when the zipper is closed. These also lie the flattest when frozen, making them the easiest for storing frozen milk.  These are also by far the cheapest of the 3, usually costing around half of what the others do.  However, these cannot be pumped directly in to.Personally, I use the Lansinoh bags for whe I pump into bottles and then pour into bags for freezing. I use the Medela or Ameda ones when I want to pump directly into bags. In my opinion, they all stink as far as volume measurement, so if I need to know how much is in there, I usually pump into a bottle, measure based on the bottle reading, and then pour into the bag. Otherwise, when zipped, they usually read about 1 ounce more than what is actually in there.
