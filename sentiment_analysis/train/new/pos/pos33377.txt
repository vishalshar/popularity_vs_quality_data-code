I LOVE this diaper!  I have used a variety of diapers, AIO's AI2's, pockets, and prefolds.  I love my BumGenius and Thirsties diapers but wanted to try an AIO.  I'll never let go of my dedication to BumGenius, but these are worth the money spent.  Kushies has exceeded my expectations!  I thought this diaper would leak all of the time because it has a small crotch and interesting sizing features.  However, my baby has NEVER leaked with a urinated diaper within a 2-3 hour time period.  Keep in mind: breast fed poop is another situation.  My baby usually leaks a little when they poop. However, I don't consider this a major problem.I can easily change my sweetie into new clothes and clean the soiled onesie.  When my baby starts eating solids it won't be much of a problem.  Overall, I LOVE this diaper.  I read other reviews saying it has a very plastic feel and is bulky.  I disagree.  My baby is of average size and these diapers are great.  They are not too bulky.  My sweetie is able to sit just fine in these diapers.  I have grown to love the outside of these diapers.  With 3-4 washes, the outside becomes a lot less stiff.  Overall, I give this diaper a 4 out of 5 stars.  If  you are interested in these diapers because of their price then I would say....yes...do it!  You will not disappointed if you are on a budget.  However, at night...I would recommend putting a Gerber plastic cover over them to prevent breast fed poop leakage.  If you are on a budget then these are for you.  Buy 12 or more infant size and 12 or more toddler size and you will be good to go.  Awesome diaper for the money conscious parent.
