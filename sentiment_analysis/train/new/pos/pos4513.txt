Worked really well for our puppy. We put it on the corner, end of our bed because she was being potty trained, had a bad experience in a kennel so we couldn't put her in that at night. She was too small to jump on & off our bed, and we didn't want her free in our bedroom and potting on our carpet. So if she couldn't wake us to take her outside this worked! She is only 10 pounds, so for the amount of urine she put out wasn't too much for the pad to hold. We don't need it any more but if we get another small dog or I have grand babies I will use it again.
