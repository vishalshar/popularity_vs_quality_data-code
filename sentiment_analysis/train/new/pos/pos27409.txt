We bought the Cosco rendition of this car seat about 2 1/2 years ago, when our daughter outgrew her infant seat.  At the time we drove a 2 door hatch back, and we needed something that would fit in our car rear facing.We liked this one because it was affordable, had wide straps that were less likely to twist, had easily adjustable straps, and would fit.  It transfered well into our mini-SUV, when we upgraded cars.I liked that you could remove the base, which then created another car seat, and made it smaller, for a tighter fit.  Or you could leave the base on, which lifted the seat higher so that our daughter could see out he window better.A  year ago we got in a car accident and it had to be replaced.  I was quite disappointed that I couldn't find it on the market.  So I replaced it with the Cosco Alpha Omega, which we like too, but not as well.My second child is now at the point where he needs a convertible, so when I saw this one available I'm buying it.It really is a good deal, safe, and easy to use (if you read the instructions).
