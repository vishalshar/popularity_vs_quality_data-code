As a parent when I received the mattress I did NOT like the firmness of it. It is very firm unlike our original mattress. However we went ahead and used it for our 2 1/2 year old daughter. She was not sleeping through the night with her old mattress and would wake up in the morning with bags under her eyes from lack of sleep, and was also very cranky. She has now been sleeping on the mattress for almost 2 weeks and sleeps through the night. She loves her new mattress. It fit very well in her Baby's Dream crib that was converted into a toddler bed.Overall I rated the mattress with 5 stars because of the outcome we have seen with our daughter. My personal preferences didn't matter this time. LOL
