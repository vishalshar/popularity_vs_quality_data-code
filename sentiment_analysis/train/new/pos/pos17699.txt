I LOVE these stickers. They are so cute! I love taking pics of my little one with them on. They stick to her onesies very well. They don't rip easily. I have her wear white onesies and I stick them on her tummy/chest area and click away. I have only taken months one through three so far. These are such a perfect way to remember your little one when they were little. I know I am going to love looking back and seeing what she looked like her first year.
