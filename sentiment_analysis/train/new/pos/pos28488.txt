This bottle was inspired by the German nuk bottle.. My husband and I were stationed in germany and these were the only bottles I could find.. I bought one and my son LOVED it.. This was back in 2007.. Then I had my daughter and I bought her these bottles as well that was in 2009.. Of course the german nuk don't have cute designs or anything but they are top rated and highly recommended in Europe. I had no problem alterating from the boob to the bottle.. Now we are back in the USA and I'm glad to see that they have these amazing bottles.. now I'm pregnant with 3# and he will be using these bottles as well!!!! No doubt about that.. No leaks no tears well Made.. Great thing about them is that they are now BPA free.. So Danke Schon Deutschland for this amazing bottle!!!!
