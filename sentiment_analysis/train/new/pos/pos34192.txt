This is an AWESOME seat.  I tried another seat for my son first and the pee guard just smashed him so needless to say he couldn't/wouldn't potty b/c he couldn't even get his equipment past the guard to pee in the toilette.  The pee guard moves so you can move it over their stuff so they don't spray the whole bathroom, which I think is brilliant.  That helped my son a lot b/c he cried the first time we went b/c it went over the guard but when we showed him how to aim and that the guard could move to cover him he was quite pleased and excited b/c he could move it himself.  If you do play with the guard excessively it may fall off, ours has like 3 times, but it's removable so its no big deal other than its gross to fish it out.  Don't let that deter you though b/c my son is an extreme mover and fidgets with everything a lot, so if it can take his abuse and only fall in 2-3 times over a 7 month period that is awesome.  Also he has figured out how to stand over the potty and pee like a big boy so the fact that it's small enough for him to stand over and pee in it is awesome too.  This seat is amazing, just amazing.  I researched every seat out there I think and this one is the best, search no further this is it, especially for BOYS!!!!!!!  AWESOME SEAT!
