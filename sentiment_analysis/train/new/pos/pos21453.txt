Our 8 month old was in this car seat installed in our minivan.  The van was hit by a vehicle driving at least 35MPH at time of impact, forcing our vehicle (from a stop) into a curb and the vehicle in front of it.  Our baby was just fine - this system is perfectly safe; so much so we bought the same one to replace it.In addition, it only takes common sense to use this travel system as a whole.  Its pretty self explanatory.
