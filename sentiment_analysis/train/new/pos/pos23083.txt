I bought this pillow and the inflatable my brest friend.  Although the inflatable one would be best to travel with, it leaked air and I was unable to actually travel with it.  The travel Boppy has been an excellent investment.  It was great on the plane, my baby actually slept on our laps on the pillow.  Fits pretty cozy in the seat with you though.  Folds up nicely and easy to carry.  Has a great little zipper pouch on the cover flap where I stored my feeding cover, tissues, burp cloth, toy, pacifier, what ever. The flap covers the opening when the pillow is folded shut, so that the surface where the baby lays on is kept clean.  I have used it at friends houses, when I take the baby to work, anywhere I have traveled to.  I just leave it in the car.  It's so light and just slings over your shoulder, or I put a clip on in and attached it to the diaper bag.  Easy to keep clean.  Excellent travel companion to help save back and shoulder muscles for on-the-go breastfeeding!  Also nice to have something to prop the baby up with so that he didn't lay flat on the floor all the time.
