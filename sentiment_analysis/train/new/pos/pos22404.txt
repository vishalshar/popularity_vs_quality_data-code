My son loves all the toys from Oball and this is no exception. I do have one suggestion though for this particular toy: add a stability feature (maybe a suction bottom) so the toy can stay securely on the floor while little one plays with it. My 7 month old ends up swinging it around. If it stayed on the floor, he would have much more fun sliding the beads around and I would be able to let him play independently, instead of sitting beside him keeping him from hitting himself in the face!
