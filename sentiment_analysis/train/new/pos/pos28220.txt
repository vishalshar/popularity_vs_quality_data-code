I've been raising kids for more than my entire life, and these harnesses are not obtrusive, but very cute, though nay-sayed in oft-discussed non-mothers rating never tried products. I'm sorry about all of you naysayers of harnesses - you have evidently never chased a rambunctious 3yo while carrying a baby and dragging another child, backpack, diaper bag and any groceries your wild pack of animals haven't already devoured.  The kids have been wearing harnesses in every toy they have, I don't see any problem with this. At the time/age for her to 'carry her momo doll, s never wanted to take it off!Anyone ever responsible for a toddler know they can disappear at the turn of an eye, dart away from you in an instant and be grabbed by someone in the wink of an eye. With this harness, the child is carrying and hugging her doll, even with your back turned, this harness allows you the peace of mind they are safe!
