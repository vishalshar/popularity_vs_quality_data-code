Love these pouches! I make home made applesauce and these are awesome for that! The small size is perfect for babies/toddlers. They clean really easily in the dishwasher, but I usually do it by hand and use the oxo tot sippy cup brush set to get into the crevices. They are very easy to clean then. Soak in hot water and then brush out the food bits. They are also great for yogurt or home made baby food if you make your own. We did baby led weaning so never made purees. However my son was able to use these at just 7 months old on his won with yogurt or applesauce in them. He felt to independent. I loved seeing him able to handle it without help. The large size is too big for a little baby or toddler but great for as they get older and need more in the pouch. My son also loves the little animal pictures on them. He gets so excited when he sees me get one out! Overall a really great buy. Really reasonable price, and quality is great.
