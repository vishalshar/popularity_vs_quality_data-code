One side is black and white with red lights.  The other side is filled with colorful animals and the lights are different colors.  There are three options.  Two are classical music and one is just lights.  The classical music can get a little repetitive but it doesn't seem to bother the baby.  The lights are engaging and our baby definitely tracks the lights with her eyes.  I had purchased a few tummy time mats and wish I would have just gotten this instead.  Our baby can be on her tummy or side when this is playing and this keeps her entertained for awhile.  Sometimes I will put this on her lap when she is sitting in her car seat with us at the restaurant when we are eating dinner.  We haven't had problems yet with batteries.  It takes quite a lot though.  Bottom line:  I highly recommend the Yookidoo Baby's First Bumper Book.
