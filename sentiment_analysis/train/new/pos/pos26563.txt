I'm super happy with this stroller!! Came in perfect condition and was really easy to assmble. My back tires need some air but even when I took it on a test ride they seemed fine, I'll just have to fill them when I can. We live in New Orleans and the streets and sidewalks are pot hole ridden and broken up, usually making pushing a stroller down the street a not so easy task; but the 4 suspension tires make is like I'm strolling down the golden  paved smooth streets of LA (or anywhere else really). The initial feature that drew me to this stroller was the option of forward or rear facing seat. My son wants to be able to see me to enjoy a long stroller ride. I feel like this stroller has the features of a 500$+ stroller but just not at the cost (at least the Amazon speacial I got which was right under 200$). The storage at the bottom is ample, now if you have a monster purse or diaper bag than yes it will prob take up the whole storage but since that's not my case the storage size is more then enough for me or a quick grocery trip. I bought the separate cup holder attachment and it works perfectly with the seat facing in or out. My son really enjoyed his first ride. I'm hoping the frame stands the tests of time for baby number 2 down the road, and what's awesome about this stroller is I can just buy a new color pack and feel like I have a brand new stroller, or if I have a girl I can get that berry color pack ü§óü§ó wishful thinking, we will see. I also love the hand bar and guard rail for the the baby is leather and not foam. Experience I've had previously is that the foam breaks and I end up peeling it off.Overall pros:EXCELLENT 4 wheel suspensionFulling reclining seat in both positionsLarge wheels for smooth rideAdjustable handle barLeather handle barEasily able to switch colorsFront & rear facing seatEasy lockComes with rain and bug coverOverall cons:Seat cover color pack looks kinda placed (if that  makes any sense)Rear tires need air and I'm scared of them poppingBottom storage could loose that top mesh and be completely open allowing for more storageFolded position is a little awkward and I don't like how the handle bar keeps the stroller stable (I'm weird about thing I touch being on the floor, especially if we are out in public and we fold the stroller up, the handle bar I push the stroller with would be resting on the floor)Overall: VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE üòçüòçüòç
