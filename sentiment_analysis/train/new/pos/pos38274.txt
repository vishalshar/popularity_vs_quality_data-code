These bad larries are bigger than i expected.  My son is two, LOVES tools, and is learning to use utensils still, sort of.  I figures these would be great for him because instead of getting bored maybe he would want to use them, but they seem like they're going to be a little large for his hands.  I love them, and I'm sure he will too, unfortunately they're a Christmas gift, so we'll have to see after the holidays how they go!! They seem like pretty decent quality.  I'm not disappointed.
