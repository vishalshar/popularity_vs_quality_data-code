The tiaras are not bad - really cute and shiny, and most importantly, the kids loved them.  It's nice that they are attached to a hair band, which in our case turned out to be sturdier than the tiaras themselves.  These, however, bend very easily and considering kids enjoy playing rough and breaking things accidently, they do break easily as well.  That's why I gave 4/5 stars.My advice for those who are dwelling on this purchase: Do not buy if you are looking for something rock solid to last the next couple of months/years ... BUT if you are looking for something occasional and cute, this is a great choice!
