My 3 year old absolutely went crazy she loves it..... I would of liked a heavier blanket, it's more of a spread... I also don't care for satin like fabric which is the top part of the blanket and pillow case.. Not the underside of the blanket, that is cotton. I gave it a high rating because she lived it.
