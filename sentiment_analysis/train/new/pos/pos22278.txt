My son started using these at about 10 months old. We put water in them and he LOVES them. The tip has two X shaped holes in them right next to each other, which seem to prevent spilling. The tip is NOT rigid and is very flexible and is easily sucked from. But like a previous reviewer said, the spouts are sturdy which accommodates biting without harming the spout. After a while of use the holes don't seem to prevent spilling as well, and then when my son figured out how to push his finger through the holes, they wear down more quickly :) The timing also seems to coincide with the bottle starting to smell a bit musty. One of these usually lasts us 2 months.BUT we love these things so much that we just buy a new one. I just ordered 6 more from Amazon. My son will have nothing else and for the first month or so of constant use these are THE BEST bottles! If you use these only occasionally then they will certainly last longer.
