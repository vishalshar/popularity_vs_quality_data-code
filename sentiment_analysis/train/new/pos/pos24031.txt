This cup is awesome. If you take fifteen seconds to read the instructions, the cup does not leak. The reviews that state that it leaks are just crap. It specifies in the instructions a specific way to put the nipple in the lid. It's not any more difficult than any other way to do it; it just allows for the silicone part to go where it is supposed to. I always double check to make sure it's sealed (it's not that difficult and takes two seconds), but I do that with any other cup. The leaking problems are purely user error. I have three cups like this one, and they're great.
