I first want to agree with other reviewers in saying that the reason that these are said to be unsafe (padding behind the baby)is not true, there is no padding behind the baby, just a thin layer of cloth.I have read arguments that you should use the support that comes with the car seat because it has been tested for that car seat, and would like to add my experience as an argument against that. I always felt terrible taking my baby anywhere with the "support" that came with her car seat, it never failed that she would end up slumped over.  Naturally I worried that this could strain her neck, but I was also concerned for another reason-aren't sling carriers deemed unsafe because some infants can smother due to their chin touching their chest?I found myself praying that I would get stopped at a red lights so that I could make sure she was breathing, an would sometimes stop along the road if she hadn't made a noise in a long time, maybe i was over reacting a little, but I don't think I was.  I knew that I couldn't go on much longer like that so I did some research and found this product.  I absolutely LOVE IT, and would not go without it again.  I love the fact that I no longer have to worry about her slouching, and it supports her entire body and keeps her perfectly snug.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.
