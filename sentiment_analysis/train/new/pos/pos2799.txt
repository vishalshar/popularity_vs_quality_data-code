We ordered the foot muff (which I think is kind of a misleading name, as it does indeed provide full coverage to the baby, not just her feet!) because we were taking our stroller overseas with us and wanted something that would be easy to keep in the stroller.  This was perfect, as when the stroller is folded up this muff stays in place, making it easy to keep attached when the stroller is placed in its carry-on/sky-check bag (thereby reducing the endless amount of baby paraphenelia you're stuck juggling as you board).  We encountered a freak snowstorm at our destination and really cold conditions; this muff was great as it really breaks the wind, and with a blanket tucked inside was more than enough for sub-zero conditions.  And, having returned home, it is now just right for spring weather when used by itself, not too hot in the mild sun.It unzips on either side, all the way down, which is convenient; I don't like that it doesn't zip all the way off (so you can't just have the back for extra cushiness), but it's not a big deal just to unzip one side and tuck it in underneath.  Also nice that there are multiple openings in the back for adjusting for height.
