I love this sippy cup.  It's one of the few my toddler would use (along with some of the Playtex ones).  We have been using these cups for over a year and they're still in great shape.  They wash up easily in the dishwasher and I love that they have only 2 parts (cup and lid) -- I get annoyed by sippy cups that require washing and assembly of 3-4 parts!The lid snaps on easily, and the folding spout is easy for a young child to open/close by themselves.  Unlike most other sippies, this makes a great "big-kid" cup with the lid removed, so you'll get several years of use from it.A couple notes:1.  This cup isn't designed to be filled to the brim.  There is a marking line on the inside of the cup that tells you how far you can fill it -- go beyond the line, and you'll find that liquid squirts out the spout when you snap the lid on!  I got squirted in the eye a handful of times before I figured this out.2.  This cup has no valve and is NOT leakproof.  If your child holds it upside down with the spout open, liquid will slowly drip out.  So while this is my favorite sippy cup overall, I don't allow my child to use it in his carseat or on the sofa.
