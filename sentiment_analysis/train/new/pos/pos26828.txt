I think the sound of the average squeaker is slightly annoying, so I was intrigued when a number of reviews stated the squeaker doesn't work.  So technically I bought this hoping mine would be defective also, and it is.  I've squeezed that squeaker at least 25 times and got nuthin'. Yaaaay.  Except that it isn't defective after all.  My grandbaby was just here, I gave it to her, and she proceeded to shake it wildly and wap it hard onto her daddy's leg with all the exuberance a 6 month old can muster and it squeaks just fine, producing big smiles from baby.  That is apparently the secret:  to smack the neck, in front or in back.  Works every time. It's not an annoying squeak (I'm used to the family dog's toys, ugh), just a cute and quick one, and she loves this thing. Grandma just got major points for very little money.
