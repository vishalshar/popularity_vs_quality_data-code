Very comfortable.. color is not bad...... it's very gender neutral incase you want to use for next child. Also we have the red chair which is very hard to match a cushion color with (we tried many) this one looks beautiful with the wood color and it goes really well together!  I feel this would match all the wood stains..... Definitely recommend!
