I bought these when my daughter was about 6 months old to start holding snacks when we went out to eat or running errands. She is now 3 and still uses them! She loves the cute design (I really didn't think she would even pay attention to it) and the fact that she can hold the cup herself and nothing will spill out. I know use these cups a few times a week for when I take her jogging (she eats snacks in the stroller) and when I run errands on the weekends. They do fine in the dishwasher but I mostly just hand wash them since we use them so often. They are such a great snack holder that I buy them as part of a baby gift for all my new mom friends.
