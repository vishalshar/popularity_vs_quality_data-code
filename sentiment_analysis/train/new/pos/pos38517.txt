We already owned two graco turboboosters with backs, which are also fine.  However, we found that the evenflo big kid had a much better ease of use rating with the National Highway Transportation Safety administration.  In addition, the seat has more padding and the dual cupholder/snack trays have great capacity for drinks, snacks, and rock collections.The kids love the seat!
