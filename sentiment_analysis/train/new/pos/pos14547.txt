I bought this bouncer a few days after we brought my son home from the hospital, because I wanted somewhere else to put him down besides the pack'n play. He's 5 months old now and he's sat in it everyday since we got it. I liked it because it's nesty, and when he was very little it cradled him and he seemed able to snuggle down in the seat. It also has a nice wide base, so although it's springy, it's not going to tip over easily. The fabric is machine washable, and the fuzzy part stays soft even after you wash it. My son doesn't really care about the sounds or vibrations, and after two months he didn't care about the toys either (in fact, we've taken the toy bar off completely), but it gives him another view of the world and he likes to sit and watch the dog walk by.***Update: I am still very happy with this bouncer, however I would like to point out that it does not come apart for storage. Once you put it together it stays that way. If space is an issue for you, this might not be the best choice.
