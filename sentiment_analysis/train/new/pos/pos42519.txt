We love the "take and toss" series.  My boys are big John Deere fans so these were a must.  They ask for these cups almost every morning.  We always have a pair in our diaper bag in case we are in need of a sippy.  I use these with my 2 and 3 year old.  They are dishwasher safe and have a little "keeper" that prevents them from spilling.  The only negatives that I can think of are that it only comes with 1 stopper and my 2 year old ruined 1 after 1 use by biting the plastic.  Thus, the plastic must not be that tough, but I don't expect it to be with how much they cost.  We have washed these multple times and the design on the cup still looks brand new.  My 3 year old can ever put the cap on by himself which is a huge plus.
