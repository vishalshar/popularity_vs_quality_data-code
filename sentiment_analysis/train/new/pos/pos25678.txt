This product had few reviews I could find, so I took a chance and I'm very glad I did.  No chemical smell at all, fits my DaVinci Emily crib perfectly, and my twins are sleeping better, I swear!  I had actually purchased cheap non-organic coil mattresses when they were born, and the mattresses wore through quickly.  So I bought this mattress to use on the "toddler" side, and they are lovely.  Just purchase an organic waterproof cover ASAP. :)Because I did not purchase this for an infant, I can't really comment on the infant side, except tp say that I'm SOOO bummed I didn't start with this mattress.  The infant side feels firm - like there's a board of sorts underneath the mattress - but it is covered with the same fabric that the toddler side is covered in, and seem like it would be perfectly safe and lovely for a newborn-infant.Finally, I had no idea about whether foam would be better than coil or vice versa, because I have only ever had coil mattresses, but the foam is great. Less jumping, and it seems so comfortable.  The kids really love their cozy cribs!  (I don't know if it's a coincidence, but my daughter is now asking for her crib, and that never used to happen!)The price point is great, too.  Very. very pleased.
