I have bought 2 of these. One for my home and one for my mother's home because she frequently watches my daughter. My daughter is 15 months and we have (slowly) been working on potty training her since she was able to stand on her own. The 5 year old I babysit uses it as a stool so he can wash his hands and reach the light switch. My daughter has no trouble opening it or sitting down on it. The front is contoured and raised slightly to keep urine from going the wrong direction. The opening is wide enough for her to pee and poop without hitting the seat but not so wide that she falls in. I love the fact that she will be able to use the seat on a regular toilet when she is taller. The cup for catching waste is easy to remove and clean, but not so easy that my daughter can remove it (yet). It is lightweight but sturdy.I think my only complaint about this potty is that it is kinda big. I have a small bathroom and it takes up a lot of space.
