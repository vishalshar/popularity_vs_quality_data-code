These are great for when your baby is ready to move up to the next flow level, usually around 3 months. I noticed that my son was collapsing the level 1 nipples and making lots of loud sucking noises/getting frustrated while eating, beginning a couple of weeks ago, so I picked up some of these level 2's and it fixed the problem. Something else to note is that these nipples will work well with the Born Free wide neck bottles too (I use a combo of Born Free and Dr. Brown's bottles). They are exactly the same as the Born Free nipple (so far as I can tell), but they are considerably cheaper!
