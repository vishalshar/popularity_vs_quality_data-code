This pillow is the only thing helping me sleep through the night in my 3rd trimester. I bought it in the middle of my 2nd trimester when I was just starting to toss and turn and haven't gone a night without it since. The adjustable wedge is great, I tend to keep it slightly off-center so there's enough of the "c" shaped back pillow to put between my knees, saving me the need for another pillow. I slept great with this pillow and none others for several weeks, and am now using this pillow and one more between my feet at 35 weeks. I also appreciate that you can flip the wedge up behind the "c" and use it as a reclining pillow on the couch now that I'm on bed rest, and in that position the "arms" of the pillow are high enough I think I may be able to use it as a nursing pillow too. We have a sectional sofa and it fits perfect in the reclining position in the corner of the sectional. Well worth the money.UPDATE: I am now using this pillow comfortably to nurse and I fold it on half to prop my feet up to help reduce post-partem leg/foot/ankle swelling. I highly recommend, you more than get your money's worth.
