I breastfed my first child for 17 months and tried out a few different covers. I didn't really feel like any of them were exactly what I wanted....either they didn't cover my stomach (if I had to pull my shirt up) or they didn't provide much cover or one of many other issues. I heard about the InfinityMom nursing scarves from a friend on Facebook and thought that I would definitely try them when I had our second baby. Well, we just had our second baby about a month ago and I have been using this scarf since the day he was born. It is AMAZING!!! Great, lightweight fabric; nice design; fantastic fit; the list goes on and on. I love the fact that the scarf goes all the way around my body, unlike so many other nursing covers. I will be telling all breastfeeding moms about this for sure!
