Really loving it . Skinniest bolster but very nice to hug to sleepesp if there is very little room for any body pillow space on the bed.Not pregnant so I  easily removed the small little wedge becoz it can be quite hard and uncomfortable to rest on it.Very nice and serves its purpose well without compromising space on the bed.
