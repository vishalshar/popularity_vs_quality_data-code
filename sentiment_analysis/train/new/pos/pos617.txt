We've had this teething ring for 2-3 weeks now. She loved it right off the bat! It's easy for the baby to grip. She was frustrated at first, when she wanted to get the colored beads in her mouth & couldn't figure out how. Now she uses gravity to her advantage or her hands to manipulate them to stick out. It's helped her dexterity! It rattles a little when shaken. Nice for getting her attention. I can poke out a single bead & tell her the colors. It's handy in many ways. The only drawback is that the wood finish is already wearing down on the ring. I hoped it would last a little longer. Her teeth haven't grown in at all yet!
