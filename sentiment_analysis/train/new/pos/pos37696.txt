These strap covers are the best I've purchased. The strap covers with the animal heads attached are adorable but can really be a hassle when they  get twisted around, or when your child is bigger, it can make for a tight fit. THESE strap covers, on the other hand, are well decorated and still have aesthetics that are interesting to the child's sense of touch, but these do not get in the way. They also withstand the washing machine well.
