I did a fair amount of online research before selecting this product.  Price was a secondary factor.  Primarily I was concerned with safety, size, and comfort.I bought this car seat for my 14-month daughter, who was petite.  I feel the smallest buckle settings are working well.  The reclining feature is very useful.  I didnt' think the armrests would make a difference since she is too small, but she likes to hold on to them at times.I have an elantra touring (car) and with the car seat in the middle console/armrest can still be brought down for use.  two petite adults can comfortably sit in the back as well for short trips.Cup holder I find useless; though it might help when my daughter is older.
