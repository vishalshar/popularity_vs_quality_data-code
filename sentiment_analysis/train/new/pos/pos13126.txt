I really like these.  When they are closed there is no leakage.  If I leave the straw open for a good length of time there will be some leakage as the milk works it's way up the straw.  Assembly can be a little tricky the first time, but now it's easy to break it apart and put it back together, maybe 3-4 seconds longer than assembling her sippy cup.  The characters on the outside have faded through many washings, but appearances don't really bother me.  The cup still works as it did the first day we got it nine months ago.
