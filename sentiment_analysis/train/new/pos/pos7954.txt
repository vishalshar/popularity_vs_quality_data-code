I really love this bag and get compliments everywhere I go! I love the many inside and outside compartments and the outside is easily cleaned. Four stars for two reasons; one, the handles need some kind of grip so they won't slide off one's shoulder. Two, the closure is just one snap that pops right back open even when the bag isn't overloaded.
