My almost-2-year-old loves it. The things in this book are just simple enough she doesn't get too frustrated but just interesting enough she doesn't get bored either. The only thing I wish was different is the snaps in this thing are really difficult even for me, the adult! I'm hoping this will improve over time with use.Everything is as pictured and I would recommend this item to anyone with a toddler they need to keep quiet for any period of time. Great to keep in the diaper bag.
