My first never liked pacifiers, but loved his orange Wubbanub. It was something for him to grab, hug, and shake. My 2nd baby loves pacifiers (2-3months old baby), but she always tries to hold them an pulls them out, flinging them out and cries. With her Black & White kitty Wubbanub she can hold and cuddle it without instantly yanking out her Binky. She even now enjoys playing with it without the Binky in her mouth, and is sometimes able to grab it and manage the Binky in her mouth again on her own!
