Love that it's organic since my baby sucks her thumb with the glove on.  Does it's job of preventing her from scratching her face.  Pretty economical for being organic.  Few organic options available.  Only thing is not particularly sturdy and after a few washes some of them had elastic at cuff start to break that's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.  If you want sturdy option, Goumi mitt are very well made and hold up well in wash, but also much more expensive ($12!) so I didn't buy many.  Since my baby needs to change them often because drools on them, good to have this less expensive option too.
