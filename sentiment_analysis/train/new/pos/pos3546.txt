I started these seeds in late March (a month or so before last frost) and now the plants are a good five feet tall in their cages.  They really do grow well in containers as advertized.  I have two large pots with three plants each, and although they may be a little over crowded I've been giving them at least a gallon of water per pot each day and they're full, healthy, and have a ton of tomatoes on them.  The best part is the tomatoes are delicious!  They're each about 1 and 1/4 inches in diameter, and seem sweeter and less seedy than other varieties I've tried.  Supermarket tomatoes can't hope to compare.  These are great plants, highly recommended!
