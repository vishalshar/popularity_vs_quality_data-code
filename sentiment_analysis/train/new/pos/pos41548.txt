Bought these sheets for the Dream on me 5" spring coil portable mattress, for our two DaVinci Emily mini cribs. Sheet barely fits over the sides. I have it stretched toward the front so the mattress isn't showing, but in the backside of crib (against the wall) the sheet is only partially covering the mattress. I'm considering sheet clips to ensure it stays in place. I'd also recommend drying these on low to prevent it from shrinking, otherwise it would for sure not fit. Fabric is also really thin - probably due to it being so stretched. It'll do for now until I can find sheets that fit.
