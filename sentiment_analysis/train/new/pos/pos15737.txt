I love both the yellow apple and the blue fish. I wish Natursutten would make more styles. The colors get my daughter's attention, the texture fascinates her fingers (she runs them over the bumps), and they are a wonderful fit for her little hands to manipulate. It doesn't hold the cold from the refridgerator very long, but that is not something I consider to be a problem. It is cold long enough for her to be fascinated with the chilly feeling and numb her mouth a bit. I wouldn't want her hands holding on to something so cold for very long anyway - they get cold enough as it is. And by the time it warms up, it's usually been thrown on the ground and needs to be exchanged.They are a bit on the more expensive side, but I am a very firm believer in that you get what you pay for. These are quality items that I felt were worth the extra money.
