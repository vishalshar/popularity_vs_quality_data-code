FINALLY! All other gates on the market with a small-pet hole are actually for large pets, not children, and have different safety standards, so this has been a long time coming. Important to us not to destroy our cats lives during our son's growing years. Our 1 year old is successfully "caged" while our cats roam. Both cats - one a little stupid; one shy, had no problems at all figuring out how to use it and seem relieved for the barrier and escape route. MUST HAVE for keeping our son out of the room with our cat litters!! Some reviews mention children crawling thru, but it would be a very low, complicated, tight squeeze for any child with a moderate head size even tho our heafty cat squeezes thru. Only complaint would be they don't also make a swing-door version. Safety 1st could make a killing offering a doored version and an x-tra long. Brilliant price and genius product for anyone who considers their cats family too. VERY nice looking - chocolate stained wood and high-quality cream interior. Super easy to install and move around. Soft edges on opening. LOVE this. Please make more!!!
