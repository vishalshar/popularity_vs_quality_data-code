I never thought I would be one of those parents who has their child on a "leash", but after my 3 year old son disappeared in the blink of an eye on more than one occasion, I needed something to keep him close by.  I considered a harness/backpack, but worried that he would get too warm from wearing it and wanted something a little discreet and less expensive.  This has worked great!!! I recently used it at the airport, and was able to handle the carry-on bags and him with little effort.  He didn't really like being tied onto mom, but I kept my sanity.  Plus, he was more cooperative in the moments he got a little freedom.  I put the velcro end on my a belt loop and the clip on his, so we could get a little more length out of it and he wouldn't remove the velcro. Worth every penny!! Wish I would've gotten it sooner.
