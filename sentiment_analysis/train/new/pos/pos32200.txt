I initially purchased this apron before my son was born. My husband and I use it every night when we bathe our baby boy who is 10 mos old now.  It is an awesome product that we both love!  You can wear it during bathtime to stay dry (while baby splashes) as the product's name implies, or just put it on right before you take your little one out of the tub.  It allows you to have both hands free while handling your wet(and slippery) baby so you can carefully remove him/her from the tub to dry off.  This apron is a nice quality terrycloth that is very absorbent and easy to put on and pull off quickly.  It has velcro tabs behind the neck and apron stings that you can tie around your waist but we find that the its not necessary to tie them.  We've used our apron nearly everyday for almost a year and it's still in great shape.  It washes and dries great but my only suggestion is to place the velcro tabs together before washing so that they do not catch on anything else you are washing with it.  As an extra precaution, I always put mine in a large mesh laundry bag before throwing it in the wash as well.  Probably not necessary but I do this with anything that has velcro on it (bibs, outfits, etc).  Just keeps baby's things looking new longer.  Would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a baby!  My husband and I love it so much that I just purchased a second one as a shower gift for a friend.
