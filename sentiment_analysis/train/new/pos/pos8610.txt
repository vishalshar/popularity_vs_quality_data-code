I love this Halo Sleepsack. We received the fleece one as a gift before my baby was born and had been using that prior to purchasing this one. Our baby is very picky about how he likes to sleep - he hates being swaddled but at the same time hates just wearing a sleeper in his crib. As soon as we tried the fleece one, he started sleeping longer stretches at night! We were relieved that we found something that can keep him warm, but also be safe for him. My baby runs pretty warm and now that it is getting warmer outside, we decided to buy this cotton blanket. This is much lighter, but seems to be warm enough for my baby during naps and at night time. He has come to know that when this sleepsack is on, it means it is time to sleep. The sleeveless design reassures me that he will not overheat. I usually can just leave him with short sleeves but on cooler nights, I will put a long sleeve. I like the flexibility that the sleeveless sleepsack has to offer. Love it and would definitely purchase again!
