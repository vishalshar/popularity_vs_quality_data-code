great little product.  the switch plate is quite solid in construction and was easy to mount.  Very colourful and cute addition to our little girls room and she loves turning it on and off and feeling the characters too.  The night light is alright but the base seems a little cheap compared to the actual light cover which is quite solid and heavy.  as long as you don't mind putting it onto another standard nightlight base it should be fine.
