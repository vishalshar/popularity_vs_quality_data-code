My daughter refused to take a bottle so we tried this sippy cup when she was about 5 months old.  She was teething so she gummed down on the end and figured out there was liquid inside.  Since then she's gotten better and better at using it.  At first, I thought the opening was going to be too hard for her to get anything out (I tried it myself) but she eventually got the hang of it.  Even if she's not drinking, she loves to hold it by the handles and shake it.  As other reviewers have said, if you don't get this cup put together just right it does leak, which is annoying but the spout is so durable with those incoming teeth I don't care.  It just takes a little more attention than other cups but nothing major.
