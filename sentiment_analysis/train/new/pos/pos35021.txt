Baby and I really love our Beachfront Baby wrap! My only "complaint" is that the fabric is slippery when it's dry and you're moving quickly. Baby was slumping lower and off to the side when I was running through the airport to catch a flight. I know it's designed for use in the water, but I just wanted to let others know about that aspect. I wish there were a fabric that could perform on water and dry land.
