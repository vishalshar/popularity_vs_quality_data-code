We tried multiple bottles (Dr. Browns, Tommee Tippee, Avent) and none of them was what we were looking for. Dr. Browns I found to be difficult to clean, Tommee Tippee's nipples always collapsed while in use and Avent always leaked. Then, my friend suggessted these bottles.Let me first start off by saying, yes there are quite a few pieces to wash, but they aren't as cumbersome to clean like the Dr. Browns bottles in my opinion. I have had these bottles leak from the bottom but that was my own fault for not putting the vent in correctly. Some reviewers said they had to be very precise with putting the vents in and I have not noticed that. I just wait until they are fully dried before putting them in. There have been times when there was a gap, but again that was my own fault.I can actually hear the air venting out while my son is sucking on them and he has much less gassy with these bottles which was our ultimate goal! You can't beat the price for this 5-pack of bottles anywhere else.. so order right now, you won't regret it!Also, all the bottles are white (which I like). They do not include any of the pastel colors like you see in the stores.
