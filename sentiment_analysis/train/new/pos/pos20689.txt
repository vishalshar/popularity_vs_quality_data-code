I had been looking for a high chair for my grandson. I wanted it to fit him until he is ready to graduate from a high chair, I wanted it to be plastic, so it could be cleaned and sanitized easily, and above all, it needed to be safe. I run a preschool/child care out of my home, so any high chair I bought, had to meet certain safety standards, which include legs with a wide spread to prevent tipping. This high chair met all the above criteria :) It also has an easily removable cloth seat/back pad, it turns into a toddler chair, it has a 5 point harness, and a leg divider on the tray when it is attached, so baby can`t slip through. I really love this chair!
