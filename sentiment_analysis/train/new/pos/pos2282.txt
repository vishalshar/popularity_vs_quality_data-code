My kids love this, and getting them to brush their teeth has never been easier! I used to have to fight them to brush, but now they volunteer and even get the brushes ready themselves (3 and 5 years old). I'm not a fan of rewarding kids for simple everyday tasks, but I must admit this one was worth it. They'll develop healthy habits that will stick with them forever (assuming they won't need the chart when they are 30!).
