These containers are great for keeping the baby's food warm for quite a while, and they're small and easily portable - great for traveling.  The only downside I can see that you aren't supposed to microwave the container itself (per the  manufacturer's instructions), so you have to heat the food in something else first and then place it in the container.I'm ordering more of these so we can keep one of these at Nana's house and one at daycare - everybody wants one now.
