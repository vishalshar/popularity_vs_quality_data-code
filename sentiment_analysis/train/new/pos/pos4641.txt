I was a little scared to buy this adapter after I read some of the reviews, but I'm glad I did it works wonderfully! Exactly as it should directions on how to place them are on the adapters themselves very self explanatory, took 1 min to place on to the stroller and and super easy to remove. Would recommend it.
