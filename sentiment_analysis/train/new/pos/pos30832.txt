Great product for value! Very well made to stand up to the beating that a drum literally takes.Fairly quiet as far as drums go so if your kids want a drum and you have an aversion to loud noise this would be the way to go!Classic wood design offers timeless and gender less  appeal so if you have a boy and a girl this us something they can share happily.Bright colors encourage creativity and play. You can definitely tell that hape takes pride in quality and workmanship as this has very obviously been polished to a nice soft and smooth finish.I read a review that said this was of poor quality as far as durability goes. I have to say I disagree. I watched my 3 1/2 year ild stand on the drum and not so much as crack or damage a single part of it.I would definitely and easily give this all 5 stars.
