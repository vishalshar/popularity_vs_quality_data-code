I bought this for my baby girl and it was a steal! It's cute and simple which is what I was looking for since I had done a Jungle themed nursery for my first baby girl and it was a lot...the material is very thin and you can see some padding around the edges but for this price and all the accessories what do you expect? Other than that it washes easy and you can always buy other sheets which I normally do cause you end up getting crap sheets with any bed set you buy. But other than that I love it and the nursery turned out great =) hope this helps.
