We live overseas and wanted to buy a car seat to leave at my parents house because renting a car seat is highway robbery. We also wanted something that would fit an economy/compact rental car. This seat is perfect!!!!! Last trip we had a Fiat 500 2-door rental which is so incredibly tiny, and this car seat fit perfectly behind the passenger seat with enough room for the passenger (my 6-ft dad was able to still sit in the front seat). It was so super duper easy to install with LATCH (we've only used it RF so that's my reference).I have only owned an infant car seat so I can't say how it stands up to other convertibles but I think it's a pretty great seat. I don't really know if my baby was comfy because she can't talk but she sure did look snugly and cozy, and she fell asleep basically every car ride so I think that means she was comfy. The material has such a nice feel to it- a nice squishy-ness. This sounds silly, but I'd happily sit in something that felt as soft as this car seat! I don't see why people have issues with the buckle. Sometimes my baby was crying and we still got her in it as easily as in our infant car seat. The little loops to hold the buckle aside are a nice detail. Also the Keylime color is so super cute. I am really sad we couldn't bring this back to Europe with us, I really wish they sold it here, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.I took someone's advice from an older review and checked the manufacturer date on the box, something about it being after 8/2011 to make sure the tethers are included. Anyways mine was fine- maybe this is no longer an issue.
