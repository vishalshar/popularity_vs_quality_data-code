My husband and I purchased a lot of barely used BumGenius Elementals off of Craig's List right before having our first baby. Any time we find them on sale we purchase a few. We love these diapers. We have tried the BumGenius Freestyles and they just don't hold up. Here are my thoughts.Pros:The inside of these are made from natural fiber cloth, meaning they absorb much better than synthetic fiber and they do no need to be stripped.Repeat: they do not need to be stripped oftenThese are easier to spray poop out of than the FreeStylesWe have been using them for two years and I still have not had to replace the elastic. I had problems with the leg elastic with Rumparooz in less than a year.You can sun out most stains. We strip and sun our diapers once a year at the beginning of each summer.These are my daycare's favorite cloth diapers because of the ease of use.Cons:Depending on the way you hold the diaper to spray it out, you can get pieces of poop under the fabric where the snaps are on the inside.The cloth does stain easier than synthetic fiber so your diapers may not look clean, even after washing them.The cotton takes longer to dry. For us this meant adding a few more to our stash so we don't have to stress about getting diapers dry.These are the most expensive diapers we have tried.
