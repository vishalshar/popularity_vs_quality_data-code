We are very happy with these. They are super soft and have strong velcro closure. They are slim, just big enough to go around the strap (very important because anything thicker than a fleece jacket is dangerous to have under the straps of a car seat). They have worked perfectly for my son in his all-in-on car seat since he was about 14 months old (that's when I got them). Our infant car seat had it's own built in strap covers so we didn't need these with it. These are probably too long to use for an infant because there just isn't enough strap exposed before the chest clip (which MUST be level with baby's arm pits).Was this review helpful for you?
