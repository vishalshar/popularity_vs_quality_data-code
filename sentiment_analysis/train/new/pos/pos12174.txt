I'm going to be VERY honest.... when I first received the sleep sack I was getting ready to return it.  Honestly It didn't look or feel worth the price.  It seemed small, it didn't seem warm enough or how would he be cool enough.  In any case... I decided to try it on the baby (he's six months) and the second I put it over him he hugged it and squeezed and that's what sold me.  He's also been having some of the best night sleeps in it.  He's usually a good sleeper and normally I put him down and let him fall a sleep on his own.  There are time if he's not quite ready to fall as a sleep that he fusses a little.  In this sleep sack he must be so comfortable so at peace that he's no fuss.  And every time I'm putting it on at night he hugs and closes his eyes, just the cutest thing you've ever seen.  So I love it... because he loves it.  I've been thinking of purchasing a second one so we can alternate.  I'm very happy with the purchase and now it seems priceless....I would also like to note, that I had to wash it twice in one week because basically he was in between diaper sizes and the size 3 diapers just weren't holding him over night before so I had to wash it because there were two morning that he was very wet.  And the Sleep Sack still looks like I just pulled out the box.  I'm beyond happy.
