We use this A LOT.To put it in perspective, we live in Seattle (where it rains for about 8 months a year) and we go outside on a walk or jog nearly everyday. We have used it on leisurely walks and intense jogs, on sidewalks and trails, in a light rain and in windy, pounding rain. It still looks great and we never have to worry about it moving around or coming off.The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because some rain guards fold up a little smaller than this one. It is really easy to get the fold correct, though, unlike some others I have used.As a note: This is on our 2006 Bumbleride Indie.  I put the year because the shape is a little different from the new strollers but it fits perfectly!
