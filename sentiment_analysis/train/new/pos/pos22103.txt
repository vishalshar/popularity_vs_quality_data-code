I just got this diaper about a week ago, but I absolutely LOVE IT! It fits very nicely on my 12 lb daughter on the smallest settings, so she has A TON of room to grow in it. When she 1st wore it she took a nap in it and when she woke up NO LEAKS. This diaper was also sent to me with 2 soaker pads (a long one and a shorter one). That was a big deal for me because a lot of diapers only come with one which makes this a good buy for sure! The 2 soakers also come in handy cause my girl is a heavy wetter. After I washed this diaper, it was still as vibrant as the day I took it out of the package and it didn't "bleed" onto any of my other diapers. The soakers agitated out in the wash on their own (I own a front loader) so I didn't have to touch them to take them out (yuck!). And the best part, for me anyway, is that it dried in a standard dryer cycle. This is a big deal to me! Before this diaper my Bummis Tots Bots was my favorite due to ease of use, but took 2 dry cycles to get completely dry. This one doesn't which helps me save energy (and we all know electricity cost is HIGH these days).Aside from the qualities of this diaper, I would like to say the owner emailed me very shortly after I placed my order to see if it was for a boy or girl. I love that kind of personalized customer service! (Of course I said I just wanted a multicolor one, but it was still SUPER nice to be asked).I would DEFINITELY buy diapers from ButterBears again and I would reccommend them to anyone I know!
