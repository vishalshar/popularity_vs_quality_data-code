Seriously, how did I survive without this thing before now?For kiddo #1, I didn't use any baby monitor.However when kiddo #2 came along, and was going to be sharing a room with 2-year-old big brother, I thought I needed to upgrade to the video coverage. And I'm SO glad I did.The cameras work great. I have two set up in the same room, one set on the baby's bed and one on the toddler's. It gives me great peace of mind to be able to watch them sleep and to check on them in the middle of the night without actually opening their door and risk waking them up.Plus, my two year old thinks I'm God when I tell him, through the speaker in the monitor, "Lay down" when he tries to get out of bed when he is supposed to be sleeping.Yep. One of the best purchases ever.
