These bottles are great. My daughter was exclusively breastfed, but needed bottles for when she started daycare. We bought these because they are apparently great for babies with gas or colic. We were lucky that she didn't have colic so I can't speak to that, but they have worked great. She started taking a bottle with breastmilk at around 6 or 7 weeks, and didn't have any trouble eating from these the first time. We've tried a few other bottles since, and while she does fine in them, she really seems to prefer the wide neck bottles. She uses the bottles at daycare and nurses at night, and doesn't have any trouble going back and forth from bottle to nursing.I was worried that cleaning them would be a huge pain since they have a few more parts, but it really isn't an issue. It doesn't really add any time, and it's worth it to try to minimize the amount of air she sucks in while eating at daycare.
