My 2 year old Grandson loves his first taggie so much that it is hard to get it away from him to wash it.  I decided I needed to get another one for him.  Unfortunately I picked another adorable pattern.  He doesn't like change.  So far he has rejected it, so I think I will have to get one just like his original.  That's O.K. because he has a new baby brother who is too little to know what it is for.  We'll save it for him.Warning to parents and Grandparents: Either buy 2 at a time, or when you come back, you'll have to buy the same pattern.
