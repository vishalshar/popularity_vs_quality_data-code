These were a must in the first 6 weeks of our little guy's life! Yes, you could just use a wipe to drape over the pee pee, but that doesn't absorb anything and it goes dripping down his legs and tummy. These were mandatory at every diaper changing station in our house in his first weeks! They absorb the pee in the terry-cloth inside. I'd rinse them out and use them again. After a couple uses, they're easy to pop in the washing machine. Recommend for any mamas of little boys.
