After finally updating my 2 year old son's nursery to a big boys room, we decided to go with a Toy Story themed bedroom.  I was worried about him not staying in his bed at night after converting his crib to a toddler bed, but this set brought the excitement we needed to keep him in bed all night.  He's been in his toddler bed for 7 days now and he absolutely can not wait to go to bed and sleep with either Woody or Buzz - he flips his pillow once he decides.  The material is of a good sturdy quality, i washed the set as soon as it arrived and it came out of the washer and dryer looking just like new, the stitching held up and looks like it's going to hold up for years.  Good buy!
