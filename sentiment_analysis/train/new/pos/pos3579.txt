A beautiful masterpiece.I recommend putting the teeth in hot water and shaping them to the curve of your teeth before you put the fitting beads in them. After that put the beads in hot water and push them into the teeth to be fitted to your smiley grill.After I first fit mine I wore them around for about 20mins and then set them aside for a few days. When I put them back in they felt very tight and didn't fit quite right. I just ran them under some hot water and refit them. Was comfortable the rest of the night.
