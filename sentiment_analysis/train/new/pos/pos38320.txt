After some intense research I decided to purchase this Samsung video monitor. I was skeptical due to the fact I couldn't test it before purchasing it. I've read reviews on other products of grainy screens, poor sound, interference with wireless modems etc. The fact is, this is the best purchase for a video baby monitor. I can't believe it was only $169. I've looked at other models in the $250-$300+ and not nearly as compatible.Pros- The picture is amazing. I do photography so I am very particular when it comes to resolution and clarity.The night view is wonderful- you can change the contrast and not grainy at all.On the camera you can set the sensitivity level as well as the volume for the music and voice intercom.There are two zoom levels, they are both very clear.From the hand held screen, you can activate the music in the nursery without going in the room, as well as turn on/off the night light.The temperature reading-I read another review stating it reads about 10 degrees warmer on this model- ours has been accurate.There is barely any delay-really it's about 1 second off.The battery life is fair- what I expected for a 3.5 inch screen. It will beep three times when you need to plug it in.You have the option of a beep or vibrate for the voice activation.You can set the screen on a timer- it will go off, but activate when she makes a noise or moves- I have it set on the more sensitive side.The intercom is great- my husband said it was very clear and she recognized my voice.CONS- there is not a single thing wrong with this model. (The more expensive Samsung models have a pan option- I have the camera on the wall in a corner and can see the entire nursery (12x14)and zoom in on the crib. Pan not needed!)A MUST BUY you will not be disappointed. I am very particular about the items I write reviews on. I hope this helps you make an educated decision on your purchase. Good luck!!Amazon is a plus- 2 day shipping, arrived the next day!
