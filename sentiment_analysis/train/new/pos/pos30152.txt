We bought these two hooks for our NUNA baby stroller in order for my wife to be able to hang her bag and other items (the stroller does not come with any hooks or other type of hangers). The packaging of the item was great, insulated inside a plastic container. The hooks are as adertised and even bigger than I originally thought. Installation is an ease. Just remove the velcro straps, attach to the position of the stroller bar that you desire, and then strap them out. They look and feel secured and are able to hold heavy items (like a full women's bag or bag full of diapers).
