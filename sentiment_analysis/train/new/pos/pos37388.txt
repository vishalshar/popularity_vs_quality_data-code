I have tried five different brands and these are by far the best and most comfortable, way better than Medella, Nuk, Tommy Tippee, etc. They also helped increase my production- I think because they have slightly larger openings. Less sore, way more milk and now my son is only waking up once or twice a night because he is getting more milk at each feeding. I wish I had this with my first two kids!
