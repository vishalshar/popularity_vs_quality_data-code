Before our son was born, my mother-in-law offered to get us a jogging stroller, but thought that I wouldn't use it much, so I opted for the regular travel-system type.  Knowing what I know now, I made a mistake.  Not only is this stroller perfect to jog/walk with, but we will also use it for camping, trips to the beach, etc.  I find that traditional strollers just cannot navigate well in the outside environment; they are more suited for shopping/indoor-type activities.  After researching the joggers, I discovered that In Step also makes this stroller for Schwinn.  That information, coupled with the fact that my neighbor has this stroller and loves it, convinced me to try it.  It was a snap to put together, I had it completed in less than 10 minutes.  I am pleasantly surprised with the ease in which I can run with it; it is both light yet sturdy, and has a nice, smooth ride for my toddler.  I would have to agree that with an infant it might not be the ideal vehicle to use for travel, but once the child can sit up, it should be fine.  I also agree with the assessment on sharp turns with the stroller, but popping the front wheel up to turn is very easy, and I have yet to find a jogger that does have a smooth sharp-turning radius.  All in all I found this to be a great jogger at a fantastic price that I would recommend to anyone who is not necessarily satisfied with a 'traditional' stroller, runner or not.
