I was a little nervous about purchasing this since it does not have a LATCH system.  My six year old son has been using this for about 3 weeks and we are both happy with it.  He wanted a booster seat like his friends but I wanted a Britax that gave me the peace-of-mind.  He can buckle the seat belt and bottom strap easily by himself.  After seeing him fall asleep on the drive home from camp, I'm glad I ordered this rather than a backless booster.  I have standard upholstery in my Acadia and we've never had the booster seat slip while he gets in or out of the car.
