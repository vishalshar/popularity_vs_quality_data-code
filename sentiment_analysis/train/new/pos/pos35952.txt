I bought these hangers for my son's nursery. The color is exactly what was pictured on line and they arrived in a fair amount of time - these were not available via Amazon Prime so it was ground shipping and took just over a week. I did have to let them air out because the packaging had a foul odor when they first arrived. I almost sent them back. But after a day or so the hangers themselves were fine. We think it was the plastic they were wrapped in. So far they hang clothes beautifully and the size is just right for his 6m-18m+ sized outfits.
