1.  Smells great...I loved smelling my babies breath from the pacifier(pink/vanilla scent).  Do not over boil the pacifier or the smell will go away, keep it at about 5 mins. tops.2.  Did not irritate my babies eczema.3.  If your baby loved this pacifier and begins to spit it out after a month or two, then you need to upgrade to the next size (newborn to full term).
