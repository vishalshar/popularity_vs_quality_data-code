I am super happy with these prefolds.  I used the infant size of the osocozy prefolds (4x8x4) in the size one Thirsties duo wraps from birth (7.5 lbs) to age 10 months (30" and 23 lbs).  The infant size osocozy prefolds fit great in the Thirsties size one wraps.  On the smaller cover setting, I just folded the prefold over (in the front for boys).I prepared the diapers with a boil on the stove for 15 minutes, a line dry (most of the way) and then a fluff dry in the dryer.  The diapers quilted up nicely and are super absorbent.  After the initial prep, I sun dry when I can, definitely the best way to get out stains.*Update*  10 monthsMy original 36 infant prefolds still are in great condition, but my little guy is getting too big for them.  I just purchased the toddler size prefolds to use in the Thirsties size 2.  Unfortunately, I found the diapers are a little too big to fit in the Thirsties size 2 covers on the smallest setting.  Talk about a fluffy bottom!  I can fold the toddler size over to make them fit, but it looks a bit awkward on the little guy.  I just ordered a set of the Premium size osozocy prefolds and think those will work much better.  So much for trying to save buying the in between size and just buying the toddler size, but I'll definitely be using the toddler size for overnights.*Update*  16 monthsI still love these prefolds.  Super soft and absorbent.  In my Thirsties size 2 covers the Premium size works better than the Toddler size, but of course they are not as absorbent (though still work great!).  We use the Premium size during the day because the smaller size gives a much trimmer bottom allowing shorts/pants to fit.  The Toddler size is awesome at night, keeping the bed dry.If I could do it again, after graduating from the INFANT size I would order two packs of the PREMIUM size (for use during the day) and one pack of the TODDLER size for use at night.  I highly recommend these diapers.
