We bought this for our 5 yr old as a dress up box that will hopefully grow with her into her teens. We wanted something that wasn't babyish that she could always be able to store something in. This did the trick. I found it cheaper at 3 other online places but they didn't have the color pink. The only downfall is the woody smell inside. I wish the inside were lined or something. I think this is categorized as a toychest, but honestly I think it is way nicer than the other types of toychests out there. Our daughter  uses this as a makeshift bed for her babies, sets up her barbies on it, and uses it to climb on her bed. It's versatile and is made REALLY well. I don't see it falling apart any time soon, and I'm sure it will house her diaries and secret notes and school memorabilia once she hits her teen years...Very pleased, aside from the wood smell (that I hope will dissapate soon).
