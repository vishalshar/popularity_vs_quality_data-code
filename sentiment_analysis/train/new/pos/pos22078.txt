I always bought this disposable potty topper from this seller. The price is a lot better than the other. My children always carry this for use in school. Saves time than placing toilet tissue paper around the seat. It's much more sanitary. Not only in school, we carry this one too when we go out of town to use in public restroom where there's no disposable seat topper (like in the beach or park). I don't really use the sticky thing under it. As long as you lay it correctly and sit on it without dragging the cover away, no problem. For little ones, the sticky under it should be used.
