We just traveled throughout the Riviera Mayan and I needed a carrier for my 11-month old daughter (22 pounds). I have the Bjorn but I know that after she's been in there for a while, my back starts hurting. I purchased another "back" carrier but she wasn't into it. I also carried along the Combi and we both LOVED it. It was easy to put on and place her in. She was very comfortable in it. I loved the pockets to keep my phone and wallet in and we used the rain cover on our last day returning to the airport. I was very impress with this carrier and hope to continue to use it up until the limited weight. I highly recommend this carrier!
