I'm surprised no one has mentioned this, because the most important criteria I was looking for in a straw cup was ease of sip.This is a valveless straw.  All valveless straw sippies are not alike.  Aside from the softness of the silicone, this model is no different than drinking through a standard, no frills, disposable straw.  So if your baby/toddler/kid can drink from a regular straw (i.e. can draw up enough liquid, won't draw too much too quickly to either choke or spit out), then they can drink from this cup.Mine is not leaking and I have no problem taking it apart.  I don't know why some reviewers have resorted to prying it open with a knife.I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't know how it holds up in the dishwasher or how long the straw will last, nor have I attempted to obtain straw replacements.For less than $6 on Amazon, it is worth a try.
