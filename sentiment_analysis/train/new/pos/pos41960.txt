I purchased this sleep sack off of Amazon in medium, and it was very low quality.  The fabric already had threads pulled out, the zipper was terrible quality, and it just looked like I could rip it with very little effort.  I still needed a thin sleep sack though, and this one ended up being way too big, so I purchased another in small from a local Babies-R-Us.  It was much different, to my surprise.  The zipper was much higher quality and the fabric didn't seem as weak.  I'm not sure why there was such a difference between the two products, whether it be that the one I purchased from Amazon was older or maybe the medium size is just a lower quality, but the one I purchased at the store in small was perfect.
