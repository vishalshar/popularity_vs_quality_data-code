While pregnant with our fourth child, I finally decided to invest in a jogging stroller (that was almost 3 years ago). After a lot of research, both online and in stores, I decided on the Joovy. I have trained for half-marathons, walked through numerous theme parks, and have most recently taken my Joovy to Germany.  This is truly the best baby product I have ever purchased.  The METAL footrest really is incredible (these are not found on higher-priced brands).  My older son sits on the metal footrest and rides or rests, not that this is the purpose, but impressive that the weight of a 6-year-old doesn't bend it! He also rides in the stroller on those late nights when kids start to fall asleep.  I am always surprised where the stroller can fit because it folds up pretty flat.  I have a tall, almost 3-year-old and I don't feel that the cover is too low, but you do have to secure the snaps when you fold the cover when not in use. I wish that I had this stroller for all four kids!
