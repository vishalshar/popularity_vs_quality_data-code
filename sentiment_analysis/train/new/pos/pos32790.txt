I find it a little ridiculous that I'm basically buying strings with loops on the ends of them for several dollars a pop here, but apparently that's what we're supposed to do now.  To that end, these do what they say on the tin.  I'm not super clear why MAM makes pacifiers that need a special fancy little ring that goes around them in order to even attach to the special fancy little string in the first place.  Most of my life, strings have been made out of string, and conveniently, loops can be made out of string, too, so basically I think it seems a little weird that a pacifier needs an extremely specific 3-component apparatus just to not fall on the ground.  I wish I'd've known I'd be spending an extra arm and leg for the accessories to the pacifiers I first bought when the baby was newborn.  Oh and if your husband, like mine, feels that it'd be a good idea to boil the plastic rings to clean them, and they turn into turdish little lumps of goo?  Yeah, you're SOL, because the clip won't work without the ring, and you can't buy those little mammajammas on their own, you have to buy them with a string and a clip as well.  I'm giving full marks here, though, because this review is technically about the clips as a set of 2, not about the absurdity of modern parenting.  So sure, I shouldn't even be having to buy these in the first place, but screw it, I did, and they work, and that's that.
