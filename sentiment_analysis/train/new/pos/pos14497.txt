I was expecting this product this weekend. Between Dec 6th and 8th. It arrived Nov 30. Granted my mail carrier lost it. I had contacted the seller after I contacted the post office and told them what had happened. They answered all my questions promptly. The post office actually called and it was found. It comes in a cute carry bag, the blanket is soft and has kind of quilt stitching. It is absolutely adorable and I cant wait to give my 2year old for christmas
