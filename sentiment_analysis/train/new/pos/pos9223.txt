I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel that Mountain Buggy could have made a universal connector similar to other buggy boards. That being said, this connector comes with several different adapters to fit the cross bars. I was able to toggle between the rubber adapters and the different drop angles to fit this to a Britax B-ready, Combi Flare Twin and a BabyJogger City Mini GT Double.  Haven't had time to figure out if this would work on a BabyJogger Summit XC single, but I'm so cheap I will try to avoid spending $60 on adapters for a $100 scooter :)
