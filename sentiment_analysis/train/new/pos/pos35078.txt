we got this for the back of our umbrella stroller for a trip to Europe, I used zip ties on the sides to secure it so that I knew it wouldn't get lost when checked on the plane.  It allowed me to put things in the stroller in plain sight, and not look like I was hiding anything, I didn't want my stroller to look too much like a traveling treasure chest for pick pockets.  I ended up putting my purse in the bottom later on and locking the strap around the stroller frame so that I just had to make sure nobody touched my stroller, instead of looking after a purse and a stroller.  But we still used this to throw a water bottle and a few kids snacks, and a clean diaper and wipes for running around.
