These hangers are awesome! I had both the standard plastic kiddy hangers you can buy at Target & these Nuby hangers. These Nuby hangers are far superior! They seem to hold up so much better because they just don't bend & are able to withstand so much more wear & tear.I bought the Honey-Can-Do HNGZ01327 Soft touch Universal Grip Clips, White/Blue, 36 count to clip onto the hangers so I can hang the matching pants, skirts, tights, etc. with my daughter's outfits. Using both of these products I was finally able to get rid of that mess of cheap, flimsy hangers that come with her baby clothes.
