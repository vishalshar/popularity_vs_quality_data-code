I bought these because my local stores seemed to be lacking in burp rags, so my next choice is looking on Amazon.  These were on sale on Amazon, so I decided to get a pack of the "I Love Mommy" ones as well as the "I Love Daddy" ones.  THESE ARE GREAT!!!  They're a great size (the Gerber ones I'd also ordered were super skinny!), and they're thick and really absorbant.  As with all baby stuff, they should be washed before first use - they were a bit rough right out of the package, but softened right up after a couple washes :)
