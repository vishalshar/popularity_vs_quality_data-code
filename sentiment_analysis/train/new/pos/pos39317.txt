Thanks to large size and 2 icepack inserts, this bag is perfect for storage of breast milk. I own a bag with just one icepack insert and it doesn't stay as cold as this one. I use this Munchkin bag while pumping at work. It fits 3 large (8oz) Medela bottles or 2 Munchkin Latch (8oz) bottles. It works also for storage of solid food as it easily fits a medium food box.
