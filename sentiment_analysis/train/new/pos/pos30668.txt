TIP: The instructions say not to throw it in the wash, but I have thrown it in the washer and dryer at least 10 times already with no apparent issues. Maybe one day the Pooh head will pop off from all that spinning, but until then, I will continue to machine wash and dry it to save time.I used this as a comfort object for my son when we sleep-trained him at 13 months.  I wanted to find a cuddly lovey that would make both my son and me smile, and this was it.  I haven't been able to find this in any stores, so I'm glad it's available on Amazon.  My son is so attached to this blanket that I had to buy a second one, just in case it is ever discontinued.  He loves to cuddle with it at nap times and at night. I bring this along on long airplane rides to encourage my son to sleep (doesn't always work) so thank goodness it's lightweight and doesn't take up too much space.However, if you want all-natural, organic, cotton blankets for your child, then this is not the way to go.  It's 100% polyester and Made in China.
