My little girl was a late walker and my doctor and I wondered if it was a confidence issue... This little device gave her something to hold onto, and ultimately helped her realize that she could walk on her own. I wouldn't want to put a child into it that didn't have the leg and core strength to hold themselves upright, but for our situation it was perfect.
