It goes perfectly with our baby's room, which we'd painted light blue and dark brown with an elephant motif!  Absolutely adorable and fairly sturdy.  It does what it's suppose to do, which is hold his dirty clothes, and I love that come laundry time, I can just slip with inner bag right on and off.  My husband was surprised how well it went in the baby's room and you can't beat it for the price that Amazon has it listed for.
