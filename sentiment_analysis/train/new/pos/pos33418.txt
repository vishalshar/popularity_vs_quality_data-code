I got onto my whole edamame kick after sampling a cold summer salad with edamame, corn, black beans and tomatoes at Trader Joe's. Frozen edamame, especially shelled, is very expensive in the supermarket, so I decided this year that I would add them to my vegetable garden. Beans are so easy to grow, plus, as a legume, they enrich the soil.I planted yellow wax beans and green string beans at the same time as these. They all seem to be doing well, although the soybeans seem to be coming along a little more slowly. perhaps because they get much bigger than the other beans.I'll update once they mature and I have a harvest to report.Update, Sept. 1, 2012I enjoyed my edamame but realized I would need to plant quite a few more if I wanted to eat them in any quantity. They grew fine, but they do take longer to mature than regular stringbeans, and my edamame seemed slightly smaller (but no less tasty) than what you'd find in the store.I have a leftover packet of seeds which I'll use next spring, but not sure I would otherwise grow these again, only because they take so long to mature (ready to pick sometime in August) while other veggies start producing by July. With my relatively small garden, they take up valuable real estate, so I have to carefully consider what I have room for, and what I don't.But they were fun to grow. When you harvest, you pull out the whole plant as the pods ripen pretty much at the same time. You boil the pods for about 6 minutes and after they cool you can easily squeeze out the beans, which are a bright lime green and delicious in a cold salad with corn, black beans, tomatoes and a little salad dressing.
