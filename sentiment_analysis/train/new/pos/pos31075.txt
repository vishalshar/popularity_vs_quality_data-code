Pros:-well-priced-keeps kid from sucking on front handlebar-pretty cute-has toy leashes you can velcro toys on to-fits well on shopping cartsCons:-it takes a bit of time to put on the cart (it'd be faster if the sides would velcro on instead of tie)-The back only attaches with one loop in the middle, so my son can pull off the corners from the cart seat's back and still suck on the metal (easily fixed if they'd put velcro on the corners of the back)
