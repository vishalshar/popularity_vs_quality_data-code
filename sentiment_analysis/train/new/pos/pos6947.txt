Can't say enough wonderful things about Nook products -- we own the change pad and mattress as well.  There is no better company for non-toxic foam based baby products.  And this is so fun and poppy, we just love it.  Think about it... your baby basically spends the majority of their day with their face pressed against this thing.  It should be non-toxic, right?  The mainstream options out there are all bathed in fire retardants.  Not good.As far as functionality, when the mat gets spit up on or generally dirty -- I just get a wet rag with mild soap and wipe it down.  The tag says you can machine wash it, but I imagine it would have to go into a commercial size washer.  It wouldn't fit in our standard front loader.  The cover does not zip off (I kind of wish it did.. but so far, we've been happy)EDIT TO ADD:  I just tried to stuff this in my washer, and it came out great!  Gentle cycle, gentle non toxic laundry soda.  Lowest dryer setting.  VERY pleased!
