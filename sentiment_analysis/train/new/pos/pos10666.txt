This is awesome. I purchased this to shade my little one when we're outside or out on walks. It totally exceeds my expectations! The quality on this is exceptional. The mesh material provides light shade while allowing baby visibility and great airflow. A zippered access allows me to reach through the mesh to touch baby or give her a bottle. And it creates a tight seal to keep mosquitos away. Theres also a reflective sun shades that neatly stores in a built in zippered pouch. It works great at blocking the sun from bothering baby. There are snaps that keep it in place in the center of the cabana. What I love is it blocks the sun along the top while still allowing visibility and airflow on the sides. And it works on almost any infant carseat. I use this on a Chicco Keyfit 30 and it fits great.
