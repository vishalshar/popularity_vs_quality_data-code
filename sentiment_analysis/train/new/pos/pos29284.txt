I have four kids and just discovered these burp cloths. My baby is 2 months old and she is my second "spitter."  I had a favorite before these, but these are so much better.  They are soft on baby's skin, lightweight so I don't feel like I"m wearing a diaper on my shoulder, and most importantly, absorbent.  Since my baby spits up so much, I don't expect to use one burp cloth for the whole day.  It lasts 2-3 feedings and then launders perfectly.  Some burp cloths are easy to maneuver on the shoulder, but only last one feeding.  Others are actually huge diapers and would last all day, but be totally gross and stinky.  This one is a perfect middle ground.
