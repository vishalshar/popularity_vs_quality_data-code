There were only a few reviews on here for this product.  So, I went on and purchased it from amazon.  I picked the dog plate & bowl set because my son has the skip hop dog lunch bag Skip Hop Zoo Lunchies Insulated Lunch Bag - Dog and the skip hop dog backpack Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog.I was very surprised how sturdy, durable, and well made these items are!  The bowl's overall size & depth is great for my 2 year old to eat cereal, oatmeal, or soup without making a mess.  The plate has generous serving areas, which also has the perfect depth.  Both the plate & bowl are solid items that will not move around the table as my toddler eats with his spoon or fork.  I am very pleased with skip hop products and I recommend them.Now I am waiting for Skip Hop to make this plate & bowl set in their penguin animal, so I my baby boy will be able to match his skip hop lunch bag Skip Hop Zoo Lunchies Insulated Lunch Bag - Penguin and the skip hop penguin backpack Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Penguin when he gets older.  :)
