Changed our lives!  My 16 month old was still waking 2 - 3 times a night to nurse and, pregnant with our second, I was exhausted.  The bone tired exhausting you get from not having had a single full nights sleep since birth.  I bought this little miracle and by the 3rd night he was sleeping for 7 hours without needing a night feed.  (Side note - he ended up being diagnosed with sleep apnea and had a tonsilectomy/adnoidectomy at 20 months.  I didn't know THAT was why he wasn't sleeping through the night at an earlier age.)  But this gem, honestly, changed our lives.  I personally think its for those in the 9+ month bracket who are grasping at straws and in need of rest.
