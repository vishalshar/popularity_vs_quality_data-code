I ordered this decal, and after putting it up on my wall, it did fall off...almost completely.  HOWEVER...I called the seller, and got a prompt response. They apologized, and acknowledged that they seemed to have an issue with that batch of material and offered either a quick refund, or offered to replace my product.  I opted for the replacement, and let me tell you....they were so incredible at keeping me updated and quickly sent me a replacement shortly after they fixed the issue with the material.  I put the decal back on the same wall with perfect results. It looks amazing, my daughter loves it, and I couldn't be happier.  Give this seller a break...they could have EASILY just refunded my money, and been done with me.  But they received an inferior product, found out about it, and fixed the issue quickly.  Their customer service, and continuous contact with me to fix the issue was impressive.  5 stars!!
