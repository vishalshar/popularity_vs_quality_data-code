This bag was great. It fit our graco booster seat perfectly. We checked them in with our luggage at the airport and they held up good. We had no issues with the material ripping or tearing - but honestly, that can happen with anything. Definitely serves its purpose and plan on using it again in a couple of months on our next trip. You can probably check it in at the gate or even bring it and put it in the overhead if you don't want to check it in with your bags (and risk having the material rip).
