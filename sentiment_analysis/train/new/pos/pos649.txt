My son used his "Kid-Ding fitted mattress cover" for over a year. It had gotten kind of gross so I decided to run quickly to the store to pick up a replacement. I made the mistake of not reading the details. This company Kid-Ding makes TWO different mattress covers that look almost identical if you don't read between the lines! About the same size, one is a Kid-Ding FLAT mattress cover and the other is a Kid-Ding FITTED mattress cover.I wasted my money cause I couldn't return it once I opened it and realized the one I got at the store Waterproof Crib & Toddler Bed Pad - 27 x 50 - White didn't have a fitted skirt to wrap around the mattress! I tried to make the best of that one, but it was AWFUL! Underneath the crib sheet, it slips and slides all over the place and crinkles up like crazy! What a disaster!I went online to make sure I get the correct one this time, and I did!!! This one is a fitted mattress cover by the same company and is just PERFECT! Wraps around the crib mattress flawlessly and doesn't move an inch! It stays put and makes slipping on the crib sheet so much easier!!! I have since bought another one! They're great and reversible. I machine wash mine and air dry -- DO NOT put it in the dryer!
