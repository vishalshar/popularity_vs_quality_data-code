My husband and I are expecting and do not intend to find out the gender of the baby until he/she arrives.  We were looking for a bedding set that would fit well with our hope for a woodland nursery.  I understand the previous comments about there not being enough pink to make this a girl's room - but again, who says a girl requires pink?  There are beautiful shades of yellow, a deep burgundy red, ivory, green and yes, a soft sky blue.  The colors are soft, neutral and warm - and all would work for either a boy or a girl.The material is nice, I think we'll hold off on the bumpers for a few months until the risk of the baby suffocating against them is diminished.  I recommend the breathable baby bumpers (the ecru color, offered at Bed Bath & Beyond, coordinates perfectly).  I'm hoping the fitted sheet softens a bit with washing and would be appropriate for a summer bed so we'll also be ordering a warmer flannel sheet as he/she is due in February.All in all, the set is simply ADORABLE and the perfect choice for our little one.
