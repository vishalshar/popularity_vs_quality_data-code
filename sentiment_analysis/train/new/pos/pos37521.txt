The photo needs to be more accurate. I purched this instead of another bc I thought the clips were cute.. when it arrived the chest clip looked nothing like the picuture. Had I known that would happen I probably would have gotten the other carseat I wanted. Otherwise this product is extremely sturdy. Only other thing is its heavy & difficult if it has to be removed. Its difficult to take out of and put into the base. I usually have to have dad do it because my wrists arent strong enough to twist the things & move it in time.
