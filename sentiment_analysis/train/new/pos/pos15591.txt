I purchased this stroller for my 15 month old granddaughter to use when she visits us at our house.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money and wasn't expecting the Rolls Royce of strollers.  It works well; I like the little shade cover and the gender-neutral design. I sometimes have to rock the stroller back on its rear wheels to straighten out the front wheels, but that's easy to do.I give this product a five star rating because of the ease and flexibility the stroller demonstrated on a recent trip my daughter, granddaughter and I made from San Francisco to Ireland.  Not wanting to lug around a giant stroller, we took this one with us.  It was so handy at all the airports and train stations and for walks in general.  We were able to push the baby to the airplane gate at take-off and pick the stroller up again upon arrival.  The stroller is lightweight; ‘pushable’ with one hand and makes for easy maneuverability while juggling all the other pieces of luggage and travel paraphernalia. It might not be fancy, but it did a great job.
