I'm really loving the Alva diapers. The white part of the pattern on this diaper isn't as bright of a white as you would think by the picture. But it is still very cute. This diaper has held up to overnights, naps and big poops from my Toddler. My Toddler is about 30 pounds and he's all thigh. Sometimes the thigh snaps can feel sort of akward since that's where he holds ALL of his chubb. But I've not had leaks or red marks out the thigh area.The insert is more absorbant than the microfiber ones. Though the microfiber ones have worked well for us. I like that both the inner and outer layer of the pocket opening have elastic. (My expensive Blueberry diaper doesn't have elastic on the inner layer and so it can sort of bunch up on my son't back. Though the diaper itself is great!)I love the design. I'm pretty happy with my purchases of Alva diapers.
