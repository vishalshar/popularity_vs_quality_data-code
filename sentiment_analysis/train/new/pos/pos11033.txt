the craftsmanship is simply topnotch...very very beautiful mobile, baby loves it and my 2 year old is smitten, she removes the magnetic detachable toys ( bear and ms mouse) and plays with them ...totally worth the money, the only minor drawback is that one needs to find a sturdy mobile hanger as that is not included.
