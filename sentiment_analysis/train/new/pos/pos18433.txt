I got this for my 7 yr old daughter with ADHD/SPD, after she was exposed to lead from chewing on a fishing weight. She loves the necklace and brings it with her to school and day care. She likes the style and feel, and it keeps her from chewing on her fingers and of course items made of heavy metals. So far no issues with breakdown of the material.
