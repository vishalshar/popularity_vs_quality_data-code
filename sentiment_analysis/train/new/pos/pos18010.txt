When Aldi Supermarkets sold their 7" Medion Lifetab Android Tablet in the United States, I struggled to find a suitable case/cover for the one I purchased.  Most of the items that are available are 'universal' covers that fit a range of tablets.  Unfortunately, all of them cover the camera.But not the Navitech.  This cover is made specifically for the Medion.  And although it is Faux Leather, it has the look and feel of genuine leather, and it appears the same durability.I am more than pleased with my purchase.  For $14.99, this case is an absolute bargain.  Navitech delivered much more in value than $14.99.
