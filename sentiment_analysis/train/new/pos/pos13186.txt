This is how to choose which Britax cars seat will work for you. It can be confusing and small differences matter.The numbers 55 and 70 indicates maximum weigh of the child. CS means Click and Safe snug harness indicator, G3 is new line with 2 new features:- HUGS new chest pads with safecell technology that are designed to compress in a crash and reduce the amount of impact forces experienced by the child and- EZ easy buckle system that prevents the child from sitting on the buckle when boarding.From the simplest to the most advanced the new G3 models go:Roundabout (up to 55 lb), Marathon, Boulevard, Pavilion and Advocate (all up to 70 lb). First two are the base models and I only considered the Boulevard, Pavilion or Advocate.I chose the Pavilion 70-G3 because has all the features that matter to me (Roundabout and Marathon lacks them, the rest have them);- true side impact protection,- new chest pads that are designed to compress in a crash and reduce the amount of impact forces experience by child,- click and safe snug harness indicator.The Advocate goes further and has a bulky addition in the head area for more safety, but it was too bulky for my VW Tiguan. This the only difference between the Advocate and Pavilion.Boulevard CS doesn't have NEW easy buckle system and Boulevard G3 doesn't have CS (click and safe snug harness indicator).Overall I rate the this car seat 5 stars. No complaints:- my son loves it, looks comfortable and the middle position is perfect to sit and watch the world through the window and take a nap without his head hanging down,- easy to remove the seat cover ( manufacturer recommends only hand wash, no dryer but it is fine to use washer and line dry),- easy to keep it clean (I wipe it with disinfection clothes and looks great),- approved for air travel, although for me too bulky for plane (infant car seat is more useful for me on the plane and toddlers can just seat on the lap or seat),- made in USA ("with global components"),- they don't feel cheap, I compared different brands in the store and liked Britax the most,- seat is very secure, there is no movements I had some with my Chicco Keyfit 30 infant car sear, but this is different base and seat,- my son was never sweaty after a car ride,- easy to install but I wouldn't want to switch the car seat between 2 cars, would buy another one,- I bought it for my 1 year old who is big enough to use it forward facing (according to instructions and my judgement), but it is reversible for rear facing, can be used from the birth (obvious minus-can not take sleeping infant with the car seat outside).UPDATE: My son is 2 years old, 30lb and still loves the seat and fits well in it even in the winter coat. After 1 year seat and cover looks like new. The only thing this seat is missing is a cup holder for older toddlers.A second baby is coming soon so I probably will buy a booster type of seat 25/40 lb-120 lb for the older child and younger will inherit this one.
