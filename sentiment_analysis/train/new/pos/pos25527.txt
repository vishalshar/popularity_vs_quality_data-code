I needed something to organize all of my pens, cards, paper pads, calculator and iPad.  Thought I would give this a try since it was reasonably priced and looked as if it would fit my needs.  It fits perfectly on my passenger back seat.  I secured the back straps around my seat belt base so that it didn't have to go around the seat.  It holds all of my office traveling stuff.  What I like about it the most is that I can put my iPad in the big pocket and it fits!  Plus I freeze a bottle of water and then as it melts throughout my day, I have something cool to drink w/o having to stop and at a store.  I could never really find a convenient way to take the iced water w/ me w/o the condensation getting all over.  This item is really great for because I put it in the cup holder and the condensation drips away from everything, out of the carrier and onto the back seat floor of my vehicle.  I have a towel on the floor and it catches the condensation.  So FINALLY I found something to solve that problem.  Thank you!!!!  It shipped really fast too so I appreciate that as well.  Description was exactly as pictured and written.  I'm glad I made the purchase!!!
