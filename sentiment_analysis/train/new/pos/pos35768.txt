I've been hesitant to review this product waiting for it to break down but so far so good. Minor issues w/screen but nothing permanent. We are able to see our son perfectly while he sleeps. Night vision works great. We have 2 sound machines running but they do not trigger the sound on parent unit as other reviewers mentioned. Camera power button is a bit bright in a dark room but our son is fine w/it. You can put a sticker over to dim. It does have red lights but they are very dim. Does not bother my son either. Parent unit screen is small but good enough to keep an eye out on baby. We preferred this one since parent unit is portable w/rechargeable battery. Battery will not last over night. We keep it plugged in when going to sleep. Our home is 3000sq ft and parent unit works great all over our home. We are able to zoom in for closer look which even allows me to see my son breathing (I know I'm paranoid). Talk feature works great although we don't use it often. If I had to point out some cons it would be inability to play music and adjust lens from parent unit. However they are not a big deal. We don't use the music much and camera is stationed where we can see our son in his crib no matter where he moves. Very happy w/purchase. As a precaution we did buy warranty.
