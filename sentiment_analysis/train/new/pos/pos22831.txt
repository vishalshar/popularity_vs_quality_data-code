My Goodbyn arrived even sooner than expected-- just two days after placing my order! I am extremely satisfied with the product. It's very helpful with portioning, and gives me a clearer picture to better represent all food groups. Not to mention, it's very aesthetically pleasing. I'll most likely purchase another, just to save myself a run through the dishwasher every night. And who knows, my boyfriend may even be on board-- he was pleasantly surprised with the size / durability of the bin.
