Every woman is different, but below are the individual product reviews including the factors that I found to be most important.LansinohRating: 5/5Cost per pad: $0.18Come individually wrapped, folded in half.+ Good size/shape, more round than the Medela disposable+ 2 sticky tabs to keep in place- Slightly more expensiveMedela disposableRating: 4.5/5Cost per pad: $0.11Come individually wrapped, folded in half.+ Size was sufficient, contoured+ 2 sticky tabs to keep in place- Not as round/discrete as Lansinoh, but not badJohnson’sRating: 4/5Cost per pad: $0.17Come stacked in the box, not folded or individually wrapped.+ Very small size and round, contoured+/- NOT individually wrapped like all of the other disposable products.  I liked this, but if you carry extras with you for changing away from home it may be less desirable.- Only has 1 sticky tab to hold in placeNUKRating: 3.5/5Cost per pad: $0.12Come flat, individually wrapped.+/- Very large in size- Not contoured- Only has 1 sticky tab to hold in placeNaturally Nature Washable Nursing PadsRating: 3/5Cost per pad: $2.50+ Can be cheaper in the long term+ Great size/shape (contoured)- More likely to shift- Need to be changed as soon as there is any leakage.Comments:Good product, but not for me for every day use.  These are fine for at home use, but I preferred the disposable kind especially when going out.  With the reusable one, they do not wick away and trap moisture as well as the disposables.  This leads to irritation if not promptly changed.Medela Reusable PadsRating: 1/5 starsI bought these as part of a kit at Target and was not satisfied.  If you buy reusable pads, buy ones that have a waterproof backing.
