I originally thought I wouldn't need these. I folded the prefolds and had the covers keep them in place. Although this will do to get by, I have a lot less leaks while using these.These are so much simpler than using safety pins and only take a second to put on. No sharp poking. No explaining to daddy why baby is crying, no explaining from daddy why he is crying worse than baby about pricked fingers.Three is plenty. One in the diaper bag for emergencies, but honestly they are built really well, so unless you lose one these will last years.
