I ordered two six-packs of leggings for my baby because it's just so much easier to change diapers with these than with pants. These legging, I don't know if it's because they're specified for girls or what, are thinner and more loose than the other ones. The other ones were made by Judanzy and designated as "boys."The upper part of the tube, where it goes around the thigh and NOT the ankle, are clearly looser and in a thinner knit. It is probably more comfy for the little one but it also causes them to fall down more easily. Since my little one likes to scooch on her butt, using just her legs to move, these fell below her knees ALL THE TIME. They sit in the right place for ankle warmers, like in 'Flashdance,' But if you want to keep baby's legs warm all the way up, go with the JuDanzy ones. They're available on Amazon, too.
