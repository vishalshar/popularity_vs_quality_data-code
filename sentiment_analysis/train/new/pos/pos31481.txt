I love the natural style of nipples from Avent.  They are super easy for my son to latch onto.  We had problems with another brand (Munchkin Latch).  When he was sucking the nipples would get inverted.  These don't seem to have that problem.  They are also easy to remove from the cap and easy to clean up, although do seem to get cloudy after months of usage.  Have been using these since birth and my son is now 9 months.  Very pleased and satisfied.
