I finally got this clutch today, not 15 minutes ago, and it was kind of scratched in places but still really awesome. I love that it is black inside and out and that the metal is a dark charcoal grey. I was concerned because some of the pictures look brown with copper tones very happy it is this color. The rings look great I love that the flower ring has a little skull at the corner the inside is super roomy and the spring loaded latch makes it easy to open one handed. I found that it came packaged in just an envelope with bubble wrap and that left some scratches on the frame and the underside of the latch. There was a string that was unraveled near the left hinge just cut it seems fine.On the back side of the flower ring there is a weld that wasn't ground down so it is a little sharp. It took so long to get here because it was sent to the wrong facility so it took a month, little bit long to wait but worth it. It is such a fun clutch and I can't wait to wear it out.
