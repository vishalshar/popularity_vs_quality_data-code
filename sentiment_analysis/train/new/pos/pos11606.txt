I bought two of these Graco Stages Travel Lite cribs for my baby -- one to use as a bassinet in our bedroom and one for naps and playtime downstairs. I chose this over the larger standard-size pack n plays because it fits through standard size doorways, which makes it so convenient to move around the house (only two of the four corners is on wheels, though, so you have to lift one end and drag it to move).The "mattress" it comes with is a really thin and hard board, and I looked all over online to find something to make it more comfortable. Then I came across the bassinet pads made by Babies R Us -- the 31 x 18 x 1 size fits perfectly. BRU makes two sizes of bassinet pads so make sure you get the right one. The Carter's changing pad cover also fits perfectly over both mattresses as a sheet.
