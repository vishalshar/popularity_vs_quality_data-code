I purchased this for the baby but ended up using it for the Shih Tzu.  The Trend Lab Dr Seuss Storage Caddy, ABC is much more attractive than the photo and its size is ample enough hold everything I need to care for and groom the dog.  The exterior fabric is soft and the interior is a simple cotton broadcloth.  The separator fits perfectly into the shell by attaching the elastic loops onto the well sewn buttons, one on each bottom and one on each top of the separator.  Because the handles are flexible, they can be bent and moved out of the way when grabbing something quickly from the caddy.  I like this so much that I'm purchasing another for my jewelry making supplies.
