I originally purchased this item for my car believe it or not. I drove a 2009 Volkswagon Bug, that had really crappy cup holders. I was able to attach this to the bar that went across my dashboard, and it worked PERFECTLY! It even help XL drinks. Will def be buying another one for my stroller soon, once my son is old enough for a sippy cup.
