Just bought my third "magic mirror."  Both my son & daughter use this to calm themselves down during the night.  No more panicked screams.  After 2.5 years of constant use, my son's mirror died.  It was never a question to repurchase.  We have the matching mirror in my car which has been equally essential for calming down frenzied, sleep-evading toddlers & babies.  Do not hesitate -- this is a baby essential!
