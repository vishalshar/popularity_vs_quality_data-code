I received the tumblers two weeks ago to transition my 2-year old daughter from using sippy cups.  The Green Eats tumblers made the transition easier than I could have imagined (it was pretty much instantaneous).  From the first use, she was able to hold the tumbler using both hands and she has not yet spilled any liquid or dropped the tumbler on the floor or table.My only regret is I wish I had taken a video of the first time she used of the cup.  After her first sip of JuiceWater (which is a homemade recipe of 3 parts water and 1 part white grape juice), she set her blue cup on the table and triumphantly proclaimed, "I am a big girl!"  It was cuteness times infinity plus another infinity!She now uses her "Blue Big Girl Cup" at each meal:  Breakfast; Second Breakfast; Elevenses; Luncheon; Afternoon Tea; Dinner and Supper.  Okay, maybe not that many meals, but, at times, it seems like it.I was drawn to the Green Eats tumblers by the good reviews, because the product is made in the USA and is free of BPA phthalates, PVC and external coatings.  I am very happy by the purchase as the tumblers are a huge success in our home.  Because of the tumblers, my daughter no longer uses sippy cups (cue the she-is-no-longer-a-baby tears).
