We love these cups.  Our first actually came from some friends who were clearing out toddler stuff and our son liked it so much, he held it like other kids hold blankets or stuffed animals.  I didn't even realize at the time that it is now recommended that children move to straw cups instead of sippy -- convenient.  They are easy to assemble and disassemble, and very practical.  One reviewer mentioned that there is a nearly imperceptible difference in the size/shape of the rubber piece in the top of the lid, which can make reassembling a little annoying if you've mixed all the pieces together.  We've just started putting each cup and its constituent pieces in a separate part of the dishwasher and have not had this problem since the one time it occurred (we mixed up one of the new cups with the original, which was apparently a different size).
