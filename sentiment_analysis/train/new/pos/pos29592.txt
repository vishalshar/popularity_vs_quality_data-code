I am a firm believer in trying different bottles to find what is best for your baby. My son did like the Madela bottles when first born, but he quickly outgrew them. The nipple would collapse because it was too slow of a flow. He is primarily breastfed, and when giving him stored breastmilk and occasional formula, he loves these bottles! He does however prefer the first stage nipple even at four and a half months. Going to try for stage two soon. Overall, huge fan and have not dealt with any gas issues.
