This review is not about the pump itself, because there's little debate that it is one of the best double-electric pumps out there.  I have been using it to pump at work twice a day and am very happy with it's performance.I want to comment on the Metro bag style in case you are trying to decide between the tote bag vs. the backpack vs. the Metro bag.  The Metro bag is working out great for me because:- The motor is in its own separate bag, so I can leave it and the wall adapter, which are the heaviest items in the bag, at work from Monday to Thursday.  I only carry the cooler with the bottles and the ice pack and the pump parts to clean them at home every night.  The other two styles don't have this ability.- I use the included plastic tray everyday as a clean surface to hold all the pump parts while I am assembling them before pumping and to prevent the parts from soiling my desk after pumping.- The bag comes with nice pouches and pockets to keep the various parts organized.  I bought a second set of connectors, valves and membranes so that I don't have to wash them at work and I can carry the two sets in two different pouches that came with the bag.- The bag is large enough to hold my lunch and snacks, so that I don't have to carry a separate lunch bag.  It also holds my hands-free bra, a small lap towel, breast pads and other small items.A downside of the bag is that the flap indeed does not close securely and the bag slips down the shoulder fairly easily.  But if you are a car commuter like me and only need to carry the bag to and fro from your car to home or office then it's not a big deal.If you commute by public transport and need the bag to close securely or need to bring the motor home each night, then you may be better off with the backpack or tote style.
