These are AMAZING. I can't thank the inventor of Sock-Ons ENOUGH. My nine month old never keeps his socks on, especially in the car, he loves to pull them off and chew on them. I can't tell you how many times we'd be out in public (sans socks) and someone would stop and say, "You should really put socks on his feet, they're going to freeze!" Yes, I know that, lady, and I've tried telling my 9 month old baby the same thing, but he just. doesn't. listen. I knew there had to be a solution and these babies are just it. It just slips around the foot and up around the heal, and bam. He can't get them off. He probably could if he REALLY tried, but he gives up after just a second. I'm so thankful to have these in my life and know that my son has warm feet all the time AND to not listen to sanctimonious granny's at the store telling me how to parent. ;) Thank you!
