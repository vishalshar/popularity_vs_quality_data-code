I love these "blocks" for the safety, the beautiful true-to-life designs, and even the sensory items (like touchable butterfly wings and a plastic toy that hangs off the side for baby to play with).  I was disappointed that they really don't have much form and therefore baby really can't stack them, which was my reason for buying blocks.  If you're looking for a great sensory toy, this is fantastic.  Otherwise this is way too difficult for little ones to put on top of one another without them falling.
