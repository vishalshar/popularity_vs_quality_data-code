I bought this cute little cup for my grandson a couple of months before he turned three. He was so busy all the time he could never finish a drink in a regular cup without spilling a lot of it. I thought I would give this cup with the straw attached a try. The Pop-Up Straw Cup was perfect!PROS:The cup is strong and sturdy, and made of high quality plastic. The straw is attached so there’s no worry about it falling to the floor and getting dirty. The cup is easy to clean, even the part where the straw is attached.The two handles on either side of the cup made it easy for my grandson to hold the cup and drink all by himself without spilling anything. He could also pop the straw up or shut it down without help. The cup was right for his little hands. He loved popping the straw up and down. It made him laugh.I was very pleased that my grandson could finally finish a drink without us having to help him hold the cup. I also loved it because he loved it, he had lots of fun talking about the characters pictured on it.CONS:The one issue I had with the cup was that it leaked…once.I watched as my grandson tilted the cup to drink the way he always did with another type of sippy-cup he had. The Thomas cup leaked.After I got him to only drink from this cup holding it upright, we never had another leak problem.Therefore, the leaking was due to improper use of the cup on my grandson’s part, not anything to do with the cup itself.I would recommend this Thomas & Friends Pop-Up Straw Cup for children who love Thomas the Train. It is worth the money.
