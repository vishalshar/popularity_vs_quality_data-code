This is very nice looking and was definitely useful when I was icing my cake. However, the one annoying thing was that after swiveling the stand it wouldn't stay perfectly in place-- it would shift back to its "resting" position. This wasn't that much of a problem for me because I wasn't doing intricate designs (it was only annoying when I was displaying the cake and wanted the "happy birthday" writing to face outwards), but might be more annoying to more advanced bakers.
