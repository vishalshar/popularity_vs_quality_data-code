I love the Deglingos toys! This "blankie" is more like a lovey or minky...just something for a small baby to cuddle with, which is why I bought it. I love the different off-the-wall patterns. I'm thinking of purchasing a pair of the kicks, just for fun, and maybe another one of these loveys to keep around as a spare. I think the price is a tad steep for this particular product, but I guess they're from the UK...maybe. I didn't do too much research on it. All in all, I really do like the "blankie". It's super cute, and I'll probably purchase another one in a different character.
