I'm sure you've seen the giant carribeaners (mommy hook) that's supposed to "help" hold your bags - i thought long and hard between that and this hook - and made several trips to the store to weigh my options - never leaving with anything until late one night I was on amazon and wanted to late night shop.Why did I pick this over the mommy hook - one reason - it's meant to be secured in place! It's like having a loose bra strap - your bra still fits but pulling up and tugging on that strap a million times over the course of the day is no fun. That's essentially the mommy hook - if your stroller's handlebars are thin - then maybe that would be helpful but mine is relative thick so i knew the mommy hook would just look awkward - and most likely slide to the side. And if you're power shopping - your kid is fussy and over tired - do you REALLY want to be finagling with the stupid hook to open it and hang your bags on it? Um, no thanks. (that's actually what sold me on the hooks - the easy of just hanging my bags off it w/o having to open/close anything)I have each hook secured 1/3 of the way from each edge of the stroller handle bar (I have a full cross bar - peg perego aria) - I like that if i have a heavier bag, it will distribute the weight across the handles (which the mommy hook can't do unless i get 2 hooks). I like that the velcro is easy to remove so i can store the hooks in my stroller organizer when not in use.The velcro isn't some cheapy velcro - it's pretty close to industrial strength b/c it took some effort to unhook the straps - which makes me happy - so i know it's not going to pull off easily with the slightest cargo. When the hooks are strapped on - it doesn't budge.Obviously - don't put too much weight on this hook - not b/c the hook can't handle it - but b/c it can tip your stroller over =)
