The frog print flannel crib pad is just that--a flannel, waterproof pad sized to fit under your crib mattress to keep messes from leaking through to a mattress pad or the mattress. I have several of these in the bassinet size and we love them as liners for our changing pad. The frog print flannel crib pad is the same idea, just bigger, and it's exactly what I was looking for. The white pad in this listing is NOT THE SAME THING as the frog printed flannel pad. I assumed from the listing that it was the same only in white with a little quilting, but instead, it's a fitted waterproof mattress pad, just without much padding like you'd find in a standard mattress pad. It would be perfectly good if that's what I was looking for, but I have several mattress pads--I was looking for a thin waterproof layer to go in between my crib sheet and mattress pad, to make changing the crib a little easier. This way, we change the sheet and the waterproof pad underneath but don't have to change the fitted mattress pad every time our son spits up or makes a mess in the crib. In any event, both items seem good for what they are, but THEY ARE DEFINITELY TWO DIFFERENT ITEMS--not the same thing in 2 different colors. As long as you know that, you should get what you're expecting. I took off a star not for the product's quality but because the listing and descriptions are incorrect.
