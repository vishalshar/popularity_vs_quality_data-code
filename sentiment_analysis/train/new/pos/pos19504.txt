Loved this seat- so stylish! I had purchased the Eddie bauer travel system for our baby and loved it! My son quickly outgrew the infant seat- So I had searched for an eddie bauer seat that would last till he was out of them- This one is great- easy to install- My son loves it, so comfy! easy to clean, very adjustable to each childs needs, head rest is adjustable, as well as the straps, tether system is easy to adjust if needed to remove the seat. LOVE IT!! WOULD RECCOMMEND!!
