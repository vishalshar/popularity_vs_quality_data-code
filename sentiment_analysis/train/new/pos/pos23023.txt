So back in the day we purchased a hamper for my sons bedroom in one of those bedding packages from target tiddliwinks I think it was called...It was not very good, and ended up breaking in less than 3 months. So fast forward 2 years later when his sister was born, we purchased this bedding set, and when I saw the hamper for sale with the bedding set I was reluctant to purchase it.I am so glad that I went ahead and purchased it!!!  So much different from my last experience!!  The hamper was much larger than my last one and WAY BETTER QUALITY.  It has a nice removable hamper bag and the wood frame is made out of a nice hardwood.  It is definitely worth the money, and looks very nice as well.  I highly recommend it.
