I was unsure about buying these because we've tried other brands of crib sheets that do not fit DD's mattress, even though its a standard size. I decided to try them because the price was low enough to where I wouldn't be upset if they ended up not fitting after all. Luckily these do fit perfectly even after washing and drying several times. We had some thicker flannel ones but I wanted to get some lighter cotton ones for the warmer months and to take to daycare for DD's cot, and these are perfect. They are very soft and lightweight. I purchased the mint and the pink geometic dots. I will definitely be purchasing more in the near future!---------After using these sheets for several months now I've decided to come back and review again.These sheets are great! I change my daughter's sheets two or three times a week on average, and I only have 5 sheets that fit her bed, so they get washed A LOT. In all those washings the colors on these have not faded, there are no holes, and the elastic is still working great. The same cannot be said of the other brands of sheets we have tried which we have purchased from both Babies R Us and Target. I will definitely be buying more!
