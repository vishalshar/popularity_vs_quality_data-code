I really love this bib! I have tried lots of different kids and these are the best! My toddler and baby are such messy eaters and this design makes meal time not so messy.  I love the head and the arm holes! What a great idea! I also love how long it is so that it keeps their laps clean as well!  It is waterproof so nothing soaks through which is amazing for my toddler that is always spilling her milk! They are so easy to clean! I just throw in the wash at the end of the day, lay them out and they are dry by morning!  The only thing is although I love the color, I don't like that the gray color stains  easy and it can start to look pretty grungy.  My baby has a black one and if I would do it over again, I would of bought my toddler a black one as well.
