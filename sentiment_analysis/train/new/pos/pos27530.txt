I ordered the "Girl's Selection" but received the "Boy's Selection" colors instead.Who cares? i'm not trying to match my baby daughters shoes with it, they work and they are made in the USA.One thing YOU MUST DO ONCE YOU GET THESE STRAPS: Hand wash them very good with a just a little baby detergent and let them dry.I used a wet wipe on the yellow strap and a little bit of the strap's color came off, you dont want that.Besides that, it does what it suppose to do, we love them.
