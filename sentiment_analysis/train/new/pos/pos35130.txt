This monitor is comparable in features to other monitors I considered when making my purchase.  I went with the ZOpid because of the reviews that stated great customer service.When I set up the monitor, the receiver would shut off when unplugged.  I found that the battery connections were misaligned and not connecting to the battery terminals.  I emailed ZOpid with a camera phone pic of the issue and they shipped a replacement receiver in advance with no credit card hold and a pre-paid return label.  The replacement receiver worked perfectly.I have been using the unit for several months with my daughter.  The "night vision" works great and we can see clearly.  The frame rate is fairly low, and quick movement will appear jumpy on the screen.  However, the purpose of this monitor is to see if the baby is awake, not to watch HDTV.The digital monitor is far superior to the old analog monitor we used with my first child.  There is no popping or other noise in the audio, and the picture quality is far superior without the graininess and distortions of the old analog monitor.The rechargeable battery is a great thing.  With our old analog monitor we went through batteries rapidly.  With this monitor we plug it in when the baby is awake and walk around with it while she naps.  Always charged, with no battery replacement.
