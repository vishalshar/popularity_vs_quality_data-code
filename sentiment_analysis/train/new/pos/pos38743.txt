The wife and I really like this crib!  I appreciate that it really was not that difficult to put together, it took about 30 minutes to get it completely set up.  We set the crib up with other items we found on Amazon too and we are very happy with how it is looking now.Sheets - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U2PLOIKSkirt - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U2PLDJKQuilt - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U2PLJ5SMattress - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MUZVKY8
