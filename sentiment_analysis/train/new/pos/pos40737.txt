It seems that when I have purchased similar clips in the past, they have  been so long that they fall past my baby's clothes and the pacifier ends up touching all sorts of surfaces. This one seems to be the perfect length. It is very cute too. This one is a soft blue and cream on the front with a more vibrant pattern of hot pinks and yellows on the back. It's very cute. The clip is also nice and strong without damaging baby's cute clothes.
