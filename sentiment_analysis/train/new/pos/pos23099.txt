I really wish we had spent a bit more money and gotten a different monitor. If the lighting is dim but not dark, the picture is so fuzzy as to be useless ("Is that the head? Oh, I see something moving, that must be an arm! Or is it a leg?") It will spontaneously cut out and in over and over even when I am well within range (this happens occasionally but unpredictably). The stand on the receiver broke within days, which seems to be a very common problem. The volume settings are annoying - even the lowest setting is quite loud, meaning that now that he's older and I don't mind if he babbles in his crib, I have to listen to amplified babbling if I want the volume on at all. Considering our room is the opposite side of the house, this means I either try to get some sleep to the loud babbling on the monitor or I sleep in the guest room next to the nursery so I can turn off the sound all together and can hear through the walls if the baby gets upset (rather than happy babbles). I wish I could just turn down the volume in smaller increments so I could hear upset cries but ignore babbling.Update 10/2016 - Okay, I take it back. This has been a very good monitor - we have had it powered on for about 22 months straight now (except for when we power it down while traveling): literally, have very very rarely turned it off for almost two years. It still charges fully and lasts all day without being plugged in. While the image is not television-quality clear, it definitely is "good enough" most of the time. We do sometimes struggle to determine whether it's his head or a stuffed animal we are seeing on the monitor now that he's in a toddler bed, and we are switching to a monitor with a panning camera so we can locate him in his room now that he has free reign, but I felt it only fair to say this has been a very functional monitor for us and will likely continue to be our traveling monitor to use when visiting family.
