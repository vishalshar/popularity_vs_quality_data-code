Very colorful and keeps baby entertained. It is large so that is plus, it also is thick so he is comfy.Cons: toys are at very edge so my baby often has to be moved back on to mat. Also it folds up but does not have a handle or anything so you are carrying a large mat, not very great when you  got baby + baby stuff + large mat.
