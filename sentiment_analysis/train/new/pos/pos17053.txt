Baby loves her lamby!  Excellent product, very soft and no smell. We were having a hard time moving our sleeping baby from my chest to her bed. The chilly, firm mattress always woke her up. I put the lamby down and voila!  She snuggles right in and stays asleep.I love that this product is machine washable (you have to buy a special shampoo) and tho I was dubious it looks and feels just as great after a wash!And no, we don't leave the baby on her belly all night. This is a supervised nap. And she can roll over. üëç
