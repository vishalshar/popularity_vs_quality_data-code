I was using the medela flanges for a month before a friend introduced me to pumpin pals. I used the handsfree bra with the medela flanges but found that i still had to lean forward for it to drain out. My shoulders and back were in so much pain. I tried these and it's great! I can situp right and it naturally flows down into the bottle. If you expect to NOT hold the flanges at all, you are wrong in either case. I found to get the right amount of suction in both cases I still had to lightly hold on to them, even with the handsfree bra. it's a big difference though because if you are holding them in hard, you are at risk for wrist injury.
