I used to install these when they were manufactured by Mericon. As a professional babyproofer, I can attest these are the most effective latch of this type. The cheaper models by Safety First are not nearly as effectve because of the design and differences in the bendablity of the different plastics. If these are the same product I used in the 90's ( these were a gift, so I did not feel the plastic) then they will be a much stiffer plastic with a c shaped groove on the latch that makes it extremely difficult for a little toddler to have both the finger strength and dexterity needed to open these. You may break a few nails until you figugue out how to open these, but the learning curve is worth the added safety for your child.If you want the most foolproof, for larger toddlers, then spend the extra money for the magnetic latches by Tot Lok by Rev a Shelf. Be warned though that those are very difficult for the average weekend warrior to install. Most cabinet guys and contractors hate to install them as well, but they are worth hiring a professional installer.
