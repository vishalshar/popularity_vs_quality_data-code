This is a very nice mattress and seems very firm, which is good for baby.  However, the vinyl covering is in a blue and white check, which can be seen through the sheets.  This feature is not readily visable in the product photograph unless you select the other pictures feature.  Also, there is a small tear in the binding along the edge of the mattress.  Our first mattress was white, and therefore there is not a pattern to be seen through the sheets.  A good solution will be to use a mattress pad.
