Well first of all, for the price it is a good deal.  Not necessarily the best thought out product, and details to follow:1.  The straps for the seat belt are a little thin and thus get twisted easily2.  The reclining option is not as easy when already strapped into the car, so adjust accordingly prior to finalizing3.  Side cup holder does not fit on the side where the door opens, since our armrest in the backseat already has cup holders, basically tossed thisOutside of that, the grow up option is the key reason to purchase as it ultimately saves on the $ as they grow up.
