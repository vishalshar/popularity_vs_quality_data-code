My clingy (cuddly, sweet) one month old LOVES this.  I've only had it a few days, but so far it's bought me back some freedom.  Normally I can't even set her down long enough to go to the bathroom without hysterical tears.  This morning I got to sit next to her peacefully folding laundry while she entertained herself kicking and reaching for toys.I searched quite a bit before picking a play gym, this was the most brightly colored inviting one I could find that also had a soft cushy mat (why are so many baby toys muted colors? Infants can't see them yet!!).We'll see how it holds up but after two days, I highly recommend it
