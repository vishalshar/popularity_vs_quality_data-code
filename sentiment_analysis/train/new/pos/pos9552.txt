I have to admit, I didn't see many reviewers on here saying they purchased this for a girl.  My daughter loves the Cars movies and had to have it when she saw this potty.  It was motivation enough that she actually is using it, from the second it came out of the box!We have not had any problems with leaks whatsoever.  The only downside is that the bucket that catches everything is a pain to get to when you need to empty it...lid, tire cushion seat, then either remove the whole seat section of just the bucket potion...but if it works then it is worth the cost.
