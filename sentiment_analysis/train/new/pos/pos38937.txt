I got the 2011 UPPAbaby G-Luxe Stroller and read the UPPAbaby rain cover currently on sale doesn't fit the 2011 version of the stroller.  So I looked around and took a chance on this one and it fits the stroller perfectly.  It's slightly bigger, but bigger is better than too small.  I am happy with the product.  You just have to air out the plasticy smell first.
