My almost two year old recently started the whole 'attempting to escape from the crib' bit so I thought it'd be a good time to switch her over to a big girl's bed. Moving her straight into a twin or full sized bed would be ideal financially in the long run; however, space wise, a toddler or converted crib made more sense for her room.I initially looked into purchasing the toddler conversion rail for her crib, but it was $60+ and a majority of the reviews were unfavorable. I came across this Orbelle toddler bed in my research and was pretty excited since the price is comparable to buying just the one rail. I'm so glad I decided on the toddler bed instead of converting my little one's crib with a toddler rail!Directions for assembly were straightforward. All you need is a screw driver. An Allan wrench is included. I was antsy to put it together so I did so on my own before my boyfriend came home from work.My furniture assembling skills are slim to none, but I successfully put together the bed by myself! You construct the side rails first, then install the bed slats, and finish by screwing in the headboard and footboard. The most difficult part was installing the slats because one would pop out of its notch as I was inserting another one into its respective hole. I eventually managed to install all the slots by starting with the middle one and working my way out on either side. Having two people assemble it would definitely make the whole thing a breeze.The bed frame itself is very lightweight. I'm quite petite and I had no problem moving it around. It also fit through our doorways easily when fully constructed, unlike our crib. My boyfriend (~180 lbs) laid in the bed with our daughter to read bedtime stories despite my insistence that he'd break it. Surprisingly the bed didn't collapse. It's pretty sturdy for the price.
