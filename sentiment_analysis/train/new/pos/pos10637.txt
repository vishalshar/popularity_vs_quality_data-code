We got this for my daughter when she was a few months old to stimulate tummy time and I'm happy to report that this activity gym really grew with her.  After she was able to roll over, she loved trying to grab the octopus and different rings while laying on her back.  She also loved looking at herself in the mirror (yes she is a bit conceited!) and it was fun to help her discover all the possibilities of this gym.  She didn't really use the whale because it would always slip from underneath her, but later on she did give it a good beating once in a while so we still got some use out of it :P  It was an excellent purchase and I will definitely use it for my second child due in November.
