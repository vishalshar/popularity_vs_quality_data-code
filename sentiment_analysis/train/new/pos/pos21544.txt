My daughter flew eight times before she was seven months old and we wouldn't have survived our travels without this product.  It packs up small enough to fit in a carry on suitcase with plenty of room for clothes and sets up easily. It was perfect as both a travel bed and a place to put my daughter while on the beach or at the cabin as it protects from sun and bugs.  While the first canopy that arrived had a broken snap, the company sent a second one for free immediately.  The bed portion is much sturdier if the canopy is in place, but it is fine to use without it until the child is very active. My daughter used this multiple times until around eight months when she could easily crawl or roll out of it canopy or no canopy.  I would have given this product five stars had the mattress been a bit thicker.
