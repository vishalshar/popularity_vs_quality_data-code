LOVE this product, and what's more so does my 6 month old!  We received the first one from my cousin at my baby shower, and little bits got it first at two months of age so he's actually loved it for several months. I've now bought four so that we always have a clean one ready to go!  Even his day care caregiver said it has been a long time since she's seen a little one so enjoy and gain comfort from something so simple.  I have also given this as a gift to several new moms who have also had the same positive reaction from their little ones!  Just so there's no confusion, this toy has stood up well to daily washing in the washing machine as I throw it in every day after I pick him up at day care.  We love aden + anais and have only ever had one problem with their diaper table pad changing cover due to it's ripping at the opening for the straps to hold our squirmy worm in place.  He was not in it when I changed the first of the two in the package, and both washed well, but the second ripped when pulling the strap through (the first had no problems!).
