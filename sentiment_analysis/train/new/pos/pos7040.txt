I got this when our baby was about 9 months old and she showed moderate interest in it. By right around 12 months though, this toy became a favorite! She loved the challenge of taking the rings on and off as well as finding different ways to use the rings, such as putting them on her wrists or trying to fit other toys through the middles. This has been a wonderful educational toy and the different colors, shapes, and textures really keep her attention. I was surprised when we got ours because it's slightly different than the picture... the dark blue is a triangle, the pink is a square, the yellow is a flower, etc. but this actually worked as a benefit because we can also talk about shapes at the same time. The only suggestion I would have is to make the base slightly weighted. Everything is hollow plastic, which is great for baby, but when she first started working on getting things on and off, it would topple over without one of us holding it steady and she would get frustrated with it. As her skills at it improved, she was able to place the rings on and off without need for it to be steadied. I also think that having the rings able to go on in any order since there's no widening of the column is great because she enjoys putting them on in different orders and she can play with it successfully now when she doesn't have the skills required to know how to put them on in a certain order. GREAT product!!
