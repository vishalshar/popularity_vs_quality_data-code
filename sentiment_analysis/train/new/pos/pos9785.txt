I previously owned a City Mini stroller which I absolutely loved. But when baby #2 was almost due, I decided to sell the City Mini and bought the Joovy Caboose Double Stroller. I quickly realized what a mistake that was since double stroller is really bulky and my 3 year old preferred to sit in the front. I can't really afford to buy a new City Mini, so after researching other options, I decided to buy Chicco Liteway Stroller. To my surprise, I find this stroller to be as good as the City Mini. Okay, it does not fold in 1 step, but it does recline as well. The foot cover, bendable leg rest and easy access bottom stroller definitely makes up for the 1 step fold. It stirs really well too.
