I live in Uganda and purchased it via the reviews and had it sent via intercompany mail.  The power here is sporatic at best, and I was able to easily assemble the unit by candle light.  It seems sturdy enough and it will keep my attention-demanding 4-month-old entertained long enough to make a cup of coffee which is huge.  It does swing a little fast even in the lowest speed but the directions state to place a blanket over the back to slow it down if necessary.  I can't comment on the battery life as we've only been using it for a few days.  As far as the noise of the motor, it can make noise at times, but I found a work around.  The directions also state to turn it on and give the swing a little push to get 'er going.  I've found that if you don't do this, the motor has to work extra hard and it makes noise.  The other trick is to let it start on its own to see which way the swing is going, and push the swing in the same directon as pushing the swing the opposite direction the motor is working will result in noise as the motor works to correct the oscillations.  It would be nice if music lasted a little longer or had a time adjustment - I think it stops after seven minutes (or something like that).  The music and sounds are much more tolerable than some of the other gadgets I purchased at the same time.  The only other thing that I think could be be improved is the height, that being it could be a little taller.  I can see as my daughter gets heavier that it may be a struggle for Mom to get her in and out, and I think there could be a little more room between the seat and the glowing dome thingy.  So far, not disappointed...
