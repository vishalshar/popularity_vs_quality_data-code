NOTE: Although the product is labeled co-sleeper, you need MINI co-sleeper sheets. The bed only comes with one sheet, so you'll want to buy extras.We think this is an AWESOME product and highly recommend it, especially for breast feeding moms. I hear some of my colleagues talk about getting up in the night and going into the nursery to breastfeed -- CRAZY. With this by the bed, our son doesn't even wake up fully for night time feedings. He's so close that I hear him when he first starts to grunt, so I can pick him up early enough that he normally dream feeds and goes right back to sleep. That means we ALL get more sleep. Also, since he's so close, we haven't had to deal with any of the sleep anxiety I hear about from colleagues who are banishing infants to a solitary night in the nursery.PROS:*Sides can be folded down and locked in place for co-sleeper or stood up for use as a standalone*Mesh sides for good breathability*Wheels function well and have a brake*Adjustable leg height*Attaches to the bed via an adjustable length strap that goes under the mattress (long enough for king) but can also be used as a standaloneCONS (All Minor):*Mislabeled product. We wasted money on co-sleeper sheets. You need MINI co-sleeper sheets.*Mattress is super plastic like and flimsy. Our son wouldn't sleep on it, but fortunately, the co-sleeper is the size of a king size pillow, so we used a firm pillow in lieu of the mattress and found success. Our son is nearly six months old now and we bed share but we put the co-sleeper in his room and he naps happily in it.*The basket ties are constantly sliding down the legs of the sleeper, so they don't look nice.*Don't care for the colors -- wish they were more kid friendly.*This is going to sound silly but since the co-sleeper has displaced my nightstand, I REALLY wish it had a cup holder on it. Breastfeeding is VERY dehydrating and I need water close at hand.
