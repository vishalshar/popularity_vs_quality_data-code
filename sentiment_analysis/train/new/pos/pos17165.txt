With my first child (She's now 5 going on 6) I had the privilege to try just about every bottle there was on the market at the time from the Dr brown  to Advent and the list goes on. Playtex drop ins was in the line up as well and guess what who won my heart!!!! Playtex. I didn't have to this time to buy a bunch of bottles experimenting because I already knew what I was going to buy. What I normally do is I'd  buy the drop ins for the early stage of life and then transition to the ventair. I absolutely love this product. For me it's very steril changing the bag is very handy at night (not having to get up to was out the bottle at every use.) And I've noticed a cosmetic change! They now bend and the cover clamps onto the bottom of the bottle (No more looking for bottle cover after every feed). Overall I love this product.
