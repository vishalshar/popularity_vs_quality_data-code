I bought this item by accident. I definitely did not read the whole description properly. However I was determined to make use of this item  since it would cost me more money to return it. Since you couldnt seal the bag, I had to figure out how to close it. I read one of the reviews that you can use cereal clips but I found binder clip works great too. Just make sure you wash the clips thoroughly. I would recommend using the smallest binder clips (mini). I would only filled the bag 2-3 oz of milk, any more will cause to leak. Plus this would leave some room to fold the opening down. It does not stand up very well so I would clamp to bags together. To put all my milk bags in one area I used a container that came with my fridge when I bought it. This help me take the milk out and in from the fridge easily. This item turn out to be a blessing since I didn't have to wash bottles.
