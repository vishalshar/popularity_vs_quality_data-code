The changing pad that this goes on is waterproof... so this cover isn't really necessary, unless you have 3-4! 1 for the changing pad, 1-2 in the wash and 1 clean ready to put on. However, the cover its self is great, and easy to put on. Maybe if I had a girl, I would only need one. But my son pees almost every time we change him, so I don't use the cover anymore.
