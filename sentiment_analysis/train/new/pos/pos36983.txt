This has been a life saver! My daughter loves hers! I recieved it when she was around two months old. She loves to hold on to the little bear. And sometimes she pulls it out of her mouth just to chew on the bear. We use it everywhere but I suggest to get two or more once you see how your baby takes to it. The best part is how you can prop the bear in all different positions to fit the need! I highly suggest this item for new moms. Only wish I had found it sooner because my daughter would keep spitting the passie out. I would have gotten a lot more sleep sooner lol.
