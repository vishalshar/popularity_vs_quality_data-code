I received one of these blankets at a baby shower.  It quickly became my daughter's favorite.  It is snuggly soft and just warm enough.  It has gone everywhere with us for the past 5 years.  When I saw how attached she became to it, I looked everywhere for the same color/pattern to have as a back-up.  I never did find the same stripes!  Recently, we left her original blanket at school.  Needless to say, we had a near sleepness night!  As I sat on the couch listening to her try to fall asleep with a substitute blanket, I got online and ordered 2 replacements.  The colors are not exactly the same, but she loves the softness!  We ended up sewing the two blankets together to make a big-girl size (now her toes don't peek out and get cold).  She loves her new blankets and they are quick becoming as irreplaceable as the original.  They wash well (don't get me wrong - after 5 years, they become a little threadbare, but still soft) and still look good.  You can tell this is a well-loved blanket, but it is still in good enough shape to travel everywhere with us (and not embarass the parents). I highly recommend the sof blanket!
