I bought this for my second child and I like that it is so much bigger than those tiny thin towels that you buy at the store.  This is a thick, soft towel with a hood on it. I will be able to use this past the first few months unlike the little baby towels.  I like that I am able to stay dry while getting the baby out of the tub and I don't have to lay her down on the bathroom floor to wrap her up.
