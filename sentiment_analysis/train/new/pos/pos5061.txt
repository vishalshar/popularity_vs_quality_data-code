While the local Babys R Us carries everything a new mother could ever dream of, the one thing you won't find is this remarkable little European baby bath. A friend in the UK told me I simply HAD to order one for my grandbaby - and she was right. Unlike the large, long plastic baby baths that are offered here in the states, the Spa Baby (also called Tummy Tub) provides an amazingly unique bathing sensation for even the tiniest of babies. Because of it's shape, the bathwater stays warmer and the baby is automatically placed in a fetal position. The combination of both is a sure-fire way to calm a fussy baby!My new favorite baby shower gift to give is one of these unique tubs, along with a basketful of baby bath items (shampoo, soap, lotion), washcloths, as well as a little hooded bath towel and matching robe. Always a hit!!!!
