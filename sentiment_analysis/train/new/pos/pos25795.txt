Item as described. Is super tall which is definitely what I was looking for because I have 5 dogs one of which is a jumper, he clears every other gate I have had but has yet to attempt to even try this one. The only this I would have liked to see with this gate would be a wider door so that if you are carrying something it would be easier to get through, but honestly I was expecting the smaller door because of a previous post.
