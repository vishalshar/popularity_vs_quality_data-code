This is the perfect teething toy for any baby! My son had been teething and wanting to bite down on any, and everything. We tried all the tricks, a frozen wash cloth, the cold teething gel toys you can refrigerate- he didn't like any of them... because they were cold. That didn't fly with him! haha. This Teething toy is perfect because as he bites down, it vibrates in his mouth soothing his teething pain. I'll admit, at first it was hard for him to hold as it was a little top heavy for him- but he was definitely motivated to figure it out! I highly recommend this teething toy for any baby!
