I bought these as something to throw in the bath when bathing the kids and they love them. My parents took half of them to use as pool toys so the kids could go diving for them and they work in that capacity as well. After a while a few stopped working but I expected that given the other reviews and considering how inexpensive they are I wasn't super concerned. I'll be buying these again when they all stop working.
