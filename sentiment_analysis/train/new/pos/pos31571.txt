I buy a new baby bath every time I have a baby (six so far) because I never fully like the one I had with the previous child. I finally found this and have used it for my sixth child. My baby bath search has finally ended. This tops every tub/sling/pad/bucket I've used - by far! I will be buying these as baby gifts and if ever I have another child because it's perfect.Safe, comfortable fit for newborn up to 6months (and possibly beyond but I don't need a tub for baby after 6 months so I haven't used it for anyone older) and easy to store. The plastic hook is removable so I can wash the bath and hang it to dry. It's super heavy when full of water but that helps it not tip in the bath water. It hangs over the tub and thoroughly drip dries in less than an hour. I think I'll keep it and use it to kneel on myself when I'm bathing kids. I seriously don't have a negative comment for this.
