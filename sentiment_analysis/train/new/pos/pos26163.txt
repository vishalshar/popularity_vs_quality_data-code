My girlfriend's roommate recently had a baby and their knees were getting wrecked kneeling down by the bathtub when they gave the baby a bath.  When I went to Target with my girlfriend, I noticed she looked longingly at a knee pad but ultimately decided that the $40+ wasn't worth it for the ugly and heavy monstrosity of a kneeler.Enter me, the hero of this story.  I rushed onto Amazon.com and browsed for knee pads and BAM!  This one came up as a top hit and had favorable reviews.  Best of all, it seemed incredibly cute and was much cheaper than expected.  When it arrived I was very surprised.  It's a very lightweight knee pad, which normally might be a bad thing because lightweight knee pads tend to move all over the place.  However, they designed the bottom of this knee pad with a material that sticks to the floor when you're kneeling on it.  And when you're not using it, the little yellow handle has velcro on it so you can open it up and tie it around a towel rack if you want.  In short, this thing is well designed.Best of all, I got major brownie points with my girlfriend and her roommate.  So what would you rather have?  An upset girlfriend with bruises on her knees or the coolest knee pad ever in the history of ever?  Easy choice.
