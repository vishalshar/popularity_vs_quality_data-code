I was hesitant at first because of reviewers saying how uncomfortable their baby sits, babies head bobble everywhere and that it is too tight for them. But after a few weeks I have not had an issue with either of them. I might just be lucky to have a 5lb 6oz newborn who fits perfectly in the carrier or parents are just over exaggerating. Everything is very cushiony so it's very comfortable for our baby. Shoulder straps and buckle are protected with the same cushion material so our baby doesn't have any trouble with those.Only cons is that is it true that it is very long. Our mid size sedan passenger seat does have to be reclined forward a bit but luckily my girlfriend isn't tall so that's not an issue.Only suggestion for parents is that you use this in SUVs unless you are short like my family and isn't bother with the passenger seat being pushed forward a bit.
