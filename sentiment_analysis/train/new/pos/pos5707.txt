We're using the Lifefactory glass bottles and this is working perfectly. It's study and does its job. I researched many bottle drying racks and couldn't find one that got good reviews for glass bottles. I took a chance with this and it's working great for 4 oz and 8 oz glass bottles along with all the bottle accessories .
