My ten month old loves these necklaces, and this one is great quality.  BUT, the color was horrible!  It doesn't match what I saw on the description-I was expecting an almost teal color, and this necklace was definitely green.  And not a very pretty green!  But it get used, as it's really just for him to chew on.
