This product took about 45 days to ship to me which was less than desirable. Slow shipping aside; this product is pretty amazing for the price! My son's daycare takes cloth diapers, and since they have to change him ever hour and everytime he poo's, I figured I'd give a cheap diaper a try. I figure I can't really go wrong with a cloth diaper if my baby is getting changed every hour. I haven't tested this diaper on my son at night; I'm not sure if I trust these diapers to uphold through out the night since they are so inexpensive. However, I did give it a 4 hour test; the insert is so absorbent that it felt dry when I checked it after 4 hours. I am so impressed with these diapers! After testing this brand on my son, I went back and purchased 22 more! Also, just to give you some perspective as to who is wearing these diapers; my son is currently 2 months old and about 11lbs with a big'ole belly; these diapers fit him perfectly!!
