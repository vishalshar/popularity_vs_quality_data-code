I like this table because later it can become a bookshelf or other storage piece that's easily accessible by a toddler. As some reviews state, it does not accommodate those bins you can slide in, but it can fit other plastic storage pieces. If the cubbies were bigger, it wouldn't still be a regular-sized changing table and wouldn't fit standard-sized changing pads, etc. I like the storage cubbies and the style of this piece. Feels like good quality too unlike some modular furniture pieces which feel cheap. Worth the price in my opinion.
