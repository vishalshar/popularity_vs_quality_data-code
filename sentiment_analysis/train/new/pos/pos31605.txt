I was hesitant.  Yep.  I almost didn't get them.  It would have been a HUGE mistake.  They are amazing.  I got them to use with my Medela PIS, and it comes with everything you need.What I love:-  I don't have to put on a hands-free bra and deal with putting the flanges in and then reattaching.-  It's such a quick hook up-  The suction is great, I actually have it turned down lower than I do with the regular flanges.-  Easy to remove if I need to get up quickly, just pull the hoses out and take them out of my bra.-  Pumping in the car is SO MUCH EASIER and DISCREET.  I will NEVER pump in the car again with regular flanges.  Ever.-  Easy to clean.-  Feels more natural, no weight dragging them down.One thing that is hard:-  You want to have the part the tubes go into completely dry before pumping again, so when I pump at work, I have to open them up to pour out instead of using the pouring hole.  This way when I wash I don't have to put water into that part.  This can be a bit of a pain, but honestly so worth it in the end for the ease of everything else.Sizing:-  I was a bit worried because I usually use a 21mm flange, but Freemie doesn't make that size.  The standard size works great for me!  I was worried for nothing.Massaging Breasts:-  The instructions give a warning that you probably shouldn't use Freemie if you need to massage your breasts to ensure milk flow.  I find I'm still able to massage just fine and it doesn't impact the suction.  It's actually easier than with the regular flanges which would break the suction all the time when I massaged.Now, do they just make my boobs look really big?  A bit, but crazy fake and flat in the front.  Therefore I wouldn't go walking around in public with them on, unless I had a huge sweater/sweatshirt to cover them.  But I will say again.  These things are the best invention, and I would totally get them again.  I wish I had them with my two other kids!
