Organic Baby Soy Bundler Zebra (Orange)I splurged on this item after seeing it on a friend's newborn.  The gown is so soft with a nice thickness.  My friend warned me that it did shrink a bit after the first wash, so if you plan to use for a newborn go for the next size up for greater ease putting on and taking off. (I purchased a 3-6 months for my newborn and it is now slightly bigger than the Carter's brand 0-3 month gowns...but so much softer!). The 3-6 months also has the fold-over hand mitts to prevent them from scratching their tiny faces.
