Excellent monitor for the price. The range is great and each part has an extendable antenna for even further range. The camera clarity and night vision are excellent. Both the camera and monitor can run on battery for like 8 hours, or you can plug them both in. I like that I can clip the camera to just about anything. The audio and range is great, and it shows the room temp as well. It even has a night light feature that you can control from the monitor for when you peek in on them. For the price, you can't beat it.
