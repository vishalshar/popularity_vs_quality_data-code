This toy has become my kids ABSOLUTE GO-TO. It never leaves her side. She sleeps with bunny (now bunnies) every night.As a result of being dragged around and much loved, it gets DIRTY. We hand wash ours in a mixture of gentle dish-soap and baking soda. We fully submerge, squeeze, and gently scrub. They lose a bit of their original softness, but truth is... they lost that softness months ago.Our one regret is getting our kid so attached to a toy that falls through her crib rails. She cries the minute its gone. Next baby will be getting a toy large enough to stay in the crib.
