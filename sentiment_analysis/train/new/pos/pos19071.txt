This is my favorite crib sheet that we have ever owned (which include some other high rated sheets on Amazon). My son is nearly 3 and still in a crib so these are fun for him as we are about to transition his crib to a toddler bed. Now he only wants to sleep on his "rocket sheets" every night so i have to launder it quickly so he isn't without them.I purchased this on a lightening deal so it was definitely worth it but I think I would still pay full price knowing now how much I love it.Oh, and all the stains he has managed to inflict on them so far has easily come out with (Oxi Clean).
