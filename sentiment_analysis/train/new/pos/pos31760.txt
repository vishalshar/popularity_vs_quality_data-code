Too cute!  Very effective on helping a picky eater eat!My grandson has allergies to a good many foods and he just does not like to eat.  But I have been serving his foods with this super construction set and he just eats so good.  He is 3 and handles his forks and spoons well but now he does so even better.I am one happy Nana here.I highly recommend this set of utensils for your child very own.  I do not let him play with them between meals because that would make them just another toy.  They have a purpose and that purpose it to eat with them.I paid ful price for this product but I wanted to review it so you would know what I think of them.
