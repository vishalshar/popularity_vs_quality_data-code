It's difficult to find a small enough leotard especially at a good price for my daughter. It is adorable on my 19 mo old. She is pretty thin around so there is some extra room. It isn't skin tight, which was to be expected considering the size range. This is the second one I've ordered because I needed one for her costume this year.
