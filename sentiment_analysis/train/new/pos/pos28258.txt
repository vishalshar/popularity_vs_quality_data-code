This item is a lifesaver for me. I own two peg perego prima pappa high chairs and the covers are awful. They are so so hard to clean and the fake leather easily peels off. The replacement covers are expensive - over $50 on etsy or more on peg perego. I found this generic cover and while it does not fit the chair properly, I am able to thread the strap through the center hole and make it work. The fabric is SUPER EASY to clean. It's a complete time saver for me. This turned two chairs I hated into two great chairs! I have the engine one and bought the pink one for my daughter's chair. A++++
