bought this product for our vacation and i'm very pleased with it.  it can hold 4 Avent 9 oz bottles, caps and nipples OR 5 Evenflo straight (i.e., not the Comfi type) 9 oz bottles/caps/nipples at one time.  so it takes me 2 two sterilizations each day--not bad even when we were on vacation, given you only need 7 minutes each time.  the only advice is you need to put in the nipples on the lower hook/racks before putting the bottles to maximize the space and fit the most number of bottles possible (caps come in last).  the hooks are also movable making it a breeze to fit everything in.  the only watchout--might be big for small microwave ovens.  in the hotel we stayed in, i had to remove the glass tray of the microwave to fit this sterilizer (and give it a little nudge to slide into and out of the oven).  overall, this product's great!
