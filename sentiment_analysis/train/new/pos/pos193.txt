Originally I gave this attachment a bad review because it did NOT fit my BOB 2016 flex stroller, but I called BOB before I returned this tray and they told me to: 1 put the left side in first. 2 raise the right side up until you hear a click (pretty high over the canopy almost). 3 Once you hear the click lower and slide the right side in HARD and you'll hear a click.  Now the IMPROVED feature of this is you don't have to take the whole thing out to get the kids out. Just release the right side and turn up, it'll stay clicked into the left side!
