My kids like having a bed with familiar and fun characters on it in bright colors.  I didn't give it 5 stars because we all were a little disappointed that it only has Pooh, Tigger, and Piglet instead of having all the Hundred-Acre Wood friends on it (and we couldn't find a bedding option that did).  The completely plain blue flat sheet could have been printed with some pattern on it.  We certainly have no major complaints though.
