This set worked great for our daughter. Very easy to push the air out. She never had gas issues with these. She did not have any bloating problems or any other issues like that. This is made of quality plastic and is chemical free.I really like the durability of this product. This product was easy to put the breast milk in and to heat up. My wife prefers these over all the others we tried. We liked that the set came with different nipples. This made it easier on us. Since she breast feeds she had a hard time finding nipples our child would take to and this set had the right one. Recommend to any person needing to buy these.your child will thank you
