I've only used mine a handful of times, but so far, so good.  Fit is true to description (although leg openings are a *little* small.  Shouldn't be an issue unless your LO has REALLY chunky thighs.  The snug openings do help to contain accidents though.  My LO can flood a diaper, but this held one void without leaking, and it even contained a very mushy poop.  We are still very early in learning to use the potty, but my LO did notice a difference when he went in this as opposed to going in his cloth diapers or disposables.  He actually told me he went instead of simply going about his business.  I probably won't venture to use these outside the house until he's a little further along in the process though.
