I bought this album for my eldest daughter when she turned 6 and started loosing her teeth. I absolutely love it, plus it is very cute.  The box keeps the teeth in place and it has where to write the date she lost them. It also comes with a pouch for the tooth fairy and a door hanger.  I'm going to buy my younger daughter one also!
