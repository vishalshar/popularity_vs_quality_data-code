I wanted a night light that I could turn on and off easily, and many other models have the switch on the bottom and it's small. You don't want to have to fiddle with something like that in the dark when the baby is crying. On this light you press the whole thing down and it turns on easily. It's easy to find even in the dark. The light isn't too bright yet somehow it's enough to illuminate a large area enough to see quite well.Update: We have 2 of these now, 1 in each bedroom. After a few months we still didn't have to change the battery. We use them all the time and they are awesome.
