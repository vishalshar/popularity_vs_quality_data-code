I love that this pump only weighs one pound and that I can bring it to work or in the car without worrying about finding a place to plug it in. It's a little bit noisy, but that doesn't really bother me. I have also used the Pump In Style Advanced, and I feel like maybe the Freestlye has a little less suction. I'm not sure whether that's due to the pump itself or the different design of the flanges. But it's getting the job done, and I've never actually used it above about a 5 or 6 setting (out of 9 for the high). I also like the Freestlye's shorter tubing, compared to the PISA.
