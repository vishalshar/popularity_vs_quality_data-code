Loved it! I was kind of scared after reading reviews but I noticed when putting on the tail if you loosen the Velcro on the sides the tails stands perfect & only put 2 toys in the center instead of all for the tail doesn't hang as low. I don't see how this toy is dangerous at all. It's amazing I'm actually going to order two more for some girlfriends baby showers! They loved it! & it's the only way I can get my daughter to have tummy time. The whale pillow is amazing! Helps my daughter from smothering her face in the ground when she 1st started tummy time.
