We couldn't find anything that could keep our 8-month-old dry overnight. He wet through his bumgeniuses in half a second, it seemed like... we tried EVERY disposable you could buy... Then a friend recommended these plus two bamboo inserts and bam, works like a charm. Dry happy baby in the mornings. :)
