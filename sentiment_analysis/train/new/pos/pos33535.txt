So I use this regularly and it's ok. I was pretty concerned about the gaps in the top of where the turning piece and the cup meet. There are gaps in the spaces so some formula from the other two sections can pour out and you're dumping the current section of formula in to the bottle. That looks like poor design. But it serves it purpose mostly.
