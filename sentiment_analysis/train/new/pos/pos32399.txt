Originally I bought the organic cotton binkie bungee for my son, after almost a year of use, the elastic string gets loose, didn't break, but the bungee looks worn and out of shape, so I ordered this one for replacement. However, this time my toddler boy use the elastic string for teething and the string broke right after 3 months of use, however my mother was able to replace the black elastic string and sew a thicker elastic strings on the bungee instead. Now after another 3 months passed, those new strings also almost broken, too.Don't get me wrong, this is a very good product, the colors on the bungee looks exact like in the picture, and the bungee is thicker and holds up the shape, a lot better than the organic cotton one. The metal clip is strong and really holds the bungee well, my son loves to teething on the whole thing! I just wish I known how to replace the broken elastic strings on the bungee myself.
