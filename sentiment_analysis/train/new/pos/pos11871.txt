I bought this since I was unable to get a BOB weather cover. I was a little worried but it worked. I have a BOB revolution double jogger. I am only leaving a review so that others know that this will work for the revolution.  I do suggest hand stitching the Velcro attachments a little better. I already need to reattach the Velcro attachment that hooks to the front of the jogger.
