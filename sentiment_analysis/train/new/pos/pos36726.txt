LOVE LOVE LOVE MAM (did I mention I love MAM?) The selection is awesome, so if you want your baby to look a little rock n roll or sassy (as I do) they have one for you. If you want dragons and knights they have one too. Can't find the lost bink at night? They have glow in the dark. Teething issues? They have binks for that too.  I kind of became a MAM hoarder in this respect! I also love that the images are part of the bink not some cheap decal or sticker.  Incidentally, if you have a mad teether as I do, if s/he happens to gnaw through the image all of MAM's colorants are non-toxic (This neurotic mommy asked!)  They also have cool tethers but MAM binks can be used with a standard tether as well (supervised always please)Aside from the cutesy and cool aspect, most importantly they are well designed in an orthodontic respect.  They adapt well for a bottle or breast feeder.  MAM does have some latex models but most are silicone based so you don't have to worry about allergies.They are also easy to clean, however I would not recommend soaking in soapy water as it may get into pacifier end through the air vent.  If this does happen just get a cup of clean water and dunk the pacifier in image side down while squeezing the "nipple" end and release while submerged to gather some water and then pull it out and squeeze to remove the gathered water (hope I make sense, kind of like using a bulb syringe) do this several times to clear any soap suds.  And no issues sterilizing but, per above issue, do not give a recently sterilized pacifier because although the surface cools quickly the hot water can gather inside and potentially burn.Sorry to go on like this but I do love this and other MAM products.  Might have another kid just so I can use them again!!!
