We purchased an older model of this stroller because my husband hated our Graco Quattro Tour and its large size.  If you are in the market, a word to the wise - hold out if you can for when the current models are clearanced to allow for new colors next year - same features, better price!  Plusses of this stroller - it is lighter and narrower than the Graco.  Also the sunshade can be stretched all the way to the snack tray so you truly can shade your child from the sun (the Graco's only goes overhead). However:  While folding takes up less net space, it is longer - it must be diagonal in my Jeep trunk and is too long for trunk-to-backseat.  I used to be able to have my Graco all the way to one side and carry a lot of cargo, but now I have to bury my stroller if I need to do it.  Also as many have said, the storage basket is hard to access...what were the designers thinking?  In the next update I'd love some accessible storage for things like change, napkins, etc. at hand-level like the Graco's had.  The cupholder is horrible, it won't hold a cell phone or keys without the danger of them slipping through.  Again not sure what they were thinking.Overall I would love to merge the features of the Graco with the lightness and maneuverability of the Peg Perego.
