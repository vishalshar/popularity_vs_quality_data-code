Just received the product and thought it is a great solution to eating on the go! There are 4 dif storage areas, 2 small snack containers and 2 large sandwich ones.of course if u chose to nestle that snack ones within a sandwich one, then u lose out on the space, but it's a great item regardless! The entire unit is not microwave/ dishwasher safe, just a few parts.I love that it is colorful..also love the built in compartment that houses the sfork n spoon..also love the wings that snap into place when stacking. I did not have trouble taking the blue lid off as another reviewer mentioned, but I was struggling with the wings a bit. But now its all figured out! I def see a lory of potential for this item, esp while always needing to carry food around for dd who is allergic to everything.I did take a star off for it feeling somewhat flimsy..its not a  bad thing, in fact I think it keeps everything more compact and lighter than having to carry around 4 easyfind rubbermaid containers.i also think it will prevent it from cracking when dropped. I'm just concerned about maybe the wings malfunctioning in the future.Their customer service is awesome. And the manufacturer is infantino. Great product and I def would recommend it to all ages for school lunches, work lunches, picnic packs, and day outings with our without kids!
