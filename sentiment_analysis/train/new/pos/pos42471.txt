I think this booster is super sturdy and fairly nice overall.  Coming from using Britax convertible seats, I didn't feel this was a real step downward.  Even the fabric is pretty nice.  When I was shopping booster seats, I didn't like the feel of a lot of them b/c they felt cheap and flimsy, i.e. the Graco Turbo Booster.  I also liked the idea of the LATCH connections, although I don't always use them.  My child has always been a car sleeper, and she has no problem getting comfy enough to conk out in this seat.  With all of that said,  I have two issues.  Number one - the width will for some reason adjust on its own.  I always have it adjusted all the way in anytime I'm messing with the seat b/c my child is fairly slim, but it will widen out within a couple of uses.  I don't know if this is a safety issue.  Probably I should have called Sunshine Kids, or Diono, and see what they say.  Number two - one of the things I liked about it is now becoming annoying to me:  It is very heavy and bulky, and is a real pain to transfer between vehicles.  It's even cumbersome moving it from the middle seat to the back of our Honda Odyssey.  I'm actually thinking of buying a Turbo Booster to have something easier to tote around when the need arises, if I can get over the differences b/t the two, and if it fits our child and car.  Both of these issues are also factoring into my deciding which booster to buy when it comes time for #2 to get out of his convertible.  I guess the bottom line is that if this seat is going to stay in one place 97% of the time, then it's really nice but if you're going to be moving it around much at all, then you might either rethink your decision or have another booster seat for moving.
