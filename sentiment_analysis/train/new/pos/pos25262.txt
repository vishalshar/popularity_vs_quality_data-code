So I've had both the original and performance models for about 2 weeks and I had the hardest time making up my mind which I liked best! The performance is MUCH more lightweight compared to the bulky canvas of the original. BUT I called ergobaby and was given lots of info from the actual person who answered the phone (not a recording!) and she told me the performance doesn't work well in the hip position since the arms are contoured...that helped me to make my final decision! We have a 2 month old boy- (14 lb) who is in the 95% percentile and I've been using just the pillow under his bottom from the infant insert which is just too bulky for my taste and too hot for us both!! He LOVES the original but not crazy about the performance!! But I on the other hand am only 5 foot and have a really short torso but felt the performance fit me better..........LOOONNG story short....I ended up buying the Original organic- I get it tomorrow! Hoping the different material but in the original design will meet my needs!Overall... due to large breasts...thanks Baby!! LOL!= I REALLY need good back support in a carrier and after wearing this one all day and feeling like I wasn't even carrying a chunky monkey....I've stopped the hunt for the perfect carrier. My ONLY con is I wish baby could face out in the front position. but I have a feeling we'll mainly be using the hip position once he gets older...for now...this seems to get him to sleep and calm him quickly! Ergobaby has a loyal customer here!!
