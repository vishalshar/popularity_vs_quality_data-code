My 8 year old daughter loves these full-size sheets to death. She got a "Barbie Room" for her birthday, and these sheets were a big part of that update. The texture is unexpectedly silky--there isn't much of a sheen to the sheets, but they are very slippery. The funny thing is that the fabric of my PJs kind of sticks to the sheets. The fabric is really different--not like cotton and not at all like microfiber. In any case, the images are crisp, and my daughter loves the feel of the silky smooth pillowcase against her cheek when she falls asleep.Other items purchased with these sheets (it all looks fabulous together!):Barbie Fab Plush Blanket - 62in. x 90in.RoomMates RMK1620SCS Barbie Peel & Stick Wall DecalsRoomMates RMK2271GM  Barbie-Feet S Fabulous Frames Peel and Stick Giant Wall DecalsBarbie Dream House Pillow with Handle
