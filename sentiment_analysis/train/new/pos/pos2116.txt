I bought this when He was a few months old and we still use it today.  He's almost 3 and has no qualms about getting hooked up in it to ride mommy's back.  A few weeks ago, we walked a 5K with him in it.  He had no complaints, My only complaint is that the right shoulder dug in weird this time around and left a bruise but that was my fault for not taking the time to resituate it. It looks complicated but after changing the pieces around a few times, it's like tying your shoes.
