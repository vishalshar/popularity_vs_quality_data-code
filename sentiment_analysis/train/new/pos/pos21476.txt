I love this stroller, this is my second jogging stroller, so I am very satisfied, because the first one wasn't worth 2 pennies.  This one has all of the good features and is half the price. Although there are no rear shocks, I really dont think that is a big deal, in comparison to my other one that did have rear shocks.  My son still falls asleep, so it can't be too bad.Also you WILL need the stroller shade because although the canopy does rotate up and down, it will only cover a small portion of your baby from the sun.  Still a good deal to me.The pockets and parent tray are very useful, plenty of storage(2 places). The tires work well and as my 8 month old grows, the footrest should work well, because it is not too small like the last one I had.  Padded handles, work good and the hand brake is definitely a good feature. ..Trying to make sure that I don't miss anything.We also use this to walk to the neighborhood beach, but I have to take my son out for it to roll on the sand.Very little assembly required, which is a big deal for me, pretty much just snap the tires on and you're good to go.There is no tray for your kid, but when you are running, he doesn't need a cup holder anyway, there are pockets on the inside of the stroller that he can keep things in, and they won't fall out when you go over a bump.
