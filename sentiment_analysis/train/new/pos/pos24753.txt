These are the best bibs out there!  I got some as a baby shower gift and had to buy more. Some brands (safety first) are super stiff and not convenient at all. These ate awesome and i wash them right in the dish water and hang them up to dry. After about 5 months the velcro started getting worn but probably from all the wearing and washing. Definitely try these!
