This is a lifesaver! We use these everywhere. With formula, it's best to not mix it with water until you're ready to use it. This allows us to fill the bottle with water as usual, then to put the formula in this caddy bottle until we need it. We use it in the diaper bag when we are out of the house, but we also use it at home. For the night time, we get three bottles ready with water, and use the caddle bottle to keep the formula upstairs. This way when the baby wakes up in the middle of the night, we can get the bottle ready with very little thought. Just shake formula into the baby's bottle, then shake the baby's bottle, and it's ready to go. We have four of them in total. They wash well with hot water, and have never had any issue with spilling or leaking.
