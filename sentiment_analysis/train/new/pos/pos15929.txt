I bought this back when I was pregnant with my now-2-year-old, and it still looks great!  We recently redecorated her room, so this didn't fit the theme anymore.  Still, it looked too cute to throw away, so I ended up giving it to a friend of mine.  She says her kids love it and it still looks brand new.  It's very sturdy and high quality.  Definitely a good buy!
