Received quickly and well packaged. It took about 15 minutes to untangle the butterflies and fishing line after removing from the package. It also helped to read someone else's review that said the butterflies could be balanced by sliding the string along the thin metal bars as my package did not contain any instructions. Aside from lack of instructions my only complaint would be that the fishing line was kinked in places causing the butterflies to hang crooked and the line from the loop to the first butterfly is "curly" as if it was overstretched but I'm hoping the weight of the mobile will correct it.
