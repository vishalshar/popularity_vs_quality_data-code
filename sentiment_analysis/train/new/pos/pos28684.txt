Finally a product that we've been waiting for! My friend Kenny who is 6' +" couldn't push the stroller without kicking the back of it as we walked, leaving all the stroller pushing to me. I saw this, purchased it and viola! Very very useful! Works very very well! Comes with 2 sets of handlebar adapters and fits my senior dog's pet stroller!! I know, I know, a dog stroller !, but she is lame and now Kenny can do his share of pushing the stroller while we get our exercise in, and our little dog enjoys the sunshine as we do our laps around the park. Kenny hasn't kicked, tripped, or skinned a shin on the back of the stroller since. Life is good!
