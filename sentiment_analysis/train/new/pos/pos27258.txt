The portable shower spray works good, if you use it properly, and if it is for the right type of application.You need the right tool for the right job.We bought this item to transfer water from our bathroom sink to the baby's tub.  We have a counter large enough to place the tub on top, but no easy way of moving the water from the faucet to the tub.  Which is why we bought this product.The Fit:It is super important that your faucet be the right size for the portable shower spray.  If it is not the right size then how in the world will it seal properly. You have to make sure the attachement is the right size for you faucet - crucial, can not stress this enough.Water Pressue:Since it is not a hard line that is attached to the actual faucet, you can not crank up the water to full blast.  Do not expect the water pressure that you get in your regular shower.  It is a shower spray for a baby.This works good as long as the seal is tight, and you do not turn up the water all the way.  We use it to fill up the baby's tub, and it is definately gentle enough to use wash the baby's head too..
