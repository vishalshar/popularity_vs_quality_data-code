I have the current model and the previous generation (model 02644) of this monitor and they are great.  Never had any problems aside from short battery life (which can be easily rectified by replacing the OEM AAs with a better brand once you start noticing a drop in charge time.)However, I recently purchased this camera to use with my older model monitor and they are not compatible. Although the description states that this extra camera will work with model 02644, I did not find this to be the case. If you are trying to get an additional camera for the older monitor, you need to get an older camera. Problem is that Summer Infant is not making the older cameras anymore. So you might be out of luck and forced to buy a whole new system (i.e., cameras and a new monitor).
