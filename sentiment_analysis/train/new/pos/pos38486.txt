I got this for our baby when we were going on a 5 week road trip and would be camping, staying in hotels and with friends. My baby was 8 months old and he would sleep in this at night. Sturdy, well made, comfortable, not too much padding (so no worries about suffocation), and it will be big enough for when he is 18 months, maybe even when he is two. I'd definitely recommend getting this. Worth every dollar.
