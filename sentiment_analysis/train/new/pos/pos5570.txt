Wow, this is a love/hate product!  Perhaps the one I have is a redesigned product (April 2004) because I see no problems with this product whatsoever.EASY TO ASSEMBLETook less than ten minutes, and no tools were necessary.  Anyone practiced in the art of assembling baby toys and gizmos will have no problem.STURDY CONSTRUCTIONTubular steel and metal joints for the load-bearing parts of the bedrail, soft plastic for the mattress-gripping feet, plastic and fabric where baby might chew.  The design grips the mattress VERY securely, and there are clever compression indicators to let you know when the rail is secured.  You do lose about six inches of bed width because the rail protrudes inward over the mattress, but that is required by the mattress-clamping design, and it is a worthy tradeoff to get a secure bedrail.SIMPLE USEThe foldaway feature is great for putting baby to bed and adjusting the bedding without completely removing the bedrail.  I would not recommend leaving bedrail in fold-down position without supervision, because a child could climb out of bed and get caught up in the rail while it is lowered.  It is very easy to completely remove the bedrail from the bed, so there is no reason not to remove it from the bed when not in use.Recommended for anyone trying to make that crib-to-bed transition.
