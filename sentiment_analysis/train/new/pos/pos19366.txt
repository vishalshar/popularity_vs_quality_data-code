These are slightly thicker than the ones I purchased at target. Not sure if it's a different style or these are an older version.We have about 30 of these and use them as burp cloths and layers for the changing pad. I don't know how I survived my first baby without these. They're cheap enough to have a ton around and not worry if they get stained. We layer a couple over the changing pad cover so we're not constantly changing the cover (after going through all 4 changing pad covers in one day, we improvised).
