This thing has saved my boy's head a million times. He is 10 months old and when he's not toppling over he's bumping into walls. We lost a son to a traumatic brain injury and did not want to risk another accident from a seemingly innocent bonk on the head. I would recommend this to anyone with an older baby/toddler who isn't safe on their feet yet.
