This car seat bast has been much easier than many others I have tried to put in to the car.  I don't even dread moving the base to another vehicle.I has a tension release on the belt which makes installing and removing the base so much easier.  Also, the anchor locks have a button to help you remove them when taking the base out.The only downside to this base was adjusting the tilt. It took me a while to get the base to tilt back further so the baby's head would comfortable relax against the back of her car seat.  Once, I figured it out it was easy to do!
