I'm giving this 4 stars only because I own this item for almost a year now and it was time to buy a replacement  so i ordered the blue one even though against my better judgement it said infant ALTHOUGH the pic clearly depicts the same footmuff I own on a stroller plus a carseat I took my chances and it wasnt the toddler size at all (Wishful thinking) but infact the infant. This says infant and its infant. The company DOES MAKE a toddler one and I wish they had them in stock seeing how any other kind of footmuff I have tried sucks, this one is the right amount of thickness and its perfect for my Uppa baby G-Luxe and for my tall toddler. Pleasee seller bring back the royal blue toddler size!!! I need it!
