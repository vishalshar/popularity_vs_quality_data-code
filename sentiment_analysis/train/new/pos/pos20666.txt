I bought this for my 8wk old son to sleep in at night and he loves it. I use the bassanet part for him and I set up the changing table and extra baskets for his bottles and diapers. And its perfect. It keeps everything organized when your sleepy at night. The color is a lot nicer than the picture they show. Its steardy and easy to put together. I'm glad I didn't buy a separate bassanet and just got the two-for-one deal.
