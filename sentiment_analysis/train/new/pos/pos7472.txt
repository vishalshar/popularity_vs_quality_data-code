We first gave this doll to my little girl when she was 4 months old.  She has loved it ever since.  We have purchased 4 of them so far so that we can always have one on hand.  My daughter is now 5 years old and actually saved up her own money to buy a new one.  It came in the mail today and she was so happy that she cried.  She still has 2 of the others (2 have been lost) and now those are the "big sisters" to the new baby.  The care instructions say "surface wash only," but I have tossed these in the washing machine countless times.  They end up less fluffy, but it has to be done and they are fine.
