I have never seen a sign with the words this one has.  It was so perfect because his daughter just delivered twins.  Grandma's pretty excited too.  Since the babies and Mom were getting all the gifts, I wanted something for the grandparents and this plaque is perfect.  You can hang it on the wall or it has an extra piece of wood and so you can stand it up if you prefer.  It is well made.  They were so surprised that they were getting a gift and they absolutely love it.  Thanks!!!!
