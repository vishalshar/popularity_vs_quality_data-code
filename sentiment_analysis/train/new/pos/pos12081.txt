This thing is a lifesaver!! it's really so easy to use everywhere!! and it doesn't slip or slide (if you put it right).. I have used this whenever we go visit family, go out to restaurants and I even used it on an airplane (3 different flights, ONE 28hr-trip); my daughter was 14 months at the time... bassinet is too small for her and the airplane seat is TOO BIG! I don't wanna carry her car seat with me and I needed a stroller where we were going so... I attached this chair to the airplane seat,and VOILA! my daughter is sitting next to me comfortably and playing and I am worry free! believe me YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS.
