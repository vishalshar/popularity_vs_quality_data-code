At 3 months, it's perfect for our little grandbaby when she's not being held. There are some gizmos on the thing that play music and vibrate, but we don't use them much. I like that it supports her in a reclined sitting position. We sit together in front of the window and "talk", or she supervises us as we do chores in the kitchen. Later on, we're sure she'll take an interest in the toys hanging in front, or make more use of the "bouncing" characteristics, but right now, it's a nice place to sit.
