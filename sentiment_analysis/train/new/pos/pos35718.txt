I just read another review on this that was bad and I was kind of amazed. We have this product and are very happy with it. We have used two rolls of the bags that came with it. 1 out of all 100 of these bags ripped. They do an amazing job of containing the dirty diaper smell. We have never had a problem with the Velcro closure. It's worked just fine for us. We have never had a problem with too many bags coming out. In fact, I was back on the company's website today to try to figure out what brand of bags they included so that I could buy more. Overall, we are extremely happy with this product. Don't listen to the bad review. Tip for parents, though: get the bag out and ready before you start the diaper changing process.
