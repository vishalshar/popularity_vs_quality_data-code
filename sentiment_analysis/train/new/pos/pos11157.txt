Black foam corner guardsPros:1. Inexpensive, you get 8 corner guards for $62. They cushy, not thin.3. Comes with 3M double-sided sticky tape.4. They are small.5. Black color is good for dark furniture. I have dark brown furniture.6. Easy to cut for a custom fit.Cons:1. You will see glue residue.2. Shipping takes a while (2-3 weeks) since it comes from Jinhua Zhejiang China 322200.3. They are small.4. My child was very interested in them after I had set them up but he hasn't ripped them off yet.Tip:1. Be careful when removing, the sticky tape will peel off your laminate.2. To make a snug fit, I open the foam corner guard like a book before I put it onto a corner.3. If you're worried about your furniture, try a different double-sided tape like poster tape.I would buy again.
