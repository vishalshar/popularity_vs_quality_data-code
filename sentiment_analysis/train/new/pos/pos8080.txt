They were so excited when I got these for them.  There is a good selection of letters & numbers & they have fun patterns on them too.  When slightly wet they will stick to the bathtub & tiles which is fun.  Also as they are foam pieces they are less likely to hold water to cause mildew.A tip to clean them though, is to throw them in the washing machine in one of those zippered 'linen' bags.  Just to give them that fresh feel again.
