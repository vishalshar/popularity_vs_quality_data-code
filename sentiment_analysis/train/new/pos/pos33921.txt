These little toys are adorable! I got them for my almost one year old niece for Christmas (she opened them early) and her mom was a big fan. She's been enjoying playing with them in the bath. What I love most about Boon Creatures is that their toys are very durable, but also stand out from the crowd. They have unique and charming designs that appeal to parents who can appreciate a more unique toy and to little kids who just love colors and playing!Great bath toys!
