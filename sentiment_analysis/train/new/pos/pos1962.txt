This shower mat fits very well in my 30" x 16" single bowl, undermount kitchen sink (Miseno MSS3219C 32" Undermount Single Basin Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink - Drain, 16 Gauge Stainless Steel).  It goes up about 1" on all four sides, but it is absoultely no big deal.  The suction cups keep it in place through bath time and prevent my little guy from slipping and sliding around.I love the ability to give my infant a bath in our kitchen sink, and will, for as long as possible to alleviate strain on my lower back and knees.  We started with the Summer Infant Bath Sling with Warming Wings, which worked great for the first 7 months.  By month eight (8), he started wanting to sit upright and the sling now became an impediment to bath time.  We tried bathing him with no pad on the bottom, but he kept slipping every time he would reach for an item.  That is where this shower mat came in and it has been a world of difference.  No more slipping!Once he is too big and we have to transition to the tub, this will definitely be coming along.  I can't really think of any negatives.  It is a good product.
