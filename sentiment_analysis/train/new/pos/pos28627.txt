This letter, which is 1 of 7 that I bought, are just perfect. Besides the fact that they are what I would consider a perfect size, they are well made and had no paint chips or anything. As far as use, you have an option to either personally install these little triangle hooks (included) to hang them on the wall. But they also come with pre-installed hanging areas where you can use nails to hang them. They have three colored ribbons as an option to hang the letters that are also included and the colors are a pastel blue, pastel pink or an olive green. Overall, these are just what we expected and look magnificent in my daughter's room.
