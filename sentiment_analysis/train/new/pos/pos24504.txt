I bought two of these to use as night stands and I love them. The quality is better than I expected - good quality wood and good finish on all of the parts you see from the front (back panel is composite and the drawer wood is unfinished and the bottoms are a bit flimsy, but still very functional and about what I would expect for this price). Other reviews mentioned that the drawers were small, and that it scratched easy - I thought the drawers were fine for what I wanted it for and I haven't had any scratching issues. As for other reviews about the drawers falling apart or not sliding right, see below.I would have given this 5 stars if not for two things:1: I had to exchange one because all three drawer bottoms were broke in half (looked like a shipping problem, but why is it packed with the flimsiest piece unprotected on the outer part of the box??) That was a hassle and made me nervous about the product, but Amazon was great and replaced it quickly and the two I ended up with had no scratches or problems.2: The directions were not entirely right and there was some difficulty with building it. The pictures of the drawer slides were backwards/upside down for where they are actually supposed to go. If you've never built anything with drawer slides, that could be confusing (could also be why some say they have problems with their drawers??). The hardware itself is lightly stamped with "R" and "L" indicators, so if you buy one, use those as a guide instead of the paper printed instruction pictures. Also, the back panel did not simply screw in (the rest of the building was very simple and all the holes and screws matched up great) and I had to use a drill to pre-make the 12 or so holes to screw them into. All in all, not a big deal, but it did take longer to build them then I expected.Overall, I would recommend it highly and I would buy more of them if I had a place for them. This is a great piece, especially for the price.
