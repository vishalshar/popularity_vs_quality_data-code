You should be required to buy this item when you buy the snack tray...I didn't want to buy this item.  So I made one.  But, as a new mom, who has the time to do that?  Just buy this one and be done with it.  I finally caved and bought this one in addition to the one I made.  This one absorbs water and leaks, and contains crumbly bits quite well.  It looks nice, washes well, and is totally worth the $30. My one and only complaint: I wish they attached a loop to the top, so that it would stay up.  It keeps sliding down toward my daughters feet over time.  Overall, another great product from uppababy.
