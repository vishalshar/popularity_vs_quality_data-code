We got this cup 3 days ago. And till this morning, we noticed that our boy keep sucking it really hard, but the water level didn't going down. I tried myself, it is pretty hard to get water out of it. And follow the instructions, there is nothing seems wrongly installed.After 10 mins exam and try-out, the trick is the center rubber protrusion. Push it all the way inside the valve disc, even concave inside. Then the water should be able to suck out and without leaking.(The original design may want the center protrusion to lock again the valve disc, but still can move a little to let water in. But the reality is not what they designed.)Hope this may help you to solve the problem and enjoy the product from now on.
