I was not sure how I felt about a video monitor but I LOVE it. It is so fun to watch him as he falls asleep or wakes up. Plus it is great for making sure he does not climb out of the crib. This is the second one I have purchased. I got it because it has a digital transmission so it is suppose to be private. The first one I got was analog and I could see the neighbors baby so they could see mine and I did not like that. This monitor is good picture and sound. Sometimes it is a little quirky so I worry that it might not last very long. Sometimes it freezes up and I have to turn it off and turn it back on. But that does not seem to be a big deal right now. The other thing is that the temp on it is not super accurate. Sometimes it is right on but others times it is off by 3-4 degrees. It fluctuates alot too, within a couple of seconds it will go from 65-69. So that is odd but I did not really buy it for that function. Overall I love it and I am really glad I bought it.
