Good spoon.  They really are spatulas and very good for scraping food from around baby's mouth.  However, they are very rigid, so the shape of the spoon makes it difficult to scrape the last bits of food from the bowl.  I don't think they would work as well with first foods because they're a bit flat (hard plastic) and I think that would cause spills, but for second foods and beyond, a good design (although the handles are shorter than I thought they'd be based on the pictures).  The spoons I found to work best were Nuk rest easy spoons - they have a longer handle, the flat tip for scraping, more depth to the spoon to better hold foods, and the spoon part is flexible.
