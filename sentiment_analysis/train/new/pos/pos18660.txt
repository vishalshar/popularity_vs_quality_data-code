We've tried a number of different brands of pacifiers and always come back to the soothies.  They are durable and easy to care for plus my kids love them.The 3+ month version is exactly the same size and shape as the 0-3 month version but it's made out of thicker/tougher material.  The difference in material doesn't matter all that much until your baby gets teeth, once they have teeth you definitely want to switch as it's really easy for kids to bite through the 0-3 month pacifier which is a choking hazard.  While it's much more difficult to bite through the 3+ month pacifier it's still possible to do so.  You'll want to keep a close eye on them and inspect them for any damage on a regular basis.  My kids didn't have any difficulty switching from the 0-3 month pacifier to the 3+ month pacifier.
