My husband and I were thrown for a loop when our second child took what seemed like f.o.r.e.v.e.r. to sleep through the night.  I came across an article on tips for helping infants adapt to their cribs that mentioned 'fuzzy' fitted crib sheets.  We were more than fully stocked on the classic crib sheets of the same American Baby Company brand, but I came to Amazon, found these and decided to order one.  The chenille sheet made a HUGE difference for us.  I cannot say it was THE thing that helped him sleep through the night, but it really made a world of difference.  It is so soft and cozy, like a blanket without the 'unsafe sleep' hazard of having an actual blanket in the crib with a tiny baby.  It never felt cold or scratchy like basic sheets sometimes can.  We only had one up until several months ago (he's 18 months now) and would wash it and put it right back on his mattress after learning the hard way that he could not be tricked into the basic cotton sheet :)  Even through hundreds of wash cycles, these sheets have not faded and still appear to be in brand new condition.Pros: Extremely soft, cozy, durable, well madeCons: None
