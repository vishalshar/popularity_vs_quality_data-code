I needed something i could travel with that wouldn't take up much room in the car and could easily sit in any chair. I love the pattern of this chair. The colors are very true to the picture. I also have the bouncy seat in this pattern. So far my children and i have traveled across the country with this seat and it fits easily in my trunk. Its easy to attach to every chair. This tray fits in my dishwasher and washes back to white every time (great for my spaghetti lover!) the only complaint i have is the cover gets very dirty and food gets under the pad at every meal. It actually got so gross that i took it off completely and never put it back on. One thing i love that the description does not tell you is that you have the option of not only the 5 point harness which is great for smaller babies but you can take out the straps and make it into just a 3 point buckle for the older chair. Its also nice that the back comes off and can turn into just a basic booster seat for a older child. If the cover would cover the whole chair or was made of a wipe able fabric or plastic then this chair would be perfect.
