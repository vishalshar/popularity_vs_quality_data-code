Having used these plates for a while (my daughter is now 15 months), I am happy with my purchase but want to make sure other parents realize what they are buying. Here are the things I like about the plates:- The price for a three-pack is not too bad considering the size, quality, and cute colors (they are still in great shape after several months and being cleaned in the dishwasher).- I like that the three dividers are different sizes: small medium and large. This is more realistic than three equal-sized dividers, which is what I had previously. When she's ready for it, I think the smallest divider will be good for dips like ketchup, ranch, yogurt, etc.- The oval shape of the dividers is easier to clean than squares- The rubbery edge of the plate does prevent skidding. We had one plate that was so skiddy we just gave up on giving it to her and have put it away until she's older.- The plates nest easily for storage. I'm consider getting another 3-pack and ditching the other plates we have largely for this reason.However, please be aware that this plate is just as easy for a little one to pick up and throw. I don't remember what it said when I bought mine, but it seems that at least on the Amazon listing, they have tried to blunt the expectation that it is "throw resistant." It took my baby no time at all to figure out how to lift this plate. She does have to use both hands, though, and can't just "Frisbee" it off the high chair tray. Usually the time it takes her to coordinate lifting the plate gives me a chance to take it from her if we're sitting together, but if she's on her own it will be on the floor. :-)If you relieve yourself of the expectation that this plate will stay on the tray any better than other plates, you'll probably be happy with your purchase, too. :-)
