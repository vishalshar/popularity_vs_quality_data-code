I bought this phone with my own doubts, after all the reviews in here. My son was 6.5 months old when I got it :Cons :1. Yes, it is not loud!2. Yes, it has boring two or 3 sounds3. No flashy lights, that I would have expected calling "smart phone"but surprisingly :pros:1. the Pink color is very flashy and baby likes it!2. Very light so, can be held by the baby easily3. keep him busy and he is fine if we give him this instead of mommy's or daddy's phone when he reaches for one!4. Though its not very thin, baby can bite into it without any worries!I was planning to return, it but he wouldnt give it to me when I wanted to pack it! So, it stays!
