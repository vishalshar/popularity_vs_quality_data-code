My daughter is 6 and we live in the country with no access to level ground to learn to ride a bike.  This attachment has been great.  She not only is learning to keep her balance, but she can also keep up with me.  With training wheels, it was impossible.  She loves it, and I love it.It isn't hard to ride or handle.  I thought that it would be hard for me to maintain my balance, but it isn't.  I would recommend this item to anyone who has a child; who for whatever reason needs trainig wheels or is too young to keep up.
