I bought this for my granddaughter. I honestly don't know who is more happy with it my granddaughter or daughter. It's easy to hold, soothing for teething babies. We have put it in the dishwasher without any damage. You can place it in the freezer too, although we have found the refrigerator to be sufficient as we don't want tiny little hands getting to cold.  A happy baby makes everyone happy.
