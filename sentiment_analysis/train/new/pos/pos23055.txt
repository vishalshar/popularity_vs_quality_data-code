I was looking for a thickier, smaller, kid-sized wash cloths for my kids as well as fresh new cloths to wash my face.  I did not want thin, small ones.  These are not as big or as thick as a regular wash cloth.  The are still a good size, not too small, to too big.  They have some weight to them and are perfet to stock up un and have around for baths, washing faces & hands and general after eating cleanup.  For me, exactly what I was looking for, including a very cheap price.  Not cheap quality.
