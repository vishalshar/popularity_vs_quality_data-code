This is an ideal space-saving solution for small kitchens.  We bought this for our 7-month old and he loves being in the center of the action.  Our only complaint is that the extension arms aren't adjustable -- so our island countertop ledge isn't super deep and therefore there is a few inch gap between the countertop edge and where the chair/seat starts.  I got around this by buying the Kiddopotamus rubber place mat with catcher lip that hangs down and catches most of what he drops.  Other than that, it's really easy to clean, seems comfortable and is really easy to install, take along to family's houses, etc.
