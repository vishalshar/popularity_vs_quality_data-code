This product is obviously no 5-star from the look of it. So given the expectations it serves well for what it is designed for - useful baby monitor.Pros:- Color wireless clear view in day time- Sound activated when baby cries, unit turns on to alert- Night vision (very disappointing clarity but you can make out what's going on in the crib)- Bi-directional audio communication (you just press a button on the handheld monitor and speak to it, the camera unit in the baby room broadcast loud enough of what you say. This is very useful when you need to speak to the caretaker or someone in the baby room to do something.Cons:- Very short battery life in the handheld unit. You'll need to keep it plugged in constantly. Wont last for 15min in my new set.- Very annoying beeps when the camera is turned off or unplugged when not needed.**NOTE: No option to disable this alarm so you have to turn OFF the monitor entirely when you are bothered enough. Yet you'll continue to be annoyed when the handheld monitor is touched of any key! It will turn ON again and start beeping throughout.- Very low picture quality in low light condition, the infared turns on but picture is so washed out. You can barely make out the scene but its the better case compared to not seeing anything.This set would be a 5-star if not for the annoying beeps and picture quality in low light even with infared turned on.Conclusion: 4-starWorth the bucks and purpose. Don't have to spend hundreds on this kind of equipment since this set has all you need.
