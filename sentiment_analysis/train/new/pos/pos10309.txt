My kids are grown so don't need diapers. I'm using them for a million tasks in the kitchen. They are perfect for so many things. My current favorite use for them is to wrap freshly washed and dried spinach and stored in Tupperware rectangular keeper. It keeps for more than a week. There are so many more kitchen uses.
