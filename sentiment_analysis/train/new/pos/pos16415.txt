I've been using this bag for a few weeks. Here are what I love about this bag. It's versatile. I can load everything from breast pump, flanges, adapters, iPad, wallets, cell phones, etc. This bag is absolutely adorable. My mom really likes it and she wants me to order her one. The design of this bag is fantastic. It goes well with all the outfits I have. I was a little hesitated about the black and brown together at first. When I matched my outfit with the bag, it just looks fabulous together. I plan to repurpose if for my everyday bag or carry-on bag while travelling after my breastfeeding period is officially over, which is unforeseeable future. My pump is a compact size Spectra M1 that can fit inside the side pocket and still have room for tubing and breast milk bags and battery adapter. The other side pocket is for my personal belongings; pill case, baby wipes, key fob, glass case, etc. I still have enough room to fit more if I want to. In the middle compartment, I load the cool bag that filled with flanges and milk bottle. The iPad mini is inside the padded pocket along with my notebook and agenda. I still have room for my wallet. It is considerably expensive since I have to convert the currency from Thai Baht to US dollars plus the shipping cost me nearly $40. I still think it's totally worth it. I carry my Maddy bag everyday which is unusual for me. I like to swap purses and carry brand names purses to match my mood & wardrobes. Overall, I highly recommend this bag if you ever hesitate. Since, I was one of those who reluctant about buying pumping bag. Now I'm totally hooked. I can't wait to see her new design and colors. Hopefully, I'll be able to have another one of her new designs to accompany my Maddy bag.
