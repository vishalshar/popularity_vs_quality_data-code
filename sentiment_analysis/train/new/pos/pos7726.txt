loves these bumkin bibs in all sizes. This one is for the babies starting out on solids.We had the regular size for our daughter and used 4 bibs for 2 years without any tears. They have been slightly stained by food, that's just what happens naturally (carrots grrr). So we got these tiny ones for our 6 month old and they are perfect bc they're small enough to fit tightly around the neck and doesn't have excess material to bunch up around feeding table.Love: lightweight, velcro adjustments, takes NO space in travel bag, hand or machine washable on gentle cycle (don't use drier bc plastic!), cheap but good constructionIf you find that the pocket sits too flat/closed to catch crumbs, i would suggest you turn the bib around and flip the pocket. This will make the pocket pop out. Just don't be too concerned with wearing it backwards, it's a great money saving trick.Note that it's NOT completely waterproof the way platic wrap would be. It's slightly porous so after time, it can feel damp- just take it off your baby when done eating. I found it being porous is a good thing bc makes if feel light, pliable, not stiff or slimey.I would buy a few bc it can take time for washed bibs to air dry.
