I love this set! I purchased it for my 28 mo. old off of Wendy Bellisimo's website - shortly before she sold out to Babies R' Us.  I then had a seamstress order fabric from her and create an incredible custom window valance and a bench pad for a window seat I got from Pottery Barn.  Even though I wasn't ecstatic about the set being half the price of what I spent, I loved that I now can buy matching accessories - pillows and wicker baskets for under the window seat.  People ask me if the quality is the same: no, it isn't.  I checked out the set yesterday.  The originals were very high quality & better thread count.  But you know what?  I think the quality was just fine for a newborn (considering you usually use one of those tie "drool pads" under them) and they aren't rough.  My sheet did start out thicker - like a linen - and softened w/ wear. I know the last post wasn't thrilled with quality, but I have never seen a prettier set ever.  I am having someone create twin bedding for me now - this is a look she can have until she is grown.  Think about that.  How many baby sets can you say that about? Nothing "cutesy" about this set. And although you don't use a blanket when they are little, those of you who have newborns remember - they grow up.  My 28 mo. old uses a blanket and a mini pillow now, and this blanket is awesome.  I will use all pieces of the crib set in my attempt to create a twin one.  You will love your nursery! This set is beautiful!
