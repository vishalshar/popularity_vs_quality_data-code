I was hesitant to buy it due to some of the negative feedback about these folding seats, but if you use the seat properly, you will never have a problem.The seat is to be placed towards the absolute back of the host toilet seat - this reinforces the back fold and prevents any sort of collapse.  Follow the directions and you will be just fine.  Makes even the shadiest of public toilets bearable.The included carry bag is great for keeping germs where they belong.
