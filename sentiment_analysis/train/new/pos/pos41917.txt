Safety 1st High-Def Digital Monitor: I live in the country and miss hearing the birds and my wind chimes during the winter when you are stuck in the house. I have this hanging outside protected with a squirrel baffle out by my bird feeders and chimes and it's working great. I had an analog monitor and the white noise drove me crazy. This monitor has no white noise. I read where people had problems with this monitor and after 3 weeks I've had no problems whatsoever. It has been turned on continually for the 3 weeks and I have not lost connectivity one time. I leave it on my counter and it stays on 24-7. We've had snow, wind and rain and it has worked flawlessly.
