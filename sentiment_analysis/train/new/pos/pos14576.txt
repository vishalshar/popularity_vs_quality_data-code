Let me begin by saying that the estimated 6 months or older recommended for this toy is wrong. In fact, this is why i knock a star off. This toy is great, but if you buy it for your 6 month old, you will be waiting probably at least 4 or 5 more months for s/he to get the full benefit of this. It is somewhat heavy, and since babies like to pick things up and try to chew on them, your child will definitely knock his/her head a few times, which leads to tears often.Okay, so those are the bad, here is the good: the sounds this little plane makes when you roll it will definitely captivate and amuse your baby. Additionally, the peek-a-boos also make cute noises when they are opened and when they are closed. The design of the releases will encourage a bit of problem solving for your child, as they are all triggered differently...one is a push lever, one a pull down, and the third is a twist knob. So, your baby will try for a while to figure out all three. My daughter has figured out two (the twist is a little beyond her so far). Closing them will also challenge your child a little, as getting them to stay closed requires either luck or a dedicated last push on the baby's part. However, my daughter doesnt get tired of trying (well, at least, it takes her a while before she is ready to move on and try again some other time). The color scheme is also appropriate for a baby. It is bright and multi-hued, which they seem to enjoy.Anyways, a good product, but really more geared for around 10+ months old rather than 6+ months.(my daughter turns 11 months in 5 days as of this review date FYI)Enjoy!
