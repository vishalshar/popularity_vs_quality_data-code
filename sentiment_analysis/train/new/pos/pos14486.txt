You can't beat this spout guard for the price.  Ours has lasted over a year and is still being used.Update:  We used this spout guard for about 18 months non-stop.  We only quit using when my daughter got to the age where we didn't fear her hitting her head on the spout anymore.  It worked great for us the entire time.  It stayed on the spout through all of her baths and daily showers taken by the rest of the family.  The only time I would take it off was when I cleaned the shower.  I had to put more air in it a few times during those 18 months but I think that was just due to the length of time and how much we used it rather than any defect or fault.  I noticed some other reviews saying that it didn't fit or wouldn't stay on and I should point out that we do have a Delta tub spout which is flat on top, more oval shaped, and maybe a little larger overall than a traditional round tub spout.  We got a year and a half out of a product that we had hoped would last six months...you can't beat that.  Would definitely buy it again.
