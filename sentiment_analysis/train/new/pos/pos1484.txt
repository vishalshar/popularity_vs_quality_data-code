I am so happy with this baby bath. I love how easy to use it is. And the rubber material that the baby lays on is super soft, and keeps the baby in place- no sliding down. My baby girl loves bath time. If you fill the bath to waist level your baby stays nice and warm during bath time, while you wash her and pour warm on her. I also love that when bath time is over, a quick rinse of the baby bath and I just hang it up to dry. No deep crevices where mold can grow. Very clean, easy, and baby loves it! Would definitely reccomend it!
