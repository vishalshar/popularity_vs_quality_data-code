These are my favorite bottles. I tried these, Dr. Brown's, Avent, and Playtex. I like using these the most and Avent second best. The Born Free glass bottles hold more than your average bottle (5 and 9 oz. instead of 4 and 8), allowing significant room at the top for powdered formula to sit when you first pour it in. The wide mouth also makes it easier to pour in the formula--less chance of missing the mouth and spilling powder. And unlike the Dr. Brown bottles, you don't need three different cleaning utensils to clean all the parts.I don't know about the anti-gas claims. My baby sure does have some gas no matter which bottle we use. But I'm very happy with the fact that these are glass, and they seem well made. Unfortunately, they do leak a little when thrown around in my diaper bag, but I mostly use them at home anyway.As for the peripherals, the cleaning tools are great, though they don't last long. The sponge will eventually tear, and you will be sad about it because the twirling handle made bottle cleaning almost fun. And I do love the formula dispenser, which I find very easy to use. Born Free does sell a formula dispenser on its own, but I'm not sure if it's the same one since that one gets a lot of complaints. People have said that it leaks and the lid seems like it might fall off, but I don't find that to be the case with the dispenser that comes with this gift set. In fact, the lid is sometimes hard for me to remove. They also said that it's hard to dispense the powder into the bottle, but I find that the powder just slides right out. You just place it upside down on top of the bottle's mouth, slide it back and forth, and out slides the powder.
