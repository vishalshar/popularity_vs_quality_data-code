I have a 31m and 12m sons and they can both use these no problem with the suction. I think my youngest had an issue at first and I gave him the easier straight straw cups but that was when he was about 7 months and first started using a sippy cup. They don't leak and I they're so much better than the click and lock which leak and are terrible. And my kids have chewed through some of the other cups so straws are durable here. Only other brand I've tried is one kind of Nuby which leaked. Not interested in trying 20 brands that don't work so I'm on here buying more....
