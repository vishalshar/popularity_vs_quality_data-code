i bought this as a teether for my 10mos old son. He was chewing so hard on his fingers that i was worried he would hurt himself. He also kept chewing on any stick-like object he could find and i was afraid he would choke/gag.this is not his favoite teether. his favorite is the yellow banana silicone toothbrush- but it has the gagging/choking issue because there is nothing to stop it from going into his throat, it's just like a long stick.The green sprouts silicone gum massager is his next favorite after the toothbrush. He also really likes the MAM round silicone teether/toothbrush/gum massager.That dark blue part can snap off sometimes if pushed REALLY hard by an OLDER child. but the light blue part is all in one piece. and i found it easy to snap the dark blue part back into place. my 10mos old son has never been able to remove the dark blue part on his own.I also got ARK's Vanilla Scented Grabber XT Oral Motor Chew. but he doesn't care for it as much. this green sprouts silicone gum massager is his favorite after the toothbrush.
