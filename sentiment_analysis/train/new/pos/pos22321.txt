Got this for our 5-month old.  She's 7 months now, and still likes this toy.  What I like is that she could use it while lying on her back and kicking with her feet, or while on her belly.  Now that she's sitting easily, she can use it sitting up.  We did put a piece of tape over the speaker because it's a bit loud.  But we have that issue with most toys, so it's not that big a deal.
