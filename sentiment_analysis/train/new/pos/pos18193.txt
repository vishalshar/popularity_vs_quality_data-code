Amazon has this at a great price, better than Walmart.I bought this when my baby was 5 months and it is the best thing ever. She sleeps so well in it, and looks so comfy. I wish I would have had this sooner when she was smaller. Is super soft, but not that weird kind of soft like the little lamb rock n play. The kitty one is perfect! My baby often rubs her fingers back and forth on the edge just feeling the soft fabric.  The vibration on the rock n play is perfect! Its strong enough to lull them back to sleep!  When I bought my bassinet, I would only buy one that had vibration, so the fact that this rock n play includes that is awesome!As for the concerns over torticollis and flat head, I can see why this may be a problem if you start baby in this from infancy and sleep the baby in this every night. My baby at 5 months easily moves her head around and I can kind of position her on her side just slightly in this as well.  I don't think baby should sleep in this every night when they are very small, so have a back up basinet or use your crib as well on some nights. This is also great to keep in the living room, keeping baby at the same height as you are sitting on the couch, instead of baby feeling like they are low to the floor all the time sitting in their bouncers.Its such a great price, you wont regret buying it!
