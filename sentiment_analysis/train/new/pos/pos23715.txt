I've been using these straps for a year and a half now and love having them!  I've used them with three different stroller and have had great success.  There is a difference on how the stroller will hang depending on the type.  Don't think that a full sized stroller will hang like an umbrella (common sense).With the Inglesina and the McClaren, the straps fit all the way around the stroller holding it up.  With my Bob Revolution (2013), I had to adjust.  I just loop the stroller straps through the push handle bar and the foot/brake bar (when folded).  I don't have to take off the wheels or anything.  This keeps my stroller up so I can still use the floor of the trunk for groceries and what nots.  Just lifting the strollers off the floor make the trunk much more usable.
