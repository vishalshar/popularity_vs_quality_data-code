Hello!I have a baby girl that just turned a year old, and for her birthday, along with many toys, she got money, and I thought it was a perfect time to shop.  I saw this pony, and fell in love.It was very easy to put together (even for me!).  The directions were very clear, and understandable, but the only complaint that I have is the stickers.  The directions for where to put the stickers take a little time to read, and I must tell you - when you put a sticker on the plastic, it is on for good, and will rip if you try to remove it.  Please be very careful when applying these.  I am going to try to contact Fisher Price, and see how to get a new sheet of stickers.  The two for around the nose I applied wrong, and I took them off.  Now it has no stickers there:-(.Otherwise this is a great toy.  The sounds it makes are cute, and the songs are ones that I haven't heard on a children's toy lately.  It is such an adorable pony!I hope that this review has helped you.  I would reccommend this to anyone, as long as your baby is over a year. ;-)
