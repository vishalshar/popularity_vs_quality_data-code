I've been very happy with these and love the colors. They have held up very well while trying to wean my daughter off of her pacifiers. She had been having a tendency to chew on her pacifiers the last couple months and compared to others we have had for her where she would easily bite through them, these have held up very well. They are Silacone too, just in case your child may have an issue with that.
