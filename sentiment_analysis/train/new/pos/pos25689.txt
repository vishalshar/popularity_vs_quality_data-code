I own both the Bumkins snack bag and the Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens 2 Count Snack Mini Reusable Snack Bag, Funky Monkey Remix.Here's my review of the Itzy Ritzy: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NN1E99D5C4HMI like the Bumkins bag a lot better because:1. it's MUCH easier to thoroughly wash and dry on a day-to-day basis. This is the same material as the super awesome Bumkins Waterproof Super Bib. It doesn't hold stains and dries in a jiffy. This makes it very practical to use every day - which is key for busy moms. Itzy Ritzy was a lot more difficult to keep clean.and2. way cheaper than Itzy RitzyBoth have zippers, which I prefer to the velcro.The prints are loud and colorful. Some adults may find them garrish. My kid loves the Dr. Seuss pattern. I personally would be fine taking this in my own lunch to work. Sure, it's a kid's print, but who cares. It's a sack lunch snack bag. If someone at work is going to make fun of you for having a Dr. Seuss snack bag, they need to seriously grow up.It's NOT waterproof, but will hold moist things fine. You probably don't want to put anything super juicy in it.
