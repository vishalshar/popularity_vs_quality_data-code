Very cute bed my daughter loves it! This bed is for a crib sized mattress so if your child is too big for his or  her crib just get a real bed. I also love that its very low to the ground so she can easily climb in and out and even if she falls its not that much of a fall. Also it seems pretty sturdy y daughter likes to bounce on her knees on the bed and the bed is still intact. My daughter is two and sometimes she just likes to lie on her bed and smile.
