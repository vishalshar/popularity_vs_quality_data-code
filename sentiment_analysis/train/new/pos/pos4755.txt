This is a great little kit. We still use a lot of the pieces even after 15 months.Some of the items we haven't used at all, but that doesn't mean someone else wouldn't need them.I wasn't sure what all was included when I ordered it. In case you aren't either this is what is includes:* Thermometer* Forehead thermometer* Comb* Brush* Gum massaging brush* Finger gum massager & case* Teething ring* Medicine binky* Nail clippers* Medicine syringe* Aspirator* Nail files* Medical cards* CaseIt's great for the price, and the products are a high quality.I'm very happy we bought this.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::I hope you found this information useful.
