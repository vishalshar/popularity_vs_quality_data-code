These are such a necessary item. I found myself panicking when my daughter would drop her Nuk on the dirty floor time after time, which is really bad when you are out and about and only have a few nuks in your bag. These clip anywhere and stay on. She has never had any problem with them coming loose and they come in a bunch of great colors. They are thin and silky like a high-quality ribbon material and the velco is very secure. I would suggest getting two or three. They are great to leave one clipped to the carseat or stroller.
