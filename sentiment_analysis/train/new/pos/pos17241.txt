This is a life saver as our infant would not sleep in his bassinet. The snuggle nest provides a safe place for him to sleep with us. Having him in bed with us really helped with feedings and calming him in the middle of the night.  My baby is a wiggler and found that he would sort of  slip to the side and out the bottom. We solved that by placing the enclosed end at his feet. We've used this for two months straight so far and think it is totally worth it. It also works well traveling around, baby can now sleep on the couch at grandparent's house.
