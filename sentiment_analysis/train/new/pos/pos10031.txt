I fell in love the time i saw the video for this stroller from the Phil and Ted's website! I got the second seat for free from their March 2013 promo. The only thing is i have to buy a citi grips handle bar cover for l11 dollars here in amazon because the rubber handle bar may break or chip form continuous folding from the ground but otherwise it was very maneuverable and can fit our military lifestyle. We do traveling and moving and having a compact double stroller for a new born and a 2 yr old toddler is really helpful for us. We do not want a heavy stroller, we purchased a single stroller called Quinny buzz and it was also good  but we just need to update for our growing family. This is worth the money. A quality compact stroller that fits a family that travels a lot!
