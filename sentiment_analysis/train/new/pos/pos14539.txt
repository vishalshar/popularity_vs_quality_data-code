I've been using these for months now and I can't live without them.  They are a must for bath time.  They are great toys and don't take up so much room because they stack.  they are wonderful for pouring water over baby's head and back.  Baby loves them too!!  He has to take one with him after bath time is over.  Trying to take it away to get the little one's pajamas on is a feat.  I wonderful, simple, useful, well made toy.  It's a must have for every new parent.
