This bottle organizer is the best!  Before buying this I had bottles scattered all over my kitchen and no real system for storing and organizing them.  I have been able to set up a bottle station on my counter and everything is in one location now.  It has definitely filled my OCD need for bottle storage and organization.  I agree with other reviewers that the bottles don't always slide down smoothly, but definitely not an issue for me.  Also, while I wasn't able to make this work for my current cabinet set up, the dimensions of this organizer appears to be perfect for placing in a cabinet so that you can save precious counter top space.
