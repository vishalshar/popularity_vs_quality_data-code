This is a great value for the spare parts.  I like having an extra set at my office so I'm not toting a bunch of small parts back and forth.  I agree with the previous reviewers about the extra bottles themselves.  They are thinner plastic and feel cheaply made in comparison to the bottles that come with the Freestyle pump.  However, they do their job and connect onto the other parts just fine, so it really doesn't bother me.  This is the best deal I could find on the spare parts kit, so it's a tradeoff I'm willing to make.
