These sleep sacks are awesome! When my baby was small I used them with his arms in to keep him wrapped up tight for naps and sleeping. He had flailing arms during his naps and it constantly woke him up until we started using this sleep sack. Yes, I could have swaddled him, but I wasn't great at it and it always fell apart. This sack is a one stop shop for swaddling without having to spend hours figuring out the art of swaddling (I think you're either really good at swaddling, or really terrible!) When my son started attending daycare at 8 weeks he wouldn't nap at all without the swaddle, so it was perfect for them too!As he got older and started rolling, we kept his arms out. In this regard it serves as more of a "blanket" while your child is still too young to have one.The fleece is VERY warm, so it may not be appropriate for everyone. We used it in the summer when the AC was on with a lighter footed pajama underneath. If you have the heat on, you may want to opt for a cotton swaddle sack instead.This material is super soft, and the velcro stays really well. No complaints at all!
