I have nine month old twins and they love these cups.  They have been using them since they were about 5 months old.  They are easy to hold, easy for them to sip, and they don't leak.  I can put two of these FULL in my diaper bag and not a drop of wetness later.  My babies still get wet but only because their mouths are not leak proof!  I purchased four of these cups, two 2 packs.  Both times I have received a blue and a teal.  These cups are really super and the only ones I will use!
