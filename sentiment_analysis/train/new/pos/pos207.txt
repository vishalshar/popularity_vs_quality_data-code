My only complaint is that I wish they were a little thicker. The thickness of these towels are THIN -- thinner than a beach blanket.When I wrap my baby in this towel, my clothes get wet as my baby's wetness soaks THROUGH the thin towel and onto my own clothes.Other than that, we like the little hooded feature for her head so she doesn't suffer from heat loss after a warm bath.For the money, it's a decent product.
