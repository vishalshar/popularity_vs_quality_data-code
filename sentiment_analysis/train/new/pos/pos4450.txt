The stroller part of this travel system is great. It is really easy to steer and the basket underneath is nice and roomy. The phone holder and the cup holders could stand to be a little deeper. The car seat is really soft and comfy and the infant head support is perfect because it keeps the baby's head from flopping around without making it hot and sweaty. The canopy is kind of a piece of junk though, and the car seat feels a little heavier to me than the chicco. My biggest complaint with the car seat is that you have to unthread the straps in order to get the shoulder pads off. This is annoying since the fabric really shows stains when my baby spits up or drools. It does clean up nicely in the washing machine though. Overall, I really like this combo and prefer it to the chicco one I used for my last baby.
