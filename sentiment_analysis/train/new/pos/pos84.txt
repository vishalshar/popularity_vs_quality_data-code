After trying every kind of sippy I can find, I buy gerber brand sippy cups exclusively. They are easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and much more leak proof than any other kind. The valves last way longer than others as well. I highly recommend these!The only thing I would advise is to make sure you specify that you want the blue & green. I know it says blue & green in the listing, but I was sent pink & green at first. Luckily Amazon is awesome with returns. :)
