Kind of cheap, but it was only $9.  It does the trick.  For an easy quick window screen, you probably can't go wrong with this thing.  The roll-up button does work well.  I'm worried about it breaking in the future, but so far I have no reason to expect it to.  It includes 3 suction cups, one for the bottom, and 2 for the top.  I don't think the description mentioned that...but it was nice to receive them.
