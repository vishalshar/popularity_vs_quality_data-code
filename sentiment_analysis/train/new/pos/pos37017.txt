Works fantastic. It's a travel potty...nothing fancy. Keep it in the car and it's ready to use. I purchased extra boxes of gallon sized freezer ziplock bags on sale to use with it. My little one is 2 and it works fine with her. I love that there is an actual seat instead of the bag touching her skin as some other travel potty designs, seems way more comfortable. I like that the legs cold and slide closed to make a compact little item to store nicely in the back of my car, but it's also super easy to quickly open when needed. Both sides are also storage compartments, keep extra bags, a little pack of wipes and an extra pair or two of undies just in case. I wouldn't say this is something that you could tote around daily, about the size and weight of a smaller sized breif case. But again works great to keep in the car, camping, or even traveling to toss in a carry on bag(but I have a smaller more compact seat for that reason). I truly would recommend this!
