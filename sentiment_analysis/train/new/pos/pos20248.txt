Absolutely outstanding! I was driving down a highway at 60 miles an hour when an SUV apparently didn't see my car and attempted to cross the highway, resulting in a severe crash.  My 10 month old baby had minimal bruising at the straps but was perfectly healthy. We are without a doubt replacing our Peg Perego convertible seat with the exact same model and hope it will never be in another crash!
