I have two other children and I have had Walmart, Kmart, and Babies R Us, diaper bags and paid anywhere from $20-$80 for them. This time around I wanted it to match her car seat and I looked everywhere and could not find anything I liked so I though this was a great deal. I love the big bag its going to be perfect for the hospital. I tend to over pack and the small bag is perfect for my 7yr old she can't wait to help and the small one it perfect for her to carry the babies stuff. The outside it really great material however I don't like the inside it's very thin material looks easy to rip. The changing pad is very thin as well no padding. The extras are neat I'll find use for them. Overall I love it. Your not going to find another set like this for this price.
