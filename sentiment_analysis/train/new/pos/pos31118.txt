This product was a good buy b/c it has a good reasonable price and can be used for years! While it doesn't have the quality of the Stokke, I think it compares well.  I am under 150lbs myself, so once my child is done with it I will be able to use myself- you can't beat that for just over $100.  The Stokke runs much more and offers the ability- to use from toddler to adult.  The only problem with this one is the wood quality is not great- you have to unscrew the sides a bit to move the seat and it split a little while putting it together... but in that... you get what you pay for.  So overall, we saved a lot of money buying this one and it still works great.
