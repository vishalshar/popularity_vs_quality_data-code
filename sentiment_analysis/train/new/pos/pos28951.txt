I have wanted some reusable pouches for a while, and it took some time to figure out which one would really work for us.  I'm glad I chose these.  They are easy to use and my kids love them.They haven't leaked at all, which was crucial for me.  The double zip part can be really hard to open, but I think it's worth it to ensure that the pouch won't bust open and have food spill all over.
