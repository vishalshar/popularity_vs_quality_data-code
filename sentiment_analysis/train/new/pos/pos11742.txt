I love this cooler. I bought it for when I had to go back to work after maternity leave. I pump at work and use this to hold the bottles and pump parts. I can fit 4 Medela 5oz fat bottles, two small ice packs and a quart size ziplock full of Medela pump parts (2 each of flanges, connectors, yellow membrane holders and membranes). I store this all day discretely in the work fridge among the other bagged "lunch bags". This bag is slender and doesn't take up a lot of room in the  crowded fridge at work.Coolest part: the handles snap together so I can snap this straight to my pump bag! It is so awesome to carry one bag and have this bag attached securely to that bag's handle.I had one spill happen because I didn't screw a bottle lid as right as I should. I didn't notice it until I got home after 50 minute commute. Besides being devastated that I lost some milk, the cleanup was easy. I just rinsed it out and wiped with paper towel. No smell. Super simple.Lastly, like I said, I have a long commute. Usually 50 mins. one way. The milk stays cold in this bag with a frozen ice pack.Highly recommend this for pumping moms that have too much crap to carry.
