We bought the standard wooden rocker with ottoman which was great til 4 month baby was all of a sudden 12 month baby. This ottoman pairs wonderfully with the matching rocker. I've fallen asleep while rocking my now 14 month old several times. Everyone I tell about this set says yahoo.com yahoo.com sure but I'm felling you if I'd have tested it in a store I'd have paid double. This is amazing.
