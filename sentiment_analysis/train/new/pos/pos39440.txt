We live in Phoenix, obviously sun is a big factor here with a newborn. Having read some fairly negative reviews I was a bit hesitant, but since the sun was stopping us going out with the baby in the stroller, I thought it was worth a try. We find it brilliant. Once attached to the stroller, it can be pushed down to the foot area and left attached while down. Then you just pull it up when needed. It does stretch tight when fully fastened, but we have not had any problems with it popping off or not reaching the canopy. Additionally, I find that leaving it attached at the foot area means that I can put burp cloths or baby wraps at the bottom of the stroller without them falling off, as the sunshade makes a sort of pouch. (Our baby is now only 2 months, I suspect this storage plan will not work once she is bigger). I wish I had bought this shade from the beginning, when she was still in the bassinet. Highly recommended.
