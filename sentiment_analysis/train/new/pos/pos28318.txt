I love these blankets. My son is a year old and we use them daily. They have held up great in the past year. One has a few snags but the rest are still in excellent condition. Very soft and cozy. Also thin enough for summer time babies. They are some of my sons favorite blankets. I buy them as baby gifts now and all the mamas have LOVED them. I highly recommend this product. Very happy with it. I will order again :)UPDATE**Photo is of blankets after 2 years of use! Yes, they still look new. I'm not really sure what all the negative comments are about on this product. These blankets are the best on the market. All of the other blankets out there like it are trying to copy this blanket/brand. The size is perfect for swaddling an infant, covering a car seat, using it as a nursing cover or even covering a toddler up on a warm sunny day. These blankets are extremely soft and have no itch to them what so ever. I highly recommend these blankets to all new mommy's. I have also bought them as baby shower gifts. How many blankets do you know of, that can hold up as well as the ones in the picture, after TWO YEARS of use?? Multiple washes, drags on the floor, drops on the ground, boogers and spit up on them and they still look new!! Why are you still reading this?!? Go buy these blankets, I promise you wont be disappointed.
