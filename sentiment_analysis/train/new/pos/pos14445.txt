I don't boil my bottles because we have well water and they get mineral deposits on them. This steam sterilizer is great. 12 minutes and 6 bottles and all their pieces are clean and sterilized. I gallon of distilled water from the store lasts me about 1 month sterilizing my bottles every 2-3 uses. I gave it 4 stars because of its size. Beware, it does take up counter space if you have a small kitchen and no where to stash it!
