I love this changing pad cover! That sounds funny to love a changing pad cover, but I have had six kids, so I have had a lot of covers!  I was skeptical that I would like this changing pad cover because the price is so reasonable.  I didn't want to by something that was cheap looking or that would not last.  This cover fits my contoured pad perfectly, and it is nice and soft.  It has been washed lots of times and it still looks new.  I decorated my babies room in a soft coral color, white, and gold.  I was looking for something basic and simple, but good quality.  This was exactly what I needed.  I love that when I lay her down to change a diaper that this cover is so soft.  It makes me happy!
