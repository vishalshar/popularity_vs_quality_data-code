I bought two of these small sized plush blankets......to line my spoiled cat's bed with! I know this is not the usual purpose of these blankets but they were just what I was looking for, for my kitty who hates the cold.The blankets are very pretty in color, and beautifully soft on the plush, fluffy side. The underside is a silky satiny type fabric, as is the all-around ruffle. I have washed and line dried the blankets several times and they come out as good as new.My cat loves the blanket and she "kneads" the soft fabric before curling up to sleep. OK, not the most conventional use for this type of item, but really suited my needs well :) A good buy, well made and stands up well to solid use.
