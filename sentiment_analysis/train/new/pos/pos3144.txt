These two frames are perfect for my baby girl's bedding! I ordered bedding also off amazon that has a damask print and bright vibrant colors also. They are pretty heavy and since I can't nail into my walls I had to buy some heavy duty double sided tape to hold them up, and also got some little hooks to hang the strings on. It all turned out pretty good! If you like sticking to the theme of your nursery or room I would definitely buy these frames!
