This nap map is super-soft and pretty.  I wish it came with a plastic bag to stuff it in as my child's school requires that it be stored in plastic to come to school.  I resorted to using the plastic bag from her old nap mat ( Rollee Mat brand ) and the blanket fit but the pillow would not.  So, she is using the Lambs & Ivy Mat at school without the pillow.
