My wife and I live in an area where both West Nile and EEE are prevalent so protection for our infants is paramount.  On top of that we have twins so we research our purchases extensively as most times we are buying two of everything.After some extensive research and looking at the competition we decided on the Jolly Jumper (one for each child) and used them all summer long with great success.  The netting is lightweight, fits very nicely over our Keyfit30 car seats while they are placed in the stroller and didn't bother the kids one bit.  I would imagine, based on the size that as the kids grow out of the car seats that these will fit (as pictured) over the entire stroller, twin or otherwise.This is just as advertised, works great and gives you a lot of flexibility in terms of long term use.
