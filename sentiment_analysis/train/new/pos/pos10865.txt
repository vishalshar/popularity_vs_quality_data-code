Mortimer the Moose was a hit with my daughter who is only 3 months old but VERY active and attentive.The moose has so many nice colors to attract my daughter's attention. In fact, as soon as she saw the moose, she smiled and kicked.Given the size of the moose (fairly large), it is not a problem for her to handle it since there are so many places she can hold on to.  She is easily able to grip onto the mooses legs and/or "ring" tail (the tail of the moose is 2 textured rings, which makes for easier handling with little ones that have such small fingers).The ears are gummy and great for teething babies. But for my 3 month old who has no teeth just yet, she is content to suck on the mouth of the moose which is soft, instead. The nice thing about this is I don't have to worry about the fur coming off and her choking on it.This moose is wonderful for her motor skills. I like the fact that it is all-in-one--a chew toy (ears are gummy); a rattle (2 hoofs rattle), a crinkler (two hoofs crinkle when squeezed); has play rings (tail is made up of 2 colorful, textured rings); a stuffed animal (something to hold that's soft and cuddly); the scarf crinkles; the body of the moose has a squeak toy inside, so when you press the body it makes a squeaking noise; and last but not least, it even has a hook (ring shaped with opening) to allow you to hang the moose any where you'd like.For the price, it's a wonderful gift, a great deal and will sure to be a hit with the infants! (BTW, even my 3 year old loved it!)
