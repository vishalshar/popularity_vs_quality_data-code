These bottles are awesome for days when you are in a rush rush rush. I bought these for my son (now 23 months) back when he was starting on solids around the age of 6 or 7 months. When I was in a hurry, he could eat without me having to spoon feed him. We used these for a good 2 months or so probably 5-6 times a week and they were life savers!To use, you simply spoon the food into the nurser, then GENTLY (as in SLOWLY) push the bottom disc up until the food fills the nipple. If you just jam it up, it's going to make a mess (as I did one time and learned from). Our daughter is six months old now and I came back to order these AGAIN to use with her. We've had them 2 weeks and used them a few times with no issues whatsoever. They are an incredible time saver. I even bought a set for my girlfriend to use with her baby several months back and she thought they were incredibly handy especially on evenings when she was rushing one kid to football another to cheer and life was too chaotic to sit down and spoon feed her daughter.I do want to say after reading some of these reviews that I would not use these as the ONLY way to feed you baby and also that my experience has been that using these does not "delay" the baby in any way from learning fine motor skills as I had read previously.
