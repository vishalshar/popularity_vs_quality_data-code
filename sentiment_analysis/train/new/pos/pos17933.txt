I've had bad luck with other crib sheets until I ran into this one.  I absolutely love how SOFT this sheet is!! My little guy moves a lot at night causing his face to rub on his sheet a lot.  With other sheets he's woken up with rashes on his face (like rug burn almost) but this one is so soft and gentle on his sensitive face.And now for some irony, it's TOO soft.  I don't know about the next guy but I wash the crib sheets with my baby's clothing, clothing that sometimes has a velcro.  Well, the velcro attaches to this sheet and WILL NOT let go, causing it to snag.  So, if you have clothing or bibs or whatever with velcro, don't wash it together with this sheet.
