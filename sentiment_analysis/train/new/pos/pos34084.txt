Very helpful product!  If you are already breastfeeding or have in the best (or have a spouse that is) you know that the bottles and parts are hard to clean (dishwashers just will not remove breast milk residue!).  This quick-clean really works - I just keep a little rubbermade tub next to the sink and throw all the parts in there (bottles, breast pump parts, even pacifiers) and then put a squirt of this in, fill it with hot water, let it soak for a few minutes, and then simply rinse them off with hot water out of the sink sprayer - voila!
