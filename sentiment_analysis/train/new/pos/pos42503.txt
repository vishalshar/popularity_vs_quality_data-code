I agree with other reviews in which people liked the size of the bag. Baby isn't born yet, but so far I have it packed up for the hospital. I like the various pockets, and I like that it's not huge. It's cute, but as others said, it is gray and orange, not brown and orange as it sort of appears in the picture--but that's fine with me. I withhold the 5th star only because the changing pad is reeeeal thin, and because the main compartment zippers zip all the way down the sides. I would prefer they didn't so things don't fall out. I also like that it's not egregiously priced. I look at the price tags of so many diaper bags and think "What the f? Is it gold lined?"
