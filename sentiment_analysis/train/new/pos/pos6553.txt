I bought this for my son when he was born back almost 8 years ago. I have had a couple more kids, and they have each had their turn with them. They are plenty entertaining for a baby. I loved the magnetic fasteners. They are well mad and lasted almost 10 years with hard daily use and countless washings. Definitely a good buy.
