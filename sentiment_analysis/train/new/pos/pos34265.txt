This board works great with my bob revolution stroller.  It was relatively easy to put together, and what was really nice about it was that it came with its own 4-in-1 tool, no need to raid my toolbox.  My two year old rides on it very easily and loves that she can get on and off when she wants.  I thought it might be a little awkward for her to hold on, but it wasn't.  I have only used it on neighborhood streets, but it rides great and goes up and over curbs very well.  It did take a couple of minutes to get used to walking behind it, but I suspect that is the nature of the product.  Also, it is extremely easy to take off and store, and the adaptors that are included are very easy to switch, so I can use it with my other strollers as well.  I would highly recommend this board to others.
