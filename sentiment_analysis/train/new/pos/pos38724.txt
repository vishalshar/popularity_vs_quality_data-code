These are very cute! The are absorbent and big enough for an infant. Definitely not big enough for a toddler! Love the hoods (even though they are to big for my 8wk old). I'm only giving 4 stars because they are very thin. I would prefer a towel with a bit more girth, but for an infant towel these work just fine. The also roll up well for storage which is very handy.If this review was helpful please click the helpful button below!
