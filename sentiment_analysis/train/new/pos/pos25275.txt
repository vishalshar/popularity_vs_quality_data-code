I bought these especially for the auto sensors which automatically turn on in the dark and off when ample light reappears.  We live on a street that doesn't have street lights so our home is really dark at night.  Lighting from these functional night lights provides a perfect path of light.  I came back to get more because I'm very pleased with these.
