I was hesitant to purchase this baby book as I could not see inside but it was very cute so I decided to go for it. I am truly happy I did. It's great quality and well illustrated. There are lots of sections to fill out key information without having to write huge paragraphs. There are spots for pictures on each page as well as some blank white pages at the back if you want to stick in more photos or add in any extra information. There are also clear full size pockets for storing anything else important and as it's a standard style 3 ring binder if you really wanted you can purchase and add in some picture sleeve sheets as well. The book is large enough to accommodate quite a few extra pages...but I would get get a separate photo album. I would say that it focuses mostly on the first year.... there is a page for each birthday to 5 as well as the first day of school.
