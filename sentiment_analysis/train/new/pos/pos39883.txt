These swaddlers have been a lifesaver with my last two babies. I didn't have them with my first, and they really make all the difference! I have babies that love to be swaddled and require it to sleep well. Just using a blanket is fine when they are newborns, but as they get older and stronger, they break out of the swaddle a lot more easily. This means I have to get up in the middle of the night and rewrap, which ends up really waking them up. Any new mom knows that sleep is a precious commodity! The Velcro is nice and strong, just make sure you stick it down when washing them to avoid gunking it up! My only complaint is that it can be a little hard to get everything wrapped and velcroed correctly with a squirming baby, so it might take just a little practice. Overall, can't live without my swaddlers!
