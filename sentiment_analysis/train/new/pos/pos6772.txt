I was going to purchase a "diaper caddy" but most were the same price and couldn't be used for much else after we out grew the need for a diaper caddy. The inside holds the box of wipes (vertically) and a good stack of diapers (didn't count them). It also has 3 pockets on the back side, which I wasn't expecting, that fit a full size bottle of baby powder, the baby lotion, and diaper cream.
