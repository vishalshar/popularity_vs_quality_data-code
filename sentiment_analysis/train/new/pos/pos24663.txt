As I write this review, I am sitting comfortably in my new Ultramotion glider. The chair is very comfortable and both my husband and I are very pleased with the support and comfort provided in this chair.However, putting the chair together was frustrating...just the handle assembly part.Very important: PUT THE HANDLES ON FIRST!Also, the amount of force needed to put the plastic rivets into the handles was very surprising.  We used a small screwdriver for leverage to get those plastic rivets in.  It's easy to get the handles confused as to which is left and right, so just do one at a time, as the rivets are different for each side.  We didn't notice this until one rivet was in, of course in the wrong side, which we couldn't remove, but used tin snips to cut a round rivet for the side that didn't need it.But after all that, it was great to sit in the chair and let those stresses drift away as we rock back and forth.The fabric is velvet-like, which I wasn't aware of and seems like it will be hard to clean, so I'll be making slip covers to keep it clean and change the look.  The light brown color is nice, but not too crazy about the velvet texture.  I'll feel better about any messes, spills, and oops moments with 2 slip covers.All things considered, this chair is great. I'm glad we splurged and I feel like we made an investment with this glider and ottoman combo.  I love that the ottoman glides with you when on the chair, a nice touch.  Looking forward to nursing in this glider!
