I am very pleased with this add on, and I think it's a must for anyone that uses a Medela pump.The 3 nipples are medium flow, so this would be for babies 4 months and older. It's not ideal for a newborn, because if they get accustomed to the heavier flow, it may interfere with establishing mother's milk supply and baby may refuse the breast in preference for the bottle.You also get: 3 bottle caps (which go over the bottle with a nipple on it), 3 storage caps, 3 discs for travel purposes, and 3 collars. The Medela pump that I have came with 4 storage bottles, so this is perfect for turning them into drinking bottles. I pump into the bottles, freeze them, then we need the (thawed and warmed in a bowl of hot water) milk, we just open and pop a collar and nipple on it.Oh there is also a nifty mesh bag for keeping all the parts in one area which is dishwasher friendly. Anyone who has a baby knows how baby gear and feeding supplies can just multiple and get 'junky' so I really appreciate having something to corral these parts.I think the price is reasonable, because instead of buying a new set of bottles, I can just use this with the existing Medela bottles that I have. It makes for better organization and reducing clutter (not having 10 different types of bottles with their random parts to keep up with.)Very pleased with this set, and I highly recommend it.
