First off, my order was delivered quickly and safely.  Secondly, the picture didn't do justice to the darling little wolf!  It looks so real with fluffy fur and a face you just want to nuzzle.  My youngest is partial to wolves as she was once told it is her totem/symbol.  the surprised gasp of delight was just as pleasing to me as the delightful plush toy. And each awww she got from on of her sisters just made her smile bigger.  Thanks Nat and Jules!  I would recommend you to anyone that wanted to surprise a loved one with a quality gift.
