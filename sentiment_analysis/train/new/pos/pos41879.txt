I bought these corner edge protectors to put on my coffee table since my 1 year old is in the living room playing all the time.  Even though our table ledge is rounded (but still has pointed corners), these protectors adhered securely.  I didn't think they were going to but once I put them into place, they stayed.  My daughter has been grabbing them and playing near them and they don't come off.  They come with several pieces of strong double-sided tape.The only down side is I am not sure how easy they will be to remove when the time comes.  I'm not sure if they will leave a mark, but the flip side is that my child cannot rip them off of the table which is important to me.They're very padded so I am not too worried about my daughter being hurt on the corner of the table anymore.  Good buy!
