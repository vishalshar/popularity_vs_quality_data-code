My 8 month old loves this. I needed something for him to grab on to and play with while nursing (instead of my lips, teeth, and face ha!). He can easily grab on to it, and when He's sitting on my lap he can chew on it, or I take it off and let him play with it. It's a little long, so when I'm nursing him I usually tie the back up a little to shorten it.
