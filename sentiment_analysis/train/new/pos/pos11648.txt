These are really cute and my son likes them. They feel really cheap and I wouldn't want to sleep on them, but my boys don't care.  We bought these as extras to have for nighttime potty accidents. They are great for that purpose and just general use. They are a LOT easier to get on than our more expensive land of nod crib sheets, and they seem to be holding up better than an inexpensive 2-pack of crib sheets we purchased at ToysRUs which ripped at the seam. The slightly roomier fit makes for easy on/off which is really nice for the crib/toddler bed mattress. It isn't so loose that it would cause any problems for a baby, but just a bit easier to get on instead of the acrobatic stretching maneuvers required to get our others on the mattress.
