My daughter almost always falls asleep in her car seat. Since we are amateur parents, we wondered why our daughter woke up nearly every time in a larger-than-normal fit. Since her head fell to the side whilst asleep, loosening the straps would cut into her neck. These do a good job protecting her now, even giving her a fun distraction when we put her into her car set. She sleeps even more soundlessly in the car seat as well.I will mention two quibbles that we have which really aren't against Summer Infant, just things to keep in consideration:1. The warning label/safety tag is as large as one of the entire protectors. It's designed to tuck inside the cover when it's strapped on, but its frequently coming out. We just cut it off eventually.2. They're definitely 'cushy'-straps. They're pretty thick cushions. Now that the days are getting warmer, it's definitely starting to overheat our daughter.Again, we absolutely love the product, and will continue to use it as long as we can through the summer. Just keep those other two items in mind.
