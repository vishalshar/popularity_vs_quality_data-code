Love these wetbags!  They are the perfect size for about 4-6 diapers (depending on the type of diaper).  Folds up nice and small too so it doesn't take up much space in our diaper bag.  They dry faster than any other wetbag we have as well.  We have the older version (with elastic) and the newer (with a non-elastic drawstring)-- I have found that the newer bags are easier to close.  Both though do a good job of keeping the smell and moisture contained.  Great bags!
