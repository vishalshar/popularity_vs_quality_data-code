This is the third one I have purchased. The first one died after a whole year of multiple uses per day EVERYDAY!!! The second one is still going strong and the third I got for a family memeber. I use this for formula,  metamucil fiber supplement ,and it's been used for other drinks as well. Metamucil is a lot thicker than formula and this mixer mixes my drinks perfectly, leaving no clumps behind. It's extremely powerful and the batteries last forever in it.  This mixer is perfect for mixing any drink. You won't regret purchasing this and for the price, it's a great deal!!
