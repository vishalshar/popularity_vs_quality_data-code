I tried several different brands before buying these from amazon.  Cloth breast pads are notorious for three problems: 1) they are lumpy and show under tight fitting clothes, 2) they don't wash well, and the edges roll up and do not keep their shape, and 3) they leak.  The fuzi bunz breast pads are clearly superior to others- they wash perfectly, and maintain their shape quite well, and don't leak at all (in fact, I could probably wear them two days in a row, they're that good).  I had been starting to think that I wouldn't find a nursing pad that would compare to a disposable one, but these proved me wrong.  I also love that I can wear a nursing cami with these pads, and they do not show through....clearly the best out there....don't waste your time trying others.
