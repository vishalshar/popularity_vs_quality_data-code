These are made to fit Enfamil bottles but I purchased them to use with the same  brand.no trouble changing from these little nipples, he really likes them alot, i dont even use them, he uses them, he sucks and sucks them all night long while biting them too, i highly recommend.My babies have always taken them well, with no gassy problem or latching problems-- and this was not the case with other brands! I liked the price and always love the amazon  customer service. However just be aware these nipples are for the standard flow .I used Enfamil slow rate nipple for my boys before, and now change to this one when he grown little older. he likes Enfamil nipples very much! Th most convenient part is they are compatible with some other bottles also.
