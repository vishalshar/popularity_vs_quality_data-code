I got this carseat before my LO born and now he is 4 months old. We've used it for 4 months and think I am ready to review it .The reason I bought it is becuase the great ranking on NHTSA, It's not really the safety ranking ( every carseat on market should pass the safety test), but I still think it's something help me to decide. Another reason is I really like JJ cole broadway stroller so this carseat go with the base without any adapter.The carseat is steady and comfortable. My son fall sleepy everytime we put him in. We went a 3 hours drive with him in and he sleep all the way without any problem.It goes perfect with JJ broadway stroller base, which works like a carseat frame, not a heavey travel system, stylish and easy/light to go.I also get it hoping it is big so our LO can use it as long as he can, like some other review say. Well, I didn't see it is that big becuase it's winter time and we put a toddler bundle me in it so it's kind of squeeze. But I hope when weather is warm and after we take off bundle me, there will be enough place for him to another several months.The only down side is it is heavy. I alway ask my husband or my Dad to carry the carseat with baby in, as it is tired for me to carry it.
