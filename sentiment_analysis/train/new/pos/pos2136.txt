My daughter started sucking her thumb at 2-3 months old. She is now 3 and developed a callous on her right thumb. We used Dr. Thumb for a total of 5 days. I told her that I ordered a "thumb thing" to help her stop sucking her thumb. We built up anticipation, so when it finally came in the mail she was excited to wear it. She wore it for 48hrs straight (removing only for bath time), then only at nights for 3 nights. The device seemed to be comfortable to wear because my daughter never complained when she had it on. She was able to play, and eat as usual without issue. During the first day of wearing it I saw her about to put her thumb in her mouth, then suddenly stop once she remembered she had the device on. After the first day, she didn't even try to suck her thumb during the day! Once she learned to cope during the day without sucking her thumb she didn't even try to suck her thumb before bed either. It has now been 3 weeks without the device and she has not reverted back. She is not a thumb sucker any more! The first week after she stopped wearing the device we would radomly ask her if the sucked her thumb and she would proudly say "nope!"  We gave her a high five each time. I think she was the right age to try this product. I'm not sure if this would have went so quickly if she were younger or older. Her thumb callous is almost gone too!
