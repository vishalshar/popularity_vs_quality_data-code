so so happy I got this set! They are the perfect size for both my 2 year old and my 6 month old. Super easy to hold that my infant can hold them no problem. The rounded, soft fork is wonderful and I dont worry about my toddler hurting himself while eating (he can get a little excited). The colors are fun and vibrant and they are easy to clean.
