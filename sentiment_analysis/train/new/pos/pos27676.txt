I look all over before buying this bedrail.  This is Wonderful.  I best is there is no area that a lille arm or leg could get caught in.  I use this to co-sleep with my baby.  (Not for all but works for us)  Because I am pulling it on a adult bed regular bed rail would only reach a inch or two over the mattress, safety first rail starts at the top not bottom of your mattress.  I can lay down with my infant nurse and not orry about him falling off.  This rail has been a life saver and I would highly recommend it.  It's only con is it can be a little frustrating to remove when changing sheets, but I will take that because it is so secure, way better that falling off of the bed :)  Happy Naps
