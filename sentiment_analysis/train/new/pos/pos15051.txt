We purchased these at the time when my baby had gotten too old for her activity mat but not coordinated enought to sit up and play.  Essentially she was always bored and fussy, and I was at my wits end.  We decided to purchase some new toys (e.g. Stacking rings and a music cube) and I threw these in the cart on a whim when I noticed the low price.  They have undoubtedly been her favorite toys since then.  She searches for them in the play basket and enjoys pulling the stack apart, knocking down a cups tower, spinning them on the floor, gumming on the edges.  Since they are light-weight, she has no problem grasping or moving them.  Plus they're easy to clean!  How can you not love such a versatile, economical, and simple toy?
