Very cute, decorative, fits easily in the cube particleboard systems, kids love it.  It is not "stiff" like many of the cube systems, though, and will sway or collapse if not in the cube furniture or filled up.  Only the insert for the bottom is stiff.  Colors are as pictured. I have never tried but suspect it is machine washable without insert.
