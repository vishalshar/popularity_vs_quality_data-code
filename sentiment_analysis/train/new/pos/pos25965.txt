My 5 month old grandson loves it! It's comfy,entertaining,multifunctional,and well made.The seat is a well padded sling type seating that provides support. The cover is easily removed for laundering if you can keep your baby out of it long enough. It also has a padded restraint that is keeps them from falling out when they starting sitting theirselves up in it.My grandson was 4 months old when I bought this. It didn't take him long at all to figure it out. He loves to kick, loves the lights/music, and has sit himself up on occasion to touch the lights. He doesn't complain when you put him in it and it's gives mom a break.It's light weight, so you can take it all over the house or to the park. My daughter uses it sit baby and locks the kicking out so she can feed him his cereal or do his nails. He sleeps in it for a nap.It's well made. It doesn't tump over, it's sturdy, and if you have a larger toddler...they can't destroy it.(I have a 1 year old and 3 year grandkids that have really tested it out!)Over all it's a great product. Grandson and his mom can't get by without it. I think the thing is pure genius! It's absolutely the best present I've ever bought a new mom.
