I should preface this by saying we have only used the bassinet part of this stroller.  We have the black stroller and it looks great and feels like quality.  We have never event taken it outside.  We use it inside so that when baby is sleeping during the day we can move him from room to room and this has made our lives much easier.  I don't think I would like this stroller as an everyday stroller because it is wide and takes up a lot of room in the car and doesn't fold up compactly.  It has no cup holders which I would like (but the handlebars do fold down which is nice when you are using it as a bassinet).  The basket underneath is pretty small and doesn't hold very much junk and that could be a problem since we all know how much stuff babies and toddlers require.  This stroller manuevers great and would probably be a great stroller for outdoor jogging and what not.  So depending on what your needs are this stroller is very good.  Overall, very satisfied.
