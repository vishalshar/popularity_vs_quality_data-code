Parents-to-be: the baby carrier is your ticket to freedom so buy wisely!The Boba 3G carrier has generally been great but I'm having issues with the straps. Over time they loosen and I have to tighten them back up again. This is a particular problem when, for example, I'm walking the dog and all of a sudden my baby's leg starts dangling out of the bottom of the carrier because it no longer fits snuggly. The shoulder straps seem to have this problem, too, but less so. I don't know if this is because I had to flip the straps when I had it in the newborn position to the infant position and everything loosened up or if this is a design flaw. Not sure.This also probably isn't the best carrier for newborns. My daughter was a wee little munchkin when she was born and we couldn't use this carrier until she was 7lbs. I had to use another carrier (Baby K'tan Baby Carrier, Black, Small) until then and I would have rather had just one. But, for parents of babies above 7lbs you should have no problem.Otherwise, this carrier has been wonderful. The other main contender for baby carriers is the ERGO brand products, which I have never used but also appear to be very good. I think you can't go wrong with either one.
