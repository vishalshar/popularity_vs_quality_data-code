Our four month old granddaughter cried every time she was in the car. I would too if all I ever saw was the back of a seat. Now she's happy and occupied with all the different things to see and do, including the foot/toe wheel. It makes enough noise for her but it's not distracting for the driver. I had looked at many car seat activity toys and this one is the best. I highly recommend it.
