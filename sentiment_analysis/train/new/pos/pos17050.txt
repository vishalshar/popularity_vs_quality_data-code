We have two of these, used in our kids' car seats (ages 6 months and 2 years).  Before the Baby Bee-Haven, my generally well-behaved children would complain or cry during car trips (we go on a 1-hour trip every few weeks to see family).  After the Baby Bee-Haven, my children either sleep soundly or stay awake happily playing with their mom.If you want your children to be comfortable in a car seat or in a stroller, buy this.Side note: as the children grew larger, we've modified these, cutting extra holes for straps.  We also sewed a lattice compressing the foam where the head is.  This solves the problem where the head is pushed uncomfortably too far forward.  I highly recommend making this modification if installing in a car seat.
