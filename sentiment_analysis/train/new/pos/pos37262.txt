I love the bedding set and the funky patterns but something about this bumper is overkill.  It could be the yellow (I love the rust color).  It's fine and i bought it along with the set - i like that it disconnects so I don't have to have it wrapped all the way around the crib.  Just pretty busy - maybe the babies will like that though :)
