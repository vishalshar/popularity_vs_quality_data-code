I bought these for use in conjunction with my cloth diapers.  I have gotten other baby wash cloths to use for wipes and they are usually just surged around the edges, which makes the edges roll up when you're trying to wipe (gross).  These have a small binding around the edge so they don't roll up like the others!  They are great.  The colors are cute (I got the blue, green, and yellow choices), the green and yellow are cuter than the picture.  I use these with the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer and they work great!  I fold the wipes once over, put them in dry, and pour water with a little baby bath mixed in over the top.  doesn't matter if I get too much water, I just squeeze the wipe out a little when I'm ready to use it till I have it the way I like it.  if there's extra water when I run out of wipes, I just throw some more dry wipes in.  simple!  These wipes are the perfect size, not too thick, not too thin, soft and smooth on one side, bumpy grabby terry cloth feel on the other side, but still soft enough for baby bum.  I have two kids in diapers, I try to use these for my infant, I use more of a terry adult wash cloth for my toddler, picks up more poop and bigger.a side note: these washcloths (as with any new fabric) are not too absorbant until they are washed a couple of times.  I send new washcloths through the wash with my diapers a few times before I expect them to work correctly.
