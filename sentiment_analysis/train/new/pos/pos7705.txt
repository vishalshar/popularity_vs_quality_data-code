Excellent product. Prevents my child from opening kitchen cupboards to drink chemicals, which I feel is a positive. My toddler wishes me to leave a negative review however, as it also prevents him from getting to the kitchen trash bag, and this angers him. Apparently playing with kitchen trash is his idea of a great time while mommy cooks dinner. Who knew? I'm still giving it 5 stars cause I feel a ten month old does not have reliable enough taste to be trusted. I mean, it was only last week he felt that toilet paper was gods gift to mankind. In fact, upon reflection, he may be a cat.
