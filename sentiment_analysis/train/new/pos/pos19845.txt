I try to review some of the bigger purchases because i know how hard it is to decide what is the best fit.....this is a lovely set up.....it has your traditional wind up mobile with an absolutely adorable froggy, fishy and turtle....this is our favorite musically aspect of this pack and play.....we wound it ALOT and i must say that it is not durable the velcrow that keeps the mobile in place, that is....and so i took a twist tie. You know the ones from bread ect and i used it to keep it in place and it works like a charm....been holding it on there for 4 months or so now. the changing table is pretty awesome. It is a little deep and then the sides come up in a way that seems to just hold baby quite sweetly and of course, has a seat belt for that added peace of mind. There is this plastic chunk that fits on one of the four corners, that vibrates and has three music selections and an adapter for an ipod....the music is labeled nature, sleep and play and i must say, me and my 7 year old are confused by this categorization as the songs for sleep do just the opposite.....but it is a nice mixture of classical and children's songs.....the nature songs button is my least favorite. The sounds, to me, just don't sound realistic in the slightest bit. They sound mechanical in a way and are not pleasing to my ears because i know what outside sounds like at night.....crickets chirping and the like....which is nothing like this....so we don't listen to it...haha.I love the little organizer and the big pocket to store things on the side.I would read the directions first before putting it together.....my husband didn't and had a time getting it to stay open but if you just  read the directions, you shouldn't have any problems.....I use this in the living room and never really go into baby girl's room all day...very convenient, one stop shop. i just use this for everything.Would i recommend this....yes. I know that all things are not going to be perfect. And when you let go of needing everything to be perfect, your expectations come back to a more realistic level and you see something for what it is.....so even with some of the minor issues with it.....i am glad my husband found this one......hope this helps.....have a great day (^.^)
