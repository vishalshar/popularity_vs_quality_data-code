Every time I wear this someone thinks the beads are ceramic or wood. No one ever guesses it's a teething necklace - even the pediatrician was worried the baby would break my "lovely necklace" until I explained. Our daughter is 5 months and likes to pull on it more than chew it at this stage, though she does that too. It saves my hair from her pulling fingers. :) The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is that the string holding the beads isn't individually knotted after each bead, so if it broke you'd have to clean up fast because the beads would be a choking hazard. Wouldn't let babe play with this unattended (duh, I guess, but still true).
