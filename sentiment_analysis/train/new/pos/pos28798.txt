I absolutely love this bouncer!! I was worried because I baught the matching swing, which I am not impressed with and almost cancelled this order because of it. The bouncer sinks in more then the average bouncer making it extra snuggly for a newborn. In fact my son will no longet sleep in his bassinet because he loves napping in the bouncer. It bounces very easliy too not to mention it's super adorable!!
