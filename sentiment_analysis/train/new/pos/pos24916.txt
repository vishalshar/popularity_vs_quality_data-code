I was t-boned at 35mph by some woman driving her minivan while texting.  Our mazda is totaled, my wife and I are bruised up, but my son is safe and sound.  He actually laughed after the crash and I promptly ordered the same seat to replace the old one.it's BIG, but it does its job.  Very easy to install and adjust, I love how you don't have to re-rout the straps to grow with your little one.
