This set is BEYOND beautiful! I read a few reviews where people stated it seemed cheaply made...REALLY?!?! I think the entire set is of the best quality, the quilt is gorgeous with the embroidery detail and the different textures of the animals, I especially love the corduroy. The picture doesn't do it justice! Overall it is incredibly well made, colorful and durable. The picture online is against a white background so it's hard to really get a feel for the colors and how intense they will be. Another reviewer stated that the green is actually a mustard yellow, Um...NO, it's not, not even close. It's a lime green. The blue of the sheet and trim on the skirt is more of an ocean water blue, what you also cannot see in the image is a beautiful navy blue elephant that really brings more masculinity to the set, and a zebra with red hair. I couldn't be MORE in love with this set!
