My husband and I bought the Eddie Bauer swing after wanting to exchange a Graco 6 speed Swingomatic  that we bought for another color. Although the the Graco works great and has great features, this swing is simply beautiful.Pros: Real wood construction, pleasing tan fabric. Nicely padded. Nice Design. Quiet motor. Smooth operation. 3-recline settings are perfect. It collapses like a ladder and so is convenient to move to another room. However, this swing is heavier than most.Cons: Tray is a bit difficult to deal with, but I found it better just to leave it shut. The music is not at all soothing, but the nature sounds option is nice. The slowest speed is just a hair faster than I would have liked, but my 10 lb. infant does not have a problem with it.The mobile has cute toys and the mirror is great for babies. My infant has not quite noticed it yet, so the jury is out on that part of the swing.I would go with the Graco Swingomatic for ease of use and features. Their slowest speed was perfect. But if you want  a really good looking swing that works reasonably well, then go with the Eddie Bauer.
