We are so happy that there is a healthy choice when needing a 'NON' powder.  Our child has Down syndrome and wears a pull-up to sleep at night.  Ever since we started to place a little 'NON' powder on the inside of the pull-up.... no more rashes or chapped skin.  Thank you for making such a wonderful product with no airborne dust!
