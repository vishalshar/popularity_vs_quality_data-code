This contraption does its job adequately; Baby can only pick off small shreds of toilet paper, so no more unraveling!  Yes, I still find bits of TP around from Baby pick-pick-picking at the roll, but the guard doesn't promise total TP defense, only an end to unraveling, which it has achieved.The household's adult users have had to adjust and get used to two-handing the TP, but it's fairly second-nature at this point.Construction has held up thus far (about a month) but does feel a bit cheap -- hope the thing stays together!  If it doesn't, I'll be back to update this review.EDIT Sept 18, 2013:  Indeed, this contraption has held up for just over a year; my concerns about flimsy-ness did not foretell its destruction.  However, the Child did eventually work out its defeat a few months ago, but I left it on because it at least reduces the quantity he can easily unravel.  Imagine NO PROTECTION -- he would yank once, watch a stream of TP come forth, and that would be so gratifying he would yank and yank until it was all unraveled.  Yes, he can now hold the guard down with one hand and pull with the other, but it's not quite as simple as yank, yank, yank, and I can live with that.
