We just got this delivered last night, just in time for our Thanksgiving travels.  This stroller wheel board WAS A GAMECHANGER at the airport with my 2 1/2 year-old and 2 month-old daughters.  It was so convenient to be able to quickly and efficiently move my 2 girls through the airport--my toddler loved it and the fact that she could see her baby sister and give her kisses was an extra plus.  I do agree with the other reviews that you can't walk directly behind it because you'll bump into the wheel, but it wasn't a big deal to walk slightly to one side.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a toddler + baby.
