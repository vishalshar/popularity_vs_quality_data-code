I love this booster. My daughter managed to get out of using her booster before she should have because it was too "babyish". She needed something like this, but the restaurant-style boosters were too awkward. I wish we had found this then. My son REALLY needed something. He just needed a boost, and something comfortable to sit on that was not too obvious. This really fit the bill.This seat is a super-comfortable foam-injected seat. It seems to stick to the chair well (once weight is on it) and not slide around on him. The colors are attractive and stylish, with the blue having a nice "pearlized" finish. It is very easy to wipe down, and is very light to carry.Here's the only problem... we've had it not quite a year now, and we have a wiggly kid. Because the edges stick up (which is good, because it helps keep him from sliding off), and he likes to get up and down from his chair on his own, the edge has cracked. It's really a clean "split" that is unfortunately getting a little bigger. I don't know if it was a weakness in the foam or what, but it's disappointing, given the price. If you read through the other reviews, you will see that others have experienced this same issue. I don't know how long it will hold up now, but I'm hopeful it will be for at least as long as we need it.Overall, I recommend this seat, with the only caveat being to note that it probably will hold up longer if you get your child up and down from it verses letting them climb up into it on their own.
