I'm glad that I found this ornament, as I wasn't able to get one in stores with the 2012 date for our "baby". We had bear themed ornaments for our first two children, so this matches nicely. I didn't expect it to be made of cloth, (I think I was expecting plastic or ceramic for some reason). It is very lightweight. I guess we will get the full effect at Christmastime when we hang it on the tree! :-)Very fast shipping from the seller. That was impressive! (Maybe two days).
