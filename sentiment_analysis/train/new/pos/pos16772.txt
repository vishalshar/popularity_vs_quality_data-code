I was hesitant to buy these because of some of the reviews but, I'm glad I did it. I have a 9.5 month old baby and she is doing great with the y-cut even without cereal. Size 3 was too slow and she was getting bored sucking on the nipple and she wouldn't finish her bottle. Y-cut is pretty fast flow. She finishes her bottle in a matter of couple of minutes. She doesn't choke or gag at all. I think if people wait for the right time to use these there won't be a choking problem. I highly recommend this product and all the BornFree products.
