I should preface this review by saying that my daughter is very particular about what she will drink from.  She is 10 months now, but has been drinking from this sippy cup and its predecessor for the past 4 months.  She refused to take a bottle, so when my wife was at work, I had to feed her with a syringe... which you can imagine was a slow, tedious process.When she turned 6 months, I began to look for sippy cups in hopes that she would take one more readily than a bottle.  Fortunately, she did... whereas with bottles, we bought 8-10 different types; with sippy cups, I only had to try two.  The first were actually gifted to us at a shower... she seemed overwhelmed by the fast flow, and we didn't like that they spilled milk everywhere when tipped.Enter the Dr. Brown's... I picked the original (older model) up at a local store... we liked it, but wished it had marks for the numbers of ounces inside.  When we went back a week or two later, the store no longer had the older style, so we decided to try this new style.  It was a hit!  Our daughter seemed to like it better, the milk didn't come out when it was tipped over (or even much when it is shaken), and our daughter can drink the whole bottle in about 3-5 minutes of motivated drinking.The only little quibble I have is that there are a fair number of parts to wash... if you plan to wash by hand, this may not be the cup for you.  Inside, there are two piece, plus the lid, handle, and bottle... totaling 5 pieces to wash.  It is totally worth it to me, but I could see that being a deal breaker for someone that was going to use this daily without access to a dishwasher.This bottle is a revelation for us... I can't say enough good stuff about it... no drips, easy to drink, the handles are the right shape for my daughter to hold on to, and it has clear markers for the volume of the contents.  Add in the fact that I trust this company to deliver toxin-free products, and I am a happy camper.
