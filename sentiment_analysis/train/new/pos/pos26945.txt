I just wanted to pipe in- these bubbles are tons of fun! Sadly, I have not seen them in dollar stores in my area, but I did just buy another "vial" of them this past Dec. 2013 at "Michaels" (craft store). It seemed to me that "Michaels" will pull them, as there were only two of these bubbles left, so keep that in mind if you fall in love with them. I, too, was concerned at first about the damage. Unlike the previous reviewer from Texas, I did not have any residue on my furniture. Follow the directions, and you will have bubbles in the palm of your hand in no time!
