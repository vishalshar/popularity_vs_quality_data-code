This cover is great. I purchased the black and sand was worried about two things when I purchased.1) Length2) Not having a large enough neck hole to see babyBoth are not an issue. The longer length is actually great so that you can use some of the fabric to strategically cover up baby from sun or for warmth. The neck hole is plenty big enough for me to see baby very easily. I wear a women's size 8 /10 at the moment and the fit for this is great.Fabric is incredibly soft. At times (80-90 degree summer days) It has gotten a little hot underneath the poncho for baby, but I'm not sure that can be avoided with this full coverage style. I don't think a different fabric would make too much difference.I ended up keeping only the black, not sand color, because the sand would show liquid marks on it quite easily.
