I was hesitant to purchase due to the mixed reviews and many complaints of leaking.  However, from my experience, the leaking is strictly based on the time put into the installation and maintenance.  I installed the sprayer, using Teflon plumbers tape on the connections.  Not a single leak.  I gave my wife strict instructions to make sure she turns it off and clears the line of water before hanging it back up.  Not a single leak.  The pressure of the water when the valve is completely open is ridiculous.  However, it is easy to turn on and off, which is also how the pressure is adjusted.  There is some spray-back from cleaning the diapers, but that is just the nature of the business.  The sprayer comes with a handy toilet tank clip that securely holds the sprayer without requiring drilling into the wall.  All in all it is a very handy product for cloth diapering, my wife and I are both very pleased (so far....).
