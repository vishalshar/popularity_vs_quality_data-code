I did not want a potty with electric pieces so I bought this and love it! I like that it has a space for flushable wipes and a pullout holder for toilet paper! The potty is easy to clean, cute, and good for small spaces. :) The peeguard is easy to put in and to take out, and the seat is nice and cushioned for little bottoms. :) My son is still so small that it is not like I need a step stool at this point in time, so it does not matter that the step stool cannot be used until he is converted to the big boy potty with the child potty attached. One thing that I do wish that this had was cleaning instructions. I mean, it is sort of common sense and your own personal cleaning methods... But it would have been nice to know how to clean the seat properly and stuff, I think. My son got poop on it once and I was like, well, I hope you like bleach seat. But anyways, I love the potty and it has features that will actually come in handy throughout its use!!! :)
