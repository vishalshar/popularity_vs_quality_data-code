I bought these everyday bags to organize my diaper backpack. I like the variety of sizes and cute designs. These feel very thin so they aren't bulky and I hope they are durable. Something to be aware of - these are NOT CERTIFIED food safe (lead, pvc, phthalates free) for those who are interested in this aspect. You need one of the food storage bags for these features. I would like one more of the larger bags from this set but don't think it can be purchased separately so that's unfortunate.
