I love these cord shorteners. I have 11 month old twins and have bought several of these to put in the areas they play in. I have also used them in my own bedroom, even though the twins are never in there. One of these wraps my electric toothbrush cord up nice and neat so it isn't taking up all of the sink. It wraps up two thin cords together or 1 thick cord by itself.This product has made having twins a lot easier. It is durable and comes with sticky stuff to adhere it to the wall, although removal of it will mean patching up and repainting. I never stick it to the wall, but it does a great job and hiding all the cords we have around the house. The kids are no longer interested in the plugs when these things are in place. And if I decide I need to move and item, it easily comes apart with a push of the center.
