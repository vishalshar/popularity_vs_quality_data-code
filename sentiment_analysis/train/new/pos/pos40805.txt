These are the perfect disposable bibs for my 13 month old when we are out and about. They do not soak up any moisture that could get through to the clothes. They are large enough to fully protect the front of my daughter while eating. The fold-out trough is so convenient and actually catches the food that is dropped. It is also a great way to hold extra puffs/snacks as my daughter is eating. The design is actually cute with mild colors - not cheesy at all. The bib has a little sticky tab at the top that holds it around the child's neck very securely. These really have all the features of a regular bib with the added bonus of being disposable.
