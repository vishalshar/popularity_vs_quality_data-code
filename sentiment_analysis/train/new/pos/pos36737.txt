I got these for our 18 month old as well as the letters by Vilac. They are a great size, fun and colorful. The decorative top seems to be some kind of compressed laminated paper adhered to wood adhered to the magnet. The magnet is the same size as each number. It contains all numbers, plus/times signs, minus/equals signs, and rather large dots that I suppose can be used for decimals or the dots on a division sign. They are really sturdy, as our dog took a fancy to them and it took him a while to destroy one--and we rescued two other numbers fairly quickly and they didn't have much damage to them at all. Our dog is a bullmastiff, so he typically shreds dog toys--so I'm giving high marks for construction.
