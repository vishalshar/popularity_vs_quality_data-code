This is my 3rd stroller and I finally got it right! Rides like a dream and is super roomy which is great for larger babies. The canopy is HUGE and fully shields my 8 month old. The 5 point harness is weird at first but once you get the hang of it you'll wonder why it seemed so tricky initially. It doesn't fold completely flat but its easy to maneuver or store when folded and collapses in a flash. Very pleased that a rain cover was included. Only complaint is that there is no parent cup holder.
