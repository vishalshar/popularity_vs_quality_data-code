These are great towels. My kids have been using theirs almost daily for 9 months. They are thick, soft, absorbent and have held up perfectly. We own the lion and the poodle. She still has all her eyelashes!  I was concerned when I first got them, but they still look perfect.  And my kids still love them as much as when we got them. I plan to get another set again for the holidays this year.
