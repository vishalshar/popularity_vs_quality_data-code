I needed plates and bowls for my toddler and wanted something colorful, but without designs. The plates he has now with designs/pictures on them actually distract him from eating... he would rather push his food aside to look at the pictures and discuss them with me. It was making mealtime quite a challenge. But I still wanted something colorful and fun that he could identify as his own. These bowls serve that purpose well. They are BPA free which is important to me, but also made of recycled products, which made me feel good about buying them. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the texture is a little unusual and leaves me feeling like I need to scrub them a little more to make them "feel clean".... they are dishwasher safe as well though. I haven't tried, but I also think cutting on/in them with a knife would leave slices in the plastic where food and bacteria would become more difficult to remove.
