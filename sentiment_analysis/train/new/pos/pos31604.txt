I love the design of this water bottle. My toddler is easily able to hold on to it, and I like that it keeps the straw clean when the lid is on.When I first got the bottle, I immediately washed it and then filled it with water to try it out. However, I noticed right away that the bottle leaked. I couldn't believe that it leaked with the first use so I scoured the comments on Amazon for any tips and found a solution!!!!!First off, the straw silicon piece is detachable so that you can wash it thoroughly. If the straw silicon unit it wet when you  screw the lid on, the suction piece moves out of place when you tighten the top. You will see a small gap between the silicon "bump" and the lid which is why the bottle ends up leaking.  To prevent this from happening, you must make sure your straw silicon unit and lid are DRY before you screw them onto the bottle.  As long as both pieces are dry, they will screw on tight and the silicon suction piece shouldn't move out of place.Hope this works for you!
