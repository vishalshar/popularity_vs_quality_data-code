I Love this paci pod! I am glad you can clip it on the outside because it is quite bulky to put inside the diaper bag. The Ju Ju Be Berry is very nice.Positives:Wristlet type of zipper metal hardware clip onRound shape for easy insert of 2 pacifiers and 1 clip...you can fit a 3rd paci if you need to OR WHATEVER YOU WANT IN THERE!!!! (Charger, change, lipbalm, mini lotion, headphone, ipod, first aid stuff etc.Mini elastic double strap on both sides of the interior of paci pod (its purple)Interior is satin antibacterial lining and Teflon coated exterior that is durable, water & stain resistantVariety of printsGreat selling value afterwards on ebay......Negative:Bulky but not deal breakerZippered, maybe annoying trying to get paci with a crying baby oppose velcro*Overall, great product! I have two.~Mimi
