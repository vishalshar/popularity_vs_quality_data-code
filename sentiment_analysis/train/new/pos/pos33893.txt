Love these bottles. I bought them with the formula dispensers Tommee Tippee Formula Dispensers, 6-Count, and the two work together so well.I needed bigger bottles for my son (we'd had 4oz). He mostly uses bottles, but breastfeeds during the night. He won't take the thin nipples, and prefers wider and flatter as much as possible. These work very well and he always accepts them. I'd used the playtex drop-ins before, and like these a lot better. These Tommee Tippee's bottles are much more compact and they're very easy to hold; they also don't have any extra parts and are very easy to clean. I also really like that there's enough room in the bottles to fill with the proper amount of formula and water without having to worry about making a mess. I stick to making 8oz, but the bottles can hold 9oz. The lids are also easy to remove one-handed, which is a big advantage over the Playtex bottles.Something I discovered today that tickled me is, you can fill the bottles to the 8oz line with water (no more, not even a hairline though) and then put in the formula dispenser and it won't overflow. Bottles are practically ready-made, but you don't have to worry about the bottle spoiling because it was made ahead. The formula stayed dry while I had it in there.I will be buying more of these here shortly.
