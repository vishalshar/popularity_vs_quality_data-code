I've used this in my son's diaper bag since he was born and he's now 13 months.  It is still plenty big and is easy to wash off.  I use it on the car seats, over public changing tables, on benches, etc.  It has held up nicely.  Not much padding, but I didn't buy it for that, only to keep baby off of dirty surfaces and keep diaper mess from getting on clean surfaces.
