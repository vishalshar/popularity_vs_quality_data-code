One of my new pet peeves is when the diaper dekor plus refill bag unexpectedly runs out. And it is ALWAYS a surprise because there's no indicator that it is about to run out.  It's rather involved to replace and I can't easily do it if my child is with me. There should be a change in the color of the refill bag as you get close to the end so that you know to plan ahead.
