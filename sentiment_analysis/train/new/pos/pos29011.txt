This is a perfect stroller accessory if you don't have a tray on your stoller - I highly recommend!It is black, fits both our stollers (Maclaren and Graco), and it seems like it should fit just about any stoller (except double-wide) with its adjustable buckle straps. (It might even fit on a smaller shopping cart - haven't tried it yet though)  It is also very easy to adjust, attach and remove from the stroller.I bought this one after lots of searching and 2 failed/disapointing similar products.The compartments are just right - the cup holders fit my son's sippy cups and my water bottle/soda bottle/take-out cup (a 32oz+ fountain drink cup did tilt the holder a bit and it leaked until I drank about 1/3 of it, but this was not a real problem at all - cup was just way too big).The center compartment & pocket are perfect for holding a wallet, cell phone, keys, etc.The longer zipper pocket in the back is perfect for travel wipes and a diaper or 2 and some coupons.  It is a bit difficult to rummage around in this pocket with larger cups in the holders, so remove a cup if you need to search or dig through this pocket.I love that it does NOT have a deep pouch, which tended to encourage putting too much in it and tipping the stoller when my son got out.  It holds just the essentials and does not cause the Maclaren stroller to tip back without a passenger (which is AWESOME).The clips are great for holding a bag, or the JJ Cole changing pad, or a sippy cup leash. I wouldn't count on the clips holding too much weight for safety (tipping) reasons, but they could likely hold a couple shopping bags if your child is riding, just watch the weight.I received it in black and was not aware of any other colors offered...?Customer service from JL Childress was great!  On 2nd use, one of the plastic buckles broke off when trying to open the stroller.  I emailed customer service, and they quickly mailed me a replacement buckle for free!I've used mine for about 2 months now and I LOVE IT!
