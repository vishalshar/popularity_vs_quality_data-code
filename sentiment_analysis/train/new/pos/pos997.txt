My wife and I were accidentally introduced to the Kolcraft when we stopped by a friend's house with our (then) 3.5 month old son. They had one, and when we put our son into it he literally squealed with delight and giggled like we had never previously heard him. I shopped the 'net and decided, as is almost always the case, to buy from Amazon. No regrets at all with the purchase. Our son is now 5.5 months old and spends lots of very happy playtime in the Kolcraft. It is well constructed and lots of fun for him. I ENTHUSIASTICALLY recommend this product and Amazon to all parents in the market.
