I purchased these to try something a little cheaper then the Medela bags I use to sterilize my breastpump parts each day and they are excellent!  I can put 2 shields, 2 connectors, and 3 or so valves and membranes in there with no problems on space or anything!  The green corner on the top of the bag is a cool-touch spot so you have a place to grab the bag that isn't hot, which is really a great perk!  They seem to be a little spacier then the Medela, but are cheaper overall and give you 6 in a box, instead of 5.  I love them and have purchased them again already!
