Very REASONABLE price. The 12 individual clear soft vinyl corner protectors are packaged in a resealable clear pouch. There is one 3M adhesive pad for each protector. The major warehouse stores no longer carry these soft vinyl corner protectors.NOTE: Purchase 3M, outdoor, double sided adhesive foam - it is packaged just like the regular 3M double sided foam except the protective strip on the foam is RED - RED color is high adhesion strength, WHITE color is not as strong as the RED strip foam. CLEAN both surfaces (that will  receive the adhesive foam) with 70% (or higher) isopropyl alcohol - do not use 50% alcohol or any alcohol identified as rubbing alcohol.We have used these soft vinyl protectors in our salons for years now - they are durable, they clean easy and do not be surprised if you have to replace the adhesive foam every now and then. NOTE: These protectors will slowly discolor after a few years. No big deal.I do not think these clear soft vinyl corner protectors are safe for use around small children, especially ones who might try and place such protectors into their mouths - this is a PVC chlorine issue.
