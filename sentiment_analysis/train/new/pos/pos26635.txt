I would say it's not bad todler bed. The reason why I bought this bed over walmart cheap one maden from pine($50), because it's mostly made from birch tree! So it means the birch is much solid then pine tree.This bad is not tall ,so it's a safety future. It's made for regular todler mattress. It's very stable and solid. It was  easy to assemble it. Overally, I'm satisfied,there are only two things that I don't like: 1- It has very low side safety rails, so if you gonna put a pillow- they are about at a same level(I would wish the rails could be a little bit higher and longer about a half of a bed) 2- At the bottom it has a drawer- nice future  but it's so week so if you gonna put some stuff in there it stucksGeneraly it is abgood bed. little bit overpricy but I would reccomend it to my friends. My son like it.
