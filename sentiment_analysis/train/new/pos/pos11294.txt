It is not easy finding certain items for an infant or toddler boy. Was so happy when I saw these camo leggings. I had to get them!We live in Hawaii, so it's warm most of the time but during the winter season it sometimes gets chilly (anything below 70 is chilly for us, lol). So this went perfect when my son wore a onesie and I slipped these on his chubby legs.So far they haven't stretched out or anything. They are sturdy and are snug on his legs. My son is a year old and weighs about 25 lbs with thick Michelin man legs.
