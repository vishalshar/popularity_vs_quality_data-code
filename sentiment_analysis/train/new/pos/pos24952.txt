This was recommended by a cousin as something that could get olive oil out of clothing.  It does that and more!  I spilled a bottle of liquid foundation (long-wearing) on carpet about 5 years ago.  I initially tried to get it up but it set in really fast.  I covered it and assumed it would have to be torn out.  After just one application of Totally Toddler, it all came up and the carpet looks perfect.  So good, in fact, that I had to clean around it some just so the clean spot wouldn't stand out so much.So far, TT has gotten out: mineral sunscreen, olive oil, melted butter, fruit punch, blood, tomato sauce and various other foods, and even migrated dye in the washer.  It also took the smell out of fabrics that had been exposed to smoke.  Those smelled even after 2 rounds in the wash and a spritz with febreeze.  I absolutely LOVE this product!
