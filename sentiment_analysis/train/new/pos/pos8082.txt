My boys are 2 and 3 1/2 and share a room. I searched forever to find them bedding without licensed characters, for under $80 a 4 piece set. These were affordable and have held up without complaint for 6 months now. Super soft, great colors, and the boys love the dinos. Its easy to match with other store's dino stuff. They love their room, the dinosaurs are not too baby, and not too big kid looking to cause nightmares lol. I used each of the flat sheets to make their curtains, and their room looks great!
