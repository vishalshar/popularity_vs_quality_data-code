I use this carrier for all of my errands with my daughter (1 year old). You do need to wait until they have head control, because this is a very basic carrier that does not support the baby's head.  If they fall asleep in the carrier it can also be a little bit of a pain because you have to help support their head if they are flopping it out.  But I still give it 5 stars because it is so light, compact, easy, quick to put on, cool (in the summer) that I use it all the time.  It is not going to be your carrier for every single situation... but it is great for trips to the store or the odd situation where you need to leave your stroller behind (like tours...the tunnels in Niagara Falls... it was nice to have her strapped on me, and the carrier was easy to bring along because it's so small).I am probably a size 12 and my daughter is almost 20 lbs and she fits fine.I don't believe it is possible to do a back carry with this though.  I tried, but it was really not possible for me to get my daughter in the back on my own, and when I turned the carrier around it rode too close to my neck.  But still 5 stars!
