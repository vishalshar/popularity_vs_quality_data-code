My 2 month old baby girl adores her Wubbanubs. They are literally the perfect pacifier and pet!! They easily lay on her chest since they are heavier than a regular pacifier. The best part is that she can hold the Wubbanub herself so much easier than a regular pacifier. The different selections of animals are just adorable. They offer your baby something to look at while they are fading off into la la land. I find these much easier for my baby to use as opposed to the tradition pacifier, as the Wubbanub has several arms and legs your child can hold on to and grab to pick the pacifier up. You cannot go wrong with these!
