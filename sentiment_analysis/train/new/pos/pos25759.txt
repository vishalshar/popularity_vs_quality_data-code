I expected this to be made cheaply for some reason. Maybe because I was unfamiliar with this. To my surprise, this panel is actually pretty well made. Although to some this may seem pricy and there are cheaper ones out there, this is the best for the money. Here's why-- The LED's are larger than the typical size LED's.- The LED's are set well so they will not bend and everything feels very sturdy.- Standard plug, no wiring hassles- The light which this puts off will impress you for sure (it really does rival a 60w HPS)- The full spectrum gives off blue and red light for optimal growth stages and flowering stages- No heat output- 14w! Less power= less $11/15/10 - Still going strong for 12 hrs. a day. That's almost 7300 hours of operation so far since I purchased it.
