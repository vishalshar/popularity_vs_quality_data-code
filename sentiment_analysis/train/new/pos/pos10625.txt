I have twin boys, one who likes to be swaddled tight and one who wants his arms free. We started them in Halos when we brought them home from the hospital after neither my husband nor I could pripey figure out how to swaddle with just a blanket and what a God send they have become! My only complaint is that the Velcro will mess up other items if it becomes stuck to them in the wash, especially things like Aden and Anais changing table covers. It is just so strong it snags them but if you secure it to itself beforehand that ceases to be a problem.The joke in our house is that we need these in Adult sizes! Definitely worth the splurge over other swaddle blankets
