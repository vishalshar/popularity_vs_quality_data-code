These are not made of the common TPU or PUL cotton or polyester popular in the cloth diaper industry. The material is a laminated nylon, think kid's kite material, but smoother. More like a shoe storage bag than a diaper pail liner.That said, the material has a good hand, folds up super tiny for travel/storage, and WORKS. Holds 3-4 toddler size dirty cloth diapers.The plastic drawstring closure comes off over the knot at the end of the drawstring too easily, hence the -1 star. Once it's off it's a bit annoying to fix, but the issue could be completely prevented with slightly better design.I like these, and would recommend them.
