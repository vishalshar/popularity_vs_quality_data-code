I ablosutely love this little hat and can't wait for the fall so my baby can wear it. It is very well finished and fit my 7 months old perfectly (her head is average or a little smaller than the kids in her class). The fabric is nice and the product looks exactely like the picture. The little pins are useless for a baby, but might be fun for a young teen.
