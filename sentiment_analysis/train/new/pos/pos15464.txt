This is a wonderful toy for nighttime!  My son can turn it on himself, but the part I love is that I can turn it on without going into his room by using the remote control.  There are 3 different settings--short play (plays just one lullaby at a time), long play (cycles through the lullabys), and nature sounds which I haven't timed, but plays for about 10-15 minutes I would say.  The flashing lights dance with the music offering a great opportunity for kids to learn as they try and anticipate which shape will light up next.
