I love that you can take pages out or put more in. The only criticism I have is the page that talks about the grandparents is the same page that on the back side has when my mom and dad got married. In this day and age there are alot of couples who have children and are not married, and even more single parents than ever. I just taped an empty page to the side with the parents marriage on it. So it's a quick fix.
