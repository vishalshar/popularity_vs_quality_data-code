In my experience, these are truly the ONLY nipples with an active latch system.  When my 1 week old daughter was choking on each bottle nipple I tried, I conducted a little experiment.  I went to the baby store and bought one of every newborn bottle system they carried and took them home.  Then I put water in each bottle, turned it upside down, and guess what?  Every single one dripped, except for the Kiinde nipple.  My daughter had no trouble switching between breast and bottle with the Kiinde system.  The first generation nipples came without the rubber 'nubs', and the holes broke down very quickly.  Kiinde soon added the nubs to help reinforce the holes and now they last a reasonable couple of months before requiring replacement.
