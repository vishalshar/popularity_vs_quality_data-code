We love this bib!! We now have three of them, and I plan to give one to my parents to have at their place for when we come.It's easy to take on and off (for the parent, not for the child :) - though it would not be too difficult for a toddler to remove if he/she wanted to). It is the best because you can just wipe off spills or wash it right in your sink (or I'd imagine top rack of dish washer as well, though we've never tried or verified this). The pocket at the bottom has saved us from so many messes-- including, unfortunately, the rare time our child threw up and it caught the bulk of it so it didn't end up all over his lap :-S...Would highly recommend this bib. After using this, I don't know why anyone would use bibs with no pocket to catch the food that falls or fabric bibs that need to be thrown in the wash to be cleaned!!
