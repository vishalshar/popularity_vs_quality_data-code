After having this product for 8 months of my daughter's life I'd say I have used and still use every product except the medicine syringe, as it didn't contain enough suction to hold any medicine. The case is too bulky really for a diaper bag, I have never needed all these products on the go, but it does get a lot of use by the changing station. I'm pleased with the kit overall and would say 11 out of the 12 products being of use I'd rate it 5 stars nevertheless.
