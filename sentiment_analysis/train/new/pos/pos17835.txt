This was purchased to take with my son (4 years old) on a trip to visit my sister out of state.  This didn't work on the airplane but was easy to carry along and was great for the cab ride and in my sister's car once we got to our destination.  Very easy to use in any car and the 2 cup holders were GREAT!  Most of these boosters that I've looked at didn't have any cup holders and it seems that my son always has a juice box or snack box when he's riding in the car.  The cool orange color is fun too!
