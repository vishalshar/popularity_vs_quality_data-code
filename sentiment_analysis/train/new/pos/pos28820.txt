I did a ton of research into teethers for our baby, mainly because I was concerned with BPA, phthalates, nitrosamines, latex, metals and everything else that appeared in teethers when we were younger.  I decided to rule out plastic entirely.  Most are BPA-free and some also claim to be phthalate-free, but usually it stops there.  Additionally, most plastic options are made in China, and although I'm willing to buy many things from China, something that our baby will be putting in her mouth is not an option for me.  I'd prefer to go with something US-made or even better, European-made since standards are usually a bit higher than the U.S.I decided to go with the safest option I could find, which was Medical-Grade or Food-Grade Silicone (as a fall-back option).This teether is German-made so I know the manufacturing process is safe, this item is medical-grade silicone, it doesn't have any weird silicone smells to it, and the design is great.  It has plenty of different textures for your baby to choose and (5) different ends that easily fit into your baby's mouth without being so long that they gag or choke, or so wide that your baby can't get it in their mouth far enough to actually chew on it.I bought this and (2) other silicone teethers, so our baby fluctuated b/w the (3) teethers, but usually ended up preferring a piece of cloth or blanket to bite down on.We also froze this teether and the other (2), but it only remained cold for a few minutes before reaching back to room temp.The other (2) teethers we bought were:Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether&Comotomo Silicone Baby TeetherIf I had to rank the (3) on baby's preference, I would as follows:Comotomo Silicone Baby TeetherMayapple Baby - AnchorLifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone TeetherAlso, our baby started using these just under 5 months and now at 6 1/2 months doesn't chew on them as often since her bottom (2) teeth came in and the other teeth haven't began forming yet.  Based on your child's age, especially if older than 6 months, your child may prefer the Lifefactory Teethers since the ring diameter is larger.  Is was a bit wide for our baby, so she ended up flexing it make it fit into her mouth which help develop her arm muscles but made her give up on that and go for the Comotomo teether.Hope this helps you all, good luck in your selection.
