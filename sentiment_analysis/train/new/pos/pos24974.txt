So its the middle of flu & cold season as well as RSV season and you want to take your baby anywhere outside. How do you keep those people with no common sense or concept of personal space from putting their sneeze maker 2 inches from your immunity-free baby? In steps the JJ Cole Car Seat Canopy to work as a sneeze shield and prove the concept of "out of sight out of mind." Since putting this on our Graco car seat we are 14 days in a row wierd-stranger free. If only they would make a similar product for the pregnant belly that would keep these same people from akwardly petting you in the grocery store.The cover fits great on our car seat and the canopy works to keep it off the baby when the handle is down and the ties cannot be used (according to our car seat safety expert the handle should be down while driving). It's also easy to unattach the elastic held bottom and flip it over the top of the seat to put the baby in/out of the seat and then pull it back down to cover the baby.The material is light weight, which is great in Phoenix, but is probably to thin by itself for winters anywhere where it gets cold enough to snow.
