We love the Ocean Wonders Jumperoo. We had to put a hard pillow underneath him so that our baby could enjoy it since he isn't quite tall enough to use it properly. He is 4 months old and approximately 17 lbs and 26 inches.  He already figured out how to turn himself around in the 360* chair, although not perfectly.  He loves the mirror on it and loves that he can bounce a little. There is a nice tray for holding a small favorite toy or a pacifier (or food, perhaps?). The chair also has a nice little shelf on it which helps to stabilize little babies in the upright position. It was easy to put together and only required a screwdriver when opening the battery compartment. It plays sound and music when it bounces. Was very well packaged. Above all else, our baby really enjoys his new Jumperoo. Side note: we try to mostly avoid batteries with our son, for various reasons--mostly due to annoyance of repetitive songs--but this is one of those toys that you don't actually need to have the batteries if you don't want them.
