Happy with the mattress, but it was tough to find the waterproof cover and sheets to fit. I thought I'd make things easier for anyone else searching.Sheets: Sheetworld.com has sheets in two thicknesses, one of which is 3"! Just select the size you want when ordering.Overstock.com has the LA Baby Waterproof Compact Crib Mattress Cover. (Had to call the manufacturer of the mattress to find this. Sheesh)
