I am shocked reading the other negative reviews.  We have a two year old and have used this monitor since she was born.  I received three other monitors as gifts and kept them for some reason.  We consistenly went back to this monitor while experimenting with our different options.  This sytem has been to the beach with me, to my parents, on other various trips, and still is clear as a bell everywhere I use it.  We have a wireless internet connection and two cordless phones set up very near the receiver and I have never had an issue with static.We do run into picking up neighborhood monitors and cordless phone calls on occasion but we just switch the channel.  I have recently noticed some clicking and just readjust the position of the monitor and it is fine.  We have had two years of consistent great use with this monitor.
