We absolutely LOVE this seat! My daughter is now about 35 lbs and still fits(we just purchased a marathon) and this Roundabout will be the spare until she grows out of it! It's a great seat,very secure,Fits in compact cars(even with other car seats around it.We have used it in a daewoo,saturn and windstar and it fits in nice and secure in all three vehicles..i did try it in my mom's Xterra and it didn't quite fit all that well...My daughter is very comfy in this seat and she can fall asleep and be comfortable.The bellamy pattern is very nice as well.I wish we would have gotten this seat when my daughter was an infant instead of closer to a year,we could have gotten more use out of it!
