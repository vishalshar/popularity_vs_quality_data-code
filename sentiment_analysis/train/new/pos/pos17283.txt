I was pleased to find this crib bedding set on Amazon.  The design is really cute and is great value, it has everything I will need for my baby when he eventually transitions into the crib (and I am not paying for bumpers that I am not going to use)!  My newborn (3 weeks) loves to be swaddled just now and the swaddler is easy to use and I have had very few breakouts.  When he does get out, the material stays away from his face.  My friends with older babies swear by their wearable blankets, so I anticipate getting a lot of use about that too once he has outgrown the newborn swaddle stage.
