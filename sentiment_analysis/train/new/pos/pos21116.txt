We are still waiting for our little one, but received this as a shower gift. It's a pretty color (better in person than online). It opens and closes easily, is light weight and manuevers very well. The seat is very soft and well-cushioned. I love that you can convert the seat to face you or face forwards. I like it much better than the Graco limos that are heavy and take up too much room. The Combi has a nice design and is thin (though with lots of room for baby) so you can get through store isles and I can fit it in my trunk. I highly recommend this stroller. BRU does not have this stroller, but you can order it online from buycombi.com for just $199 and they offer free shipping.
