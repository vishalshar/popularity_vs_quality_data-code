I enjoy the versatility of this caddy. It can be used as one large diaper caddy by utilizing the Velcro straps on the back of each separate unit or it can be used as two smaller caddies. I ordered this product with that knowledge in mind and wished to use it as two separate units; one for toting to the bathroom when I change babies poopy cloth diapers and one for containing babies lotions and thermometers. I used command hooks to hang both on my wall so baby couldn't reach them and so far this system is working wonderfully. The handle openings allow the caddies to hang nicely and the flat back means the caddies are flush with the wall.  The caddies hold a lot more than I had originally thought they would. I can fit several cloth diaper inserts and shells into one caddy. All the outside pockets allow me to store diaper balm, liners, and hand sanitizer. I can even fit a medium to large size lotion in the side pockets and it  holds nicely. It is worth noting that I received a gray caddy not the khaki color In the picture. I don't know how many different colors are available but keep in mind when ordering that you may not receive the khaki color.
