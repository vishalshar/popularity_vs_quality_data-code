Overall it's pretty good, but there are a few things that keep me from giving it 5 stars:-You can't pick the color/lullaby combo. If you want green stars, you have to listen to heartbeat; want blue stars, have to listen to twinkle twinkle, etc.-There is a plug in the side, but there is no info about the plug on the Amazon listing, in the owner's manual, or on the box. The plug says "DC5v" next to it, which indicates that the unit is not designed to be plugged into a home outlet (AC current), but could possibly be plugged into a vehicle outlet (DC Current). Without any information about the plug anywhere, I don't know where I could buy a power wire that would fit. Furthermore, if I found a wire around my house that fit, I would be afraid to plug it into my wall because of the DC indication next to the plug on the unit....I would really love to be able to plug this thing in.-The information on the box and in the manual are different. Box says music for 20 min., stars for 45. Manual and listing on Amazon both say music for 20 min., stars for 20 min., and a few answers to questions on Amazon say music for 25 min. and stars for 45. I haven't timed mine, but the inconsistency is the stuff of 4 star reviews, not 5.
