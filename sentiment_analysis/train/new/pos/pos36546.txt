I am so happy I saw this potty seat on a blog and found it here on Amazon for such a great price! It's pretty much the same price as the cheap, soft plastic seats you find in the stores, but much, much better quality. It's really easy to wipe clean, and it has not retained any smell at all. My son is still not a HUGE fan of sitting on the potty, and my mom seems to think it's because this chair is too hard, but I don't see how it's different from sitting on a plastic toilet seat...Overall, a great product that I'm sure we will keep around for the next kid. It also has fit every seat we've put it on (about 5 or 6 different ones at grandparents' house, our home, friends' homes). And it's attractive looking without any dumb cartoon characters!
