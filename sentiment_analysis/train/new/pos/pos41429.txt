I have to admit that I was a bit nervous when the decals arrived rolled up, held together with a rubber band and packed somewhat loosely in a long priority triangle box. It turns out my fears were absolutely unfounded.While there were many pieces to put up, they were labelled well. I did print a picture from the site which served as a guide to leaf  and monkey placement. If there was one thing I would recommend that be added to the shipment is a color image of the final design. When applying the decals to the wall I rubbed them into place with my fingers and then with a towel to make sure there were no gaps or air bubbles. The pretty cool thing is that the thinness of the decals allows the texture of the walls to show through which make them look painted on. Very nice. My six month old son immediately was entranced by the monkeys and loves his new room. I highly recommend these decals or any others you might be thinking of getting through this company. We will save the name because as our son grows he will certainly want to change his room. By the way, I was nervous about the edges of the stickers and whether or not a butterfly or two would go on properly before putting them up do the the slightly crunched edges when opened and called the company. They were really nice and explained that if I had any issues whatsoever that they would replace all or part of the decals. Needless to say there were no problems, but that was a welcomed sense of assurance before putting them up.
