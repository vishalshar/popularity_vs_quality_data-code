We used one of these lovies for our first daughter and are now using a new one for our son. This brand and style is made of organic cotton and is exceptionally soft, almost like fleece. It's a nice size, not too big and overwhelming for baby. The colors are rich. I think the new version is not made of organic cotton and the organic might not be made anymore so buy two (for one as a backup)!
