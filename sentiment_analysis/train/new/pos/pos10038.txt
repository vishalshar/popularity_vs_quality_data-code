I don't know what I would have done without these.  I bought them before I had my baby on a whim.  I knew nothing about them nor did I know how HARD breastfeeding is in the beginning.  (Why does no one warn us about that?????) I was 4 days in and about to throw in the towel when I remembered I had these stashed away.  I popped one on in desperation and BAM latched right on!!!!  I was able to successfully breastfeed from then on out.  I used them for about a month or two and then just quit one day.  My baby had NO problem latching on to me directly.  Please get these even if it is 'just in case'.  This small piece of silicone will save your sanity! *Side note:  to get sparkling clean just put a dab of dish soap on them and hand wash under hot water.
