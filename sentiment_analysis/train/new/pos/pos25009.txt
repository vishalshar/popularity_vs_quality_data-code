These table toppers come with stickers, one whole sheet per topper.  We used these when traveling abroad, which required us to have many long meals out with family and friends.  These were a lifesaver!  My 18 month old loved playing with the stickers and they entertained him for the entire meal.  There are two different kinds of stickers/table toppers - one is a kitchen scene and the stickers are all food items that you can place throughout the kitchen.  The other is a bedroom and the stickers are bedroom items (toys, clothes, etc.) that you can use.  Great!
