I used this for my daughter for well over a year. It works great especially after she was able to sit up on her own. I also took it outside after we weren't using it for water play and she loved putting her little dolls in it. We used it to pull her around the yard when it snowed. I have also taken it tubing with me to hold a cooler full of beer, and everyone thought it was hilarious. A 28 gallon Coleman cooler fits perfectly. And it bobbles and you cannot tip it over. This thing is tough and versatile. I am buying a new one now as ours finally popped after 3 years of abuse.
