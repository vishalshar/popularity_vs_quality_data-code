I plan to have my newborn sleep in the pack 'n play, but not in the "cuddle cove" seat. I needed a cover for the bassinet "mattress" (the flat, foldable piece that comes with it...not an actual mattress) and this product really fits the bill. Despite the fact that the label does actually say "tumble dry", I followed other reviewers' advice and line dried it. (dried wicked fast, too). I'm surprised by how soft it is and the fit it great...nice and snug. I wanted to stick with a Graco product to ensure a good fit and it worked. I'll update my review once the baby arrives and I've had a chance to actually use it.Update: This was a great purchase. I highly recommend.
