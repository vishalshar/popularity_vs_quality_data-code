I bought these to add an extra skin to liner layer because my cloth diaper fabric has either stopped absorbing or just cannot keep up with the heavier wetting as my son ages. These are indeed hand made as stated in the description. The fabric could probably stand to be pre-shrunk as some of them bunched in the wash but a little tugging to straighten works just fine. The fabric is nice and soft. I've used machine manufactured cheap liners from BuyBuyBaby and they are very similar in design but these are much nicer fabric and USA made by hand. you cant top that! If you think you can make them yourself, then by all means do so if you have the time. They are basic but you dont need bells and whistles to absorb urine, folks. 10 bucks is a far better value than using up a bunch of my time sewing now that my kiddo is on the run. I bought one set to test them out then I bought 6 more sets. Best purchase in my diapering experience thus far.
