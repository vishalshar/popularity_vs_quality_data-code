We love this sleep sack! Our house is always kept at a cool 70 degrees or so for sleep, and our son seemed overheated in all fleece footy pajamas, but too cold in plain cotton pajamas (plus he pulls off his socks). But add this to cotton pajamas, and he sleeps like a champ!Also excellent for early climbers! We were afraid we'd have to move him to a toddler bed when he was only 11 months because our (freakishly tall) child kept bouncing and swinging a leg up on the rail in an attempt to vault to freedom. But now we always put him in a sleep sack before bed and he can't get his legs far enough apart to climb over! At nearly 16 months, with him climbing all day every day on everything, he still can't climb out of his crib (not even close) when he's wearing this.It has the added unexpected benefit of being a key part of his sleep routine. Once we change his diaper and put on the sleep sack, he knows it's sleep time. He reads a book with me, then waves "night night" to the light to tell me to turn it off, then grabs for his crib which I gladly place him in. No fuss, no tears, just a super smooth transition and he falls asleep on his own. It's magic! Try it without the sleep sack (like if he puked on it.... Cue the purchase of the backup sleep sack) and it's not nearly as smooth to sleep.All in all, one of our MVP (most valuable products).
