I am very pleased with the order i received. They Shipped it much quicker then anticipated, and it was a nice surprise to receive it early since I had run out. These bags are great for keeping the smell from the diapers out of the house. It seals up great, and it's light fragrance is not so strong as to overpower a room. I am not a big fan of strong smelling perfumes. I would recommend this store to anyone who is interested. I know that if I need more, I will be sending them another purchase order.
