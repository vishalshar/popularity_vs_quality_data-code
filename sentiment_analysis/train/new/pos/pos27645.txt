I like these sheets a lot, even though I'm giving them only 4 stars.  I'd give another half-star if that were an option.  The reason I took away a star is that when washed and dried or slept on, these sheets look like paper that you've wadded up and then tried to flatten out by hand.  In other words, they really need to be ironed in order to look their best.  Nothing wrong with that, but the simple fact that I'm buying toddler sheets suggests that I don't have time to wield an iron if I don't have to.  That isn't being a Mommy Martyr.  It's just stating a fact.  I'm not wasting time ironing sheets when I can spend it playing with the toddler who uses these sheets.  Also, the pillow case is more like a sham-pillow case (you put the pillow in through the back instead of the top).  No turning the pillow over for the cool side.  Maybe toddlers don't do that, anyway.  That's just a mention.  That wasn't enough to dock a star.Now on to what makes these sheets pretty darned awesome: there's the bottom sheet that's fitted, which is expected.  But then, the TOP SHEET has a fitted pocket, so you don't have to do hospital corners!  That's a HUGE deal when you're dealing with a toddler bed that has rails or bars on two of the three sides down at the foot.  That genius pocket keeps the top sheet right the heck in place, no matter how thrashy my daughter is in her sleep!Where do I have to go to get that fitted pocket on top sheets in twin and big-people bed sizes?  It's just brilliant, and makes this sheet set worth it!
