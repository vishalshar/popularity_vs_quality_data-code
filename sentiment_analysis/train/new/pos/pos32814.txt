I held off for a long time deciding which stackers to purchase. You would laugh to know how many countless hours researching stackers and other baby toys I would purchase for this 3rd child! Normally I would run right to the Fisher Price Rock a Stack, as that is what we all grew up with for the most part, I know myself and my other 2 children.  Time has passed and come to a place where we have so many options! and making sure a toy that goes in a baby's mouth is safe, dyes, bpa, size, etc!Originally gravitating towards the ol' faithful, I read reviews of the blue dye coming off and the center stick being a problem. I purchased a more expensive wooden popular brand and the stick was super dangerous and some of the wooden rings were too small and a whole ring would certainly be in babys mouth. I came across these! I loved the OBall Oball-- so thought it had such great reviews Id give it a try! The OBall Anyway Stacker Toy is great! You really can stack it anyway, also the rings are a great size! My only suggestion would be as a few others had said, "It would be nice if the red piece also stacked anyway." It only can go on top. That is so minor however, it is only a matter of personal opinion. This toy is fun for the kids, from what I see safe, colorful and makes them feel proud of themselves as they see they too; like you are able to stack!
