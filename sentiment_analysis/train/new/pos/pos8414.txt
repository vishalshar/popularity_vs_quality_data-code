This fit great on my double BOB, I did not like the stander BOB double stroller cup holder so when I saw this it was a must. yes, it's not sturdy enough for a run with a cup of coffee but why would you be running if you had a hot cup of coffee? I actually got this because our family was going on a road trip for almost the entire year through all 48 states. We are 2 months in and this bag has come in real handy. I am able to put in 3 sandwiches and few fruits and snacks into this bag, with 2 bottles of water to take to our museum trips and parks. Only thing is that front hook that holds the cover down is a rubber band and it came out of the hole with in few uses... I think I should be able to fix it once I get some tools to push the band back in. Shoulder strap that came with it was pretty sturdy, it's like a duffel bag strap, but I did not had to take it off the stroller. It has enough little pockets and little dividers to keep your credit cards, id, phone, food all those things.
