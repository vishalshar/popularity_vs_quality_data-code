Our entire family was suffering from the control our 2 year old had on us. She was constantly getting out of bed during the night. She refused to stay in her bed. My husband was adiment that she was not sleeping with us. I tried everything from sticker charts to the supernanny method. Nothing was successful. I reached out to a friend, and she said she had used the door monkey. I did some research and though I was a little hesitant, I purchased 3 of them!Judge if you must. But it has worked. The day they came in, we went over the process with her of how it would work. We would go through the normal bedtime routine. Once it was time to get in bed, we would put the door monkey in place. We would be able to see her on the monitor, but we would not speak to her. When the cow wakes up (she has a wakeup clock in her room), we would come and take the door monkey off. It would only be used at nighttime. Once she can go to bed and stay in bed, we would take it off.The first night she screamed, yelled, pulled. But, she wasn't able to get out of her room. She could see through the opening it created, but could not leave the room. It took her 12 minutes, but she then crawled in her bed and went to sleep. The second night, she screamed for 3 minutes. I realize it is not the intended use of this product, but it worked for us.I am sure there are some who consider this appalling, and I am ok with that. She had been confined to a crib before we transitioned her to a toddler bed, but no one ever questioned that!I just know that this product worked for our house. Thank you.
