I love this sippy because it's stainless steel, has removable handles, has a straw/sippy option AND is extremely durable. My son learned to drink through the straw around 7 months and loves to carry this cup everywhere.  He's dropped it from his high chair onto the tile floor and the tip still hasn't cracked, even after hitting tip-first.  With all this said, I do wish it had a pressure valve of some sort to let air into the bottle while my son drinks from it.  He has to suck pretty hard after a gulp or two in order to continue getting water without popping off and letting air into the cup.  This isn't a big deal, overall though.  He loves his cup.  We bought 4 cups in different colors and use a different cup each day.  We wash them and their parts on the top rack of the dishwasher and don't remove the sleeve.  We've never had any issues with mold under the sleeve or anything.***********UPDATE******** 2 years laterWe have had issues with mold so now remove the sleeve (along with all other pieces) every time we wash the cup and let everything dry completely before putting it back on. We removed the colored cap permanently since it also would collect mold over time (shown in 1st & last photos). Our second son was born 1 year ago and was given 3 of his own new cups. We ordered replacement sleeves from Kid Basix so our toddler would have GREEN sleeves on his cup and our baby would have BLUE sleeves on his cups. Our second son also learned to drink through the straw very easily at 6 months old. We mainly put water in the cups which helps cut-down on the mold issues. We have 3 cups for each child and that seems to be enough. Cleaning the cups is a lot of work but is worth it in my opinion since they are safer for the kids to drink from on a daily basis.
