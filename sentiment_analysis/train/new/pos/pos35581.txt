OK so baby is not here yet so I have not used it. I will say that it is exactly what I expected, it came earlier than I expected, and I am very happy with my purchase. It was very easy to assemble especially when you consider the fact that I'm nine months pregnant and I did it alone. The napper is very soft just as I had hoped. My baby getting a good nights sleep is everything to me so that was very important (if only my sleep will be as important to him LOL). Now the price.. Praise Jah! 89.99 +free shipping for a product this awesome?! Definitely getting your money's worth. Promise you won't regret it. Also, I read a review that someone was disappointed that the attachment for the diapers was not detachable from the changing station and I didn't really like that too much either, but it wasn't a big deal. I found a diaper organizer, a really cheap and cool one, right in Walmart with so many compartments on it that clips right onto the bed in front of the changing station. I'll upload another pic soon..
