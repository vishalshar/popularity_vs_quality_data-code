These arrived as described.  We like the snaps, rather than velcro, since it stays cleaner and doesn't have any scratchy parts.  They could be a little thicker, but are double layer and more absorbent than the straps alone.  We have used them on the Ergo, the bouncy chair (hangs in doorway), and the car seat; they are great for covering any of these straps that baby can chew on.  The organic cotton is a must, too.  We don't want him gnawing on nylon, polyester, or some other synthetic substance.  We also like that they pop off quickly and easily, allowing them to be simply washed in the sink or with other laundry.  This is much easier than washing the whole carrier when if baby spits up on the strap.  These things aren't cheap; if you have access to organic cotton and a seamstress, you could make them for much less, but this was a fast solution for us when baby suddenly started drooling and gumming everything :)- Matthew's Review
