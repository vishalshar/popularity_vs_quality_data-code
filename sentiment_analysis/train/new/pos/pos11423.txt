The covers do a great job of protecting plugs and outlets from little fingers. A couple of notable things, however:1) The covers are a two part arrangement with one part being the actual cover itself and the other being a plastic base which the cover snaps over. The base is affixed to the outlet by a screw which goes through the outlet coverplate, ie the litle screw in between the outlet receptacles. If you have the decorator (Decora) style outlets, these covers won't work with them. Not a deal breaker, but worth noting.2) Although they look pretty roomy, I don't think a DC power power adapter would fit under the cover.
