I purchased this set nervous from reading the reviews and was completely ecstatic when the results came in. We set this up immediately, just in case we needed to return and everything was perfect. The wood matches exactly. The boards connected  perfectly and no additional modifications needed to be made. If you have the vicki sorelle crib in espresso this is the bed rails to purchase!
