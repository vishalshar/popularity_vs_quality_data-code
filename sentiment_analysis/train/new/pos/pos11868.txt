A fantastic Christmas gift from an Aunt! Our infant also enjoys the Lamaze peacock, the firefly and the giraffe. However, Marina the Mermaid is her favorite. Marina seems the most versitile of the similar Lamaze toys with a "mirror" (thin safety material with backing), a teething toy, starfish rattle, textured hair, clothing crinkle and ribbons attached near the mirror. Our infant has interacted with Marina and Jacque the Peacock the most, the giraffe is her 3rd favorite. She loves to chew on Marina's hair. I also investigated the Lamaze doll with hat from this line and found it did not compare with regard to the textures and activities on the single doll. We use extra toy clips to hang Marina from the car-seat headrest in front of our daughter when going on travels. That system keeps her from being dropped. Marina also works out great with Tiny Love Play mats and clipped to a stroller or for lap play with a parent of sibling.
