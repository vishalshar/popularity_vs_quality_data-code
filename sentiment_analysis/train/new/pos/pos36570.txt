I had a rather unconventional reason for buying this pouch.  While traveling to Europe, on tours as well as traveling on our own, I sometimes found the ladies rooms lacking in supplies, I.e. toilet paper, paper towels, sink for washing hands (some of the tours were to some rather rustic locations).  I decided to travel in the future with my personal stash of convenience items.  Carries the camping-style Coleman toilet paper rolls nicely, individual packets of hand wipes, and more.  This pouch is a thinner fabric than I had expected, doesn't really look as though it would stay dry if exposed to really wet conditions, but it has a thin, flexible vinyl liner which should keep contents dry, short of full immersion (not sure seams would prevent water intrusion).  Wish it had a sturdy loop so I could fasten it to the inside of my camera bag that doubles as a purse, but I'm using the rather large tag on the side as a loop and it is working well.  I liked having a choice of colors.  The pouch measures 4.75 x 9.5 inches.  The larger main pouch should keep contents dry, the smaller outer zip pocket is not lined so not resistant to water.If you find this review helpful, please let me know by using the voting buttons.
