I got this to cover a window in my toddlers room. When turning it sideways i was able to attach it to the window casing instead of the window frame this worked out amazingly well as i can still open and close the window as needed. This seems to be made of good solid plastic and will hold up well. Pre-drilling holes is required for this application or at least i would recommend doing so. I have a 2 1/2 year old going through a throwing toys phase and this has proven to prevent the window shattering 2x already so i am glad for purchasing this. I understansd this is for a door but with some imagination i was able to protect the window and more importantly my Child i have included a photo of this installed
