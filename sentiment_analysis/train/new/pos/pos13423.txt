After reading the reviews I decided to go for it anyway. I figured I needed to stop procrastinating and just buy the rocker so if we had to find an alternative, we would have time. I heard the reviews saying it was difficult to assemble, it was easy. I read that it wasn't very stable, mine withstood my 40 lb dog jumping into the basket and back out, and a hormonal pregnant woman moving it upstairs, banging it into every wall and railing on the way. The only thing that was even slightly a disappointment was that my moses basket, which I assume is a pretty standard size, is just a tad bit small for the frame. We're debating a few ideas to solve this, but it isn't a deal breaker. We could either move the plastic pieces in and drill our own holes, or we could put some sort of cushioning around the plastic to help it fit snugly. Either way, this is still a great product and we love it. It went together easily and is sturdy. Looks BEAUTIFUL in my room, and is the perfect height for setting up next to my bed for co-sleeping without baby sleeping in my bed.
