we are potty training and I thought it would be a good idea to get my son a stool so he can wash his hands with me when he was done using his potty. The price was good on this and he loves cars so I didnt think anything of it and purchased it.It is a fine stool and is sturdy and grips the ground nicely with the rubber edging on the bottom.what I dont like about it is how low the stool is. My son (who is two) still cannot reach the sink. I should have read how tall it was and thought about it some more. It is suitable for older children like 4 or 5 and not for a toddler.it is lightweight which is also nice and my son has dragged it all around the house to give him some added height and new exploration for trouble!
