This was purchased for a dining room set and the chairs or contemporary.  I didn't think her parents would use a hard plastic seat on the chairs.  It was the perfect fit for my granddaughter's chair and is very firm.  I'm sure a full wash of the cover will be needed, but for right now a light spill was easy to wipe up.
