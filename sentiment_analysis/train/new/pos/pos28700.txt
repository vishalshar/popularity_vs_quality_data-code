I bought a Graco Trekko and found that it was heavy and took up my entire trunk space!  Because it was such a painto load and unload from the trunk (ESP after a c-section) I ended up buying the Graco Urbanlite stroller and It has changed my life!  For starter, the same carseat (Graco Snugride 30) can be used for both.  Also, it is easy to fold and unfold, it is light and has a huge storage compartment on the bottom.  The parent and child consoles are a plus.  I would recommend this strollerto my friends.
