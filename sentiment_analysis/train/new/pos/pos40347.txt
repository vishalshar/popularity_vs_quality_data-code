I just had my first baby and had only 6 weeks maternity leave, so I bought the Platex pump after reading several reviews that said that it and the Medela were the best commercially available electric pumps.  It works wonderfully.  It feels a lot like a baby's mouth sucking your breast and I am  able to painlessly pump 4 bottles per day so that I can continue breastfeeding while going back to work.  I was able to use it to stockpile milk in the freezer while I was on maternity leave, as well as to start our baby on 1 bottle per day after her 3rd week so that she could seamlessly transition to taking the bottle from my husband after I returned to work.  I have no complaints about this pump. It allowed us to transition me back to work without a hitch in the baby's schedule.  I highly recommend it.
