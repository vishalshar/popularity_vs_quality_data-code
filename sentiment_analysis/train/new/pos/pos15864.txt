I purchased these for a friend (I started off with 3 to see if she would like it) and she is constantly raving about how great they work and never give her daughters diaper rash.  Oh, just FYI she couldn't figure out for the life of her why there were two liners in there.  Apparently there are polyeurethane (sp?) liners in the diapers so she was washing them every time her daughter "used" them.  After researching them online she figured out that they came with two liners so she could just take one out, and use the next one.She absolutely loves them and says they work perfect on her daughter...I am ordering more for her right now-plus they are great for the environment, and save on purchasing diapers, so who can argue with that?The diaper bag that comes with it is used by itself (my friend told me to check out the website for more info) and you just was it as is with nothing else-she says it is really handy to use.  When drying, put on low setting as to not "melt" the liners.Good luck!!!
