My 3 year old daughter is potty trained; however, she has the occasional accident during the night.  This product has been a real time saver! I ordered two so that when there are accidents I can throw one in the wash and easily replace it with the other one quite quickly.  My daughter has eczema and allergies; however, this product has not bothered her one bit, it's quite soft to the touch.  The backing is lined and we haven't had any accidents that pad didn't absorb (it's quite large on her twin bed).  The pad stays in place well, but we do have to tuck it in a little bit each night to ensure a tight fit (no biggie).  I would recommend it to anyone that has accidents while sleeping... I think this would also be great if you have a little one in diapers who leaks.  Thank goodness we no longer have to replace all the sheets when she has an accident.  I highly recomment this product!
