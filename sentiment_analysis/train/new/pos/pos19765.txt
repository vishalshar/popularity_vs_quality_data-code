I bought these flat flannel diapers for my grandson and they are the best.  I looked high and low for flat flannel diapers and finally stumbled on these.  They are ultra soft, wash beautifully and can easily be folded into thirds to fit in a velcro diaper cover.  They also work great as baby bath towels, burp cloths, and receiving blankets.  Six packages of these diapers will last the entire diapering period with changing the folding pattern.  For a little over $100 plus the cost of your choice of diaper covers you are set from birth to toddler.  I would definitely buy again.  I wish I could have found these when my own children were babies.
