I have a Snugli, a Moby and an Ergo Baby and I must say that the Ergo Baby is THEE best carrier I have seen or used.  I have an in-home child care so myself and my staff carry the babies with us everywhere we go while multitasking, teaching and caring for the older children.  With the Snugli (which is just like Baby Bijorn) I like it and use it often but when the baby goes potty, it often ends up on me since the way the leg holders are designed causes a gap between the baby's leg and the diaper.  With the Moby, I am just too nervous carrying a tiny infant in it for fear that their face may get smashed against my skin and they will stop breathing.  However, I have yet to find a downfall to the Ergo Baby!  The only thing that I might complain about is that I had a c-section with my daughter 8 weeks ago and the waist support of the Ergo sometimes irritates the incision.  However, the irritation is only a problem if I have been wearing it for hours on end or if I am sitting with it on for a while.  I especially love the performance aspects of this carrier.  It is more water resistant that the original Ergo and it came with a LED safety light.  Both of those aspects are perfect for rainy Portland, Oregon!  I actually love the Ergo so much more than the Snugli and Moby that I ordered a second one for my staff to use with the other infant.  I also purchased the infant insert for my newborn and she loves it.  We can go anywhere with the Ergo and she is perfectly content (always a big plus!).  I would recommend this carrier to anyone and everyone.
