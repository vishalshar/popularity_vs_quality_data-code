I was about to buy Boppy from Amazon, but I decided to look around for a more affordable option. Then, I found this, which is half the price! The pillow is extremely useful, when I'm breastfeeding or when the baby wants to take a nap next to me.This very comfortable for both me and my baby! I definitely recommend buying this over the more expensive brand!
