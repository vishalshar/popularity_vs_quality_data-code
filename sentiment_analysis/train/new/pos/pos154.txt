This is my daughters OBSESSION now.  She has had it since she was 2 months old and now reaches for the pacifier with the binky buddy attached and snubs any other free standing pacifier.  I have repeatedly washed this item and it has held up incredibly well.  The velcro clip that fastens around the pacifier is strong.  I WILL be buying more of these.
