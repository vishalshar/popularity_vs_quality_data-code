I was originally disappointed by the quality when I opened the box.  Cheap stick legs to support the cloth bag, and an interior lining I was sure would just break with light use.  But we've had this and used it for several months now, and it normally gets over half-full before it's emptied for cleaning.  It is holding up well, and I don't see there being a problem for us having this around through until our next child has grown past its use.  It's expensive for the quality you receive, but it matches the set and at least holds up over time.
