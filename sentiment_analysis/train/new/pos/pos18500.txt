It's a good size for most surge protector/power strips, and adequately large for all plugs we try to put in it. However, it can be a huge pain in the butt to open...even for an adult! I don't know if there's a way to design it so that an adult can open it without using tools like a standard screwdriver or keys to pry open the tabs, but it'd be great if it were just a tad easier. In fact, I've worried a couple of times that I would *break* the tabs, thus making the case uselessIf you don't have to open it very often, it's great!
