I scoff in the face of other pacifier holders.These are absolutely the best on the market!  I'm a mom of four and this is the only holder that has never come off of anything without squeezing it first!  I also love the fact that it snaps shut.  I have one on the car seat strap and one on my Kinderpack baby carrier.  Every once in a while I'll need to transfer her with a paci in her mouth and I can either unclip or unsnap, depending on what my needs are.  It's so nice to not have to rethread each time.  I didn't think I would value that feature as much as I do. Plus, it's just easier/faster when I need to wash, etc.I have used it in a pinch to keep baby's toys from falling onto the floor when she feels like playing the pick up game when we're out.  I'm all about that game because it teaches them cause and effect but I'm NOT all about germs when we are out running around.  This is perfect.  I have a few different baby buddy products and I love all of them!  I just throw them in the dishwasher if I feel they need to be cleaned.  They come out looking brand new!
