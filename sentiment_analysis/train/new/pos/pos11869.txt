I have used a lot of bags over the years, mostly messenger bags and this one is very solid. I gave it 4 stars because meets all my desired requirements in a bag but doesn't excel really at any. As a guy, I first wanted a bag which didn't scream diaper bag. Looking at this bag in person there is NOTHING about this bag that tells someone it is a diaper bag. Secondly, I really wanted a functional bag. Despite not looking like from the outside it certainly has all the required pockets. I also just have twins and this bag is just large enough to carry all the required incidentals. It isn't overly large, nor is it too small. The strap is very important and is comfy, but not too large. Lastly, as others have mentioned this bag is very well made. It will last years to come.One thing which is the biggest weakness is the wipes dispenser holder. It has a piece of elastic that only goes 'around' the wipes rather than 'under' them which allows them to fall down into the bag rather than stay into the opening. I plan on fixing this by putting a piece of fabric there to full enclose the pocket and keep them there like the manufacturer should have.
