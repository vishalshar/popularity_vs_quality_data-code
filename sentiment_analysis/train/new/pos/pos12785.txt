Great quality.  Not the best fit, especially for a chunkier baby (we went up to this size a few pounds earlier than they suggest) but they seem comfortable and leak-free.  The velcro tabs are small, so I always have them under pants or bloomers, something to be sure they don't come undone with wiggling.  We've been quite happy through many, many washings.  And they're cute!
