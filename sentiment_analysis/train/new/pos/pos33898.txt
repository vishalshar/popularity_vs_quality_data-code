I love MAM products, especially the bottles. I used them for my daughter 8 years ago and told my sister about them for her daughter who had EXTREMELY bad gas and colic. She wanted to use her bottles that were "cute" until I purchased a MAM bottle and her daughter had instant relief. So now at 14 months old I'm taking my niece off the bottle and she instantly took to this cup. I also purchased the BornFree Breeze cup which she didn't like. Great sturdy cup and great quality. Doesn't leak and has a cover for the top to help keep it clean! I just purchased 3 more so my sister has them when she gets back from her vacation!
