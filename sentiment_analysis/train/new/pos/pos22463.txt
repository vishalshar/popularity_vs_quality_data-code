I love this cap. My 5 yr old son just had his vaccinations the other day then had a fever at night. i used this on him and he wore it going to sleep. It helped a lot. He didnt complain of it being too cold or uncomfortable. He was able to rest well so did I. This is safe enough to leave on asleep with the ice gel pack on. The gel pack being almost palm size more or less can only stay cool for maybe 2 hours max depending on the temp of the person using it. I had other means of lowering his temp not just this but this is way better than using a damp towelette in my opinion which I usually do. I would suggest having maybe back up ice gel packs of this size to replace the gel packs if your using this for longer than 2 hours. If his temperature didnt go down I wouldve used the other gel packs I had ready in my freezer. Item came on time. Would purchase from this seller again
