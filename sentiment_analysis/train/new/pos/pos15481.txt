We bought this high chair for our granddaughter, and it works well.  It did require assembly, and all screw holes were pre-tapped, which made alignment relatively easy.  The metal screws for critical connections required some extra effort to screw in, but not beyond what this grandfather with arthritis could handle.  The construction appears solid, but there are two areas which were surprising.  1. The footrest (white thing below the seat in the photo) is solidly fixed in position with no adjustment.  2.  The seat itself has a structure on the front between the child's legs, which apparently is meant to keep the child safe from sliding out while one matches the crotch strap with the shoulder harness safety belts - which is a little redundant in my estimation.  Tray adjustment is a little strange, and requires one to pull the tray straight out to remove.  When in place the tray has a fair amount of wobble room, and is not tight in its position (front of tray toward parent moves up and down).  The seat has 3 positions, but our 7 month old only uses one (straight vertical).  Others have commented on the toy, which adheres to the tray with a big suction cup - which our little girl can pull off with a loud POP, bringing the toy close to hitting her own head, and scaring her.  She loves it as an independent toy, not suctioned to anything.  She also loves the ears on the giraffe on the seatback pad.I would recommend this High Chair, as it is well made, and attractive to our little girl.
