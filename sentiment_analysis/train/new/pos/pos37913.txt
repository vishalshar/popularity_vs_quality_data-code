This Turtle thermometer is perfect for helping me set the right bath temperature. Those ducks that let you know when the water is too hot suck, too hot is so vague it doesn't tell you what temp the water is at, its always either too hot or cold to the touch. I'm a first time parent with a 3 month old boy and since getting the turtle he has responded to bath time in a much more positive way. He really seems to enjoy it now.Its super easy to use, there is no on off button you just place in the bath as you fill it up. It will display what temp the water is and all you have to do is adjust as you fill it up to get the temp you want. The directions instruct to stir the water as you fill up so you even the temperature out and reduce hot and cold spots. If too hot or cold the red light will blink.The only con I see is that the battery is not replaceable, but the turtle should last 2-3 years which is fine with me for the price.
