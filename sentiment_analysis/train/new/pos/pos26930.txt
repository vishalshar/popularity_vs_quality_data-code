I am not one who gets excited about baby products, but I must admit -- I love this carrier!! It is super light weight and the self contained fold-in bag feature is so smart and easy! I got this as a secondary carrier for my 15 month old for travel, quick trips, etc. and it has quickly become my go to carrier (over our Ergo - which we do like).  I realize now that most of my carrier use is for errands in the neighborhood and travel anyway, so it works well for my needs.  I also love the portability of it when folded - I can toss it in my purse or carry on bag and hardly notice it's there. I have used it front and back carry and my daughter does well in both modes.  She actually seems to like being in it and is very comfortable.  It may not be what you need if you need a carrier for more heavy duty use, but outside of that, it works great! The lightweight, great function and low cost (I found it for under $50) make it worth every penny -- even if only as a secondary carrier.  In a world of too many baby products, this is DEFINITELY THE ONE TO BUY!
