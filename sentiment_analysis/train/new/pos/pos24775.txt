Great start of a costume! I had to add some bling to it, but it was super cute when all done. The 12-18 mo size was extremely long (sleeves and pants legs) for my 15 month old. I love how the cape is detachable. Jumpsuit has short zipper, so was a 2-person job to get a squirmy toddler into it. All in all very pleased!
