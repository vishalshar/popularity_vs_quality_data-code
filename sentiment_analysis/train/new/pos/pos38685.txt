I really can't complain about how speedy they sent my merchandise...Ordered 12/20, received 12/22...IMPRESSIVE!!What I will complain about is this:  Picture is misrepresentative of size  :(  There needs to be a better description. Maybe someone will take a picture of a baby wearing this. Perhaps someone will verbally describe the fact that this is meant as a newborn gift.Fifteen Dollars is Overpriced for just one bib, no matter how cute it is.I know, I know...there are a pair of booties included, but they are soooooo small---Infant size---for a newborn baby only. And, they wont fit my soon to be 4 month old nephew.if you want to give this as a Baby Shower Gift or a GIFT for a NEWBORN, it is  perfect. 5 stars. I hope this helps.
