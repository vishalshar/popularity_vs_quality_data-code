Got it for my one month old because of big wheels and a carry cot option that can fold down and does not require extra storage space. Had it for a month. So far - love it. It's a little bit on a heavy side but those large wheels are great for the beach and parks (we live in Hawaii). I am taking my little one for long walks in the morning and at night and he just sleeps there and I know his spine is doing great which is very important at this age. Baby is comfy sleeping in it, not like those poor babies stuck in car seats where they can't stretch or lie flat. The carry cot has a wood at the bottom and nice little breathable mattress, so it's firm but comfy. Very good amortization. Happy mama.
