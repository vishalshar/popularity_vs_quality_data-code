This Diaper bag is nice and roomy. I can fit in all the bottles, diapers, and extra clothing items in this bag neatly without a lot of fuss. And the weight of the bag is perfect for additions so that it is not overly heavy when I do add items to it. The strap is nice and wide so there is "little slip off the shoulder" problems with the bag. The design is very cute, even daddy doesn't mind carrying it. I have a little girl, and eventhough it is baby blue the characters are cute enough for either baby use. The bag also comes with a changing pad in it's own individual slot in the front, so there is no digging for it when you need to change baby fast.This is a perfect gift and it doesn't cost a lot, not exactly stylish for conservatives, but for the new mommy who is on the go this bag is perfect (great for a registry item too).
