So thrilled with these pull-ups that had to write a review. I was so tired of urine-soaked mornings with my 4 year-old and especially my 3 year-old (who we, admittedly, still allow to drink a lot of milk before bed). Constantly dealing with sodden sheets, blankets, pajamas and boys was becoming extremely tiresome. Finally decided to seek out better, more suitable, pull-ups and gave these a shot. Bingo! We've now had three nights and they have worked wonderfully well. The bedding remains bone dry and only their PJ bottoms around the crotch have been only ever-so slightly damp twice (on the 3 year-old). Certainly this limited damp is absolutely nothing compared to the dripping wetness before. Delighted.
