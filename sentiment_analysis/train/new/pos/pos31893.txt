a bit skeptical when i was first looking up this product but once i got it and got it together i was impressed. my son who is 5 and 1/2 months old had sum trouble initially getting started but once the milk started flowing he killed his bottle. it is soooo much more convienient then having to hold up or prop up a bottle to get things done. especially in the car. and for any parents who have this product find any issues with ur child getting started just squeeze the nipple until the milk comes to the top. great product tho!!
