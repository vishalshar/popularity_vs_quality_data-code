I am potty training my 3rd child right now. I couldn't find my old Gerber vinyl pants and had to buy all new ones. Of course I started with the Gerber pants, the new "improved" material, PEVA, is HORRIBLE!!!!!! It is loud and seems even more uncomfortable. I thought I'd give Dappi vinyl a chance; they certainly couldn't be any worse than the Gerbers. I was surprised by how wonderful these are!!! The material is soft, silent and perfectly waterproof. I love them and so does my daughter. She weighs about 22lbs and I got her the medium. They fit very well--no leaks. She wears them over the Gerber training pants (which I love) and these Dappi pants add no bulk. I will buy these from now on!
