my eldest daughteris having her first child and ashe and her husband live in Italy she asked me to order her some crib sheets since in Europe crib sheets are so expensive or very rough material the babys not due till march so I thought id start stocking up on them now and see which ones are the best quality for the money these are great soft and reasonably priced I paid double for a carters crib sheet and they feel the same I don't know what her system is for washing clothes so im gonna run each one thru the wash and see how they hold up but rite now I think im gonna stick with this brand
