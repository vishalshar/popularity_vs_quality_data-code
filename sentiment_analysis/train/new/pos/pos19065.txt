When I bought this back when I was still in my second trimester, I had no idea if I was going to be successful at nursing.  I wouldn't have without this dang pillow, I can tell you that.  No accessory can make you stick with it when you're having troubles, but this accessory can at least give your arms a rest and make it easier to endure those long long LONG (did I mention long???) first nights.The pockets are what really made this particular boppy awesome.  I could keep lanolin, chapstick, my cell phone, a pacifier, and other small odds and ends right to hand.  When he would have a cold, I could keep a thermometer tucked in a pocket.  When he started teething, teething gel and tablets lived in a pocket.  When he had colic, gripe water was always tucked in there.  I'd keep a towel tucked in a pocket to wipe up spit ups or dribbles and as a way to keep track of what side I was on.  Since there are three pockets, I could tuck the corner of my towel into the pocket on the side I'd finished up on.  I love this dang pillow.  It will probably wind up going in my son's bed when he moves from his crib to a big boy bed, since its smell and feel will be familiar and comfortable.If I have to do this again in the future, I will definitely be using, if not this very boppy, then one just like it.4 years later -- No, we're not still nursing.  He weaned himself  not long after I wrote the original review.  But "Bop" stayed with him like a stuffed animal till he was three.  He would curl up in the C of it, with his arms wrapped around one side or the other.  It was like having arms wrapped around him I guess.  I didn't let him keep it in the crib with him, but once he was in a toddler bed, he would go and get it.  When I'd go check on him, he'd be wrapped up with Bop.  Bop is still in his room.  He'll be four this year, and he lounges in it to read books and still snuggles with it on occasion.
