These are really cute, large (but not too large), and best of all they have a plastic backing. I have bought other bibs that were ALL cloth (no plastic backing) and sometimes spills on them would leak through to my grandchild's clothing.  That will never be a problem with these bibs. I also love that they come out of the washer/dryer just great with very little to no fading.  And Parents, here's a little tip for you regarding baby stains i.e. spit up and baby food...Try a bar of FelsNaptha. Most stores carry it in the Laundry detergent aisle.  It's been around longer than I have for a reason.  All you have to do is wet the stain, rub the bar on it, and wash. It's amazing, and costs less than $2.00 and lasts a very long time.  Just sayin'.....
