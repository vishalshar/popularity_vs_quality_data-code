These are fantastic! I use these for pacifier tethers. They are super easy to use for adults and difficult for little fingers to operate, which is great for their safety. Secure well to clothing, fabrics, etc. I love that these are plastic and in super cute colors. I always used the metal ones, but these are both safer and cuter. I will definitely use these from now on.
