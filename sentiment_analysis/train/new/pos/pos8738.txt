We considered an IKEA crib but do not live anywhere close to an IKEA store. Then I saw this one on Amazon, which looked really similar.It arrived and was easy to put together. It suggests to put it together with another person, but I found it easy enough to put together myself, even being pregnant and rather awkward these days! It's decent quality and doesn't wobble at all. Anyone complaining that it isn't sturdy either didn't put it together correctly, or got a defective one.We ordered a standard sized crib mattress and it fit in this crib perfectly. No gaps, but also not too tight.I didn't give it a perfect 5 stars for 2 reasons.-- It DOES off-gas a little. Not a ton, but it definitely had a smell kind of like fresh paint or sealant when we first opened the box. I wouldn't buy this crib and put my baby directly in it. Our baby isn't due for several more weeks, so I'm not at all worried about it. The smell is almost gone now and it hasn't even been out of its package for a week.-- It'd be nice if they included some white plugs to cover up the holes where you screw it together. Could probably DIY something like this, but even those cheap bookshelves you can buy at Walmart come with little white covers to go over the screws. I suppose they are wanting to avoid a choking hazard, which is obviously more important than aesthetics, but it seems like something could be done to minimize the appearance of the screws on the ends. Not a big deal, just noticeable.
