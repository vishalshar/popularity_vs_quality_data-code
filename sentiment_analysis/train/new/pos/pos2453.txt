I have 4 of these car seats. 2 in Butterfly Bliss and 2 in Martin and these are buy far the best car seats we have ever owned. They are forward facing only but well made and we love the metal frame in the back, very sturdy. Harness is easy on and easy off and very easily adjustable. I spent a month researching car seats and finally decided on these ones, the head support is great, their heads rarely slump when sleeping with the 2 supports on the side of their heads and the cup holder is a plus. My daughter loves her butterfly car seats, very cute girly print too and a major plus is it has a 10 year expiration, converts from a convertible to a high back booster to a booster so this will be the only car they will probably ever need and then they won't need to be in a car seat at all AND AWESOME FOR TALL KIDS! I recommend them to anyone who says they are looking for a convertible car seat. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
