*** CAUTION *** WARNING TO PARENTS *** CAUTION ***This is a great quality product that is easy to setup, easy to use, and easy to fold when storing.I do, however, want to warn parents out there about the possibility of your child ejecting from their seat.I use the Uppababy Cruz with my two children. My newborn sits in the carrier while my older son stands on the Ride-Along board (RAB).My newborn is in a car seat and is facing towards the parent who is pushing the stroller.My older son, while standing on the RAB, likes to hold on the handle bar of the stroller. To be clear, this handle bar is the bar that you use to push the stroller. One day he decided to use the handle bar as a monkey bar and, like a pull-up maneuver, thought it would be fun to swing. This caused a massive weight shift and the entire stroller tipped over. Think of this like a catapult and my newborn was in the catapult's basket.We are extremely fortunate that my newborn was securely fastened to her car seat and was not catapulted out. If she was not fastened, and just sitting inside the car seat, then she would had flown out. She would have hit the ground. My warning to other parents is to always make sure your child is buckled in when you have someone on the RAB. I do see some parents sit their child without buckling because either it's too hot outside or the stroller is intended to be stationary.And locking the wheels does not change the pivot point of the stroller catapult nor would locking the wheels prevented the weight imbalance. I hope this helps someone.
