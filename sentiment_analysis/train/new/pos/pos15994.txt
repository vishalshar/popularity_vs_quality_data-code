I will just list the pros and the cons (my opinion, of course):Pros:folds very small and comes with a carrying pouch (which I never use because the cover stays folded once you fold it)windproofwater resistant ( resistant doesn't mean proof! but so far that has been good enough for us- and we get lots of rain)velcro and ties as well as smocked front to keep the cover stay put.Cons:The velcro and the ties.the velcro in the back is too short. every time I pull on one side (for one reason or another) the other side just comes apart- longer velcro strips would fix that , or an entirely wider back panel wouldn't cause such tension. stronger wind gets in at the back as well but doesn't really do much harm; it's just bothersome that this also causes the strips to loose grip.the ties. as the word says you have to tie them. multiply that by four and it gets harder. But having to get baby in and out makes it downright enerving to do it- because now you're doing the whole thing 2 or more times depending on how often you have to stop somewhere.I will acually attach some velcro strips onto the ties to make this faster.The lightweight fabric of this cover and the stylish look most definitely outweigh the cons. Best one I've owned so far.The ties and short velcro strips are the reason for the one missing star.Other than that it is great.
