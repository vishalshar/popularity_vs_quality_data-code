Despite the multiple negative reviews I think these plastic pants work quite well. I don't think they run big because my almost 11 month old has been wearing them for a little while now and he is 22 pounds. He wears size 12 months and he probably is the size of a one year old. People also complained of the sound or being "too loud". People they are waterproof plastic pants. They are gonna to sound like that. To me it doesn't matter as long as they don't leak! And in my experience they don't. The only thing I've come to realize is you can't dry these in the dryer and if you do dry it on low or delicate because they will melt and wear down quicker and then get holey and you'll have to throw them away. Mistake on my part but now I know. Overall they are great and fulfill their purpose. I would only suggest price comparison because they are cheaper elsewhere.
