I love this carrier. I use it almost every day. It's super simple to put on and take off and my daughter loves it. This carrier was the most comfortable one I tried on in the store and it also fits my husband perfectly.My daughter loves to be held close all the time, but that makes it hard to get errands and housework done. This carrier is the perfect solution. The carrier padding is very soft and machine washable (a wonderful feature as my daughter tends to spit up a lot).My only complaint is that the straps do tend to slip so I have to readjust them a lot. This is not a big hassle though, the straps tighten easily and I've gotten so used to doing this that I don't even think about it anymore.Overall, this carrier was a wise investment. We have especially enjoyed using it at baseball games and in movie theaters.
