This is a great booster.  It was easily assembled and my daughter loves the pink and the cup holders.  The only negative is that the seat belt comes out of the positioner each time we unbuckle (never when driving) so I have to put it back in each time.  That's not something my daughter can do on her own yet, so I have to buckle her in.  (Honestly, I would anyway at her age, but maybe not a year from now!)
