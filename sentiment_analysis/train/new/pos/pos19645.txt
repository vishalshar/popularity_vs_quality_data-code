I highly recommend the purchase of this bag for anyone who owns a sit'n'stroll.  The bag is mesh with a solid, reinforced, rectangular bottom, and has roughly the same volume as a paper grocery bag.  It attaches to the stroller handle with a strong Velcro strap that doubles as one of two carry handles when the bag is off the stroller; two small elastic loops attach the bottom of the bag to the back of the stroller.  It folds very flat and is easy to cram into an overstuffed suitcase; it could also work as a stealth "personal item" (bet the beady-eyed TSA people wouldn't count it as an additional bag if it were attached to the stroller when you rolled past them) when you fly.  It would be nice if there were a flap or zipper to close it at the top but all in all it's definitely a handy accessory.However, I should note that you can't collapse the stroller into a car seat while this bag is attached; you have to take it off first.
