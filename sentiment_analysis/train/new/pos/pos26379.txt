This bag is perfect for the days my handbag isn't enough but the regular, big backpack is too much. Yesterday I used it for the first time and stuffed it on purpose, but sometimes I'd forget I was carrying it with me, it's super comfortable !Shipping was incredibly fast, I purchased on May 29th, it was shipped a few hours later and arrived on the 31 !! Love it.The only thing is that finishing could be better, it arrived full of loose ends, but nothing a pair of scissor can't fix :)
