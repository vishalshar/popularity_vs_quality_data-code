Living in NYC, I haven't used the infant car seat in a car but a handful of times, so this was vital to use when running around with my son in the carseat attached to the stroller. Fits perfectly over my Britax B-Safe. It seals in heat well enough to only need a hat, sweater and maybe a light blanket. Most importantly it blocks the wind unlike draping a blanket over the top and constantly adjusting it from blowing off. I also really like the velcro'd hole in the middle. Easy for slipping my hand in to pop back in the pacifier, for example, or to let some air in if he seems hot. Note though: I don't leave this on him when indoors, I open it up otherwise he'd get quite warm.
