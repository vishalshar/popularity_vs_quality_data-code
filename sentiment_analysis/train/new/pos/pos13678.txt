Worked pretty good. I saw results pretty quick with little application. I was like, "Great, cuz that little thing is expensive and I dont wanna buy more." So depending on the size and depth of the stretch mark, you'll probably need to buy 2 more (max). Because seriously its that good. I still have more, bought it last month and received the week after. I only applied it morning and night for, I think a week straight, and started falling off..my stretch marks are minimal, dont judge me (on my love handles, butt and inner thighs) I applied it on my love handles haha. And  its like its gone, no lie. 10 bucks suck, but its worth it.
