I'm so happy that these fleece liners have solved my son's diaper rash problem. We started cloth diapering and noticed that the moisture from the prefolds was making him have a rash. We were told to try laying a thin piece of fleece over the top (touching his skin) and it worked great!!I would recommend not drying these for longevity. We just lay them out to air dry.I'm a bit irritated that they liners are getting a bad rap from so many reviewers on here. I notice people writing that "they don't absorb" etc. etc. That's not what they're made for!! It's very clear in the description. I feel like many of these reviewers do not understand cloth diapering. You should be using a soaker or doubler NOT a thin fleece liner if you are looking for added absorbancy. These fleece liners are ONLY for clearing up diaper rash because fleece naturally wicks away moisture. And I'd much rather use these than cutting up my own fleece because fleece in the fabric store is going to have dyes in it. I do not want those dyes touching my son's private areas!! These liners add protection from moisture without adding bulk. At night, we lay one right over the top of a hemp insert. I highly recommend this product!
