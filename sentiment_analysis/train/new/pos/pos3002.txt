The Juppy is such a simple idea, I wish I would have thought of it!  It does exactly what it says- helps infants learn to walk with your aid but without your back pain. My daughter is nearly 9 months old and is off-the-charts large.  It still zips up and has some room for her to grow (but not room for her to be uncomfortable). My husband is 6'4" and can use it at it's most extended setting without bending down (but with his arms only slightly bent).  The bag and small size make it possible for me to tote it in our diaper bag wherever we go.Beware if you use a bouncer- your infant will need to get a bit used to the Juppy.  It only takes a little practice and a bit of patience to help your baby learn the difference.  My daughter loves the freedom it gives her.  At 9 months, she's pulling up on stuff, but having difficulty maintaining her balance.  I believe the Juppy is helping her to figure out the mechanics of walking.I recommend this as a nice aid to their transition to walking.
