My wife and I debated cloth diapering for many months as we were preparing for our baby girl to be born.  Ultimately we decided to go with pre-folds along with Snappi's and various diaper covers.  I had read one review that said she did not end up using the Snappis because the diaper cover would hold the prefold in place so the Snappis were redundant.  I initially bought into this idea but had already purchased the Snappis so I figured I would give them a shot and boy am I glad that I had already purchased them!  While theoretically it would "work" not using the Snappis with prefolds and only using the diaper cover to hold the prefolds in place, I am now confident you would be looking at BLOW-OUT CITY if you chose to do this!  Anytime we have issue with excrement escaping the prefolds (which is fairly rarely) it is typically because we did not tighten the part of the diaper between the babies legs enough with the bottom "T" of the Snappi which keeps the prefold firmly "sealed" around each of the babies legs.  In conclusion, our parents and grandparents would have KILLED for a packet of Snappis back in the day before disposable diapers!
