The battery for our Summer Infant Baby Monitor had been on the fritz for quite some time before we finally decided to replace it. This battery is rated at 1800mAH, which is significantly more than the standard 1100mAH battery that came with the unit.So far, the battery has performed flawlessly. We get much less static on the monitor than before and can have the monitor running for MANY hours before needing to be recharged!
