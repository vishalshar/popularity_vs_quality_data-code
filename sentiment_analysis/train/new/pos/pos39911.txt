With all of the different reviews and experiences people had with this, I was extremely skeptical of buying it. But the customers that wrote the good reviews had me sold and I am so glad I went with their opinion as opposed to the ones that complained about how difficult it was.If you're looking for a one-time use, with cheap material and minimal work, then yes, you should probably go to Ikea. This product didn't come with a days amount of work, but it came with enough pieces that made me believe I was building something sturdy enough for my daughter  to use now and a couple more years to come.Everything lined up. No chips. No bad paint jobs. No missing pieces---in fact, they sent me extra pieces. Maybe I got one of the good batches...?
