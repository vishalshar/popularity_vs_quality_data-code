A lap pad? What? Were these originally supposed to be like burp clothes for your lap? Obviously, I don't actually know what the intended use it for these, but like more other people, I love these for use on the changing table. When I originally purchased them, I was afraid they wouldn't be very absorbent. But I ordered them anyway, just incase. Our little man has soaked them a few times ( as well as the wall... ) and they don't soak through. I usually end up changing the pad underneath anyway as the spray usually lands outside of the perimeter of these, so 80% of the time they keep me from having to change everything, 100% would be better. I really would love it if they were bigger, hence, the four stars. Otherwise these are quite nice to have. I even have to say they wash really nicely too. We've had some number 2 accidents and spills on these, and they have never stained.All in all they are great - just need to be bigger!
