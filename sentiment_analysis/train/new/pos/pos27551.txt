I first bought the SafeFit mirror, and was not pleased with it.  I bought this mirror because of the remote.  I have a Ford Freestyle with a headrest in the middle, so it fit perfectly and does not block my view.  I bought a mirror, so she would have something other than a carseat to look at while I'm driving, not so that I could look at her, even though I can see her from my rearview mirror.  I have used it from the passenger seat to see her, and to relocate a pacifier.  What I like about it is that once you turn it on, it stays on.  I don't have to turn it on every five minutes like some toys.  It also has adjustable noise levels, and lights and/or music, but you obviously can't do that from the front seat, so I leave it on the same setting.  I have had no problem with turning it on with the remote, I have it clipped to my sun visor, and it works from there (but the angle is right in my car, I guess).  The only complaint I would have is that the lights are hard to see in the daytime, but she seems entertained by what she sees in the mirror and the music, and at night watches the lights.  It's a little more expensive, but worth the money in my opinion.
