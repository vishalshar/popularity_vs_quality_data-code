Everything about this bag is right: the price, the simplicity, the ease of use. I wanted something basic, not complicated. It fits everything we need and isn't too large to carry around. Others said it was too small, but I've used this to fly with an infant and even included my phone, wallet, and a book with all of her necessities. As an unexpected bonus, it came with its own changing pad.
