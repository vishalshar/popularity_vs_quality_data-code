This was a great gift for my first grandson, after researching baltic amber for many weeks.  The necklace is beautifully handcrafted, my daughter likes it, i think i love it more.  Found if one doesn't work, then perhaps two maybe better?  The first one was a gift (cognac color), and I particularly searched out this one because of the beautiful cherry color in hopes this would be of more help.  The baltic amber is beautiful, and seems to be working (hooray) my grandson isn't freaking out so much!  Thank goodness, the poor thing.....  almost 7 months old now, and born premature.  Thank you so much for this beautiful precious necklace.
