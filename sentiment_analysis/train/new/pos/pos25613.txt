This bag is amazing, is a show stopper! I fell in love right away when I saw it online. The combinations of colors are just beautiful. I was concerned about the bag not closing properly, as I read in other reviews, but I did not care. I bought it almost a $100 off the list price. A pretty sweet deal. I will too, use this diaper bag after it's done with baby duties. I think it will be a great ipad/macbook bag! However, at the price is listed now, I wouldn't have bought it (now it is  almost a hundred $). Don't think twice if you like how it looks, because it is as cool as it shows!
