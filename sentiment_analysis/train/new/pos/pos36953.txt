I ordered this as a replacement infant car seat for my 3 month old, as he LOATHED his older brother's hand-me-down Baby Trend Flex-Loc (which I'm not a fan of, either).Firstly, the color: I almost didn't order this particular seat because of reviews stating that the trim was purple. While it is not blue-blue, it is much closer to a royal blue than purple. I have zero hesitation about putting my son in this seat, nor would I mind putting my daughter (if she exists in the near future) in it.Second, the price is OUTSTANDING. The price I paid is $80-130 cheaper than I've seen on other sites. And free shipping? Love you, Amazon.Safety. After reviewing numerous car seats, this one ranked in the top 5, and has a higher height/weight limit than many others.The SureLatch system. Genius. I literally installed the base properly and securely in less than 1 minute.Canopy/sun shade. Full size? Genius! Just sweet little tootsies show - no more reaching over the seat to adjust while driving!Cushion! The old Flex-Loc was basically a thin piece of fabric over hard plastic. No wonder my Buddha boy hated it (note, my older son was so easy-going, he never minded the Flex-Loc, and it had great safety ratings, so we went with it).Overall, I am super happy with my purchase. Baby boy seems happier, and I hope to regain some sanity by not having to endure crying fits EVERY car ride.Bottom line...BUY IT!
