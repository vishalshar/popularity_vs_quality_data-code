Why is it SO hard to find decent baby towels? They are traditionally really thin and not near big enough. I would say the Frenchie Mini Couture ones are about the best you'll probably be able to find, especially for the price. They're decently soft, and certainly large enough.I just wish they were thicker! I want a thick, luxuriously soft spa-quality towel. Like the kind I have in my own bathroom. Is that so much to ask?
