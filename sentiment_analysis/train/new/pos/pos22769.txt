I got this body support about a week ago and I love it! Not only that, my daughter loves it too. My favorite thing is that the strap covers are small enough for her straps. All the others that I saw were too big for her straps! It keeps her very cozy and she cuddles right into her seat now. Makes the rides in the car much more pleasant when they are comfortable. She is 2 months old now and I wish they had had it when she was born because I definately would have bought it. It is also reversible which I love but I have kept it on the soft side so far. I definately recommend it!
