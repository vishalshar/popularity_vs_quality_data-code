The crib will inevitably make or break your baby's room, because it is a large piece of furniture that becomes the centerpiece of the room.  So even this is our second baby we still decided to go with something nice (our first baby will be using his crib for at least another year).  We had to order the crib from a BabiesRUs store, but it only took a week for them to get it from the warehouse and to call us to come pick it up.  It was very easy to put together and is very sturdy.  Our first crib has one side that goes up and down for putting the baby in, and I was concerned that because this one does not it may not be as convenient.  I now realize that it is not any less convenient, but on the other hand, much more sturdy, because there are less pieces that move around and get loose, needing occasional tightening.The fact that the crib converts to a full size bed means that you don't have to spend more money in two or three years for a bed for your baby, this is a huge plus because we will soon be faced with this dilemma with our first baby.  For our second it is solved!OVERALL this is beautiful piece, very well made, easy to put together and makes the room look light and serene.  Add the bedding of your choice and you have a gorgeous nursery for your baby, with a crib comparable to others costing two and three times what this one does.  Add the fact that it converts to a day bed and to a full size bed later on and your baby girl is all set for years to come!
