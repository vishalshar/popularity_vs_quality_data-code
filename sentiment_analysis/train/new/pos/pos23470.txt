We use this thing everywhere! Since 2.5 months she has really enjoyed sitting in this. We take it to restaurants and she sits with us on the table. We take it outside while we are grilling. She uses it in the kitchen so she can be near me while I do the dishes, cook or clean in there. It really helped me for her to be more mobile and independent, and still be entertained by participating in what I was doing. Its also easy to get clean with just a surface wash.
