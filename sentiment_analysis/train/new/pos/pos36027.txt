This is my first review-ever.  My baby has had acid reflux from day 1-she is 8 months old now.  She HATED naps and I mean would stay up all day to avoid them, and be up all night.  She is a vampire!  I thought I was going to lose my sanity trying to put her down 15 times per day, no use.  I read about this product in the NYT ( I have tried everything else) and I have to say- THANK YOU GOD for this turtle.  My baby isn't super cuddly or amused by much.  How do I know this works?  I turn it on, the music plays, I swaddle her, she cries, but then when she sees turtle in her crib, she reaches out for it and puts her hand on the lights and falls right asleep, to the ocean sounds and music.  It's a miracle, I am serious.  She loves this thing and now has 2 naps per day and sleeps 12 hours per night.  I swore I would never have another kid after the severe sleep deprivation I endured, but now that I know something out there worked for us, like this product, I am considering it.If your child is an insomniac nap-hater, then this Turtle's for you!  We bought the blue one.
