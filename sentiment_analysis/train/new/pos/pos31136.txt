Overall seat is as hoped.  The narower and lower seat width allow for easier access and multiple car seat in my Escape.The seat does not have multiple angle position, so you'll have to use a wedge of some sort if you want to tilt it back.The quick latch which is basically a strap with one quick release latch on each end that attach to your car's anchor support is not as secure as it would if the latch was attached directly to the seat.  So the seat does not secure as tightly to the car as the Britax I had previously.Overall, the quality is better than a Brittax.  If I would have known about this brand, I would have bought the seat (or the other version) when my child was born instead of getting the Brittax
