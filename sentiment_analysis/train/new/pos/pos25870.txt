I bought this (single duvet cover) for my dorm room and I love it! I love the bright colors and the material is nice an soft. My only problem with it is that because it was made in the UK, obviously the size of the cover fits a single bed which is a bit smaller than a Twin XL in America. I am not completely bothered by it but it would be nice if it fit perfectly and my Twin XL comforter didn't bunch up under the duvet cover but I'll just have to make do with what I have (it's still really comfy and you can hardly notice the bunches!). Other than that, it is really nice and if you are planning on buying this for a Twin sized bed instead of a Twin XL, the comforter would probably fit better inside better than it would with the Twin XL comforter.
