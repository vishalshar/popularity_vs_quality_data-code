I originally bought this toy because I wanted a toy labelled for babies under 6 months. I wanted something for my 2-month-old daughter that would be different than a rattle or a teether. She seemed really for an 'actual' toy, but at the same time I didn't want her to have a toy that would potentially harm her, so I stayed away from 6m+ toys. So I found this cute little tree, that she liked very much from the beginning. We first used it by showing her the little animals, then she started squeezing them in her hand and using them as teethers, but very quickly tried to remove the animals from the tree by herself. She started lifting the tree by its handle around age 3-4 months and didn't want to let it go!Now that she is older, she can remove and put them back all by herself, and started using them for some pretend play. Obviously a toy she will cherish for coming months and years.This toy is really the proof than even today, kids and babies can have fun with toys that are not packed with electronics!
