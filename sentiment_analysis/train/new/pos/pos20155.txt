Words do not adequately describe how wonderful these are. I would never trust the retrofit kits that mount to the base of the seats. These are safe and durable and reliable.I still use my convertible car seat and my booster seat like infant portable seats and these make the in and out an absolute breeze. I would spend 3 times as much considering how wonderful they work. I would recommend them over any seat belt on the market for anchoring a car seat.I went through a car seat safety inspection and I was the ONLY one with my seats (two of them) installed. They had been checking for two days and I was the first and it was all due to the idiot-proof-ness of this system and these latches are RUGGED and BUILT to last!  I have washed them, hooked and unhooked them more times than anyone could imagine and there is no trace of wear and tear, not one tiny bit of fraying. And they are a year old.Definitely on my thrilled list.
