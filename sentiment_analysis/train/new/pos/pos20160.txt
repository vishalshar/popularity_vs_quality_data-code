I have had these decals on my sons wall for 3 years now and they are still sticking. The corners and sides peel up a little bit, every now and then, but nothing I can't just push right back down. We even transported these from one house to another when we moved, and they still stuck perfect. I have had other decals that were complete garbage and ripped right away, but these did not. You still have to be very careful when peeling them off the backing though. Overall I think this is a great product and would recommend it to someone looking for a monkey decal. I also love that a decal that says, "monkey" comes with it!!
