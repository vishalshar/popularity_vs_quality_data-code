I am somewhat tall (5'8" female) but I followed the sizing measurements online and it still ended up being small. The body fits great because its soooo baggy and I love it. But the legs are abnormally short (come to mid calf). All in all, worth the money.  Super comfortable,  soft material,  really warm. Also heads up, you shouldn't expect great craftsmanship for this cost,  but it is pretty poorly put together. Cheap zipper, loose threads....still love it.
