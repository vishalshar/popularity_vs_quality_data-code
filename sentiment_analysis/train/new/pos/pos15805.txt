I gave this to my 3 year old daughter for Valentine's Day. Out of all the uses she could use it for, (I suggested toy storage or for her dirty clothes), she has found the most fun using it for hide and seek!Aesthetically it looks a little different from the stock photos. The eyes have a blue color iris followed by a black pupil. There is a small velcro strip just under  where the "head" and "neck" meet, so it can stay closed if using it to hide dirty clothes, or maybe even using it as a present wrapping for another surprise! (I did this with a smaller pig inside.)If you're looking at price comparison and utility with the Bongo Buddy versus the Bongo Buckets, the Bongo Buddy is larger than the largest container you get with the Bongo Buckets and has a closing lid. The Bongo Buckets provide more overall storage. Both are great!
