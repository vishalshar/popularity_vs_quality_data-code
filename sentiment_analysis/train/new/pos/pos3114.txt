I bought this pillow, because I have always been and always will be a back sleeper. Regardless of how many times I went to sleep on my side, I always woke up flat on my back, and now that I'm well into the third trimester, I knew it was time to do something about that. My problem is that when I lie on my side, I get horrible cramps in my thighs and hips and end up on my back to get the pressure off of them. I searched for pillows in a number of places, but this was the only one that claimed it supported the lower back (others advertised belly support, which isn't a huge deal to me), so I gave it a try. When I first opened the box, I wasn't too sure about it--it looked very flimsy and small. But after setting it up, it supported me completely! And I even woke up not on my side once, but the wonderful thing about the design of this pillow is that even when I get all the pressure off my hips and thighs, it keeps me at an angle, so I'm never actually flat on my back. But the majority of the time, the back support side supplied enough firm support that I was comfortable on my side without putting pressure on my thighs and hips. I love this pillow and wish I had bought it 27 weeks ago, when I first found out I was pregnant. But instead, I bought a full body pillow, which although was comfy to sleep on, provided no support but in front and was large and cumbersome. This wedge pillow is supportive, but takes up just enough space. It's wonderful and a huge comfort for back sleepers.
