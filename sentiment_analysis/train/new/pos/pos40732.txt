Great for kids who cannot tilt a traditional sippy cup.  My 10 month old took to it immediately.  Just a word to those who are having trouble putting the cup together.  It takes practice but works.  The straw is in three pieces.  You must insert the soft part of the straw into the lid before connecting the other two plastic straw attachments.  The only problem is that some liquid can stay in the straw and my daughter has learned to flick it.
