I was looking for inexpensive bottles that would fit with my Medela breast pump and could be used to feed my infant as well as store breastmilk. These bottles fit the bill. They are cost effective and work very well as feeding and storage bottles, they also fit with the Nuk orthodontic nipples which I use and I can say I am satisfied with them. Great product!
