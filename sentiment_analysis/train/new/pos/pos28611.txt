We have been through just about every stroller there is!  Since there are no local stores to find these higher end strollers where we live, we have ordered several different strollers from Peg Perego, Maclaren, Stokke, and Mamas Papas.  Needless to say, they all went back!  We finally ordered the Bee.  We love it!  Has all the features of a full size stroller in a nice compact stroller.Reversible SeatHuge CanopyPushes literally with one fingerFull reclineDecent size basketAdjustable handleReally padded seat for babyFolds almost by itself!We love it and would highly recommend..  FYI - the Maxi Cosi car seat adapters work with the Cybex Aton as well.
