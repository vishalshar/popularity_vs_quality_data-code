I searched long and hard for stickers for my son's bedroom. I was afraid to waste money on stickers that would just fall off. I am pleased with these stickers. Some have lifted a slight bit at the edges... but only where I didn't wash the wall before installation. I had washed the walls and installed most of the decals before my son was here, but finished after he arrived. I was too lazy to wash the walls once he was here so I just stuck the stickers up. There is a difference between lazy and proper installation :-)The room looks great and I love the fact that I can peel them off instead of re wallpapering or re painting when he is old enough to want a new look.
