Absolutely love this wrap!!!1. Fits great2. Easier and faster to put on than moby or other wraps3. Holds baby comfy and tight4. Hands free nursing5. Helps baby fall asleep6. Easy to take baby out and keep asleep7. Love the pocket to hold keys, wallet, cash8. Padded shoulder is a must have and super comfortable!9. Obsessed with the bright fun colors, get tons of complimentsI use this wrap everywhere from home to the store, and keep with me on walks to keep baby happy and pull her out of stroller when needed.Have been able to use so far from birth to 4 months.I recommend also getting a structured carrier (infantino is my fav for small baby so far) that dad can use and that is good for wearing for long periods of time and front carrying.Tip: the shoulder pad feels best pulled onto the side of shoulder versus closer to the neck. This holds baby tighter to you and feels more secure.
