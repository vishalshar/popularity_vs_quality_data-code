as the only option i found that was lead/latex/bad chemical free option, i bought this even though it did not have stellar reviews. Turns out, for us, this mat is great!  It was smelly out of the tube, but we just let it air out in the bathroom with the fan on for a week, and the smell is mostly gone. We're using the mat in our metal kitchen sink (also known as "the baby bath"), and all the suction cups worked great, on the bottom and up the sides, for good cushion. The little man not only didn't slide into the water or bump his head, but he even had enough traction to pull himself up to standing with some help from the dish rack.  The little toys are cute, but too hard for the little man to grab right now. Soon though, and he certainly tried to get them.
