We had better luck with this one than with our first one two years ago. That one never tied onto /attached to the crib well and I had to get creative and yet it still always hangs at a slant allowing the things on the "sheld" to slide off easily. But we still make do with that one on my son's crib. We got a new one for my newborn's crib and this one is nice and sturdy and makes me want to purchase another to replace our son's falling apart one. The one with the green trimming is the old dilapidated one that has always been mishappen and not easy to keep hanging. The brown was is much sturdier and clearly newly improved!
