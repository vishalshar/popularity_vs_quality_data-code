My son is finally at an age where toys really interest him. He tries to reach for anything that grabs his attention. I bought this set as I hoped it had a little bit of everything in case he gets bored of one particular item we just switch to another. I really like the variety in this box.Before handing any of these to my son, I made sure I washed them in warm water with mild "kid safe" soap. The only drawback was that, while soaking in water, some of these toys got water in them. I had to get a blowdryer to dry the water (and dampness) out. Beware the camera on this package has a battery which I mistakenly soaked in water.My baby is enjoying the vivid colors and interesting sounds this set has to offer.
