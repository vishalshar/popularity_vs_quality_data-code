A must have!! I researched many bouncers before buying this one and I am so glad I did! It is so easy to customize and switch up what my baby plays with so she doesn't get bored. I can put toys within her reach and by her feet. I bought a crib piano to attach near her feet since she is quite the kicker and loves music, and a toy bar she likes to reach for to play and bring to her mouth. Getting her in and out is a breeze since the arches just move in and out of the way. It has both a reclining and sitting position. And I really like the colors. The crab is a great toy and not annoying at all! (The train sounds it makes goes with the team on the fabric, just look!)
