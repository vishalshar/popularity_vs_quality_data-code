I got this for my 10 months old (was 7 months old when she first got it), she took to it like a pro! Before getting this one, I had her tried some other soft spout sippy cup and all she did was chew on it and got water everywhere! Didn't quite get any water into her mouth, but it was all over her....After searching around a bit, I decided to get her a hard spout and hope that that would prevent her from chewing and will actually be able to get to drink the water. And it works! She still try to chew on the spout, but she is able to suck on it and drink without much trouble.The only thing I didn't like about this is I find the handle really hard to take off and assemble. I always take off the handle to wash because water gets between it and the cup, and who knows what other food particle got in there too. I like my kids' sippy cups to be CLEAN! I seem to always have to struggle with taking the handles off and then couldn't figure out which way to put it back in. In the end, I just left it out.4 STARS, minus 1 star because of the hard to take off handle. Will definitely buy again.
