Oh my word, this is the best invention EVER! My kids are so picky with the foods they eat.  Mac-n-cheese is a staple in our home and I have spent years trying to figure out how to send it to school with my kids.  Well, this Thermos food jar is the answer to all my problems!  It keeps hot food hot for 5+ hours!!  Enough time for me to heat my child’s meal in the morning and have it still be hot for them at lunch time. Also, cold items stay cold for 7+ hours!  The thermos is very durable too.  The price seems high at first, but when you realize how much of a lifesaver it is, you won’t bat an eye at the price!  I would highly recommend this to anyone with school aged children. I have already purchased additional ones for family and friends.As an Amazon Prime member, I rely heavily on reviews to make informed purchases so I hope you found this helpful.
