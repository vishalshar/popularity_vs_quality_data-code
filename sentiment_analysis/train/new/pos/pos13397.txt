When my daughter was born she loved to be wrapped up in this and stuck in the Ergo. Well, let's be real- she hated the actual process of wrapping her in this. But once she was in the Ergo, she would fall asleep (some days that was the only way) right away. Once she was asleep, we could take her out of the Ergo, but leave her in this insert and put her down and she wouldn't wake up.I do wish the button on the side was sturdier- a lot of times it would pop open before we got her in the Ergo. But we loved everything else. And the print is cute but not so girly that my husband disliked carrying it around. The only other con is that the insert makes it even sweatier to use the Ergo, but once we figured out she wouldn't wake up in the insert we were sweating a lot less!
