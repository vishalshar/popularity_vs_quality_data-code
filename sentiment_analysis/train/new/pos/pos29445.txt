I first purchased a multi-colored necklace and did not see any improvement. I contacted the seller and she was very helpful and explained that the raw form and lighter in color necklaces have been known to be more effective.  My son has been wearing this necklace for 3 months now.  He has had several teeth and molars come through that I found in his mouth!  We have not had to use Motrin or Tylenol for teething since he has been wearing this necklace.  The only complaint I have is it is a little too long, so he tends to play with it and put it in his mouth (when measured it was 13.5 inches).  I have taken the necklace off 3 times to see if it made a difference and every time he became fussy.  I was skeptical at first, but am now convinced!
