This is the 2nd set I've purchased. (The dog unfortunately destroyed the first set.) They're very soft and can slide right up the car seat straps so my baby doesn't get red marks in his neck anymore from the tight straps. Easy to remove and put back on with the velcro attached. Very cute dog faces, too.
