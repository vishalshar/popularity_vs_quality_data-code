So my son just turned 7 1/2 months and hes a big boy plus he was starting to get very unconfortable in his infant carseat he wanted to sit up not lay back so i was looking at a whole bunch of carseats and came across this one. i read a lot of the reviews and all tht i read was positive so i figure id give it a try so i did.. it came and i loved it very comfy  he seems to realy like it . easy instalation and all its rear facing now and its perfect for my toyota venza! i would really recommend this carseat love it love it also a really GREAT PRICE!
