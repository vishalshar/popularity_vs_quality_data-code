Had a baby late July 2013 and as a father this is one of the big things I was stressing about buying.  I'm a little tecky and wanted something my wife could walk around with and keep an eye on the kid and something I could use on my smart phone.  I looked at everything made baby monitor wise and home security wise and was shocked to see that the technology was not quite where it should be for 2013 then I came across this.  With no reviews I took a leap of faith and am glad I did.  The handheld device works great and has a pretty good range depending on the location of the camera.  Baby can be in the living room and I can almost make it to the end of my property without loosing the signal.  The PIX quality is good, even when in zoom move. The motion record will fill up a 4GB card quickly (I turned off this function).  I do get static on the handheld but it's not bad at all.  Setup was easy.  I almost mounted it in the babies room but I'm glad I didn't.  The camera had a few hour battery life to it so the camera can move from room to room which has been GREAT!!!!!  I wanted something that you could talk threw (not an option on this) but my friends sound BAD and I have found it really wasn't needed for us.  I also wanted a camera that would pan and this camera also does not do that.  You do have to have the handheld device on the charging base (base has the internet connection) and turned on to be able to view on a smart phone or iPad.  This is a little bummer as I have to call the wife and see if she can set it up so I can view from work.  They should Bluetooth this down the road to fix this problem.  But you DON'T have to have it plugged into the internet to make the handheld work.  Any how hope this was helpful and you and your family enjoy it as much as we do.
