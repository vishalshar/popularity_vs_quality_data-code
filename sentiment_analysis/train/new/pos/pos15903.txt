I ordered these for my daughter who just had a new baby. He tuned out to be a bit of a spit upper...so we were always using burp clothes and anything that we could grab fast.. We were using so many a day and they are expensive and decorative and not so thick. We are thrilled with using these preemie pre-folds for burp clothes..they are smaller than others, so not too big for shoulder, they are thick and super absorbent and they are very reasonably priced. If we had a preemie, I would definitely also recommend them for diapers!! We do use cloth diapers, but our boy was almost 11 lbs. at birth, so no preemie for sure!
