Oh my goodness how stinking cute are these?!  Once my son started to crawl I wanted to get something that would be easier on his knees while he was on the hard floor. Also living in Colorado it obviously gets freezing cold and I just throw these on under my sons pants to help keep him extra warm. Shipping did take longer then I would have hoped but I was aware that it was going to take a while. The leg warmers them selves don't stay up on my little mans thighs as well as I wish they would but that could definitely be because he is on the lower side of the weight/height scale. The material is soft and stretchy, perfect for a baby. The material seems to be very sturdy even after multiple washes. The color is still vibrant and the footballs are just so stinking cute. It was nice to finally find a cute accessory for a baby boy.
