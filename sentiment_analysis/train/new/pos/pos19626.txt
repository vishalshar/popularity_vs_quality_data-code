These bibs are adorable and 2 of them have robots, one green with robots and one blue with robots and one is solid blue. Each bib has a pocket at the bottom to catch food.I bought these bibs for the stroller because I give our baby a fresh pear or other fruit or veggie snack on our daily walks and baby makes a mess since he is still learning about foods.Before the bibs food would go all over the stroller and his outfit and just make an awful mess.  Now the pocket on these bibs helps contain some of the mess and the fact that it is sleeveless makes it convenient for his arms to move freely without feeling restricted.  The bibs are a thinner plasticy material and the back of them is a solid white, which makes it easy to determine which side is the right side.I honestly believe these bibs will last our baby throughout his infancy through to toddler hood and definitely for quite a while!Again: *Yes, each bib has a pocket*.The second and third bib's pocket just has to be flipped over when you receive them.  The instructions are on the back of the cardboard attachment if you need instructions to know how to flip over a pocket on a bib.  I took pictures of this for any one who is interested.Oh, by the way, I bought these sleeveless bibs because I had purchased the Frenchie's long sleeve pocket bibs for our baby to use at his high chair and since those seemed to work well I figured I would give these a go because I definitely di not want something thicker or too unmovable for the stroller.Good Luck
