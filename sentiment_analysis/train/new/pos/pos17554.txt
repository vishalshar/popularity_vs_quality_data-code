I travel from Texas to LA frequently with just myself and my daughter, who is 23 lbs at 2 years old. We started out with a river rock green one at birth and purchased this one as summer was coming and more travel came up. It's much easier to travel an airport the size of Dallas-Fort-Worth (huuuge!) to the standard size of LAX with my little girl cradled in this than in a bulky stroller. I just have to remove her shoes and I can carry her through security without a fuss. Much easier than if I had her in a stroller, I can board the plane, and get off the plane with carry on's easy peasy! My daughter prefers to be facing me in this carrier vs. the hip or back carry, but this bad boy is used DAILY in our home. From me, to her grandpa, everyone has worn it with her to calm teething, not feeling good, separation anxiety, and general clingyness while other things needed to get done. It's also been great to calm her down and get her to nap, or get her back to sleep in the middle of the night after a nightmare. We use it for Zoo trips, hikes, walking down to the beach, aquarium trips... anywhere you would normally DREAD bringing a stroller, we carry the ergo and get along just fine!
