Perfect for our breastfed baby! We did try Dr. Brown's first but our baby had issues latching onto the nipple because it was longer and thinner than the Avent Natural Nipple. We had to use a bottle from the very beginning and our baby had no issues switching back and forth between the bottle and being breastfed.Watch the sizes! Most of the bottles start off with Newborn flow (0m+) which is a size 1 nipple, but this was too fast for our newborn and he was always choking on the milk so we had to order new nipples.Just as a reference:First flow, Size 0Newborn Flow, Size 1 (0m+)Slow Flow, Size 2 (1m+)Medium Flow, Size 3 (3m+)Fast Flow, Size 4 (6m+)Variable Flow, for thicker liquids (3m+)I don't really pay attention to the recommended ages that are on the nipples. I find it a little confusing and it doesn't really work for my baby. He's currently 3 months and just started on the Newborn Flow Size 1 nipple.
