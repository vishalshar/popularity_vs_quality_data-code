My daughters lunch box ripped & we needed to get her a new one.  She loves littlest pet shop & picked this one out on Amazon.com.  I was a bit nervous that the picture on the lunch box might be different than the one online but we were very happy when the lunch box arrived & the picture was exactly as shown.  We are very pleased with it & so far it has held up very well! My daughter loves it!
