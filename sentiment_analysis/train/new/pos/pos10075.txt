I carry it with me whenever I go out with baby.The two top chambers can fit up to 4 scoops of formula powder. Ithink the bottom can fit 5. But I maily use the larger bottom chamber for snack/crackers/cheerios but you can definitely put formula or baby rice cereal in there as well. Each chamber comes with a sealing lid. This is to keep the bottom of the chamber above from getting dirty. I don't really use the sealing lids since the formula powser and cheerios don't make much of a mess. But they are there if you need them.When going out on short trips, I can just screw on 1 or two chambers and fill them with what I need. You don't have to use all three.Great seal between the chambers. Cheerios stay fresh and crunchy for days. Dispenses easily and all the contents come out. No wasted formula with this dispenser and I have never spilled or made a mess. This has also gone in my steam sterilizer over and over and holding up great.I would recoomend this product.
