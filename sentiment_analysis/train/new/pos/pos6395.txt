I bought this stroller to take on short trips when I don't want to drag the big stroller around with me and it is a great stroller! I love the feature where you can have the back be mesh for summer time or be covered in the winter time! The canopy is a great feature as well! I like the fact it has a cup holder too! The only thing about this stroller is that if you are over 5'4" I would not buy it as it will be too short and uncomfortable for someone taller than that to push! It does really well on our gravel roads when we go for walks as well, but this stroller is definitely for older babies that can sit up well on their own.  My baby will fall asleep in it from time to time but doesn't necessarily look that comfortable! It is very light weight and folds up to be small so it's easy to haul in a small car or SUV and store! Mine fits right in the corner of the closet! Otherwise it is a great buy! And it looks nice too! I have had several people ask me where I got mine!
