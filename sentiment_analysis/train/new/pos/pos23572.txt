Eating meals with our 15 month old son can be quite messy.  When dining out, or when eating at friend's or family we needed a way to reduce the mess and also limit his food from getting dirty.  We briefly tried place-mats, but they would not stay in place and before long he was eating food right off of restaurant tables which might not have been thoroughly cleaned.  My lovely sister (who is now a mom of three) introduced us to disposable place-mats.  We were reluctant at first - because it seems wasteful to frequently throw away a plastic sheets, so I was extremely pleased when I discovered these Table Toppers which are bio-degradable.  Even the plastic bag that holds the table toppers is environmentally friendly!A paper insert states that they are made from "a revolutionary new additive that enables them to fully bio-degrade in as little as 9 months to 5 years!"  It goes on to say that there are no toxic byproducts and the polyethylene film breaks apart and is completely "eaten" by microorganisms which are present in the waste stream - even working in landfills.  "The plastic simply degrades into an inert 'humus' that is actually beneficial to the environment and conductive to plant growth."It is very nice to know that while they will be thrown away quite frequently, they are not damaging to the environment.We received one package that holds all 60 Table Toppers - which is surprisingly compact.  I appreciate that it has a zipper top to ensure that all of the Table Toppers stay inside even when it is tossed about inside our diaper bag.  (Although the zipper seal can be extremely difficult to open without ripping the plastic bag.)The mats do have adhesive on all 4 sides, and thankfully they stick near enough to the edge that there is not much of a lip for our son to pull on.  The mats stay in place perfectly and do not leave any residue when they are removed.  They work well and are very affordable - coming it at about 22 cents each ($12.99 / 60).
