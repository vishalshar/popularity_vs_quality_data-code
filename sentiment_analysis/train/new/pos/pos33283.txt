I thought this product was pretty handy, and it works great. However, for me it just wasn't practical. It was much easier to put in some pre-made baby food into my baby bag than it was to take this out and use it while like out at dinner or something. And of course I didn't use it much at home as I would make my own baby food in the blender in mass quantities so I used that instead. Even though this is a great idea and concept, I didn't get as much use out of it as I thought I would. That being said, it is a great little product that works exactly the way it says it should, it is handy and small and fits easily in your diaper bag.
