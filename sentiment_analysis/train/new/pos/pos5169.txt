The actual size is now 11" x 14" inches vs the original size suppose to be 12" x 16". BTW, It does not mention the layer (eg: 4x6x4, 4x8x4...etc.) I can only guess that it is the 4x6x4 version. Oh well...BTW, if this is your first baby, I recommend ordering Three Size1 6-pack (total 18 diaper). We have 2 dozen of size1 and it became too small for our 2-month old boy. We just ordered 2 dozen of Premium size, hopefully it last (will update here). BTW, the quality between Premium and Regular are the same but Premium is a bit larger.I'm very happy with the quality of these diapers. The problem is the shipping cost go up and down. In the past 2 months I have seen Free Shipping twice for all sizes. Then the rest of the time cost $10 or plus per dozen(ridiculously high). Finally I was lucky to order it with free shipping today. I'm putting down the price and size diff below for those who has time to wait for price drop. Of course if you are in a hurry, get it now. Cloth diaper will save parent a fortune. We once changed 24 diapers a day for our baby, he is always clean and happy. That worth every penny to us.
