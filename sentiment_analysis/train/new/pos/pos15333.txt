This is super soft and cute.  I got it for my 4 year old son to go with his new "big kid" car seat and he loves it.  I was hoping the little pouch would hold his sunglasses, but it's just a little too small for that.  It is handy for tissues we found out since he has been sick this past week.  It does say it's reversible and the inside has a cute material that is not plush.  It says it's for summer time use, but since this is pretty light weight and not bulky at all I don't see the plush side being a problem during the summer.  The inside also does not have a pouch.  Overall, It is perfect for what I was looking for.  If you are looking for something to double as a pillow this is not it.
