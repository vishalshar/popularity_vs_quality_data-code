I really like this highchair.  I bought it  for two reasons--one it matches my decor and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.  I cannot stand all those baby prints!  Secondly it folds remarkably flat, which, admittedly, we haven't done, but I don't think its that big of a deal since it blends in so well! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the footrest seems to be only for looks.  My daughter is only 6 months, but the way it is recessed I don't believe she will ever be able to make use of it.  I'm sure this is a drawback of it being able to fold down so slim.  I also really like that it is  on wheels, and the seat cover is a soft, plastic that is easy to wipe down and keep clean, yet soft and comfortable for her to sit in.  I haven't had a big enough mess to have to wash it in the washing machine yet, but it looks as though it will wash well.  I also recommend purchasing the optional mix 'n move toys that will fit on the tray--they are more entertaining to her that I would have thought, and they don't end up  on the floor all of the time!
