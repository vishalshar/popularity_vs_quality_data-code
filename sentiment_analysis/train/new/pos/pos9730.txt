I have bought two other CR Gibson Baby Memory Books. Both of them have the same binding as this one. I have opened & closed my books a hundred times or better over the past Five years, and they are holding up just fine. As with any book that is bound, eventually it will loosen some but just take care of them, dont abuse them, and dont let the kids play with them and they will last. I plan on buying this one for my third child. Also, I dont recommend a cheap ballpoint ink pen for writing in these books - it will smear and make a mess and stick to opposite pages. Invest in a good writing pen.
