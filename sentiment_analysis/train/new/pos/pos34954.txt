I really like the concept & how cute the duck is and because its so bright I can find it in my bag very easily. The only thing I would change is the size of the bags, they are very large & it feels very wasteful to use such a huge bag to throw 1 little newborn diaper away & it wouldn't be very hygienic to save the bag until it's full either! I only use them if I absolutely need it & am somewhere were I cannot just toss the diaper in the trash. All in all still a good purchase & good to have around as a just in case item.
