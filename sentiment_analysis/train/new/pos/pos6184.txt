My 3 year old constantly disables just about any "child-proofing" we can throw at him (I think he likes the challenge) but these have held up so far. After moving in to a new home with gas fireplaces we knew we had to do something to protect the light switch that controls it. Immediately after installing the cover he ran over to it and tried to figure it out (including hanging on the switch for a few seconds before losing his grip). Once he realized it wasn't going to be as easy as the others he lost interest and went off to play with a toy. I'm honestly surprised that he hasn't come back to it.I can see where this could lose it's effectiveness over constant use but because it's on a fireplace we will only need a few months out of the year it should do fine.
