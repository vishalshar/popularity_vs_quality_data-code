I looked many hours between this one and the In-Step Safari. I chose this one because it looked slimmer and I liked the longer canopy for my children. I was glad I chose this one.I LOVE THIS STROLLER!!! It fits trough the door of my house as well as through stores. Just not through aisles, as is the case with all side by side double strollers. The canopy is great. It covers all of the kids except their feet, which is expected. It's extremely light weight, easy to fold and maneuver. I love the red/black check pattern. Other reviews talk about the seats reclining at an awkward angle, however, it appears that the angle is no different than any other jogging stroller. It makes it so you can run and know that the kids are going anywhere from those seats. The cushions are cushy and personally, my kids look very cozy together in this stroller. I have a 3 year old and 7 month old boys. The only negative is that the black handle, while being very soft, tears easily from stored on the ground, as the stroller folds in half, and sits on the handle. I bought the schwinn double stroller storage bag for under $40.00 to further protect it. Overall, I would pick this one again. Also, it has an awesome compartment with zippers and sort on the handle for water, keys, wallet, cell phone, etc. It's everything you need in a stoller.
