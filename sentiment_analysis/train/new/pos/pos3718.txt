My baby is so long that she outgrew this quickly, but it was a compact and inexpensive solution for travel and day trips.  I added a waterproof pad to add more plushness, but it's handy for naps at all-day outdoor venues, for the pool, etc.  It also afforded a little privacy when changing her diapers and corraling her gear while we were in the pool.  It was fine for overnight stays at hotels (and before baby could turn over), but I'd either use the hotel crib or pack a portable playard for longer trips.  The mobile arch was handy for draping a thin blanket to block out light.
