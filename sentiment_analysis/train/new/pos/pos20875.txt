They don't make anything like I'd imagine a fantastic dad's diaper bag should be.  Wanted something you'd see Clint Eastwood carrying on a horse.  Every diaper bag out there either looks like a women's handbag, or a diaper bag.This was really cool, but fell a little short on function.  For the money, expected just a little bit more.It is nice material, not like the cowhide you'd get on a real tool belt, but a fabric facsimile.  Everyone liked the novelty of it, but after a few trips out, it was clear that there was nothing to hold stuff into the bag.  The Avent bottles didn't quite fit into the pockets, or would get stuck on the way out.  Pacifiers would fall right out when the bag tipped over.  Didn't have any of the cool features the other bags had, and wasn't so good looking as to overcome the lacking functionality.If you have the money to spare and think it looks cool, or want to get it as a novelty for someone, it's a really clever bag.  It just fell a bit short on usefulness.  For 20 or 30 bucks this would have been a keeper.Wish they made a bag so cool you'd want to use it after the baby was big.  Or so functional you would take it to the office when it's not carting diapers.We ended up returning it to use the Columbia and Jeep bags people gave us.  Guess you're just not allowed to have a kid and be cool.
