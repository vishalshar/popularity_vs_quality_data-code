This stroller is lightweight, easy to collapse and expand, and most of all is safe for my son. The only gripe I have is that the red foot brake cover popped off within the first time of using it. I figured after spending a good  amount of money on this stroller, things would remain in tact. Other than that, I have no complaints.
