We needed a crib for our first grand baby.  A portable crib seemed like the way to go.  As a crib , this one is not as "portable" as one would like.  Taking it down to transport requires a bit of disassembly.  However, when the baby gets older and we use the crib as a playpen, it will be much more convenient to collapse and use.  Another warning about this product is the "new" smell.  There is a strong plastic odor when the crib is first opened.  We set up ours a few weeks before the baby arrived to give it time to air out.  Overall, the quality is good and the utility meets our needs.
