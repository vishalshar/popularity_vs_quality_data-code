I bought this entertainer to use in my home office to entertain my (then) baby while I got some work done.  It was a fabulous investment. It saved me a bunch of money on baby sitters (the reason I used to justify the expense to my hubby when I first bought it).  He would play and play and play in it.  My son has been a bit small for his age.  For us, this was never a problem.  However, I didn't buy this for him until he was approx 6 mos old.  Younger ones might find this item too overwhelming and too big to use.  If you wait, though, I believe your baby will be happy with this item.One caveat, there was a problem with the item when we first bought it.  (It was missing an item.)  Since it was the last the store had (target) and no one else had it in stock, I called Fisher Price customer service for help.  They were extremely helpful and sent me the replacement, immediately.My son is now over the age of 2 and STILL plays with it.  I, now, have it in another room and am getting ready to put it in storage.  Whenever he gets the chance, he runs over to it and plays for quite a while.I looked at several entertainers before purchasing this one.  I, also, have another circular entertainer leftover from my first son - which I used on the first floor of my home.  However, the Fisher Price Intellitainer exceeds the others in terms use and fun for my son.Oh, and it's pretty easy to take off the seat cover in order to wash it.  (I've had to do that a couple times.)
