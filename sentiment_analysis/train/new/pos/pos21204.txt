The Ride-On Carry-On has changed our lives for the better! We fly from the west coast to the east coast every few months with our young son. We usually take the red eye, so that he doesn't have to sit awake on a plane for 7 hours. Occasionally this means carrying him, and our luggage, through our connecting airport. Enough was enough, and I was ecstatic to find the Ride-on carry-on. Our son is 7, though not yet 50 lbs, which technically puts him outside of the suggested age range. But we found the seat to be plenty tall for him! After seeing several reviews cautioning purchasers that their carry on luggage might suffer damage, we decided to find a cheap, sturdy, $5 carry on at a thrift store to strap it to. We figured that way, if it broke, we wouldn't care too much. Well, we wheeled it across four airports this month, and the carry on survived and so did we! We got a lot of laughs in the airport, and it really just made our trip more enjoyable. Now here's the catch, and I would really be careful if you have a small child- twice the wheel of our carry on caught on a transition from carpet to tile, or the edge of the moving sidewalk, and the whole thing toppled over, taking our son with it. He got a little scared the first time, but it was more of an annoyance and a tripping hazard for others than a threat to his safety. Take it slow on carpet transitions. Be careful. Don't take any sharp corners. And you should be fine. Obviously with that much weight on top of two tiny hind wheels, the center of gravity is bound to be off. Was it enough to discourage us from using it on the way home? Absolutely not, and it is definitely an integral part of our travel plan from here on out!
