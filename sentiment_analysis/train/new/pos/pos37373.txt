I was so excited to receive the Sweet Sunshine crib set for our nursery. The motif of our room would mimic the crib set with a yellow, white and grey color scheme. The quality of this set itself is wonderful and I think it's worth more than the retail cost, however my only qualm with it is that the comforter itself is not as pictured. The grey part of the comforter is not really grey, it is actually more of a taupe than anything.So all in all, great buy, but don't expect a grey comforter. See picture attached to review.
