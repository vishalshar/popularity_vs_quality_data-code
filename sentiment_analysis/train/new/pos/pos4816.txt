Updated: 2 months after purchase.  My biggest complaint though is the volume level. You can turn off the monitor but you can't turn off the sound.  I wish i could just watch the monitor esp when my son is crying since i can hear him despite the volume..we have a small house. The other monitors on the market are definitely more expensive and I don't know for how long I will need this monitor since my son is getting old enough for me not to need it very often.  soo...this will serve its purpose.___________________________________________________________I bought this monitor based on my friends recommendation and I did not read any amazon reviews first...i probably would have been scared off.  So far i've been using this monitor for a few days and it has worked as designed and advertised.Two things I would have preferred:1)the volume control i wish could go lower.  If you have a sound machine on in the baby's room there is no way to make the monitor's volume really low.2) it came with a rechargeable battery pack.  The camera takes  AA and the monitor takes 6. So we always use the A/C plug because I hate going through batteries.Pros:1)I like you can see your baby's eyes and whether or not they are closed.2)unlike some of the reviews i have not experience crazy static. my cell phone does not interfere.3) has an Auto on mode so you can set it and the monitor will not come on unless there is noise from the baby. (although you can't use this function if you have a noise machine in their room.)4) you can turn off the video part and just have it function as a regular monitor if you wish. Nice feature if the monitor is next to your bed at night.  I just turn on the video if i hear my son cry out to see what the situation is before i go in.5)the picture is a good size.  I've seen some monitors that are really small.Hopefully it continues to work well!
