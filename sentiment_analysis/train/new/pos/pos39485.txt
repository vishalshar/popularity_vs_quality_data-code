This is my second child and second time nursing. I used a double electric pump at first but soon realized that it took forever for my milk to let down and i felt like i was not draining each breast enough. This time it has been an issue with time to nurse and pump with a two year old and a newborn so i decided to try the manual pump. I originally purchased it so that i could carry a pump with me if i was away from the baby but realized that this pump is much more efficient and now its the only pump i use. It would take 2-4 min for my milk to let down with the electric but the suction on this manual pump is so awesome that it immediately brings milk out. I am able to pump for about 5-10 min on one side and get 4oz easy. That would have taken me double the time with the electric and only get maybe 4oz on one side!  SO LISTEN UP FIRST TIME NURSING MOMS.....get this pump because it will help establish a great milk supply and keep it up! I wish i would have had this pump with my first child b/c i would have nursed her longer. I also like this pump b/c you control the speed. You can speed up pumping when you see your milk coming out and stop pumping if you have a crying baby or toddler to tend to. No cords to mess with too! I thought my hand may get tired of pumping but it isn't too bad. I don't mind having to switch hands to keep pumping when i am getting a bunch of milk and fast.  An added benefit to this pump is the clean up time...double pump equals double the equipment to wash. This pump i only have a few pieces to wash....yay! The only complaint that i have is that they should include an 8oz bottle so you can keep pumping and not have to empty the 4oz. Really it is not much to buy a bigger bottle but would be nice to have the package contain one 4oz and one 8oz.  Cant say enough good things about this pump....hope this info help:)
