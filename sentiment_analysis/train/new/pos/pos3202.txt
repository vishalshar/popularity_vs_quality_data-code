What can one say?  It is Reed and Barton, has a darling shape of a giraffe and is a wonderful gift to a special little great-niece, great-netphew or some other very special baby.  I've purchased this charming little spoon twice and it will not be the last time, I'm sure.  I give it 5 stars and so will the gift recipient.
