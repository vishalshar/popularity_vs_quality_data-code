This item is just as cute in person as it is in the picture. It's bigger than I thought it would be which is great because usually things are smaller than how they look in pictures. My original purchase came in the time promised but it was broken during shipment. The seller was very quick to respond to my email request for a replacement and their customer service was great. They replaced the item immediately.
