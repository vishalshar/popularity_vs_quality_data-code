I had never heard of these, but when my Safety 1st Complete Air 65 would NOT tighten up in my IL's late 1990s Toyota RAV4, I started researching.  This has made her RFing car seat much, much safer.It is very difficult to install.  But the reason being, the instructions tell you to tighten the seat as much as you can, then unbuckle and add the locking clip.  Trying to re-buckle really is tough, but it should be.  Your seat is then securely fastened!Their seatbelt DID lock, but the locking was older and wearing - so it wasn't as quick to lock.  This is keeping her seat from sliding in the lap-belt.  I would highly recommend it for anyone finding this problem in an older car!
