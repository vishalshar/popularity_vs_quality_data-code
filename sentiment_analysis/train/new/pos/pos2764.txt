When I first had my child, I bought a couple different brands of diaper covers to see which one I liked the best.  I definitely like the Thirsties better than the other brands.One brand in particular (Bummis), would feel soggy as if the urine was starting to seep through the cover.  Thirties diaper cover does NOT feel soggy when the diaper is wet.  It feels completely dry on the outside, even if the diaper is soaked.  There are gussets on the legs and this helps keep the cloth inside the cover.  I chose the type of Thirsties with snaps because they last longer and do not attack everything in the wash like Velcro does.  I gave this a four-star instead of five-star because when I got my six pack, the crotch snaps (used to lengthen the diaper) on one of the diapers don't work.  They simply will not snap together; it's forever in the largest size.Also, maybe I didn't read the description closely enough, but you may not get the colors shown.  I got two whites, two greens, a melon, and an orange.  I was kind of hoping for the colors that were in the picture of the bundle.Anyhow, now that we have another one on the way, I'll definitely be purchasing this again except in size one for our new little one.  Depending on the price savings (which I don't think much is saved by purchasing the bundle over the individual covers), I might buy the Thirsties size one snap covers individually so that I may choose the colors I prefer.And lastly, I almost forgot to mention the bag that comes with it.  It's a smaller version of the reusable, mesh grocery bags.  I don't know what to do with it so it is useless to me.  It's not like I can put dirty diapers in it (like a wet-bag, which is what I thought it was when I bought the bundle), and it's too small to use for grocery shopping.  Maybe I could use it to put an extra set of children's clothes in to keep in my car.  Either way, I don't use it, and I haven't found it practical.
