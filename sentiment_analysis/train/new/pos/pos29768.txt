I looked EVERYWHERE for a baby keepsake book that I liked and this was the ONLY one that I even considered.  I was at the point of just doing a scrapbook from scratch when I found it.  We did not want to find out the gender of our baby until he was born, and there were very few gender-neutral options available.  Also, most books were super cutesy or old-fashioned.This book has a simple grey and yellow color palette with occasional animals.  It doesn't make any religious references, which I appreciated.  There _are_ sections for classes/nursery planning/shower which may not be applicable in every circumstance, though, and it's bound in a way that make them impossible to remove without damaging the integrity of the book.  It includes all the must-have sections with lots of room for you to add your own additional memories/photos.The cover material wipes clean easily, but scuffs pretty easily, too.
