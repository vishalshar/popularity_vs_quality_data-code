After trying a whole range of teething toys, from Trix Clutching toy to Sassy Water filled Teethers Developmental Toy to an older version of Munchkin Teether Babies Monkey to an older version of Manhattan Toy Color Burst Winkel in a Box, with most being something like Bright Starts Chill and Teethe, Pretty in Pink or Chilly Dilly Daisy Teether, I got fed up with the fact that none of them (except occasionally the Sassy butterflies) kept baby happy for long, probably because none of them gives a really good purchase for gnawing, the way my rubbery teething beads did when I was a kid.  The harder plastics used now just aren't chewy enough. After catching the 2-year-old gnawing on a silicone hot pad multiple times, the light bulb went on and I found this teether on Amazon.  The reviews saying lint sticks to it told me I'd finally found a REAL teether.  (I was not keen to buy the expensive latex giraffe that's all the rage now.)The 2-year-old loves the Lifefactory teether.  It gets chomped from all sorts of angles, twisted up or left in its circle, and, living on the toddler bed most of the time, does not collect lint.  It can fit in the back of the mouth for those painful back molars, a feature missing in most teethers. It fits over my wrist fine, but it doesn't stay there because the little one has strong ideas about whose property it is.  The grippy silicone is great for chewing.  The yellow is very cheerful.  If teething is bad enough that we need to use it away from home, some links like this type Bright Starts Lots of Links will easily keep it attached to a stroller.We haven't tried refrigerating it, but I don't expect it would keep a chill terribly well.  The only downside is that our kid occasionally uses it as a bracelet, gets it stuck above the elbow, and has to have help removing it.  Extra bonus is that it's made in USA!
