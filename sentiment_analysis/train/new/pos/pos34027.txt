I'm no diaper bag newbie- I have a 3 and 2 year olds and i've been thru many high end diaper bags (petunia, storsak, other skip hops, ju ju be's...) so my review is a good one!  this bag is SO amazing for the price.  VERY similar to the storksak emily but less than half the price and a bit larger which when you have two kids is better!  So much room for everything without looking silly when not as full for errands or a quick trip.  Can be packed with tons of stuff for a longer day out too.  Don't know why anyone mentions the fabric seeming cheap; it seems very nice and silky yet strong to me.  Love the four outter pockets on front and a small zipped one for my iphone- great for my small bits and keys and sunglasses as well.  This bag is SO stylish and practical, i just love it to pieces!  The hobo shape is really high end looking and all the pockets keep me organized.  The blue lining was a bit shocking at first now i think it looks vibrant and a nice contrast to all the black.  Clips on the handle of my bob just great!  And at the lower $59 price on amazon, how could i resist?Update almost 2 years later!Still in love.  kids now 5 and 3 and its perfect.  lots of pockets for snacks, my stuff, band aids/meds and misc.  I can fit so much in here, and now my needs are different and it still rocks.  you CAN maching wash on gentle in a pillow case and air dry for a nice clean bag.  The black is so classic and i get compliments all the time still.  best diaper bag for 2 small kids, babies or pre school aged!
