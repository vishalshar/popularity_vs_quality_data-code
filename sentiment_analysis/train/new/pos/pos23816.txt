Great potty. My son loves the cushion seat. And what fun to have your own toilet paper and a slot for wipes.  We ordered a second one of these for my sons school since he wouldn't go on the hard plastic seats we got him.  He also likes the lid and that you can use it as a step stool.  Helped with the joys of potty training a reluctant toddler.
