I really love this Gerber Stripe Nylon Diaper Tote. I bought I when I found out I was pregnant with my second baby girl. I bought it because it matched the colors we painted her room. The colors are bright and great for baby girl. The material is nylon, so anything that gets split on it or in it is easy cleaned up. This diaper bag is a lot bigger than any other I have had in the past. My other daughter just turned 1, so I will be carrying stuff for two babies. It is very roomy and it can fit a lot in it. It is easy to carry, it doesn't slide off my shoulder at all. It is very light and quality of material is excellent. I have washed and dried a few times, no problems washing or drying, no fading. I'm very pleased with this product and recommend to new or expecting moms. The extra bags and wipe holder also come in handy.
