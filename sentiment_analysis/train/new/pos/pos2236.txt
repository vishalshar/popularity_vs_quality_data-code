I tried several nursing pillows (Boppy, JJ Cole Paisley Nursing Pillow, Bebe Au Lait Nursing Pillow, Comfort & Harmony Mombo Deluxe Covered Nursing Pillow) and this was my favorite by far. The Boppy is too soft and floppy, the JJ Cole is too firm, the Bebe Au Lait was too rotund, and the sides of the Mombo sort of folded up in an annoying way. And they all are flat so they don't conform to the shape of your lap, resulting in the sides drooping over your thighs. This pillow is brilliant with the additional detachable pillow. I flip it over so the smaller pillow is on the bottom and fills the gap between the chair and the large part of the pillow, essentially making the large part of the pillow flat so my baby isn't rolling off it like the others.I don't mind that it doesn't have a cover, as I just put a receiving blanket between my baby's cheek and my breast to catch any milk or spit-up. And if it does get soiled, I've tossed it in the washer and dryer and it's fine.Also, to address those reviews that say there are little fibers that come off - they didn't bother me at all. I think it actually helped to wash it because they aren't coming off anymore.Love this pillow and won't use any others.
