Mattress seems to be made well but its a little too firm, in my opinion. I know that baby mattresses are supposed to be firm but this is REALLY firm.  Nonetheless, our baby sleeps well on it and I supposed that's what's most important. It also fits really well in our Stokke crib and she's not being exposed to lots of toxic stuff. I would purchase again.
