I purchased 2 rolls of this border to go in my son's room.  My husband and I put both rolls up in less than an hour and it looks wonderful! 2 rolls were not enough for his room (we need another half roll), so I am ordering one more roll to complete his room.  The color of the border is great.  If you follow the directions exactly, it is extremely simple to put up.  Just make sure you wipe the bubbles out and smooth it with a sponge to wipe off any excess glue.  I truly have no complaints with this border.
