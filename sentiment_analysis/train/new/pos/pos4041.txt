i got this toy at my shower. everytime you put the carseat in, it gets in the way. it moves all over the place. it has a tiny mirror in it. i took it back & bought the one by fisher price. it has a remote control, music & lights. it's very convenient & i love it! i would recommend that one instead for only $5.00 more!
