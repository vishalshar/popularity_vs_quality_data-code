I have used this baby gate at the bottom of the stairs. As you see in the photos, the left side is bolted into the drywall and the right side is attached to the banister. I am happy with how it functions, but it did require some alterations to make it work well.When you take it out of the box it says that you need to bolt it into a stud or else use drywall anchors. It does not come with any drywall anchors so I needed to get some of those. It also has instructions for mounting to a wall that has a baseboard, but my baseboard is extra deep at the bottom and it would not work with my baseboard if I wanted the verticle support to rest on the floor. I accounted for this by setting the vertical Rod on top of the bottom portion of the baseboard as you can see in the photo. The plastic pieces that act as support spacers in between the vertical rod and the drywall are only so big so I could not set it on the floor or else the vertical rod would be too far away from the wall. Because the vertical Rod was slightly elevated on the left side I also need to elevate on the right side next to the banister. I have used some of the scrap pieces to stack on the floor on the right under the vertical rod that is attached to the banister.The width of the gate adjusts freely, too freely actually. It really helps to use slip ties to lock the gate to the proper width.Lastly, the hinge was squeaky and stiff, and some wd40 helped a lot.UPDATE: After a little over a year of heavy use, the gate ripped out of the wall and left big holes in the sheet rock. It's gave me a chance to learn to patch a wall.
