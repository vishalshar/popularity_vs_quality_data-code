I was looking for wash clothes that were all natural, a minimum of 100% cotton and surprisingly couldn't find much in brick and mortar locals.  After a bit of searching found these and went for it.  I love them.  They are supper soft and work great for bath time and cleaning baby's face.  I'm sure she likes the soft feel of them against her skin too.  The only negative that I have about them is the first wash.  Because they are so fleecy soft, they shed a lot of lint in the first wash, which got on all the other clothes as well, but overall, no big deal.  I would highly recommend them and am thinking about getting more to use in place of wipes.Update... So I don't think these are as soft as they were initially.  They don't wash up really well.  I bought some thinner flannel wipes that I use instead because I think they are softer to the touch.
