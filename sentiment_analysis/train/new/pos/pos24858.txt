There aren't many pack-n-play toys on the market and this is a good one. I like the mirror and bright colors. I bought it to try and entice my very tall 6 month old daughter to sit up and then stand up more. When sitting, she can reach the bottom purple star. She is super strong, but gets frustrated easily when she can't transition from one position to the other easily. I was hoping this would help her to not give up so easily. I am sure she will really like this toy in the months to come.
