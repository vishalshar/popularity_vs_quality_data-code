Attention: This chair is not what is listed in the description (6 months and up). There are two Keekaroo chairs sold by Amazon that are exactly the same except this one doesn't come with a tray and you cannot buy the tray separately. I was quickly price shopping and didn't realize that this chair does not come with the tray. Because the tray is not sold separately, I need to ship the whole box back and exchange for the chair with the tray to make it useful for a 6 month old.The chair is really nice though, which is why I'll go through the hassle of the exchange. It's solid and very well made. It is the 'right height' to scoot up to the dining room table once your child id old enough to sit at the table without a tray. If you're looking for a high chair to put in the kitchen however, and feed your baby while standing up, this isn't the right chair for you because it won't be tall enough.
