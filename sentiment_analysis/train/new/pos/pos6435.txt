Our toddler's mattress that she has had since she was born in her crib was supposed to just move right into her toddler bed with her (we have a 4-in-1 crib), but the mattress didn't last (it was a Sealy).  Springs were popped up to the surface and the mattress sort of cracked in the middle, exposing the stuffing and springs.  She's NEVER leaked onto the mattress or used it aggressively, so we were pretty bummed.  She's 3.5 years old, and still using her toddler bed, so we had to find another small mattress since she's not ready for a twin.  Once I started researching, I was appalled at the level of harmful chemicals in these and all mattresses.  I wish I knew then what I know now.  We ordered this Naturpedic based on the high reviews it received.  Despite it being really expensive for a mattress that she will probably only use another couple of years, I just couldn't justify exposing her to the harmful chemicals they use to make standard mattresses, especially given the amount of time she spends on and the close proxemity she has with her mattress.  If I could offer any advice, it would be to those purchasing this mattress as their newborn's crib mattress and then you can use it to transition to the toddler bed.  It fits perfectly into the 4-in-1 crib and toddler beds measure the same as well (except IKEA beds, which are sized specifically for their crummy mattresses).  It has NO smell/odor and the center was not higher like others have stated.  I've also skipped using a $50 mattress pad and folded an organic blanket under her fitted sheet, and there is no plastic sound.  It's rather soft and she noticed right away how comfortable it is. I definitely recommend it.
