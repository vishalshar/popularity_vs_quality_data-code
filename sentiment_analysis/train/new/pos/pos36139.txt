This is a very good baby monitor. The picture quality is amazing (even is total darkness). You can scan the entire room with this camera. Before getting this I tried safety one monitor and was very disappointed because the picture quality was poor, small was screen, and it was complicated to use PLUS it cost $100 more.  Oh.. this monitor is very easy to use. Great for grandparents.. My mom loves it. The only reason i did not give it 5 star is because it can not be mounted on the wall.
