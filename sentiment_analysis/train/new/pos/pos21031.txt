My sister and I both own these window shades.1. Creases in filmNEITHER of us had an issue with folds/creases in the film.  Yes, they come folded up, but warmth smooths the creases, and they completely go away.2. Ease of applicationYes, clean the window first.  Of course the film doesn't automatically lie flat and bubbles remain.  Simply use a credit card or other similar surface edge to smooth out most bubbles.  I wouldn't have expected this to be like window tinting.  I didn't purchase window tinting...3. SizeOne film almost completely covers a small window, but it does not cover the entire back windshield.  This shouldn't surprise anyone given the dimensions of the film.4. AestheticsOf course these are not fabulously attractive - you've chosen to put a piece of film on your window that doesn't completely cover it!  I DO THINK they are MUCH MORE attractive than the roller shades.  I searched and searched to find anything less ridiculous than roller shades.  These provide a more chic look (as chic as you can get with a piece of film...).5. ValueSeriously, these are incredibly cheap, work well, are the "least worst" in appearance (in my opinion).  I highly recommend them if you are otherwise not inclined to buy super dark window tinting and think roller shades or those with Disney characters are silly looking. :-)
