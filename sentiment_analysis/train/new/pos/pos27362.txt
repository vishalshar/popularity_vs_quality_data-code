Love, love, live this play mat, my 8 week old loves it for tummy time, contrast really catches her eye, their is crinkly material inside several squares that make noise and she loves to feel it. There are hardly any high contrast mats and toys that are the best for infant development. Most play mats are pastel colors. It also washes well in the washing machine and I hung it to dry. I will buy more mats in the future as gifts in the future!
