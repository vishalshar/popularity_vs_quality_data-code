I purchased these OXO Tot Baby Food Freezer Trays, June 3 and received them June 7 (speedy service). I am so amazed with how simple and easy it is to prepare and store baby food. The trays are easy to use, just put the food and pop it in the freezer, once frozen push out the cubes and store them away. These trays come with 14 pods that hold about 3/4 ounces of whatever food you put inside. Taking out the food is so easy, you just twist the tray gently and the cubes slide up. I really enjoyed how easy it is to use these trays. Cleaning the tray is simple, even bright orange carrot puree doesn't stain the tray. You can save so much money making your own baby food, and storing it away in the freezer for future use.The product I purchased cam with:1 white tray14 ice cube pods1 green slide on lidI bought the tray along with OXO Tot baby storage containersI have had great experiences using OXO Tot products.
