I've used many different brands, some of which are very complicated to use. This one has a very simple design, the baby is in it and swaddled up in seconds. It's a nice soft lightweight material, which is great with the warmer weather starting up. The " whoo loves you" saying and the owls are just too cute. The saying is sewn in and the owls are made of a soft materiel so it will not scratch the baby if her skin rubs up against it. The Applique is also very well sewn into the fabric so it will survive many washing's. I bought the small/medium size and it swaddles the baby very snugly at 2 months old.
