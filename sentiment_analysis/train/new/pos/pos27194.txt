There seem to be many negative reviews for these bags, but I have no serious complaints about them.  I have stored milk nearly 50 times using the Medela bags and have been completely satisfied.  They are sturdy and hold up well when being reheated.  However, I do dislike the fact that the way they are closed is to insert a little trash bag tie into the two pre-cut holes and then fold over and over and twist together until tight.  I store my milk in tupperware and then enclose in large freezer ziplocks and have not had any problem with the milk being corrupted.  The way they close is annoying because it doesn't freeze flat at all and I can only store 3 bags of milk per container- thus taking up tons of space in the freezer.  When I heat these up in a pot or under hot water I never have to double bag or worry about leaks and that is what matters most to me.  I recommend these bags and will continue to use for the remainder of my time breast feeding.
