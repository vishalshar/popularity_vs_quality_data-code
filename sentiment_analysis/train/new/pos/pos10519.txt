Over-all these are pretty good bottles. The only thing that I feel could use some improvement is the shape of the top of the bottle, it's a little bit too wide. Example:  When you get to end of feeding and have to tilt the bottle upward to get the last 1/2 ounce or so, the base of the nipple is actually touching babies nose.Other than that, these are GREAT bottles. They are resonably priced, never had any problems w/ leaking & absolutely LOVE that cap snaps onto bottom of bottle, GENIUS!
