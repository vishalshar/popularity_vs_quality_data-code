I was very excited to try this set based on all the reviews I have seen, and I was not disappointed. I was a little reluctant to spend so much on just one,  but I planned on purchasing the Birth to Potty Pack if it worked out, which it did.  -The wrap is very thick and sturdy, and clearly of excellent quality. I can see why the company is able to offer their Two Child Guarantee. These things will last.  -I love that the diapers and covers are sized instead of "one size". I have tried OS with no success at all. The perfect fit was more comfortable for my baby, and prevented any leaks.  -I don't think it's overly bulky for a cloth diaper, in fact it's much trimmer than I expected. (Although this was never a concern for me. If you're looking for a super trim, disposable-like fit, this isn't it.)  -Also I didn't have any problems with the velcro scratching, or any red marks at all. I was able to get a good snug fit around the legs and waist without leaving any red marks anywhere.  -Made it through a long night on a medium/heavy wetter! Dry cover, dry clothes, dry sheets, happy mama:)  -Hubby likes it. This is essential.  -Flushable liner is very soft and works great. I don't know why I never tried these before.I highly recommend these if you're looking for something simple, not flashy, that works and is excellent quality. I'll definitely be purchasing the Birth to Potty Pack for my baby on the way (and toddler daughter still in diapers).
