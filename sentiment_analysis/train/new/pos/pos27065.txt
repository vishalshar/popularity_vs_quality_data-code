First off, I really like the way it looks. I agree with the other reviewers about it being poorly designed. The animals hit the arm and it completly stops spinning. The materials used feel nice and soft, and the animals look great! Why two stars? I am not happy with it at all. One complete wind lasts about 30 seconds and when you go to wind it again it makes a lot of noise waking baby up. I don't think the price is worth it at all. I can't return it because I have cut all the labels off.****update**** July 12, 2012So I gave it more stars now that I bought this Hleeduo Baby Musical Mobile Plays Twelve Tunes. I guess I wasn't too happy about having to wind so often. I know it's not a manufacturer defect but hated it anyway. Now that I can turn it on and sooth baby, it works for me!
