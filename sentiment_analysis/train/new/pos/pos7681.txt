This bottle saved us!! My 3 month old breastfeed baby was rejecting the bottle right before I was supposed to return to work full time. This is the only bottle she liked for the first few days of training her to take the bottle again. After she was about a month old she would occasionally take any bottle, one day she started rejecting them and coincidentally it was right when I had to go back to work... We were super stressed and so was the baby. With this bottle and a consistent routine of trying to get her to accept the bottle we succeeded after 3 days. It was tough but we had to find a way for her to feel the comfort she felt on the breast with a bottle. We kept doing the same exact things with each feeding so she would get used to it. The first free days she barely ate from the bottle but I stayed strong and only breastfed her in the morning and at night. Her doctor said she would make up the calories and to bring her in if she was still rejecting the bottle in a couple of days to check her weight. We didn't need to do that so it worked out.It's so funny now when we use this bottle to feed her everyone asks us about it.. It's really cute and everyone says it resembles the shape of a boob. :)
