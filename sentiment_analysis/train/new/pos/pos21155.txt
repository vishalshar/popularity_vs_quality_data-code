A adore these food pouches. At first I was set on getting reusable ones (I don't love the waste and bulky top) - BUT at .$33 a piece, it was the cheapest option when it came to making A LOT of food all at once. They are also the only pouches I've found that are completely transparent. Using fresh organic produce, they ended up pricing out almost the same as Plum Organics ($1.50/pouch) but nothing beats the fresh factor!!One note- I am a very crafty person, ...a foodie with a VERY well equipped kitchen, all matter of pastry bags, tips, basters and injectors ... I have the patience of a saint- Do yourself a favor and BUY THE DAMN FILLING STATION. It saves a TON of time, and even though it can get a little sloppy, trying to figure out your own method without it will be more frustrating, and I can guarantee,  A TON MESSIER. I hate having another random gadget like this in the kitchen, but it was totally worth the $25.Last- They freeze well. I thaw in warm water. They say DO NOT MICROWAVE- I of course tried, but wouldn't recommend it. The spout and top edges become ridiculously hot after only a few seconds. The top 1/4 inch actually started to boil and the rest was frozen solid. They also say DO NOT REUSE. I tried, again, not worth it. Hard to safely clean and dry, and it stays kind of crinkly.Oh- The top spout doesn't seem to be a universal kind of thing, SO, if you are going to spoon feed out of them, buy the Infantino spoon attachments. THe "BOON SPOONS" which fit Plum Organics do not fit.
