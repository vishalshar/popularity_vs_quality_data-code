We ordered two of these Flatophants. They are really super cute and soft. Great size for little ones. The only problem we have is: one of the Flatophants has a slight manufacturing defect...it has two tails. That wouldn't be a huge deal  since babies don't care, but unfortunately the second tail is located on the Flatophant's frontside making for awkward gift giving, especially when all of us immature adults are chuckling and snapping photos. We will be performing a removal surgery of the extra appendage soon. Still a good buy. The other one is perfect and adorable.
