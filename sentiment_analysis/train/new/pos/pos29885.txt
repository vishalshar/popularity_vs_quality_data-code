This is a lot nicer than the store bought ones around at the beginning of every school year.We had to get one for our Kindergartner and I didn't think this would even cut it for our non-napping 5 year old, but she says she likes it and has been using it for 2 months now.A body pillow pillowcase fits it PERFECTLY, even folded up.It was worth the price to me at this point (though I wish it was little thicker and maybe a little longer) and I hope it lasts all year and then some, maybe she can use it on our hardwood floors since she likes to sit or lay on the floor quite a bit.
