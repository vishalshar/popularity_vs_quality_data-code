I own several Summer Infant change pad covers and the natural cotton ones in solid colors, like this one, are by far my favourite!! The material feels really great and the baby loves it. We sometimes leave the baby on the change pad for 10-15 min because she often quiets down when we put her on it and seems to enjoy herself, so I wanted a cover that feels good against the baby's skin, is absorbant as she often has impromptu mini-spitups and washes well in warm water (surprised how many baby items do not pass the latter test well!).These pads meet all of those criteria, plus I super like the cornhusk color - very warm yellow.I highly recommend the plain cotton covers like this one over the synthetic ones with cutsie designs. Though the designs are cute on other covers, the synthetic material feels awful and plus if you use a liner, you won't see the design too often.
