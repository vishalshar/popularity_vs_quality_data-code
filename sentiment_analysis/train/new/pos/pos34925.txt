This tub is an excellent transition tub for a baby too big for those little plastic tubs, but too small for the big tub.  It is spacious enough for our 11 month old to play (and he is a big 11 month old), and provides nice soft sides so that when he slips he doesn't bang his head on the hard sides of the tub.  We got the deluxe with the toys, but I think they are more entertaining to me than to him.  I wish that we had skipped the traditional plastic tub and went straight to this.  Great buy!
