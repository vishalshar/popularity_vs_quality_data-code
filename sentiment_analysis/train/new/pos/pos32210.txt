This wrap is worth it's time to put on. I didn't baby wear with my first child because I thought they were harmful to a baby's hips and legs but I was using the wrong baby holding device. This wrap works great for my preemie newborn but I pay careful attention to her airway and have followed the directions closely. It takes a little time to put on but it becomes second nature after you do for awhile. It supports my baby well and i feel she is safe while in it. UV is very important to me and I didn't realize how often I would be wearing a baby. It washes well and is very durable. The cons is that it is essentially one big long price of fabric and you have to be careful not to let it touch the ground while putting it on while outside but their is no alternative to achieve the snuggle you get from baby wearing.
