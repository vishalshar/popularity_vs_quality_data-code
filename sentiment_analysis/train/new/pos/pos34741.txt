we bought this pack for our 10-day trip to England.  My husband had our baby in the pack and I kept all diapering/personal essentials in this bag.  I preferred it to a lop-sided, one-shoulder diaper bag.  No way I was going to walk with one of those for hours.  But, I didn't want to use a backpack because it's way to easy to be pick-pocketed of money, keys, credit cards, etc.  So, I kept those things in the front pockets where I could see them.  Having said that, there's no pocket big enough in the front for a passport.  That would have made this bag better.Overall, it was compact & streamlined.  I rarely felt I had to squeeze through a space because my bag was too large.  I was asked to remove it once on a tour of a castle because the tour guide thought it was too bulky.  It was the only time & I had camera, video camera, diapers, bottle, etc. in the bag.  The reason it only got 4 stars is that it really isn't constructed sturdily.  Zippers aren't sturdy, bottle-pouch cord broke...the buckle to keep the pack at the right size kept letting slack back out so the bag would hang on me after minutes of use...things like that.I still recommend it though because it's the only one like it I've seen.
