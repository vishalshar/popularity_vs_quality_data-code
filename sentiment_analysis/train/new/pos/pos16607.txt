Using it as a snack bag as that needs to be packed separate from the lunch. It is a little big for that purpose by still nice. I purchased two in navy and one in green. The material on the green one is different and isn't as structured so it always looks wrinkled. It was too late to return as I had already used it a couple of times, but that makes it look old. However it still works as needed.
