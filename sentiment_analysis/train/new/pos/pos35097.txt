This tub is perfect as we are in a small apartment.  It is easy to fold and store and holds just enough water to get baby clean in the kitchen sink.  Be sure to follow the instructions -the bottom of the bathtub MUST rest on the sink (or tub, or counter, etc).  The tub is not designed to be suspended over the sink and, as some other reviewers have found, can lead to the tub collapsing.
