This is a great car seat-- it's comfortable, easy to clean (washine washable cover), easy to adjust, and most important...safe.  It allows you to keep your child rear facing longer than the typical seat.  Rear facing is safest in crash tests, even for children past a year old. It can also be used up to 40 lbs., which is also a safety plus-- a lot of cheaper ones can't be used past 30-35 lbs, and then you have to go to a booster style seat, which is really not safe for young toddlers because it doesn't have the cradling structure of a full car seat.  True, it costs a little more...but it's worth it for the precious cargo it's protecting!
