I went on here to purchase this bag again (my dog chewed one of the handles off) and to write a good review of it as well so I was surprised by the negative reviews I saw.  I liked this bag a lot and found it very useful.  It was perfect for any type of long activity where anything could be needed - i.e. church - I could load it with snacks, diaper necessities, hand wipes, all my stuff, coloring books and crayons and still had room for my large Bible.  Granted the bag was very heavy after adding all that but what bag wouldn't be.  I usually carried it by hand because it was so heavy but when I did carry it on my shoulder, I did not have a problem with it sliding off.  I liked that it had numerous compartments and I could keep everything separate so I wasn't fumbling through everything just to find a sippy cup or bag of crayons.  For what it is (a large bag perfect for holding enough to get through a long activity or afternoon), I think it is great.  As far as snapping it shut, I never did because the design of the bag allows for the compartments to sort of close on their own and so I never needed to snap it shut.  Hope this helps anyone who might be thinking this bag could be useful!
