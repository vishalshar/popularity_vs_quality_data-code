Started off with the manual pump, loved it, so I bought the electric to go back to work. I love the pain free pumping, found the pump very effective when assembled correctly, and motor is fine after 3 months of moderate daily use. After a week of pain free pumping at work I could always achieve multiple let downs and plenty of milk.  It takes a little patience to learn at first, but customer service is great if you have ANY problems, and it's well worth it. Do get a handsfree bra to go with it or your arms will get tired from holding the cups to your breasts, but that's a small price to pay for no pain/tugging.Once I didn't assemble it right and could not get suction in one cup.  I called customer service and they went through scenarios until we figured out that I didn't snap the cup on completely, user error.  Also, I broke one of the cap tabs and they sent me a new one and new tubes right away.If you are a new user I would recommend you just call customer service the first time you are ready to use it and they will walk you through the easiest way to do things. It's well made, but it is newer and you do have to assemble it correctly or you will loose suction.They do recommend hand washing the soft parts: valves & cup face.PROS: Gentle AND effective, only 3 parts per cup to clean, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, Discrete Black Tote w/ cooler bag that you can leave the pump fully assembled in & run w/o removing from tote(it does Not get hot).Cons: You do have to learn to put it together right and it's turn up the TV a little loud. It's worth it to be painfree. Also, get the Simple Wishes Hands Free Pumping Bustier for Medela Breast Pump L/XL/XXL bra to go with it.  This pump sucks on the nipple like the baby but you must still hold up the cups pressed to your breasts and your hands will be tired after 15 minutes of holding.Any of my girlfriends planning to breastfeed will be getting the manual pump as a shower gift! This pump saved my breastfeeding experience.
