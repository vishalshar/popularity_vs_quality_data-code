I've had two babies and they both will only use these latex Nuk pacifiers. I think the latex is a more similar feel to the real nipple, versus the silicon nipples that are easily found. I had to order these online since I couldn't find latex pacifiers in the stores. I ordered two packages, months apart and received the same green and dark pink color ways both times. I thought that was worth mentioning since the vast majority of negative reviews are from parents of boys that prefer their boy baby not use a pacifier that has some pink on it. The pink is dark pink and could easily be mistaken for red. If color matters for you, judging from other reviews you'll probably get green with pink. :)
