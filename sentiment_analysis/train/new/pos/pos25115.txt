I'm a grown ass 23 year old woman. For years I struggled with a dry, flaky, itchy scalp. Nothing I did seem to help it. Tryed Vaseline, sulfate free shampoo, hair oils, mason person brush nothing helped ! Only coconut oil helped a bit. Winter comes and my scalp is hell. Now it's cracking and bleeding. I'm miserable. At this point I was using Johnson and Johnson baby shampoo to combat the dryness since it seemed to help a bit and I was desperate. Then I remembered my momma used to use Mustela on me with no problems and I was like okay what the hell I'll try it.And boy I swear I heard angels singingA couple weeks into it and my scalp was feeling flyIt stop bleeding, flaking and it blissfully stop itching.But more surprisingly my hair started to get curly again!! Not even the $50 recommend shampoo from Ester salon did that.This product is a life saver I recommend it not just for babies but for people who are at their wits end with their dry hair, you won't regret it
