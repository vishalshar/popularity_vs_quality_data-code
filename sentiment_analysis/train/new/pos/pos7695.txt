This blanket is sooo soft and washes up like a dream. Our son loves it so we take it everywhere. It keeps him warm but I would recommend only using it to cover up not to swaddle with. The side you see in the picture has the softer fabric but on the other side is a slippery fabric like satin, which would make it hard to hold/swaddle a baby. The color is great and only slightly darker than in the picture. It's perfect for anyone doing a Winnie the Pooh theme or just likes the character.
