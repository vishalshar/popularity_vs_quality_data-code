UPDATE: A friend of mine swears by these cups so when I told her my concern below, she quickly replied that you can easily separate the lip from the lid and clean it in two pieces. Problem solved!I like the idea of this to help my son learn to drink from a cup without the spills. Cleaning, however, is not as simple as the dishwasher. This was found under the rubber flap (which seals the lip of the cup to prevent spills). I used this once because the cup isn't clear so it was hard to see if my son was actually getting anything out.
