I really like these cards, don't get me wrong but there is another set I wish I had found first that was used at the first shower for my daughter's daughter that was made for close friends. Look it up if you are a close group. Otherwise this one right here is nice and we got some lovely thoughts for the child! But the other set has a lot of "what do you wish for ..." the child. Oh, so wonderful!!! But my daughter didn't want copy-cat showers and the shower I assisted with was more women from our congregation who have only known her a couple of years, not like the first group who she grew up with. Hope this made sense. Both cards are great and if the mom is having more than one shower, get them both!!
