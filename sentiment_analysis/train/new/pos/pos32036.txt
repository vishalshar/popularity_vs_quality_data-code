Love this one so much better then the Bob duallie parent console. There's more room for holding items, and the insulated bag is awesome. I can see how people have issues saying it's too loose. You have to make sure the plastic loops are pretty much on the side of the the handlebar, and then tighten it. Wrap the Velcro straps all the way under.
