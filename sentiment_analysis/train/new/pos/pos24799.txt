I initially bought this monitor set because Amazon had a really good deal on them.  We have four young children in the house, so I went ahead and bought two.  I really don't know how I lived without this great invention!!  I can look at my kids during playtime, while they are napping, etc. without disturbing them.  The night vision feature REALLY works too!!  I really like the secure feeling I get when I know that my kids are not getting into something they should not be and knowing that they are safely tucked into bed.  Definitely one of the best purchases I have made this year!!
