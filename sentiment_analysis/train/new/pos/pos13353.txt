The music is very nice (parent friendly)The mobile is very entertaining to babies.ALL remote control mobiles have a big weakness - the remotes only work when they're in the same room as the mobile.  This means you have to get up every time you want to restart it. No one has created an RF remote.  At least this model runds a long time before shutting off.What you read about the poor design of the pole is really true.  It doesn't lock in place, and the segemented pole doesn't even lock together.  Truly a terrible design.I'm giving it 4 stars because ALL mobiles will in fact break apart and crash on a baby that pulls on the toys.  Parents need to be careful with all mobiles - not just this one.  The fact is that this mobile has more useful features and more engaging toys than all the others I have seen.Everybody complains about the poor arm design, yet they buy the product fully knowing what could happen.  The FIRST day I caught my daughter grabbing the toys, I took it down.  If your child can stand in her crib, remove ALL mobiles - period.
