Happy with this purchase. The colors are beautiful and attractive, my baby gets tired from his bouncer fast nut not this mat, he even falls asleep in it. Other reviewers are right about the hard plastic toys, but my baby loves them and they are the first thing he tried to grab, my husband things they are too hard on our babys little hands when he bats at them, so simply I replaced them with our other soft toys. The mirror is genius EXCEPT for one major flaw, it is the type of mirror that reflects in weird shapes, it makes me dizzy just looking at it, this defeats the whole purpose of the mirror, otherwise I love that its portable, and that the songs are from Lion King movie, and that it is baby activated.Update: I washed the mat along with Simba soft toy, in the washing machine and they came out just fine !Another Update : baby still loves it ! The mirror is one of his favorite toys ! I still think the mirror is genius and i love the tunes, and the lights ! I love how the baby has to activate it and keeps activating it to continue the song. But still im not a fan of the fun house type mirrors, yet the baby loves it !
