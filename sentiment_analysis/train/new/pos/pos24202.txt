These have been great as my son started eating baby food. I can store leftover food in the fridge and not have to waste it. The lids stay on well and the suction bottom REALLY sticks. They come clean easily. Now that my son is older (11 months) these work great and are just his size. We've purchased a few sets and they have all held up very well. I put aside veggies and fruits that we eat and can reserve some for him, ready to eat.UPDATE:My son is now 20 months old and we still use these all the time. He sits at the table with us in his booster seat and feeds himself. We occasionally use the suction bottom, especially when he's a bit fussy and wants to throw the bowl. They're washed by hand sometimes, but mostly in the dishwasher-no spaghetti sauce stains, scratching, or fading. Still very pleased.
