I got this for my daughter who has sensory processing disorder. Bath time has always been hard on her and me, but when I used this on her, it was the first time since I could remember, that she didn't scream. She actually enjoyed the sound and visual stimulation caused fron the water running down.Anyone whose child has SPD can understand how difficult bath time can be, and this has helped so much! She is 3, but I also use it on my four year old daughter and one year old baby girl. It fits all comfortably. It is a little difficult to get it adjusted just right, but it is really worth it. I was nervous reading all the previous reviews, but it came in a flat package, and I have used it over twenty times, and has not even attempted to break. I STRONGLY reccomend for anyone who has a child with sensory processing disorder.
