I was a bit surprised by how big the diaper is, since like others have said, it is a little big. Even for a 45 diaper, I thought it was rather gigantic. I did a double take to make sure I hadn't ordered a really small adult diaper, and I put it on my 6 year old just for funsies.All of that being said, my 25 lb almost two year old can still wear it decently if he has pants on over it. And it is very absorbent even without any extra inserts. So, all in all, I am satisfied with my purchase.
