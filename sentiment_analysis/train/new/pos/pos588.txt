My child gets multiple compliments when he wears these bibs.  They look like bandanas, which allows you to keep them on the baby for longer periods of time and no one will think that you left a bib on from when you last fed them.  My baby is in the drawling phase so I like to keep something on him for periods of time so I do not have to change his cloths 20 times a day.  These come in handy.  They are absorbent but no where near as absorbent as a terry cloth.  They are good for one feeding then they must be thrown in the wash as they do not air dry very quickly.  They fit well around a babies neck and comes with two buttons so you can choose the size you want.  The tag on them is pretty large and it faces on the outside, so you are given free advertisement of the brand.  You can't really remove the tag without damaging the bib so you will just have to deal with it.  My child is not attracted to tags like most, so I can see this either as a great feature for these children or it could be something they just play with as you try and feed them.I would definitely get these again, they are snug and do not let milk drip down to the neck.CONS:  Only one feeding as they do not air dry quickly like terry cloths.
