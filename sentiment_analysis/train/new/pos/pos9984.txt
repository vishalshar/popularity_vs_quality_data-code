My one year old hates having her hair rinsed, specifically the water getting in her eyes.  I gave it 5 stars because for $1 and change it's awsome. Yes it is made out of foam, but no it is not Styrofoam. It is actually quite durable. It has snaps in the back to adjust it to your babies head. Once adjusted it fits snug and keeps all water from her eyes. Shipping was 2 weeks quicker than the arrival date. The only mistake i made was not ordering the 3 pack. Mine came china post, and yes it was folded in half, but popped right into shape after i opened it. I am very happy, and my daughter is too! This visor is a lifesaver and definitely work the buck and change. Do yourself a favor and order the 3 pack because they work great, but as i said it is foam and im sure eventually ilk have to buy another.
