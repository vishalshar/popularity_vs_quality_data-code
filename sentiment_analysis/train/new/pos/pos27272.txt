This set is adorable and pictures do not do it justice! The comforter even has inconspicuous loops on the backside for hanging on the wall as a decoration option, which was an unexpected surprise. I also love that you are given the option to buy without the bumper since they are apparently hazardous to infants. Which saves a ton of money not being forced into purchasing it as part of a set.
