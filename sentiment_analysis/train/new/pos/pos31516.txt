Incredibly cute. Mr. Baby loves this! I believe these pacifiers included some luck in the order because the last 2 times that Mr. Baby used one of these paci's; the Raiders won! Coincidence? I think not!! :) ha haThe pacifiers are good quality and Mr. Baby likes them. So... 5 stars! :)P.S. Just because a baby may or may not have brought luck to the game, doesn't mean adults should suck on pacifiers during football games! LOL!!!Note: In the pacifier pictures; there are drops of water(not defects) in various places. I took the photos after I sanitized them with boiling water. Which I suggest you do as well with any item that goes into a baby's mouth.
