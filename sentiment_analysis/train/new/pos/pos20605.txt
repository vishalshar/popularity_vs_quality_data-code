My wife and I are the proud owners of 4 of these puppies.  Now we don't have to worry about our kids falling in the toilet butt first and getting flushed down the toilet.  It is every overprotective parent's worst fear, next to kids falling off bikes without helmets or being unreachable by cell phone.  BUT I DIGRESS!So, I was doing my usual Amazon comparison shopping on my iPhone while shopping at major brick-and-mortar retailers when I stumbled upon this great find.  It was on the shelf at this particular retailer, and the Amazon review told me that I had found a winner.  Elated (as elated as you can be about a toilet seat for training a toddler), I bought 4 of them.  Yes, that's one for each toilet in the house.  I was most concerned about the new oval/elongated toilet in our downstairs bathroom.  Our old round toilet broke, and the plumber recommended an elongated toilet for reasons I cannot repeat in an Amazon review.  BUT I DIGRESS AGAIN.  Anyway, I wasn't sure this seat would work well for all of our toilets.  As you might guess from my 5-star review, it works PERFECTLY!  Like a poopy in the toilet, not in the underpants, this is cause for celebration.  Seriously, though, this seat is a real winner on multiple fronts:+ Simple, Dummy-Proof: Just put it on the toilet!+ Soft/Comfortable: They should make real toilet seats out of this stuff.  Very nice!  If only my butt were small enough!+ Easy to Clean: Just wipe away.  No small crevices or other tough-to-clean areas.+ Universal Fit: Fits our round AND oval/elongated toilets.+ Space Efficient: Stands on end beside the toilet when not in use.  Very cool.+ Integrated Splash Guard: Works great for our little guy's little guy, if you know what I mean.+ Excellent Value: For the money, I feel this product is an excellent value.+ Fashionable: Berry Blue is quite the statement.  Why sit on a white seat when you can have Berry Blue?
