The dinosaurs are so nicely crafted. I love the colors of them too. Lots and lots of variety as well! The mat is made only of thin plastic so I'm guessing that it will tear quickly. I plan to laminate  it because it is so cute I'd like it to last. Both of the kids, girl age 3, and boy 5, played together with plenty of  space to share without getting in each others way. The box it comes in is perfect size and makes clean up fun and easy! Just fold the toss in all the toys and its done! Its light weight and its great to take along anywhere. The mat is very light and just folds up and goes in the box as well. When our 5 yr old grandson had to go  he made sure to pack Everything it comes with back into the box  then asked "grandpa, can I take this home with me?"  We bought 2 off them.:-) oh one more thing. Some of other reviews said the names of each dinosaur were written underneath them.  Neither of the sets I bought had the name of what it is underneath it. Still a Great buy. Great set of toys for a great price.
