This is an amazing stroller that I recommend for everyone.  I have not had a single problem with this or matching car seat I purchased elsewhere.  First off the wheels are fantastic!!  This is all terrain vehicle, go anywhere do anything, no hassles.  Second is the adjustable handle bar... I am 6' 6" tall and I can push this with ease and dont have to bend over to push.  Then there is the no middle bar down between the rear wheels. I cant tell you how many times I used to kick that stupid thing on other strollers and man it hurt.  Fourth is the levers,  the single cable brake design and the pull lever front wheel lock are so convenient!!  Everything is durable and elegant with built to last in mind.  I dont care what anyone else says about this thing, as long as you take care of it like you should be doing... it will last the life of a couple children.  I would rate it higher if I could but it only gives a 5 star rating.  THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR THE PRICE!!!  Did I mention it is also an excellent running stroller?!?!!
