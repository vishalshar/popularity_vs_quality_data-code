I really like this monitor for outdoor use.  The reception is amazing for long ranges!!  Our yard is 1 1/2 acre so we needed something to transmit far away into the garden.  This is the ticket. It works very well for outdoor monitoring of baby, but if you only intend on using it indoors for night times I suggest using the 900mhz version.  It doesn't produce so much interferance because it is not trying to transmit long distance. Final say, outdoor use...it's absolute amazing. Indoor nightly use at bedside, try another version with less transmitting capacity.
