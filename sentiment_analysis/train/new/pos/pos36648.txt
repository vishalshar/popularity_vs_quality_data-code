This pump impressed me so much that I felt compelled to write my first product review. I'm a First time and pumping only mom. I had been using an Ameda Purely Yours double electric breast pump, an expensive and time consuming machine with rigid hard plastic and varying efficiency. It would take an average of 20-30 minutes to express 4oz. A friend recommended that I get a manual pump for times when I have to be away from home for more than 3 hours or for in case of emergencies or power outages. I picked the Comfort manual pump because,1. The gel pad looked squishy and comfy and lord knows my aching breasts needed some comfort.2. The price was more than reasonable, as a new mom and a grad student I need to be really careful how much money I spend.3. It's portable and comes with everything you need to feed your baby on the go. It comes with a nipple attachment and covers for the flange and nipple.4. It is far from taxing on my hands. It requires very little effort to express large quantities of milk rapidly. I can express 4oz from one breast in 4.5 minutes. (Yes I timed it)5. Super quiet and no tubes, wire or hoses.In short, since I received this pump I haven't touched my electric pump and likely wont be using it again unless something happens to my Comfort Manual pump. It has replaced my main electric pump. One of the best purchases I've made for my daughter and myself.
