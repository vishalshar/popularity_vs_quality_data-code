My baby loves this. I wish it had a strap or seat belt to hold the baby in. We will have to make sure we don't leave her unattended for a few months because she would fall right off it, she's only 7 months. One of the music buttons doesn't work so we might have to exchange it, once I contact customer service and see what they say.
