For the money, this mattress is great!  We put it in the Graco Lauren full size crib we just bought and it fits but it's very tight.  Adding a fitted mattress cover and fitted sheet will make the fit even tighter and not very easy to change the bedding.  However, there is absolutely no way that anything could fall between the mattress and crib sides- so it's very safe.  I can't really tell a huge difference between the "baby" side and the "toddler" side but they are labeled clearly.  This mattress will be perfect for as long as we will need it- there is no point spending lots of extra money for a mattress that's not going to be used for years and years!
