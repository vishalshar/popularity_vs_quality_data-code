My Grandson was four months old when I purchased his Graco MetroLite Stroller in the Rittenhouse design. I made my decision based on several features and the reviews  on Amazon. Having used it for 8 months, I am very pleased with the performance of the MetroLite. The stroller is light enough for me to lift it into the tailbed of my truck with ease, light without a "cheap" feeling, sturdy and able to take the punishment of day-to-day city walking. I especially like that the canopy is large; offering adequate protection from sun and wind.I have occasionally used a  blanket to completely enclose the baby, and could easily observe him through the window in the canopy. The basket is spacious. I have had it packed! Large diaper bag, my purse, several shopping bags, and whatever else I could cram under there. My all-time record is 6 plastic grocery bags emptied into the basket- $65 bucks worth, which really is not much more than a milk, bread and egg run. Folding and unfolding is a breeze. I am challenged in that department, and this stroller has not let me down. I guess Joshua and I have logged quite a few happy walking miles with his stroller, and we both enjoy it. I do need to mention the convenient cup holder, the pattern is beautiful, and the reclining seat is very comfortable for him. He likes to ride with his feet on the dash, and kicked back.I often push it with one hand walking beside it! It is that easy to use. This stroller has also captured my Daughter's attention. She prefers it to her heavier Graco stroller. She also loves the Rittenhouse pattern and has just ordered it for the baby Girl she is expecting in June. I would purchase again and have happily recommended it to my friends. The only negative thing I can say, is again, regarding the basket: when the seat is reclined, it is hard to get at the diaper bag and such, but that is nothing compared to the value of this stroller~ thanks Graco and Amazon
