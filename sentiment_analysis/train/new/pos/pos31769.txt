This was a two-year birthday gift for a grandson who was trying to make a cardboard box work as a marching drum like the marching band drummers he'd seen recently.  His cardboard box kept falling when he'd start marching.  This one has a neck strap, and his face truly lit up when his daddy hung it on his neck.  The sound is a good (LOUD!) tom-tom sound, more like real drums than you'd expect in a toy.  It hangs below his waist, so he'll be able to use it even when he's a lot taller. Worth the price.
