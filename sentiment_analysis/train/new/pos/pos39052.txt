I bought this for a baby's first Christmas. The child is only 3 months old, but is starting to grab onto things. I had to decide between a toy that she could manipulate (like this one)  or one that would grab her attention (thinks lights or noises). I decided on this one. And it was perfect.Taggies are a popular item, I guess. I have not had a baby in the house for quite a while. I did remember them always grabbing on to any loose material on a shirt, or pants, or your ears. When I saw that this toy had multiple "clothing tags" on it I thought to myself, "That's genius!"The eyes are embroidered on. That's an important detail for infant toys. The only caveat is that you need to inspect the toy often. If a tag is coming loose you need to cut it off. Babies will get those in their mouths if given the chance.Overall, I'm impressed with the quality and design of the toy. My friends loved it and that's what really counts, right?
