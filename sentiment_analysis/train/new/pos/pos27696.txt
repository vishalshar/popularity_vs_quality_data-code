This is a wonderful product. Bouncer, rocker, infants, todlers, feeding chair, TV chair, sleeping. This handles everything. We have 6 mo. old twins and a 2 1/2 year old. We can use this rocker for everything and it packs up for travel as well. We have many similar items in the house and this one tops them all. Don't let the low price fool you. If we had bought one of these things before, we would not have bought so many others. We would have just stuck with a few of these ones. We will be buying more in the future for gifts we like it so much.
