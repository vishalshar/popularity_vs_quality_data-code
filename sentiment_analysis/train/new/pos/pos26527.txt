We use these more for handy grabs now that my baby is older bc they are so small.  But they are incredibly soft and on the thinner side, would make for a great lovey blankie!  The fox is my fave, his nursery theme.  We used them as swaddles when he was newborn and they were great, didn't require a lot of wrapping.  He was nearly 9-1/2 lbs and 21", and he was still easily swaddled in them.  You will see in the photo, size wise they pretty much cover the cushion of a medium sized recliner.
