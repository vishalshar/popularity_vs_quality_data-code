The bibs are pretty. It's big around the neck and longer in length than the average bib, so it's better on a older baby (8+ months). They seem to be drool resistant, but after a few months of wearing and washing, The backing on the bibs seem to be wearing thin. I left a wet bib in a ziploc, and the bib looked like it developed mildew growth. Since they recommend no bleach, I was not able to get the mildew out in the wash, so it had to be discarded. Otherwise, the bibs are good.
