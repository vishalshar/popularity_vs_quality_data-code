Okay, I confess, not just for toddlers. We do something in our house called "The Silly Train" which involves me, my 6yo son and my now 2yo toddler doing a precession with "Moo" our Howdy Cow, the little fire truck ride-on, and the Froggy Friend potty. Sometimes I'm on the truck, usually I'm on the cow, and the 2yo is almost always on the potty -- it's about the only way he'll use it. (Although he did stand in it the other day and poop in his diaper -- that's progress, right?)Moo is more than just the best ever toy, she's also a friend who stands by happily and lets the (now) 2yo engage her in long discussions about cheese. Sometimes (with a little help), she'll even nod in response. Patience really is Moo's strongest virtue; she's happy to stand around and provide a canvass for the little oaf when someone leaves a pen lying around. That does bring up one negative about Moo: her hygiene. Moo simply does not wash clean. She is porous, and she hangs on to stains. She's not dirty, per se -- and we did take her camping once -- but she is still sporting the red dye from the 6yo's unwashed new red pajamas and the toddler has gone to town with ink pens and markers, both of which usually wash off things with a bit of elbow grease.Sadly, the 6yo in a fit 6yoness, tried to pin Moo with her aviator wings, so now she is unable to hold onto her air. She has lost a lot of weight and is quite weak. We will try and repair her with a bicycle tyre patch, and if that doesn't work, we may have to have a hard conversation with the boys about where cows go and exactly what "steak" is made from.** UPDATE **We purchased some inflatable repair goop from Walmart for $5 which you paint on in 3-5 layers. Moo has responded extremely well to this treatment and has gained considerable weight. She is back to fine form, with a small scar, and a full member of the family again. Last weekend she and the 2yo played soccer together. She also participated in leaping off the couch onto the bean bag (second best toddler/6yo toy ever). Moo also was willing to let the 2yo stand on her back to jump onto the bean bag, but this activity is heavily discouraged in our house and not recommended for yours. How the 2yo is still alive is a wonder. Perhaps Moo deserves some credit for not toppling over in spite of being kicked across the room as he launched for the bean bag.~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~I noticed some of the older reviews mention that Moo doesn't come with a pump. She came with a hand pump when we bought her. It is much quicker and easier to use a bicycle pump with a basketball nozzle. She has been structurally sound blown up by mouth.Some of the other reviews mention that she tips forward. My son got her at 15mo and wiped out that way once. It's not far to fall and kids need to take risks and learn from their mistakes. Still, maybe it's not a good idea to let them play near sharp table corners? It's a ride-on toy for bouncing on; they are going to fall off and when you are done laughing they will be back on and smiling again. I suppose a helmet is an option for first time parents.****************************** LAST UPDATE ******************************Don't worry, Moo is still a picture of good health and bringing joy to a family -- just not ours. We did a cross-country move, and though I was determined to keep her forever, the nearly-5yo just wasn't playing with her much anymore. It didn't seem fair to her to drag her along, so when another family with a 5yo and a 1yo came by, we took the opportunity to rehome her. Don't worry, it's a great family - we rehomed our TDi Jetta to them 6 years ago and they're taking really great care of that. Other than the scars described above, she was in perfect condition after nearly four years of faithful service.
