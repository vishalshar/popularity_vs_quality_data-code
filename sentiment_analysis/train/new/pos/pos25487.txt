This is a great chair. It may be expensive, but the fact that it can go from cradle to highchair to toddler chair to big kid chair makes it worth it.For everyone who said they would rather have a Stokke, I'm sorry, but not many American kids are going to fit in a Stokke for long, no matter what they say. Plus, you buy the tray separately for that. The fit issue is true for every Scandinavian high chair I have seen.Anyway, at this point, I have a TALL 50 lb 5 year old sitting in the Fresco (it holds up to 75 lbs), pulled up to the table. He loves it. The footrest is sturdy, and he knows how to unlock the swivel so he can spin. I mean honestly, it can't be that hard if he can figure it out.To be fair, I watched the 8 minute youtube video by Bloom when I got my chair, and with that, I had zero problems with assembly.Another plus is that the chair is so stable that even if you have pets, you will not need to worry about this getting pushed over.The ONLY gripe I have is that yes, when exposed for a long time to the sun, the chair yellows. HOWEVER, it is really only noticeable when you take the cushions off and see where that has NOT happened (does that make sense?).As for cleaning, the only high chair I have ever had that was easy to clean was the Boon Flair because it was seamless. And that was the worst highchair ever in every other respect.I will also say that Bloom is a great company to work with if you have any problems. When my chair yellowed a bit, they offered to replace it, at their cost for shipping. I decided it wasn't that big of a deal.I just worry about how my 5 year old will give this up when there is a new baby!
