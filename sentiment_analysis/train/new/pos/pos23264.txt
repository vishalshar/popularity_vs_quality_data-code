We got this on sale and so far I don't regret the purchase in the slightest. The color (espresso) is lovely. It's sturdy, doesn't creak, wobble, etc. I had some doubts before purchasing due to what I read on other reviews but I'm not sure what they were basing their information on. One reviewer remarked that there were stickers absolutely everywhere and they were an eyesore. Yes, there are stickers on just about every piece but if you assemble it correctly every single one of these stickers is not visible. It looks just like the picture - sans stickers. Another reviewer remarked that the brushing of a fingernail across the finish scratched the surface and expressed concerns regarding long-term durability/wearability. This customer must have fingernails like razor blades and must have really worked at scratching the material because I tested it out as well and my fingernails were incapable of scratching the surface of the wood. Overall, it's a beautiful piece, worth what I paid, and I would buy it again if given the chance to do things over.
