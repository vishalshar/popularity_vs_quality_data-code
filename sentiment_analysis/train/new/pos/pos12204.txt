We were given this monitor initially as a baby shower gift and unfortunately had to purchase another one because my 14 month old son thought the monitor should take a swim in our dog's water bowl. We tried another monitor in the interim and were disappointed because the screen would time out after 5 minutes and you couldn't adjust the sensitivity on the that brand's monitor. We have a fan running in our room for noise to sleep and you would constantly hear the fan noise through the monitor. So we went ahead and purchased this monitor because we liked it so much. The only thing that would give this monitor a 5 star rating is if it had zoom capability. Now we have the monitor plus 2 cameras so set up to monitor different angles of our son. Good purchase, you can't go wrong with this monitor.
