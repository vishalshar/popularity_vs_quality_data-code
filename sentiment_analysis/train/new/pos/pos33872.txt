I like these a lot. I used them after my first child and again just this month for comfort after the 2nd one. They come with these  disposable slipcovers too.PROS:-Fit nicely in your undies-The slipcovers are cottony but thin enough to allow the ice to come through effectively-There are two ice packs so you can rotate them easily and not have to go without a pack once it loses its cold feelingCONS:-Slipcovers are difficult to put on-Packs only stay cold for about 20 minutes; I find this makes them not worth the money. They should lower the price.-I don't know where to get replacement slip coversTIPS:-Put a few Tucks (or equivalent witch-hazel pads) on top of these so they don't stick to your wound and the cold can penetrate your affected areas better-Check them for defects when you receive them- the packaging indicates this but I read it after use. I'm sure not many are defective, but I imagine if they are you wouldn't be able to return them after use for obvious reasons.
