I ordered this for my 3 1/2 month old son. He took a liking to it right away. I specifically was looking for a swing that sat him more upright than laying down and that had a tray. I believe the tray will come in handy once he is older and able to grasp food or toys more easily. He holds onto the activity bar that goes across the tray. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is that the buckle system is a bit of a pain to use; hence, I never buckle him in at this point.  The music is pretty decent and the motor noise is not too loud. You can hear it but nothing like some reviews have discussed complaining of a loud grinding noise.I looked around a LOT for swings.  This one fit my desires best -to swing him in a more upright position than laying down and came with a tray- and we love it.*Note, we did change out the mobile animals. It came with the bears that many graco products do. We had extra mobile animals from a mobile that broke over his crib, and we used the stuffed animals from the one that broke to hang from the swing. They work perfectly well and are more interesting than the boring bears. . at least to us as parents!
