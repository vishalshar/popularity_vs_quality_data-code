I love these bells, but like many of you I thought I was getting 4 not 1.  It was my fault for not reading the description more carefully, and I also didn't read the reviews because my son uses these bells in music class, so I already knew I liked them.  When only one arrived I was so sad.  I thought that for only getting one set of bells the price was rather high.  I ended buying more from my son's music teacher, and they were less than half of what I paid for them on Amazon.  My son still loves them though!!
