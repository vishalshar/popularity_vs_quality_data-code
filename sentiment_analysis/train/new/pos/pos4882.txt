I've tried a lot of different storage options for bath toys in the 2.5 yrs I've been using them and this one is by FAR my favorite. At first I was hesitant because of the size being so large and we have a tiny bathroom so I tried other options. I had a net whale one before - drainage was poor and it was always in my way. Tried a corner plastic shelf (made in USA so I liked that part!) that held on with 4 suction cups - drainage poor and fell off because it was in my husband's way. Also tried using the soap dish holders in our tile tub/shower, but that's not enough room. ALL those options were bad because soap scum easily coated toys.THIS ONE- this is great. you can easily remove it from the shower before anyone else uses it eliminating the problem of soap scum all over your toys and hair, ect from washing over them. Drainage is great at the bottom. Haven't used it to scoop toys up or anything yet, but I imagine it'll be great for that too. I got over the size of it since I can remove it when an adult uses the shower it is not a big deal.Installation was very easy and I can see us possibly buying a second one in the future. OXO does make a great line of products for the home so I wish I choose this one FIRST!
