I bough these for my daughter when she was a baby, she did not have much interest in them since they were hard and honestly not great for teething. They sat in her toy box and she is now 4 Â½ . She has been playing with them but left them somewhere and just about had a meltdown.I was able to get a two pack of these which saved me a dollar or two from buying two single ones. They arrived today and she lit up and was jumping everywhere. She said she had a bridge she had to unlock for the Care Bears so had to go to work. Later, I noticed she had the keys hanging off of her belt loops. She said she needed to have them close uncase the bridge closed.These are great for all ages. This is now the third set I have bought and I hope she does not lose them. They are very easy to wash off with warm dish soap and air dry. I love that there are no metal parts to rust as well.
