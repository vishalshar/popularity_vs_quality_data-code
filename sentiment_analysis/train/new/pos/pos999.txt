Finding the perfect plates and cups for toddlers seems to be the most stressful research I've ever done in my entire life. After spending so much money-I mean a ridiculous amount- on cups I was then facing the plate challenge. I spent about $10 bucks on one plate that didn't have dividers and had the curved protective edges. Unfortunately, I didn't want to spend another $10 on the same plate (don't get me wrong that plate was bad ass) so the hunt continued.Would you believe these Gerber plates were the only other plates I could find with the curved edges and no dividers? ::sigh:: The snob in me didn't want to buy these cheap plates because I figured they would warp immediately or perhaps change the taste of food when microwaved. ::eyeroll::Well, the joke is on me and my snobbish attitude. These plates are dope! They are super easy to clean and hold up well with the microwave. I don't have a dishwasher so I can't speak to that but I would imagine putting anything this thin and flimsy would warp with such intense water pressure and high heat so I suppose that just comes down to common sense and not necessarily a design or manufacture flaw. The fact that they come lids is even better. I couldn't ask for more from this product.
