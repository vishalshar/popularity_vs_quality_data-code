**UPDATE: I have had used this stroller now for over a year and a half.  We take it all over our bike paths and at least three days a week to the beach.  It still performs beautifully.  We did learn you have to Lock the front wheel in any kind of loose dirt or sand, especially thick sand, because the wheel will turn and stick sideways.  Not a problem to remember to lock it!  My son likes that he can climb in and out himself and he has his own cupholder and snack tray.  I still recommend it highly - again, I am NOT a serious jogger, but I power walk at least 1.5 miles with it every day! :)After reading the positives and negatives of this stroller, and testing one in a store, I bought this just before my son was born.  We live at the beach and there are also a lot of bike paths, so we walk with our dogs a lot!  The stroller was on sale here at Amazon, arrived quickly, and has been great!!  So easy to push and turn.  In 16 weeks of use, the front wheel has only come loose once and was very easy to tighten back up.  I've learned when to lock it and when to let it spin - if you leave it to spin on too rough a terrain it does loosen up - but if you lock it on the same terrain it's no problem at all!  I recommend this stroller and I am very satisfied with mine.
