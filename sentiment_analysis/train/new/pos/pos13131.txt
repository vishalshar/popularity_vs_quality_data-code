As most first-time moms, I was obsessing with the reviews of all sorts of blankets for babies trying to find the safest, best quality, and more durable ones. I can tell you with confidence that these (I bought three with different designs) were the best due to its size and material. They are worth the price. I've been washing them over and over and the material has held just like new, the shape is almost the same, and the colors have stayed as bright as when they were new.I bought other blankets that were made of a different but still nice fabric, but they all ended up being too small for my now 9-month old little girl. Save your bucks (and time spent reading endless reviews) and go straight to get these ones. I used them a lot when my baby was just born to cover her car seat and stroller, then to swaddle her (these are the only ones that could still wrap around her at 6-months and I'm sure they would still work if my girl would let me swaddler her now). We now use them to cover her when going out and it is a bit chilly. We also use them a lot on the playpen and sometimes to let her nap on the carpet. One more thing: these blankets were invaluable when travelling. I've been stuck for hours at airports and they make for a nice clean space to let her play on the ground; they're also great to let her sleep on while on the plane, and because of their size, you can make a little pillow to protect her head from the hard arm rest and the wall.
