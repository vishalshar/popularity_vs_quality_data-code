Elevated one side of a king size bed about 4-5 inches.  Helps with acid reflux reduction.  Handle on the cover makes it easier to pull out and readjust if necessary. I find this wedge under the mattress more comfortable than a wedge pillow on top of the mattress because the elevation is more gradual and subtle.
