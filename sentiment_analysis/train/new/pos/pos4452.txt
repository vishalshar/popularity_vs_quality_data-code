As a pediatric PT I love to use this mirror when we work on the hated tummy time activities as well as in sitting.  For the younger babies, I prop it in front of them against some furniture and hang linking rings with rattles from the top to encourage looking up and lifting their heads.  As they get older and easily prop on their elbows, I like to lay it on the floor in front of them with a toy on it (suction cup toys work well) so that they can see themselves and even me if I'm sitting behind them to help and work on shifting weight and reaching.  Once they're working on sitting, I can sit behind them and we can still make eye contact in the mirror propped vertically in front while at the same time I can watch their facial expressions and see how they are reaching and playing with toys.  I'm sure it works well as a crib toy too though I've never used it for that as my own baby is 22 years old!The black and white designs on the back are great visual stimulation and a favorite of our early intervention teacher.
