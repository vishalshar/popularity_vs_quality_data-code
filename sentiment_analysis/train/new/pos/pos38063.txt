We had this ready and waiting for our little boy when we brought him home 9-months ago. It has served us very well ever since. The changing table was great while he was an infant, and with the storage unit that attaches to the side this whole thing served as our nursery in the living room of our tiny house. Now, it's stripped down to just the play-yard for our now-bouncing baby boy. We use it as his main crib at night when he isn't in bed with us and it's perfect! He is tall enough now to stand and hold himself up with the edge, but there's not getting out of this thing; very stable and secure. We've also found it surprisingly easy to travel with and very compact considering it's full size. It's very easy to fold up and pop back into place. Takes two hands of course, but it's as easy as five quick releases, and then five quick snaps to pop it back up. This was one of our best investments for our baby.
