I bought this mattress for my DaVinci Cradle as the mattress that came with the cradle originally was very flimsy and thin. This mattress is exactly as described being about 2" thick with the dimensions being 18x36. It is a good consistency-not too hard yet not flimsy. I am very happy with this purchase! Not sure about other reviews stating their mattress came folded, but mine came wrapped in plastic, flat, and not folded or bent.
