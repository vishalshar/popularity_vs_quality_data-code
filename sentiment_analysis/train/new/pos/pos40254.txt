I currently have four children aged four and younger and the Cooshie is our favorite booster seat.  It is soft and comfortable and, even with all of my oldest son's ups and downs and wiggles and squirms, it stays right where I put it.  We have had our oldest Cooshie for more than a year and it is still in one piece and good shape despite my son's abuse.The Cooshie is about the size of the traditional hard plastic booster, so you can take it with you but it's not the most convenient thing to haul around.  We typically toss ours into the car when heading to a restaurant just in case there are no acceptable boosters available and only take it out if needed.  The zipper case it comes in does have handles, so that makes it a bit easier.This booster is very easy to clean.  I typically whipe ours down with a damp rag each meal and take it to the sink for a thorough wash regularly.  I've even been known to take a Clorox wipe to it when the kiddos have been sick in addition to the washing.A note to consider - the rubber does have the potential to break down some varnishes and paints over time.  If you are quite attached to your chairs I would recommend a nice slip cover so that the booster doesn't come in direct contact with the finish (or go the cheap route and put a piece of cardstock or posterboard against the back of the booster).  The bottom of the Cooshie has a different finish and texture than the rest of the booster and I'm not certain if the bottom has the same potential to break down the finish since I have farm chairs with straw seats, so there is no finish to break down, though the Cooshie has taken some paint off of the seat backs.
