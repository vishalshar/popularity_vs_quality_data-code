I got back to work about a month ago and I'm just now getting a good solid pumping routine in place. My job has me out of the office on the road all day so I don't have access to a refrigerator to store milk after pumps. I have to pump 3x a day in my work vehicle. I love this bag because I can put two 8oz bottles, two 5oz bottles with the flanges attached and my Medela ice pack in the main body of the bag, and I use the top portion to keep my lunch cold with the ice pack that came with the bag. My routine is now this: pump while driving (thank you Rumina hands free tank top!) into the 5oz bottles. Pour them both into a bigger 8oz bottle. Put the flanges back on the 5oz bottles and stash them back in the cold bag. At noon I pump again, pour this into the other 8oz bottle and reassemble the flanges and 5oz bottles. In the afternoon I combine the two now equally chilled 8 oz bottles and pour the warm milk into the freed up 8oz bottle. Again I stash the reassembled flanges and 5oz bottles back in the bag and by the time I get to daycare to pick up my son I can pour everything he needs for the next day into one 8oz bottle (he only takes 9oz a day at daycare). It sounds complicated but it's actually really easy and smooth now that I've got a couple weeks of practice. This cooler bag keeps my pump bottles and flanges cold enough so I don't have to worry about washing them each time between pumps. I usually wipe the flanges down with a Medela quick clean wipe and I'm good to go. I'm getting to the point where I'm pumping more than he eats at daycare so having the second big bottle in there lets me store the excess during the day for our freezer stash at home. I'm sure things will change as he gets older but he's four months old now and this is what works for us.
