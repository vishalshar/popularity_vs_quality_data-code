The case is very useful for protecting the iPad and I have small children who use it often.  One downside to the case is there is no port for access to the power/data socket on the iPad.  There are ports for all other buttons and sockets, so not sure why that was left out.  I used an Exacto knife to cut a port for the power socket.  It wasn't too difficult, as it's foam rubber, but you do have to be careful.  That was the only negative about the case, as it should have had a port already, in my opinion.  Otherwise to charge the iPad you have to take it partially or fully out of the case.
