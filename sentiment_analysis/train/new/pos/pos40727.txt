Perfect size for baby.  All the pages crinkle.  Includes a mirror with a flap to hide mirror in shape and design of a simple baby face.  Also really like the" spine" which is a good hard (soft) plastic with" grip" rings as well the contrasting color scheme.I bought this for my second child -we didn't have anything nearly as interesting for our first and she is" rocket scientists material:)!  This baby toy book, though, gets the most attention during activity time.
