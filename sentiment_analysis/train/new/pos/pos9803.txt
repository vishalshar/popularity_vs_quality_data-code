This was my first JJB purchase and now I am totally obsessed with this brand. I am ready to buy all their products.The first time I used this bag was for a three day trip away with no kids.  It held my ipad, make-up, toiletries, sun glasses, large wallet and a whole bunch of other goodies.  I was truly astonished by how much fits in this bag.For every day use, I use the separator as the dividing line of kids vs. my stuff.  I am a pretty messy bag stuffer, but this bag has helped me clean up.  I have two boys 4.5yo and 16months.Here is a list of everything currently in my bag:Coach wristlet stuffed with all my cards, change, cash, lip gloss, receipts.4 - size 3 diapersWipes hard caseTissue packPair of cotton pants for my 16month son2 juice boxesBottle of water2 baby fruit veg packets3 other kid snack thingsPaperworkiPhone in front pocket.  That is the only thing I keep there.Tampons and a padBatman figurinePros:Front cell pocket.  I can easily grab my phone without digging around thru the whole purse.  Seriously every purse should have this.Key fob - I don't use this every time I am out, but I usually lose my keys in my purse and this is a fantastic idea.The bazillion pockets - JJB helps disorganized moms stay organized or feeds the craziness of the OCDs.Roominess - I cannot believe how much I can get shoved in here if needed.Styling - I love love love the steel gray color and lavender lining.  the shape is really cute too.Cons:This bag might not be for the over packer or people who need to pack a lot of stuff. I do not see this working for a newborn baby bag, but is wonderful come like 1 yrs old.This bag is used for everyday run around, birthday parties, shopping, but not for extended time where I would need to bring 2 pairs of clothes for my boys, blankets or toys.  For that I need another bag and am probably going to purchase the JJB be prepared or BFF.Seriously buy this bag!  I have even convinced a friend with no kiddies to purchase this bag.
