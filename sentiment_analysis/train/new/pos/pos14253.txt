I must've tried out 6 different highchairs. All I wanted was a highchair that was easy to store, easy to clean and had a tray that sat relatively close to the baby. I never tried out the joovy or the valco because all the reviews said the tray was far away from the baby and lots of food dropped down. I tried the quickfold which was SO heavy and bulky the convenience of storing it was negated by it's size. The evenflo modern highchair was large as well and didn't fold up small enough. My final picks were this and the evenflo compact fold highchair. I loved everything about the compact highchair. It was super lightweight, super compact to store, and cute. However, the cover was not washable and the material seemed very porous. I finally settled on this chair. The pixi folds up flat but is pretty tall when folded. It is also heavier than the compact fold but folds and unfolds easily. The winning feature of this highchair over all the others is that it is so easy to clean. Everything just wipes down. I like the harness and the tray sits nice and close to baby. It's also a very stylish chair. I deducted one star because it's a bit heavier than I had hoped (but not overly so) and I could not for the life of me get the front legs to snap in. The directions are also ridiculous as they are just pictures. No words. Not helpful.
