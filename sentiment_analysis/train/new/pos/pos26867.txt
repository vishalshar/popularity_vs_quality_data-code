I have a 3 year old and a one year old and was looking to replace my tandem stroller with a side by side.  I did a lot of research, and although I spent a lot more than I had planned to spend, I am not sorry!  I absolutely love this stroller!  I love that the weight limits go up to 55 lbs each. We should be able to use it for a couple of years. My kids don't want to get out of it. The 3 year old said that it is very comfortable, and the 1 year old cried hysterically when I had to take him out of it to put it in the car. We took it to the mall today. It easily fit through all doors and through narrow clothing aisles. The cup holders came in handy for drinks. The baskets held my very large diaper bag without a problem. I love that it literally turns on a dime. The double handle is great for tall or petite parents, and it's very soft and comfortable. It folds up very nicely (a little stiff at first, but is getting easier as it gets broke in). It's a little heavy, but not near as heavy as my Graco tandem stroller. It's a very attractive stroller. My only complaint would be that the frame is not red, but silver. I thought the red looked really neat in the picture, but mine is actually silver. It still looks nice. I would highly recommend!
