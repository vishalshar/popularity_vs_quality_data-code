My son had one when he was born, and now, almost 9 years later, a friend of mine was having a child and I went and searched a lot of stores and found it here. Love these bears. In my experience, the sounds these bears put out drastically help the child sleep comfortably every night. And as they grow, it becomes a comfort item if you keep the bear with them. I loved this bear and so too does my friend. Both of our children have slept all night every night since birth. Now, I know this is just speculative, that it is due just solely to the bear, but it almost seems like it. Like I said, we love this 'womb bear'.I have looked at other 'womb sound' plush toys, but found them too stiff or weird looking, like I wouldn't want to take the item out of the house if I owned it, which defeats the purpose of comforting the child with the sounds if you only use it once in awhile. This bear is soft and no choking hazards. Even the stitching over the nose is soft. The blanket is removable so if there are any accidents, it can be easily washed and taken care of. The sound box fits into its slot, and easily removable for change of batteries, or complete removal due to child's age.I did and will recommend this product to anyone with a child on the way. Best day to start the acclamation into the world is by this bear on day one hour one.
