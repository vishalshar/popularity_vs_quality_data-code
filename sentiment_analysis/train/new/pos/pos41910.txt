Got this for my sister for my one year old nephew after his other stroler broke. It is light and easy to place in the back of the car. Also easy to collapse...only downside is that im not a very tall person, im 5'1, but the handle feels low and somewhat hard togrip when i push it.  but im happy about the price and glad that it is actually heavy duty so it can hold my nephew. also dont like how the tray has to be pulled out  in order to get my nephew out of the stroller and doesnt swing to the side like his old one. but other then the shortness and the tray. glad i purchased it.
