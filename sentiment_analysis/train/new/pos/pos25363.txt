This is a great little monitor! The picture is very clear, the sound is very clear, and the battery life is sufficient. We bought this to use in our playroom so that I can see still the kids when taking a shower or making dinner. I do wish it had the capability to remotely turn the camera, but it serves it purpose and we're very happy with it.
