This is such a great way to attach baggies to the outside of your diaper bag, where they are very convenient. The negatives to this are the price and the dispenser catching. For 25 refill bags, you pay quite a bit. Every now and then, the bags don't roll out easily. It's like the black plastic roller inside the bag is catching on something. However, even with these negatives, I will keep using this product. The bags are the perfect size to drop in a dirty diaper and be able to tie it in a good knot so you can take the dirty diaper with you, or if you are in a home where people are okay with you using their trash, you won't worry about stinking up the house!
