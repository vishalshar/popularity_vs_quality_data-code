"Is that from PBK?"  Is the question that I've gotten numerous times since showing off my new bedding. Which is interesting because I looked on PBK first and didn't see anything that really jumped out to me that I loved except for the one set that my sister had purchased and used for my neice a few years back.  I obviously couldn't use that, so when searching amazon for a set of colorful, fun bedding that wasn't a "theme" and didn't have characters plastered all over it this one jumped out to me in no time flat!  I also loved that this set doesn't just have pastels, but also a variety of rich colors and seems to go along with just about any color you would want to throw into the nursery. After reading the reviews I decided that for the amount of time that you use baby bedding that it was worth a shot at purchasing without seeing in person.I was thrilled to receive it in the mail and even more pleased to have it out of the package and washed up. The sheet washed up great.  It seems to be of good quality and fits the crib mattress snugly.  The quilt also washed up very well, and the "shabby-chic" aspect of the quilt really reveals itself upon pulling it from the washer.  The layer under the flowers that was left to fray does so and looks super cute! After washing I laid it out on the dining room table and used my tiniest scissors to snip the threads from the fringes that were a little too much and then draped it over the porch railing to dry in the sun.  Now it is displayed over the crib railing just for looks.  I'm holding on to the bumper to wash and use when baby is much older, as you aren't supposed to use them these days, and the bed skirt I didn't wash, but just ironed and installed on the crib and it looks great!So, for quality (great weight to the quilt!), style and functionality I would definitely recommend this set to another mom wanting a good look for their buck!
