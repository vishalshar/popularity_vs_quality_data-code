I like this changing pad cover because it is cute and soft. Usually only my baby's head comes into contact with it though, because I put a changing pad liner down under her body. Liners are easier to throw in the wash than taking this cover off of the changing pad. Since I always have the liner down, the animals on it are covered up, so it looks like I just have a neutral colored changing pad cover, which is fine with me, I still like it quite a bit.
