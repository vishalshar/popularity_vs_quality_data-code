I purchased this seat for my son last month after lots of research.  However, because we live a good distance away from any big baby stores I was unable to actually try this exact seat.When it arrived I unpacked it and read the manual, then put my son in it and tried to adjust the straps to fit him with no success (and lots of screaming on his part).  So I read the book again, tried again, and still had problems.  I called Evenflo and a representative named Jessica talked me through the process with the same results.  When I tightened the harness with the knob adjustment, the shoulder straps separated and fell off his shoulders, if I got them straight then the strap was too loose at his hip area.I know, some of you might read this and think, "what a dummy!" which is what I was thinking at this point.  For a somewhat educated individual, this was just beyond me.  For that matter, we also own an Evenflo Titan car seat which had been a breeze to figure out, but it has a single strap very similar to the Graco infant seat.  When I relayed this to the Evenflo rep, she explained the the double strap is part of the "Memory Harness" but that it is only briefly mentioned in the manual.  Since it is supposed to make it easier to get your child in and out, not harder, they would just send me a new seat to try.The new seat has arrived and seems to be working much better. My son seems to enjoy the high-up view and it is much cushier than the Titan, so it has to be more comfortable. It still takes me forever to adjust, but I think it is well worth it to have such a safe seat with all the comfort features this one has (and still $50 cheaper than the Britax).One other note for you online only shoppers like me--this is a substantial seat (like the LaZBoy of car seats) for all its' cushiness.  It was a tight squeeze in my little car, but is great in the truck.
