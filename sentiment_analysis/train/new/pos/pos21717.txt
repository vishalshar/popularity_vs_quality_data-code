The size is perfect for a regular size bath tub! And even if the baby wobbles from side to side the it seems that if they were to fall over they wouldn't hit the  hard tub. The bottom is not as all slippery when sitting in it.The only downfalls I have are that the front area where the soap holder is, is too wide to fit over the standard faucet to fill, and it you try to turn it around the monkey head rest takes up too much room to fill from the back. We fill the regular tub up with clean water and then scoop in into the blow up tub with bubbles. It also does not have a bottom plug to drain it so you have to dump it each time.Also the suction cup broke off after repeated use but that's not too big of deal. The temperature reader works at first but my son was able to get off very easily.
