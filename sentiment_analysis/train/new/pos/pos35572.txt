The Combi is an excellent stroller. It is lightweight but not small. It can accomodate children of varying sizes. The build quality is also very good. Some other reviewer mentioning the bad wheels must be driving nascar style. For normal use the wheels are built just fine. The shoulder strap is very comfortable. The seat height is also perfect for feeding or entertaining your baby when on the go.My only complain is that I wish it was easier to fold and unfold with one hand. My wife traveled with it alone and it was really hard to fold unfold while holding the baby, a diaper bag and a knapsack. And, you have to fold unfold it to go through security as it needs to go through the scanner. If there is someone else to help out it is not an issue.Hope this helps
