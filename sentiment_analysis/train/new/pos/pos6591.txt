I am a 15 year old person who has a bad habit of chewing on my rubber bracelets, erasers, pens, and other such items. Chewing helps me focus and can even help me calm down after a lot of excitement, so I bought this. I was very excited to see it came with a bracelet! I have had it for a few weeks and both necklace and bracelet have stood up to regular chewing with adult teeth (my teeth). The necklace DOES NOT COME WITH A CLASP, which may be an issue for those buying this for small children, as it could become a safety hazard. It dries very quickly, so you will not need to worry about it staining your clothes. I wash mine every day when I brush my teeth, so as not to let it become a germ or dirt magnet. For other teens/adults who chew (teens who chew pencils, autistic adults who chew as a stim) I would warn you that the necklace does not look like a regular pendant; it will be obvious that it is not fashion jewelry and so you may receive questions about it. I only wear it around the house. However, the bracelet looks like a pretty normal round rubber bracelet, so no one will ask about it! I wear it often. My only issue with this product it does not come with a clasp.
