These are exactly what I was looking for to use on my glass desk at the office.  The corners are at eye level for my 1-year old golden retriever.  They stick well with the adhesive strips provided.  As far as the aesthetics...they are not necessarily pretty.  But they are functional.  My kids are all grown but I imagine that if I had little ones they might want to play with these because they are so squishy.  Not an issue with my dog and they have provided me with great peace of mind!
