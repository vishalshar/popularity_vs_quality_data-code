In the comments here, some people were concerned that this isn't original Medela brand tubing. I ordered these from Amazon, and at the same time ordered a set directly from Medela. They came in identical packaging (bright pink sticker on the front), so I know that these sold on Amazon are also from Medela. The tubes are open on one end, and have the yellow adaptors permanently in the other end, so they connect to the Pump-In-Style perfectly. These tubes go with the Medela Pump In Style Advanced Tote.
