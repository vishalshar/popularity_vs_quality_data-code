We got this for our daughter when she was one month; it was basically her first toy. She (The Pink Princess) has spent her life attached to the rock and play or the car seat and seen various levels of interaction as the baby got older. Games such as batting, grabbing, crinkling the noisey ears, or sticking various parts in her mouth. Today (almost the months later) we reached a new high. The baby had giggled before at such hilarious activities as putting on the carrier or wooshing scarves across her face but today she had her first real giggle fit thanks to this little toy and its hilarious vibrations. Thanks Pink Princess, you are full of giggles.
