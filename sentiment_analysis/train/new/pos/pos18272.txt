I tried to get these at Costco where they typically sell for $18 for the lot of 3 but our Costcos were always out of stock of them and we got to the point of just needing them for school.  So, while I would have preferred to have paid $18, I am happy to have them.  I love that the mouthpiece is covered when in the down position, unlike a Camelbak, which keeps it a little cleaner.  I love the big loop to carry it.  I love the colors.  What I don't love?  How crazy these things are to try to clean.  We only put water in ours, but I know even water will start developing gunk after a while. I pull it apart as much as possible but there are always places that you cannot reach with bottles designed like this.
