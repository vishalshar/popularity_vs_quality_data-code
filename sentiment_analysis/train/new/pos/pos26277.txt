My husband and I LOVE these bottles.  My son has been using them since he was 1 week old.  I have not had any issue with the "gasket" melting in a the dishwasher (I even use our sanitation rinse option).  I take them apart, place the gasket and nipple in our dishwasher basket on the top rack and they are ready to go!I do let all pieces dry thoroughly and carefully place them together.  You have to line up the bottle with the bottom part with gasket just right, if not they will leak.  Each leak we had was "user error" not a defect of the bottle.  I highly recommend these BPA free bottles and will not use another brand!
