Let me start off by saying the first of these I received (purchased) had a few manufacturing flaws.  One of the base pipes was not manufactured properly and no matter how many times we switched them around, would not go together.  The plastic molded seat has 4 wheels attached on the bottom so it can go around 360 degrees.  Ours had 1 wheel missing, making it impossible to even fit in, let alone twirl.  I had reviewed many jumperoos and wanted this one because of the soft blue overhead tube to attach toys to so I ordered another one immediately through Amazon and it came the very next day before I even had time to send the "bad" one back.  Thank you Amazon!  I am glad I did.  Being a grandma with a 4 month old grandson who just got to the point he is tired of always being placed on his playmat, bumbo chair, or carried around in grandmas arms, the first day he tried this jumperoo he is one happy little guy!  Like most other reviewers his feet do not touch the floor yet and I played around with different size pillows for the full effect of jumping, he loves all the toys, the music, and the fact that grandma doesn't have to hold him in the standing position, he can do it (to some extent) himself.  He wears himself out jumping and therefore naps better, too.  Grandma loves that).
