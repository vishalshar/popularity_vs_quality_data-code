I bought this for our son who will be due soon. I was able to put it together in like 30 min. The instructions were really easy to understand and the pictures helped. Some of the pieces were already assembled so that made it even better. It has great features; being a playpen, bassinet, changing table. Comes with mobile and diaper sack. Only $90, can't really beat it. The only thing (which wasn't a big deal to me) is that the mobile doesn't rotate on it's own or play music. So if you're looking for something like that, then this isn't it. But that wasn't one of my criteria and for the price I paid and all the other additives, I have no complaints.
