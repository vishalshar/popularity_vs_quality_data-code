I was surprised to see all the negative reviews. I’ve had my two Rockstar Itzy Ritzy Bento Boxes for over two years without problem. I do put them inside another protected lunch bag just because I add a juice box on the side. The only reason, I’m buying another one is 1) I love it so much and 2) it broke only because I dropped it on a hard surface and the corner cracked. Even with the crack it was still usable. Please don’t be dissuaded by all the negative reviews. It has saved me time in the morning from having to pack individual baggies, no more crushed cookies, and so easy to whip up a healthy balanced lunch. I panicked when I had difficulty finding its replacement because the design and compartment sizes are perfect for us.
