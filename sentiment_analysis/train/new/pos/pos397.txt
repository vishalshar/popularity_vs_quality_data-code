i bought this to lock our pantry closed (it has double doors with lever handles that don't turn they just pull open.). It works well to keep my shelf-scaling 2 year-old from the chocolate chips- but only by using 2.  As other reviewers have mentioned, one was definitely not long enough.  The handles are pretty close and I don't see how 1 strap could fit around refrigerator handles either.  And the adjustable end has no stop at the end of the strap so you really can't have it lengthened all the way or it will slide off.  But having 2 is the perfect solution.  They buckle in a loop and I can tighten them with enough extra strap (about 1.5" in my case) that they won't slip open if pulled on.  It's the same as an average stroller buckle, so any child that can undo one of those can open this, unless you are putting it out of their reach.  My 4 and 6- year olds have no trouble, but the 2 year-old can't open it.  Perfect for my situation.
