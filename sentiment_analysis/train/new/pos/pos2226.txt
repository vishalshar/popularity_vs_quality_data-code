We already had been using this unit for our first child who is now almost 3 and needed an additional unit for our 2nd child who was just born.  The sound call has been perfect and never given us any issues.  If you are getting static you need to adjust the frequency on the units which is very easy to do.  I would suggest this unit to others.Update 2/11/2016I am still using two seperate Sony 900MHz Baby Call monitors with one being almost 5yrs old with nightly use.  The units are still working as intended with no issues or problems that I have to work around.  I don't get the feedback in the frequency as other reviewers have mentioned unless I am close to my cell phone which is normally being charged overnight when they are in use.  I still love them and wouldn't exchange them for any other product like them (same basic function) other than maybe one that actually has a camera to see your babies.  Just wanted to say still going strong and the product lasts with everyday use.
