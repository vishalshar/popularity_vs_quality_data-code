I hope other mommas read this review and consider my opinion! I use this thing everyday in the winter and get to keep my sanity by going outside to get "momma time"!  When I bought the BOB revolution stroller, I looked into buying the shield and actually waited until cold weather hit.Here are the reasons I love this accessory:Keeps my baby warm and cozy!! I am able to go walking/jogging and use this shield in the ranges of 30- 55. They recommend not using it if temps are over 65, and I agree that it's way to warm if used in the warm sun. I feel that I can bundle my baby enough to not use the shield if it's above 55 degrees.Keeps him dry and out of the wind!We were walking on a cloudy, dreary day in TN and it began misting. I got wet, but my baby slept the whole time in his little cozy greenhouse!Allows him to enjoy SceneryMy baby gets bored easily and loves the changing scenery in the stroller. I was worried that he wouldn't be able to see out with the shield, but he still can! I can tell that he likes the ride with the weather shield and still thinks it fun with it on the stroller!Easy to take on and off!It takes me about 40 seconds to put this on and less time to take it off!It's safe!You must read the instructions of how to use it safely.( how to keep air vents open to allow carbon dioxide to escape). I feel that it gives adequate air flow!Momma get to view baby anytimeI like how the Velcro straps can easily come undone so I can peep in on baby to see how he's doing! I can even leave it open if it's just a chilly day to keep him in full view.Don't hesitate if you are a regular exerciser/strolling momma! It's totally worth it in the winter and on misty days!
