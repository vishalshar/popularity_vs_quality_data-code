My baby isn't born yet so I haven't used it but the setup was super easy and it's a good looking stroller/car seat.  It seems to maneuver smoothly.  So far so good!Update - I adore this stroller.  It rides smooth and goes over all terrains easily.  It's easy to break down and fits in the trunk of my car.
