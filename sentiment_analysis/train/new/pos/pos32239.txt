Love this! I finally found a seat that fit my son!!! He's 17 months, 33lbs, 35". He's been extremely interested in potty training, but I had to put a hold on it because I couldn't find one that worked! :( I bought 3 others before this one and they all were ok, but when he actually 'went,' it went all over! This has a higher guard that is perfect, and a larger seat altogether!
