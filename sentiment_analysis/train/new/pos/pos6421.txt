Your child is either on team sleep sack or not, so this review touches on parenting OPINION that should not interfere with the review of this product. This is a well built, light weight sleep sack. My daughter is 37" tall and weighs 32lbs and this sack has room to spare. (See photos)My daughter has used some form of swaddle or sleep sack from a very early age. She was raised with a very consistent bedtime routine that includes entering the dimly lit bedroom, rain machine playing, nighttime books and, of course, putting on her sleep sack. The sleep sack is the final piece that puts her in a chill mood for books and bed. As soon as her arms are in this thing, her eyelids get heavy, the thumb goes to her mouth and she's done with any thoughts of negotiating to stay up later. It's almost creepy how quickly she calms down.With that in mind, we've had to find ever larger sleep sacks to accommodate her. This sleep sack fits her well. Its light weight makes it perfect for warmer weather. The loose fit and open foot design also make it comfortable. Although we have nudged her to ditch the sleep sack, she continues to ask for her "cupcake sack."I would recommend this sleep sack.
