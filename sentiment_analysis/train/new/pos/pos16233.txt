We own 2 different bouncy seats. Both are Fisher Price - the Itsy Bitsy Bouncer & Soothe N' Play Safari Bouncer.To quickly compare the two: the spider bouncer seemed uncomfortable for our son until around 8 weeks old. It is much larger & sits very upright - which is great now for after feedings. It is also more substantial than the Safari one - and has less spring in the seat. Although he's still rather uninterested in the toy bar (I almost always leave it removed from seat) I'm sure he'll be intrigued by it soon enough. The music is really cute & not as annoying as most - even my husband agreed. The vibration is much stronger on this seat - it rattled all of the plastic parts until the baby was about 11 lbs and weighted it down better.I've found that having both seats is handy. We keep one upstairs & the other down. If I had to pick just one for the early weeks of a newborn, the Safari sure helped our lil one sleep & take naps. The seat has plenty of "give" and that's just what was needed to gently rock our wriggling lil guy back to sleep when he stirred. The vibration is nice - although I never leave it on for more than 10 minutes or so at a time. The Safari seat also looks really nice in photos. I seem to take a lot of pics in the seats - and the neutral backdrop works great!
