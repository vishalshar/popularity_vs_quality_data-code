Aden + Anais Classic Swaddle Under the SeaI LOVE this blanket. We used this blanket with our newborn from the first day. This blanket ended up in some of our newborn pictures as well and it photographed lovely.These blankets can be used for so many uses, a nursing cover, a swaddle blanket, a playmat, a cuddle blanket, a stroller cover.  My favorite use of this one is to cover up my baby's legs in the stroller. We then use a second blanket to cover up the car seat as needed for lights while in stores/restaurants.PROS:adorable turtlessuper soft muslinmultiple usesgiganticcozyCONS:That it doesn't come in even bigger sizes for adults (kidding...well sort of!)The quality of this blanket is far superior to other swaddle brands I have used. I highly recommend the Aden + Anais Classic swaddle over some of their other lines as well.I paid full price for this item and would purchase again as gifts.
