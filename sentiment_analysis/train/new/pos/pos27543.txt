We use these with breastfed poop diapers. Once poops become solid, they are tippable straight out of the diaper, so why use a liner, you know?When baby is small, you can actually rip these liners in half and only use half of the sheet. After awhile, we were able to predict when poops might happen and use them judiciously to conserve our investment. I typically used them in my AIO and fitted diapers to prolong their life. I wasn't concerned with my prefolds so much. (I would definitely use them on a pocket diaper if I had any of that type.)You can also spray them off with your diaper sprayer into the potty to toss them into the trash. We have older pipes in our house (and also in our previous apartment), so we were not able to flush ours down the pipes as advertised. But hey, biodegradable in the landfill for a few months is better than a disposable diaper and wipe in the landfill for 50+ years, right?TL;DR Yes, these are a good buy and do their job. Rip a sheet in half when baby is small, and be careful if you have older plumbing in your home.
