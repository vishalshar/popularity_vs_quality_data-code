I wanted a turtle rug for my baby boy's room and well.. I got one! It's adorable sure, but what is the point of a rug if your kid can't really play on it? It's the size of a door mat so I  guess it's a baby's room door mat! Also, it's very rough to the touch, I was testing it with my knees and hands a second ago and it was very scratchy but I'm pretty sure It'll wear down with time
