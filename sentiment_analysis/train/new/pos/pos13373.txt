Contrary to the other reviewer, I bought this stroller and am largely satisfied with it.  It is nice and lightweight, and folds down to be compact.  I like the 5 point harness and the ride is fine.  For strolling down the street, I put the front wheels in the fixed position and they do not get caught (something the prior reviewer may want to try).  For maneuvering in stores or other crowded spots, the front wheels will spin.  I have only two complaints about the stroller:  first, when you are pulling it up a step (backwards), the brake can be triggered; second, the handle is fixed so you and your baby are always looking in the same direction (ie, you cannot stare down at your little bundle, except through the window in the top of the canopy).
