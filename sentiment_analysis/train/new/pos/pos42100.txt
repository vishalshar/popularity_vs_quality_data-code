Even though these are made for children, smaller adults really appreciate this product which enables one to keep a seat belt off the neck and on the shoulder where it should be located.  My dermatologist noticed a lot of skin tags and moles developing on the left side of my neck and suggested this product.  Thank goodness Amazon had it because I could not find it in any auto parts/accessory store.  Bought the same brand years ago to match the interior of my car, but it finally wore out.  Originally, these were a bit larger, much better for adults and came in more colors.
