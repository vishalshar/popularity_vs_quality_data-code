PURPOSE: Purchased for 10 month old son.OVERALL: Great. These were the pacifiers that were given to my son while in the NICU. They are the only ones he seems to like. So while I do not know if it's "engrained" in him or he just prefers them, but we haven't had luck with others we've tried.PRO: Price, Child loves them.CON: None
