I spent a long time researching and debating over high chairs.  I have a 2 year old developmentally disabled son who still requires a high chair.  He was rocking so forcefully in his old high chair that the chair legs were coming off of the ground.  Also, I love that this high chair will be able to grow with him.What I love:1) Easy to clean the seat and the straps!!  The straps are super easy to remove and toss in the wash. (I had bought the Stokke originally and returned it because the cloth pillow they use for padding would be dirty after every meal!)2) My son sits really nice in it.  The material is somewhat rubbery so he doesn't slide forward.3) It is sturdy!!  He still does the same motion to try to rock the chair...but NO rocking!!! :)  It scoots a little due to his movement, but not much.4) It has a horn for the seat5) I like that there is a foot rest and his feet aren't dangling6) It is easy to place my son in the seat.  (the Stokke has kind of a bucket seat and I would have to thread my son's legs through each leg hole.  Not easy or fast...)7) 1 handed tray removal (the plastic part, not the wood part)8) It has a 5 point harness, but you can use it as 3 point is preferred9) Moves around easily on my tile floorThings that could be better:1) I wish it had maybe one more tray setting.  With the two currently the first setting my son can get his hands into his lap and with the second setting it pushes his bib up which tends to make it easier for the bib contents to dump out.  This will change as he grows...2) Sometimes the buckle doesn't click in super easy...but it isn't an issueI love it!!
