The Sugar Booger training cup is the best I've used so far. The lid is secure enough for table use, and there is no gadget inside the lid to slow the flow of liquid, so the lid serves simply to lessen spills. As my son has become older, it is simple to just offer the cup lidless, as the lid has no threads or bumps to hold it on. As a first lidless cup, the two handles add extra grip and stability. A word of caution, though: these cups are not unbreakable, my son threw his first one once, and it broke apart. However, they can handle quite a few drops and a lot of rough use. We have had the replacement for well over a year with no issues. These are not drip proof sippy cups, the lids are easy to remove and if your child leaves it on its side, liquid will dribble out. However, they are great training cups for use at the table or with close supervision. The simplicity of the parts allows thorough and easy cleaning, which is what first interested me. Most sippy cups are so elaborate that I hate putting milk in them because I'm never certain it all washed out.
