I bought my first model of this humidifier in 2005, still under Hamilton Beach brand name. I bought another one in 2009 under Graco brand name. The humidifier is reliable, and quite on low setting. Many people fail to recognize that standing room temperature water is always a great bacterial breeding ground, no matter what brand and type you use. Here is how I take care of it without using any chemicals (I don't think it is a good idea to breath the vapors from chemical additives).Daily:1. Flip the filter upside down. It prevents the filter from drying up on one side, improves its performance, and extends it life.2. Check water level in the tank and fill if needed. Do not allow humidifier to work without water. It will dry out the filter and you will need to replace it.Weekly:1. Clean the tray and the tank with soap. If you don't, you will get mold building up in the tray and the tank and eventually in the filter.2. I wash filter under cold running water. Takes few minutes but helps to extend the life of the filter.Annually:Clean the dust everywhere I can. A lot of dust gets accumulated by the end of the season.I get about 3 months from each filter.Seems like a lot of work? May be. But before buying the 2nd one, I tried many brands, vaporizers, etc...and all were disappointing. I decided to buy the 2nd one of the same model because it works better than others and I can deal with extra care.
