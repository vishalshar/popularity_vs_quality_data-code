I love the 3 in 1 feature.  Having the step stool is great.  The story is neat, but it can get annoying if the child keeps pushing the buttons over and over and over.  It says the top fits most toilets.  It does but it is a little shakey.  It doesn't seal around the lid, but rather has pegs that go inside the toilet bowl.  If the seat is round the top fits fairly snugly.  If the seat is more oblong, then the seat will move around a bit.  This is disconcerting to me, let alone my son.  Needless to say, he likes to just use it as the potty chair, and not on the "big person potty"/The splashguard for boys is also low.  We bought this as the first potty chair.  It got to the point where we wanted a potty on each floor.  So we bought a $7 Walmart chair.  The Walmart chair doesn't convert to a step stool nor does it have sounds or pictures.  It is a basic potty.  But the guard is much better.  We haven't had a single instance of him peeing over the top with the Walmart chair, whereas with this one, we have had more than a few.  He has to remember to point down.  He can be distracted on his Walmart chair.  However, this potty insert drains very cleanly compared to the Walmart chair which we have to wipe the edges down every time.If you want something plain, simple, easy to use, and no floor messes, pay $7 for Walmart.  If you want more bells and whistles, this is the most affordable option out there, can be fun, but can be messy for boys.
