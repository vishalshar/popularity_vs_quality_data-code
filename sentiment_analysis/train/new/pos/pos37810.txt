My four year old daughter received this princess, along with Melissa & Doug Smoulder the Dragon PuppetMelissa & Doug Smoulder the Dragon Puppet (which is great for left-handed folks) and Melissa & Doug King PuppetMelissa & Doug King Puppet for Christmas and let me tell you-we have had a wonderful time with these.  They are so well made for the money. Every member of the family (young and old) have had a blast with these. They work wonderfully with HABA Doorway Theatre .  I see many fun puppet shows in our future.
