My baby and I really like these pacifiers. They have always fit him (were never too big/small) from birth and up. Since the entire pacifier is encased in silicone, there are no hard parts that will hurt him if he lays on it, and no pieces to come apart if he yanks on it. At about 5 months, my baby started to chew it. No signs of wear and tear. I've been putting three in the crib: one to suck on and one for each hand. My baby likes to feel and squeeze it, but wants one in his mouth, too, so three seems to do the trick. Plus, any that fall out during the night can quickly be replaced by my baby or me with multiple pacifiers in the crib! I've also attached one to his car seat on a clip (see my review for the booginhead clip) and my baby loves that.I've read other reviewers who've said the pacifier came apart with little use, but I've never had any problems. I wonder if they were just defective. With that being said, always keep a mindful eye on your baby with anything you give them.
