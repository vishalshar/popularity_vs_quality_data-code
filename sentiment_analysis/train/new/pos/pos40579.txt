We took these to a family reunion camp with a couple of 5# sacks of spuds, and the kids AND adults had a blast playing with them!  A #1 size potato is just right for ammo--with the smaller size, you got plenty of shots and didn't waste too much of the potato.  Biodegradable, too, so I didn't worry about clean-up in the wilderness.  Could you find a toy that requires cheaper or more readily available pellets?  The guns are sturdy, and I like that you can take them apart to wash them.  We noticed toddlers don't have enough hand strength to pull the trigger, but it's loads of fun for the older set!  Even my uncle in his late 70's couldn't resist joining in.  I liked them so much that I came home and ordered a few for each family who had been there as Christmas gifts.  Hope it will bring back some fun summer memories in the dead of winter!
