Usually buy Baby Hugo Naturals shampoo and baby wash vanilla-chamomile (I DON'T like the smell of shea butter) since it has an excellent EWG SkinDeep rating, but it wasn't in stock this time. That's after I had been used to Loving Naturals Adorable Baby wash - which isn't even produced anymore! So ugh...off to find ANOTHER really safe, gentle, not ridiculously expensive, sls/paraben etc.-free product for my little ones. If you're conscious about these things, this Baby Mantra product is a good choice!I'm not sure what one reviewer meant about the "cheap cologne" smell - the only fragrance is lavender and honeysuckle - mostly lavender! That's what gives it the slightly spicy aroma - anyone familiar with lavender will recognize it at once.This lathers great - a little goes a long way - without leaving gobs of suds floating in the water (something I wondered about since it's also a bubble bath). Rinses clean easily too. Both my little ones have sensitive skin, prone to get a bit of eczema in the summer, and this is just fine, non-irritating.The one con is that I'm not sure if it's tear-free, usually a requirement for me. It isn't advertised as such, not on their website either, so i would assume not. However, I've seen other reviews where people have assured that it is. I haven't got it in my kids' eyes yet, so I can't say for certain!All in all, a really good shampoo/baby wash - I'll be buying it again.
