I bought this for my then 2 1/2 yr old, when I was pregnant with now 4 yr old (follow that?). I bought it because I was worried that my 2 1/2 yr old might feel left out when I was wearing the baby. She adored it. She would proudly wear her baby dolls in public while I wore her baby brother. My oldest, 4 at the time, also wore it on occasion (when little sis would give it up!). It has since been worn by that baby when his little sister was born. He also wore babies in public (trucks too, lol) and loved it.Five years in, we still have this doll moby and it still gets lots of use by the littles. The original kid it was purchased for is now 7 and a little old fr it. She uses it only rarely as a baby carrier. Otherwise, it is a skirt, a leash, a hammock for dolls, a blanket, etc.Anyone who is a fan of babywearing can't go wrong with this purchase for siblings.
