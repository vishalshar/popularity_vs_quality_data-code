These blankets are nice because they are small and light.  I mainly use them as a cover-up when nursing or pumping in semi-public places (i.e. the car).  It is so hot here in the summer, so this is a nice lightweight blanket, versus some of the other heavier flannel blankets.  It is too small for swaddling, but I didn't buy them with that intention.  If you are looking for a swaddling blanket or something warm, you might want to pass on these.  However, I am surprised how often I have used them.
