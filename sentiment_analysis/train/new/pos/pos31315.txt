we have 3 kids and all in boosters or regular car seats. and i have 3 in my minivan. all i have to say is that these really save your seat BIG TIME.. all the food and dirt that collects on them - i cant imagine having that stuck on my carseat itself. that would be just nasty.they are easy to remove and clean when i do my car cleaning and hold up beating really well too. no tears or rips at all. they are easily put back in.i would buy them over and over again. big money and time saver.
