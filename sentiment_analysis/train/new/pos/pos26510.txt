This is a cute set, good quality for the price, but you're not supposed to use a bumper or blanket in a crib anymore so that makes buying a set futile but I did it anyway cause I wanted the dust ruffle.  I bought a pink mesh bumper  and it goes fine with the color scheme.  I can use the blanket now that she's older and for decorative purposes, I used the dust ruffle and sheet and just draped the blanket over the back of the crib.  The fabric reminds me of a down comforter- very warm in the winter, and cool in the summer.  I'd give it 5 stars if the bumper were mesh!
