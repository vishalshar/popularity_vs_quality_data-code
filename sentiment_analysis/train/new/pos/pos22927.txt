This jumper is by far the most outstanding out of all the ones I've used for my children. When my oldest was little Graco made a Jane jump up. She loved it, and I thought it was the best thing in the world. Thinking that manufacturers in the U.S. had nothing but safety in mind, I did not let the huge spring inside of a large plastic triangle enclosure over my daughter's head bother me. Since my daughter loved her jumper so much, she jumped a LOT. I regularly had to adjust it for her growth and checked the strap because it seemed to loosen for some odd reason. But I didn't see any malfunction, and she went about jumping until one day the strap broke and the plastic triangle housing that held that heavy spring came straight down on top of her soft head. the blood curdling screams are something I never want to experience again. Graco refused to take my phone calls.After taking one look at this jumper I installed it (with children in tow) in about 45 minutes. Which is not an easy task, but does not reflect on the jumper at all. It is amazingly simple to install. My 3 month old loves it. She loves to kick and bounce, so this is now her favorite activity. But most of all..... I love that I can tell that there are no belts that will eventually wear at a point that I cannot see, nor are there any heavy parts to come crashing down onto my child. The minor additional cost is nothing compared to the potential savings in medical cost and pain to your child. I am so glad that someone has finally improved this devise and made it more safe for our children.
