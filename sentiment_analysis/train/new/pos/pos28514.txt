So, I bought this Boon high chair about 1 year ago, as of now, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! This is my 2nd child, and with my 1st I had a standard run of the mill Graco high chair, which was hard to clean in all it's nooks and crannies, and took up so much floor space, and didn't roll. This high chair is the easiest to clean baby item that we own! Let's face it, children can be messy while they eat, and not having to fuss over them making a mess is worth a million dollars! :The other selling point for me is that my daughter will be able to use this high chair as a normal chair when she gets older for years to come. The normal baby high chairs are not even close to being as versatile. My daughter is only 15 months right now, but she is the size of a two year old (at least) and she will still be able to use this chair up until the age of 4-5 years old....try and use a different high chair that long!I love being able to wheel it from the kitchen breakfast bar, to the dinning room table to the living room, or wherever! The fact that it can accommodate any height is amazing! This means I can feed her anywhere, and that is pretty awesome! You get the idea, I can't begin to say enough good things about this high chair!The ONLY neutral thing that I can say about this high chair is that if you plan on leaving your child in this high chair for long periods of time, this is probably not the high chair for you. It is well contoured and ergonomically designed, however it is not padded as much as the normal high chairs. This did not effect my family as the most my daughter sits in her high chair is about 20min- 1hour, and she seems perfectly happy!Putting it together was super easy, and only took about 10 minutes, so don't feel intimidated over that.The BEST  high chair for the money that I could find! I would recommend it to any and everyone!
