Really like this product.  However I think the usage instructions could be better.  It tells you to either mix with witch hazel to a pretty strong solution for a spray (not sure if this is meant to be sprayed directly on wipe or baby undiluted, because it doesn't say, but it seems like it would be way too harsh at that concentration without adding water.  The other suggestion is to "mix a few drops with water" to make a wipe solution.  Not very specific so you are kindof on your own to figure out what works for you and your baby.  From my own experience, I do like the product very much, however the directions need to be more detailed.  I fill up a small sink with hot water, add a splash of witch hazel and a single squirt of Potion and mix well.  Then I throw in my cloth wipes, gently squeeze out the excess and lay them in my Prince Lionheart Warmies wipe warmer which I LOVE!  I overdid it with too much Potion at first and it seemed to irritate baby's skin a bit and overwhelm the senses as Tea Tree oil is pretty potent stuff.  Three words - Less Is More (except when it comes to directions for use)!
