I have been buying these for the past 3 years now.  I get a set for each of my sons to give to their grandparents as a present.  My boys are now 3 & 4, so this will be the 4th set we do.  I have tried using other versions, but these are so quick and easy that I just keep coming back to them.  The marshmallow is a little bit sticky, but you just have to roll it out large enough for your kid's hand to fit completely when pressed down.  After rolling, press the handprint in.  Be careful of dirty fingers, because it shows up on the stark white of the clay, although we left one that way once, because it showed better detail on the palm.  If you don't like it, mush it up and re-roll.  After you are happy with the print, or given up on getting your kid to cooperate,  ;-) use the included circle to cut out the handprint.  Then, poke a hole for the ribbon, and leave to dry.  Make sure to give it some time to dry, because it doesn't happen overnight.  The grandparents love them, and they are on display front and center of their trees every year.  I think the kids will get a kick, seeing how much they have grown from year to year.
