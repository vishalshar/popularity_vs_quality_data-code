I am very happy with this purchase.My son is 20 months old, and I like using sleep sacks because he rolls around a lot when sleeping.When we used blankets, he would either get tangled in them, or the blanket would end up not covering him at all because he changes positions so much.This is more of a problem in winter.  We keep the house at a chilly 69 degrees, so I didnâ€™t like that my son could get cold when not covered by a blanket.The sleep sack has certainly solved the problem of him not being covered, and staying warm enough throughout out the whole night.I bought the XL size.Having read some of the other reviews / complaints about the sizing, I completely disagree with their sizing complaints.I am certainly glad that the sleep sack is longer than expected.That is exactly what I wanted, I mean, this is a growing boy, so if it was sized to reach just to the length of his legs then he would outgrow it in no time.The extra length is also good because then he can put his legs into it when sleeping.I also love that this sleep sack has leg openings, which makes it easier to stand up in his crib, and if he wants to walk around the cold house, he can.Finally the micro-fleece fabric is very soft and comfortable.  My son loves to cuddle up to soft fleece-type fabrics.
