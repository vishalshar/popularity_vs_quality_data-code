I'm a bit of a car seat freak for kids. When my daughter was too big for regular car seats and needed to graduate to a booster, I initially bought her a backless wlittle one. That wasn't horrible but I could see that she wasn't really comfortable and downright miserable on longer trips. This seat was recommended to me by a good friend. My daughter loves it. Loves the cupholders. Loves that it's roomy. It folds in half t easily leave at school for after class playdates.
