This chair is great to have in the nursery.  It is comfortable and reclines completely.  After spending 6 weeks in the NICU I can't even explain what it was like to have such a comfortable chair to come home to.  I actually have slept in this chair a couple nights when my daughter was sick.  Much preferred to bringing her into our bed!  A couple things to consider with this product: 1. the chair was delivered by a full size tractor and trailer which could not make it into my neighborhood, so my husband had to borrow a truck to meet the tractor trailer at a local feed store where it had another delivery.  2.The chair rubs a little when gliding towards the back which can be annoying at times.  It never sticks, but you can tell it is a tight rub.  3.  The back comes seperate and requires very little assembly (it just slides into the bottom piece), however the back of my chair does not fit snug on one side and when looking at the chair there is a gap between the seat and the back on one side.  4.  The chair also is sort of noisy, has a small squeek.  Overall, I think the chair is a little over priced however I am actually quite pleased with our purchase!
