We used this cute little game at a baby shower. I was nervous after reading the reviews about multiple winners, but decided to plan ahead based on that. The deck had one card in a plastic sleeve that was the winner. I held up all the cards against the natural sunlight and could see through them to know there wasn’t more than one winner (I saw the reviewer that said most of her cards were winners, that would be very frustrating!)When guests arrived they each got a lottery card and clothespins (for the game where you can’t say “baby”). Right before eating everyone opened their lottery card. It worked out really good at our shower. We also played the game on Amazon where you guess the ultrasound baby body part and measure moms tummy. Both of those are a little more time intensive and require more thought, so this was a great fast, easy game to balance that out. I had bought an extra set just in case we had more people show up and in case the few school aged children who came wanted one, but we only used one set. I definitely recommend this as a quick, but fun game at a shower. Just hold the cards up against some bright natural sunlight to double check you didn’t get too many winners.
