My little one switched back and forth easily from breast to bottle with these, and you can also purchase the sippy cup nipples (on Amazon) to fit them for later on down the road, which I appreciated. They never leak, unlike the Avent bottles I had with my other two children, and they are easy to wash with any bottle brush. Just be sure to put the little plastic disc in the top before putting the nipple on and shaking up your formula; if you try to shake it up with only the nipple and cap on, you will shake formula everywhere, as both have vents in them. It does take a little extra time to put the disc in and then take it out again after shaking, but that time is saved in the washing, since the parts are all so easy to clean (unlike Dr. Browns). My baby has not been gassy at all with these bottles, and I would highly recommend them to anyone, especially moms who intend to breast- and bottle-feed for a while.
