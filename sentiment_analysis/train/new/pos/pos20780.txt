We were given several pair of scratch mittens after we'd already bought these. My daughter constantly scratched her face as a newborn, and so she spent the first two months of her life in these mittens. The other mittens we'd been given never stayed on. These however, I can't remember them ever on e falling off, and yet they weren't to tight either.They're also super soft. We relied on them so much we ordered two more pairs despite their higher price tag. We also love that they're organic.She also used them again a year later as an extra layer underneath her knit mittens when we'd go on our daily winter walks. They're not super warm on their own, but their light weight material made them perfect for doubling up under heavier weight mittens.I also recently bought a pair for my brother and his wife who just had a baby and they to love them and find they stay on better than any other mitten.
