My daughter loves these things. I'm not sure what it about it, but she LOVES them for sleep time and relaxing. The material is very soft, and she likes to drape the blanket over her eyes when light is shining into her room and she is trying to sleep. I'm almost embarrassed to say this, but I've bought about six of these over the past two years. She loves them so much I have to keep stashes of them in different places.
