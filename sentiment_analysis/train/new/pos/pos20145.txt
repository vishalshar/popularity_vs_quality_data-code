I recommend this product. My daughter was 2 at the time I bought and installed it, and it is good as new a year and a half later. I do not think it should be called toddler corner Kushons as it has protected me many times too. It has prevented many bumps to my daughter's head. They are the same color as the countertop and they bend in nicely. If they did not bend it would not make a difference as their function far out weights aesthetics.Most of the negative comments were on the tape that is supplied. I  made note of this from the outset and had bought a different 2 sided tape hence I did not use the tape supplied. I hope the manufacturer takes note and change the tape as it is ruining the reputation of an excellent product.
