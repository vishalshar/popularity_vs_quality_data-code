I purchased this item as a visual stimulant for my baby while she's in her stroller/car seat. It is the perfect size/length to hang from the stroller canopy. I think it might be a little too close to baby to use on the infant car seat. Baby isn't quite here yet so I'm unable to confirm. The colors are nice and bright, sturdy construction. If you have a thin canopy it might have difficulty staying on since it clips/slides on. I have a Graco Modes travel system and it stays on pretty well.
