I think this is, so far, my wife and mine favorite toy we have given to our daughter. Our baby is currently 8 months old and enjoys this toy. Granted, a lot of times she just picks it up and tries to "eat" it, but even then it still serves it purpose! As she grows older this toy will continue to work for her.Very pleased with all the options this toy has:- Two volume levels. The highest volume isnt super loud, and as some reviewers have noted the speakers are on the bottom so it is slightly muffled sometimes. On the other hand, we've had some baby toys that are annoyingly loud so its nice to have a regular noise level toy- The keyboard has three settings: regular keyboard (pressing a key plays one note), song play (pressing a key plays one phrase of a song, has about 3-4 different songs), counting (playing the key says the number written on the key)- The keyboard also has three sound settings: piano, xylophone, flute (i think i am remembering those correctly)- A language setting, so the counting can be done in english, Spanish, or frenchSo as you can see, with all these options, this toy is very versatile. I am very pleased with how reasonably priced this toy is. It runs on AA batteries and comes with batteries already installed.If I had any complaints, i would say the sometimes the keys dont register a hit. For teaching cause and effect, it would be great if the keys always registered a hit when the baby touches it, but it is good enough. (Like sometimes when i am showing my daughter which key to hit, it wont make a sound, but i can hit it again the exact same way and it will register a hit then).
