I received the Safety 1st Safe Glow (audio) monitor as a baby shower gift and that works really well, and got the Safety 1st Crystal Clear (also audio) monitor as a free gift from amazon.com during a promotion (haven't used that one yet so couldn't tell you how that works), but when my daughter was born (first child), I found I wanted more assurance than an audio monitor provided and decided to get a video monitor.  The price was, of course, a lot higher than the audio monitors but after using this for several weeks now, I would have paid even more for it.  It's well worth the price.We have an apartment so the video monitor is never more than 20 feet from the camera/sensor, and there's been no problem with interference.  There's slight buzzing when the volume is turned up high, but I can still hear her clearly with the volume at the lowest setting and can't hear the buzzing.  The video is completely clear and has no static, even though it's separated from the camera by several walls and is in the living room, along with a 2-computer wireless internet network, cordless phone and other electronics.  This is definitely worth the price and I would recommend it to any new mother.
