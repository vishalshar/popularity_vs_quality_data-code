I am the crazy safety lady so this product caught my eye the minute we found out we were pregnant. At 4 1/2 months, the lap belt is creeping up my belly. So my husband ordered one of these for me since it is a reasonable price and the commute between our home and work has a lot of accidents... and we wanted to try it out. It is a bit of a pain installing it in the car (mind you, I was doing it alone while my husband was at work and was suffering from a cold/allergy combination so I could have been making it much harder than it was). Once it was in and secure, it works fantastically! It pulls the lap belt off of my belly and back in my lap where it belongs. I have had to hit my breaks a couple of times and the bump belt has kept everything in place. I feel completely confident that in the worst of circumstances, our baby will be safe from any belt trauma. I've forgotten to unlatch it from the seatbelt before trying to get up and it definitely holds you in there. Also, it is discrete and comfortable, my husband doesn't notice when he is driving the car that has it. We switch cars periodically so I will be buying 3 more so there is a bump belt in every driver's and passenger's seat.
