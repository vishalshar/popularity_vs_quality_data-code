Our twin daughters love this bouncy. They received it as a hand-me-down from a friend - so it has been thru 3 babies & is still in excellent shape. They much prefer it over their older sisters Eddie Bauer bouncy-  which I would definatly NOT recommend as she didn't like it much either. To address complaints in another post - why do you need to carry it by the toybar? It isn't a handle. It works just fine as a toy bar...For the first few months this bouncy was a lifesaver - both babies would fall asleep in here when nothing wlse worked. This was by far our best piece of baby equipment in the early months!! They do love the toys that came with it, expecially the rattle that turns, but play with them seperately while they are sitting/rolling around on the floor. They are now 7 months and we still use it occasionally for naps in the laying flat postiion - that's why I logged on here tonight to check the weight limit.
