My baby boy got his JazO's when he was just 5 months old.  He is smaller than most other babies his age, and feistier as well it seems :-).  Yet, he wears the JazO's with no problems!  The glasses are comfortable on him.  The strap is very soft (the glasses come with 2 straps, a smaller one for babies when they are younger and then a larger strap for older babies).  The strap is very easy to adjust (there is velcro on both ends of the strap) and the glasses can be put on and taken off very quickly and easily.  For comparison, my sister bought another pair of sunglasses for my baby boy, from Janie and Jack...They are not nearly as nice as the JazO's; they won't sit on my boy's face properly because they use a plastic frame instead of a soft band like the JazO's.  Not only is the band soft, but the glasses themselves don't have any sharp edges...so, when my boy is not wearing his glasses and is instead chewing on them (as he does evertyhing else he gets his hands on these days), I don't have to take his glasses away from him.  When we go out, he wears the JazO's with his hat and he's all good.  I am very pleased with the JazO's and highly recommend them!
