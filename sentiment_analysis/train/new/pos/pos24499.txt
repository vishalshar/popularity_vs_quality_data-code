I like the way these look, but the two larger ones were a bit big for my diaper bag. I had purchased these for a recent trip and thought this would be a good way to help organize the diaper bag and make things more accessible. What's nice about them is that the backside is mesh, so you can see what you are looking for without having to search too hard. Even though we didn't have any blowouts or diaper leaks, I imagine that putting the wet/dirty clothing into the dirty bag would have spread the mess throughout the diaper bag, because it is not waterproof. Overall, a fine product.
