My first review (way down below) was written after about a week of using the tops at which time I gave them a 5 star rating.My second review, after five months, was written when I had broken three of them trying to get them off the empty can, and I gave it three stars because I hadn't found the trick to getting the cap to let go ... I had not figured out what makes them decide to cling tenaciously to the can and I said I probably won't buy any more.WELL NOW, FINALLY, I KNOW THE TRICK!!  Trying to take them off the cold can when the plastic is also cold and stiff was the problem.  All you have to do is wait til the warm up or run them under warm water.  When they become more flexible again they come off easily.  Four stars and I'm buying more!Original Review:I don't know what all the controversy is about ... these things work GREAT!  At least, after I read the directions they did.  The first time I just tried to force one over an open can and wound up bending the can and spilling soda all over.  THEN I read the directions.  Quite simple, really; just unscrew the cap, place on top of the can, and then push on the top between the "ears".  Snapped right on my Coke product cans.  When you're done, push the ears towards the middle and it comes right off.No longer have to put up with flat soda for the three days it takes me to drink one.  Try 'em.
