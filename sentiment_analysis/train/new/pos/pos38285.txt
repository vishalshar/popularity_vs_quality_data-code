I have been meaning to write a review on this for some time, and unfortunately I think the company that sold me this product is no longer selling it on amazon, which is a shame because they had phenomenal customer service.  In brief: I received a defective product (the little weight wasn't attached properly and didn't work) and they sent me another, new rocker completely free of charge without asking me to return the defective one.  Quality.  Anyway, I have nothing but praise for this product.  Like most of the other reviewers, we were transitioning our baby from swing to crib and this helped us to get "over the hump."  She is now sleeping well in the crib but still wakes up and fusses, setting the rocker off 2-3 times per night (it is very responsive to her crying/fussing).  When the shaking starts, her cries turn to coos and she goes back to sleep.  It's great.  We've had it for 3 months now, it goes off multiple times per night and we're still on the original set of batteries.  The only problem is that she's now "addicted" to the rocking which makes traveling difficult because the thing doesn't attach to a pack n play.  But otherwise, no complaints.
