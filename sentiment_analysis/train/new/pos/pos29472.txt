Love love love this!! I had a bjorn from my first child that I didn't use much because she had me all to herself. Now I have a 9 week old son with bad reflux and MSPI that needs to be held all the time and an active clingy 2 year old I need both hands for. Baby wearing was suggested to me so I used the bjorn because I already had it. My son is 12 pounds and my back was killing me after wearing him for an hour. I wear this all day and it's significantly better. Yes there's a ton of material and it could be overwhelming if you're tiny, but you'll get the hang of it. the color (eucalyptus) is really pretty and suitable for gender neutral.  The material is interesting and has a nice stretch to it; that said its heavy, I don't know how comfortable that'll be in warm weather.  I put my cell phone in the pouch in the front, it's a huge pocket but I don't know what else you'd put in there, it comes all folded up on itself and somehow fits into the pocket but good luck figuring out how to do that again. It's adjustable and you can tailor it to the size of your baby bc its just one long huge piece of material. I like that I can put it on and keep it on all day and take my son in and out of it without rewrapping. It comes with directions for the standard wrap with the baby facing you on your chest but claims to have other wearing options. I've visited the website they recommend to find other options but I couldnt find any other options. I'd love to know which other options there are. The price is kinda high, I think it's the most expensive wrap I saw. I'd like to say it's bc it's the best but I really don't know. I can say it's so much more comfortable and supportive than the original bjorn.
