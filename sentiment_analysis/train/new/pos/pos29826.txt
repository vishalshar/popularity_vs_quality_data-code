I purchased two of these bins, along with two of the larger size bins of the same style. They are decent size (look at the product specs to make sure it is the right size for your needs), it matches our decor, and they look a lot better than some of the wicker baskets.If you are expecting a basket with hard, sturdy sides, this is not the item for you. It is not a fabric covered basket. It is as described, a fabric bin. It is fabric over a metal frame.I have used one in our entryway, one in my office and one as a bedside bin to hold my reading materials, projects, notebooks,etc.
