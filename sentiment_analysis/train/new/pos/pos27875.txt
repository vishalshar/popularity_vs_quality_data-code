This is such an adorable little duck.  I bought it for my godchild for Christmas because she collects rubber duckies.  This one was so different and unusual that I had to get it for her.  All of her duckies look mostly the same but this one really is something special.  She is only a year old but she was super excited upon opening the package.  This is her new favorite duckie!  I can't wait to get her the others!
