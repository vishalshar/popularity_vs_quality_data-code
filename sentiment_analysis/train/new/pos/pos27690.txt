Allows for you to make 3 bottles almost instantly.  The opening fits inside the bottle so you simply tip it upside down into bottle that is already filled with water.  Couldn't be easier.It is pretty basic, a container split into 3 sections with a tightly fighting snap on lid.  The hole has a cover, so you turn to have the hole over one of the three sections, open the hole cover and pour into the bottle, and since it fits inside the bottle opening, you can easily pour it in.  Once complete, if you need to make another bottle, just twist top to next section.  You have to pre-measure the powder, as there is no measurements on this container, so you have to  know what size bottles you typically use to work with this.
