What can I say... this tub is awesome. So good that I bought it twice. I first owned it for my boys, and used it primarily when they were too small to sit up unassisted. The recline of the tub, combined with the snap in bar for baby's tush makes for a perfectly comfortable bath for baby. I was able to put enough water in to get the boys clean, and enough for them to have some fun splashing, but it never was so much that it got near their ears or face. Once my boys outgrew it, I gave this to a friend for her to use.... she loved it as much.Fast forward a few years - pregnant with my daughter, I begin searching for a baby tub. I looked at, and tried, several before I went on the hunt for the whale. Bought it again, loved it again. My daughter used it much longer than my boys did... she liked sitting up in it well after she could bathe in the big tub. I guess she liked to be a bit more confined in her bath. She used it until she was nearly 1, so I'd say I got my money's worth out of this.One nice feature they added between the first and second I owned was a drain plug. If I had any criticism of the whale, it would have been that - but no more!
