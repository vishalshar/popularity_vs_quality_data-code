I ordered this for my 4 month old,  he's nearly 6 months now and uses it several times a day.  Soft and thick mat has washes very well.  I've brought it to grandmas a few times,  take down and set up is very easy.  Baby loves the lights and moving birds and I love that it goes with the decor in our living room.
