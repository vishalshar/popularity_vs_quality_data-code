This is very handy for feeding my baby solid foods while we're out-and-about, when a bowl and spoon are needed.  The spoon snaps into a neat little compartment in the lid of the bowl, so you can just toss the whole thing in your diaper-bag and rest assured that the head of the spoon will stay safe and sanitary until baby is ready to eat.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the spoon is a bit wide, but my 10-month-old manages it just fine, and she's on the petite side.  It might be an issue if your baby's mouth is very small, but even then, the size of the spoon shouldn't be problematic if you make sure to scoop the food onto the edge of the spoon.  Plus, the bowl & spoon are BPA-free and phthalate-free, which are safety bonuses.  I definitely recommend this product if you're looking for an easy, sanitary way to spoon-feed your little one while on-the-go.
