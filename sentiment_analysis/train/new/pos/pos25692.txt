...to keep the wood from splitting when wet.let it dry BRISTLES FACING DOWN so that the water runs off the brush and does not collect at the base. this is a simple solution but if you don't do it the wood will buckle and crack. I read all the reviews that mention this and bought it anyway thinking the company might have solved it. they had not. so my brush faded and split after the initial wash the company recommended in the instruction. I retuned that brush (thank you amazon) and got a replacement. it has worked perfectly and I have washed a couple times since.
