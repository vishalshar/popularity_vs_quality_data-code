After reading some of the reviews I was not sure if this was a good product. All reviews for this type of potty seat are about the same. All of them have a little wiggle room and they need to be placed on rim of toilet not seat to work the best. I have a rambunctious 2 1/2yr old and this works fine for him. I told him to hold on and dont jump or move around to much and he does excellent. He loved it right away out of the box. Good colors to make it look like a toy and then the comfort of not thinking he was going to fall in was all he needed to start goin on toilet. Wish I had bought this seat before all the other crappy ones I got. The 3-in-1 feature is awesome and there really is no need for other seats. Only caution and why not 5 stars is that the rim in the front could be just a inch or so higher every once in a while urine can get over edge but we are just working on holding it down and that really works fine.
