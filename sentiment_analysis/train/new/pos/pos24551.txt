These Ring snuggles work great if your ring does not fit. I have my wedding band and a engagement ring, the largest one included fit around both and works well to keep my rings from falling off. The package comes with assorted sizes which is great since determining the size before you have them is somewhat difficult to do. My rings were going to cost $700.00 to size so I went with this option instead. The price is great and if you are looking for a much less expensive option than getting them professional sized I recommend the ring snuggies. They are fairly easy to get on and off if you are like me and take them off for the shower.
