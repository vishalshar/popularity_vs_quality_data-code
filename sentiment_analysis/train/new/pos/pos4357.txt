I did extensive resarch on what I considered to be most important in an umbrella stroller - portability and proper handle height.  This stroller fit the bill, with its adjustable handles and easy closure.  I can go for long walks, do errands and hop on the bus when I need to, all without much effort.  This is very important to me as a mom on the go - without a car.  One thing that I could NOT STAND on most strollers is my feet kicking the back wheels and being hunched over, which prohibited good posture and getting proper exercise as I walked. This stroller allows me to multi-task (exercise briskly while getting errands done).  I'd recommend this stroller.
