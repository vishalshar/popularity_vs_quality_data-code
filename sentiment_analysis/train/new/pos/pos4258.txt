I ordered this and it was really easy to put together.  It's good quality for the price, too.  It IS pretty narrow, however, my husband and I are average size (I'm an 8 before pregnancy) and we both fit in it - but it's not roomy at all.  There's no room to move around but is quite comfortable nevertheless.  It glides silently and the cushions are fine.  Overall, I'd recommend it if you are looking for something that is good quality but don't have a ton of money to spend on the best quality and roomiest.  Our baby isn't due for another month so I can't say what it will be like rocking a baby, but for now we love it!  In fact, my husband is in it right now napping.
