I ordered these for the abundance of unlabeled breast milk in my refrigerator. It seemed like every week I was throwing away a bottle of breast milk because I couldn't remember when I had pumped it... For breast feeding mom's out there, you know how much it sucks to have to throw away 5 oz of good breast milk because you couldn't remember how old it was. We didn't want to use just regular labels or tape because we didn't want any sticky residue on the bottles/tops. These work great they stick well, even when the tops are thrown in the sink and allowed to get wet. But they still come off easily and they don't leave a residue on the plastic. My only issue with them would be the predesignated lines for name and date... the lines are a little small, our last name has 11 letters in it. Even writing small, it won't fit. Luckily I only need for the dates. Make sure you have a sharpie or something like it, it will save you some hassle when writing on the labels.
