I am giving this necklace 5 stars.  It didn't look exactly like the picture, it was lighter as another reviewer mentions, but it was still green and it looked nice on my 17 month boy. My necklace was 12.5 inches and it was a good length for him; and he's not a small boy.  I bought this to replace 2 anklets from a different company that had fallen off.  Does amber work?  It is subtle, it's not a huge difference you would see with Tylenol, it is soft, they may feel a little more comfort but not numb.  I bought a necklace in hope it would help with my boy's drooling.  I am not sure that it worked because I didn't have the chance to find out.  I left him with his father to take my daughter to meeting and I cam back and my son'd necklace was gone.  Like without a trace.  I can only think my son was pulling on it and the clasp came open (which I am GLAD that it does, for safety) and the necklace flew somewhere we haven't found yet.  That or my son threw it in the garbage, like he does with stuff if we don't watch him.5 stars based on: I have experience with amber, and this was real amber; I loved the color on my boy; the clasp came apart when tugged hard on (I assume) piece of mind about strangulation.I hope to buy another one someday, I'll have to save money again.  Maybe I'll get the same color, maybe a new one!
