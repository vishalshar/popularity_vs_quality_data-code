I loved this infant bather!  It really helped when I gave my baby her first bath.  I felt safer knowing she wouldn't slip down into water but had the comfort of the warm water under her and when I used the faucet sprayer in our kitchen (on the lowest setting).  She loved this bather and I'm glad I purchased it.  I would definitely recommend to anyone who had or is having a newborn and just needs that little bit of extra security when bathing their baby.  Oh let's not forget it really helps not having to bend over and hurt your back.
