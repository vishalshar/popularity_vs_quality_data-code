Five stars mostly for the great customer service at the Sassy company.  After our little guy's phone took a bath, we called to ask how to dry it out (since it is machine-sealed).  I called outside of business hours and left a message with little hope of a helpful reply.  But, the next day I was phoned by a representative who not only knew what to do, but had knowledge of their own tests experience with this product and water. Then, out of the blue, a week later we got a replacement phone in the mail.  We didn't even ask for that and wouldn't have expected it had we asked.
