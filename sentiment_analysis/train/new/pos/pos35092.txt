This stroller is just awesome!  With a small car, back seat is nothing but car seats, front seat is nothing but baby diaper bag & toddler stuff and the the trunk is filled with the stroller.  This stroller saved me from having to buy a bigger vehicle as it takes up very very very little space so groceries now can fit in the trunk.  The awesome thing is that I'm not struggling to collapse it or open it as I did with the big bulky thing.  After collapsing I can put in the trunk with just one hand too instead of fighting to get it in with both hands and my whole body.  The back breaks had a 'sticking' issue of this stroller, but, customer service at gogo baby swapped it out quickly and pleasantly.  I couldn't have had a better experience.  I'm glad I stalked out the woman I saw with one and get so excited to dimenstrate how easy it is to all that have stalked me.  I saw some people slammed the handle as cheap/flimsy, but, I didn't think so; however, if you are really tall and have a heavy child you'd have to extend the handle all the way out and it wouldn't be as sturdy as it is for me, so, it is possible..... (I'm 5'4' with a 18lb in a graco safe seat and plan to continue the dedicated rear up to 30lbs like I did the first time---3yrs ish so I'll be using this for awhile.)  Oh, almost forgot....plus, it saves that wrist from stress of carrying baby in the safe seat as it is the heavy (biggest) dedicated rear!This stroller is my best baby purchase yet!
