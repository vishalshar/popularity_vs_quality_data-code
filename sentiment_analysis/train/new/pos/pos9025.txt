This chair is good and very comfortable to sit while rocking the baby to sleep. The seat has a thicker cushion than my friend's gliders and the back cushion is high enough to not slouch or slip down below your head and neck. The ottoman should be higher, but I remedy this by putting a small nursery pillow on top of it. The one really bad thing about the chair is the locking mechanism that allows for the various positions. This slips and gets stuck in a stationary locked position quite often. I ended up removing the mechanism completely from the glider and now it glides perfectly. I found no use for the mechanism when it was installed, so I would recommend everyone to assemble their gliders without the locking mechanism to prevent future headaches. The rating of four stars assumes the locking mechanism is not installed. If you were to install the mechanism, I lower the rating to two stars because it will eventually prevent the chair from gliding at all.
