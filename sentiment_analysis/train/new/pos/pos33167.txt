I've purchased Yookidoo products in the past and was in need of a new bath toy and thought this would be a good additional to our bath routine. My son is 2 years old. The fountain works well and is easy to assemble and use. My son enjoys playing with and stacking the toys, as well as interchanging the characters as they all spray differently. I'd definitely recommend this product. Only drawback is that is doesn't play music, would be nice to have some tunes (like the Musical Duck Race).
