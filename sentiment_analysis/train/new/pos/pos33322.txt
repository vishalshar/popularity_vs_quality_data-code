Absolutely love this sheet! I purchased it during my last pregnancy "just in case" my water would break and to have some additional protection on my mattress during breast feeding time (leaky boobs). Main criteria for me was that this protects my mattress AND that it doesn't make me sweat my tail off which usually happens with rubber coated or PVC coated water resistant sheets.This however has no "plastic" coating and consists of 100% breathable cotton but I honestly wasn't sure if it was up for the task.No worries.So far it has held up to all expectations.My water did break in bed and I had nothing go through on my mattress. The sheet also has prevented boobie leaks from staining and soiling my mattress rather well these past 8 weeks.In other words it is just fabulous. In case you're wondering it feels a lot like heavy duty Jeans material but it is also nice and soft to the touch.I bought this sheet in the "portable crib" size with the intend of using it in my sons crib during potty trainin time a little further down the road. I'm pretty sure it will manage this task just fine.Thumbs up! Definitely worth the money. I'm considering to get the King size sheet for my bed soon.
