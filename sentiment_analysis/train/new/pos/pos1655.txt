indestructible.  One of my favorite toys, it makes a giggle sound when you drop it, I kept it when my son outgrew it.  We recently got a border collie puppy and it is her favorite toy and believe me, she has tons of toys.  If this toy can survive her, you will never destroy it.  Now, I'm sure the manufacturer does not recommend this as a dog toy and it might not be a good idea to leave it with a puppy unsupervised but so far it looks brand new and its been through kids and now a puppy.So I got another, for a baby gift.
