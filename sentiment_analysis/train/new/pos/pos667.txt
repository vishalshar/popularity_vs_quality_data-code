We've been using our Diaper Dekor for more than two years now.  In all that time, the Dekor has held up wonderfully.  After hearing friends complain about the two-handed requirements of Diaper Genies and the like, we went with the Dekor because the easy, one-handed operation was appealing -- just stomp on the pedal and throw in the diaper.  We were also glad that the product was so well-reviewed; it turns out that those good ratings are very well deserved.Our Dekor works so well that we keep it in the family room, where we spend most of our time (bonus: we don't have to run upstairs every time we need to change a diaper!) -- and we certainly wouldn't do that if there were an odor problem.  The only time we've noticed any odor has been during the summer, when it's really hot and the contents get... ah... ripe faster, and even then it was only when the lid was open.  Other than a few super-hot weeks each year, we empty the Dekor once a week and all is well.The interior of the Dekor, where the diapers are collected, has gotten a touch stinky over the last couple years, but you don't smell it until you open the door to empty the unit.  A little Lysol helps, but frankly, as long as the smell doesn't "escape" the Dekor, it's a non-issue to us -- and so far, so good!The refills may seem more expensive than other systems, but they last FOREVER.  With my first son, we used only four refills in two years.I highly recommend the Dekor, and wouldn't even consider another diaper disposal system.  Hope you're as happy with it as we are!
