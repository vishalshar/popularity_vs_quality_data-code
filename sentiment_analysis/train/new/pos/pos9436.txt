This green dog is for our newborn once he gets a bit older.  The dog is adorable; I chose it for the bright colors.  My only disappointment, which I did know when buying it, is that it doesn't have the chime ball inside.  They seem to have phased the chime out of most of their plush animals for some reason.  My three year old has the old tan dog with the chime ball inside and absolutely loves it.  When she was younger she really enjoyed shaking her dog and hearing the noise (which was a subtle sound) so I wish we could have that with this one.  Overall though this will be a great toy and we really like it!
