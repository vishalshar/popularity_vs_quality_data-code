I am so please with this company, I originally bought the teething bracelet for my son but when it arrived it was too large for his wrist and was sliding off easily.  I contacted them about possibly doing an exchange for the bracelet with the necklace and they were so wonderful they said for me to keep the bracelet and pass it along to someone else, and sent me a necklace at no charge to me. That is AWESOME customer service.  I received the necklace within just a couple days and immediately put it on my son.  I can tell a hug difference in his temperament with wearing the necklace.  He's also drooling less, but still does drool and he obviously still chews on things but doesn't seem as frantic to have something in his mouth to soothe the pain.  I haven't had to give him any pain medicine since he's been wearing the necklace for just over a week now, which is awesome!!! Highly recommend!!
