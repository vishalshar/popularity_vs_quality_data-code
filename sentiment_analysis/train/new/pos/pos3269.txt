i'm really glad i got these. they are soft and waterproof and do exactly what they are suppose too. I lay my newborn right ontop of them anytime i put him down to sleep or nap, they're that soft.I'm not sure what the other reviwer was complaining about the way these pill, not sure what that means. I didn't cut mines, just left them in their original size which fit my newborn perfectly.They aren't going to win any beauty contest either but I wouldn't say they are ugly, the designs are nice to look at while I nurse my son sideways on them. Plus, they are under $10! What a deal! I'm thinking about getting more since two get spit up on and soiled upon really quickly.I love these and I think you will too.
