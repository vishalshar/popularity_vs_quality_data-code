This burp cloths are exactly what we needed.  Absorbent, thick, not too small, not too big.  We bought the smaller (half size) Gerber cloths that come in a package of 6 - they just weren't absorbent and one side felt scratchy.  These cloths are softer on our baby's skin; they feel like, slightly, thinner pre-folds.  I'll only buy these now.
