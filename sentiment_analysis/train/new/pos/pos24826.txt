I love these!! I bought myself a set to go in my purse for emergencies (because let's face it, I'm an on-the-go kind of girl and I never know when I'm gonna forget to grab silverware) and they are so handy! They even come with the little case so you can slip them back in if they're still a little dirty and they won't go jangling around your purse. Seriously, forget these being a kids set... they are a life saver for adults! Also, the case is nice because it closes with a magnet and not a latch thing, so it's less likely to break if you're clumsy.I don't think the spoon is deep enough for serious soup eaters, but like I said, it's great in emergencies where you're starving and just forgot to pick up that plastic fork. In fact, these are really great for people who are going green and don't like the idea of bundles of plastic flatware ending up in dumps for seagulls to choke on. And they're just the right size for a kid's tiny hands too. If I were a mommy, my kids would each have their own set because I just think they're wonderful and super useful, ESPECIALLY with the carrying case.My only complaint is that the sugar skulls aren't as bright and vivid as the picture shows, but they're still quite a functional set and very lovely to have. I'm contemplating getting a set for my hubby too, for his lunch at work and for on the go as well. Seriously, I can't say enough wonderful things about these cutie pies!
