This thing is great! I use it for my Dr. Brown's wide mouth bottle and medale pump, and they work awesome. Some of the other reviews said something about leaking, the only thing I can think it that they didn't remove the pieces that go in the bottle. If you don't remove the inserts it doesn't screw on correctly and it would probably leak.
