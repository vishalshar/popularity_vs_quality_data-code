I'd had my eye on this stroller bag for a while, and I bought it when the price was too good to pass up. This is a small bag that attaches with velcro to the metal bars on the side of a stroller, and gives you some extra room to hold a few essentials.  Diapers, wipes, snack, sippy cup or bottle will all fit in there, and perhaps a few more smaller things.  (I've never stuffed it to the brim.) Not gonna hold a ton of things, just carry your diaper bag if you need to bring a lot of stuff.I like the Saddle Bag because my Maclaren Quest has a small basket that is kind of a pain to get into if the kid is in the stroller.  Hanging things from the handles causes the stroller to tip over backwards because it is so light.  This product works great for a quick jaunt to the park.  Also, if your stroller (like mine) has no baby bar in the front to hold the little darling's sippy cup, you can stick it in here. I got the navy color, and it is very nice. The quality is identical to the Skip Hop diaper bag I bought my husband, very durable and easy to care for.  I may get another one for the other side of the stroller, I like this one so much.
