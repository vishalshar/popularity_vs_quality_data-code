Works great.I was worried after reading other reviews here that this adapter wouldn't be as good as the one that came with my Medela Advanced Backpack.  But I knew that the Medela pump has warnings all over it saying not to exceed 9V, and that if I ordered from Medela and something went wrong - that they are good at replacing parts.  So I took the chance, and ordered two more of these.. even though the price was more expensive than other 12V generic adapters on amazon.Happy to report that it works just like the original.  No loss of suction, which is what I was worried about.  The cord is thicker and more reinforced than the one that came with my backpack, but I imagine that it's just a newer version that is built to fray less.It has been fantastic having multiple adapters.  I pump exclusively for my twins and supplement.  I now have a place to plug in my pump in our bedroom, my office, and our living room.  Before, I had to rely on the battery pack if people came over and I needed to go hide to pump, and when the batteries ran low I'd lose suction.. it was a huge pain.And in the future, if these adapters die.. I know Medela will replace them since it has their brand.  I also know I am not damaging the motor with a higher-than-intended voltage. The peace of mind was worth the higher price.
