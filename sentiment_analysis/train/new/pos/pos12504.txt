I had been looking for a mobile when I read soothers are better and the music plays for a bit longer. My son (then 3 months), would refuse to sleep on his own when put to bed, I'd had to carry him until he fell asleep in my arms. The very first night I used this I knew I had bought a life saver. I didn't like the first two slides very much so I just went right ahead and skipped to the last one (clouds, bees and stars) and he was staring at ceiling as if in a trance while the music played softly (it has 3 volume settings). After a few months, he would push the buttons himself and lay in the crib,listening and looking at the lights. I love this product! It's been almost a year since I bought it and I still use it. My son's so used to it that when he hears it, he knows it's time to relax and go to sleep. The only negative thing I could think of is that the "nature sounds" are not very loud, very hard to hear (sometimes I thought the battery had died until I pressed another button). All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone and in fact, I'm buying a second for a friend who's having her first baby soon.
