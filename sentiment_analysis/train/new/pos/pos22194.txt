We got these to make a safer play area for our daughter when she was becoming more mobile, because our floors are made of porcelain tiles, and all I could imagine was her falling and chipping a tooth on our extremely hard floors.These do a great job making the floor softer.  The only thing is that they are quite flimsy, and unless you wash them every single day (nearly impossible when you have a baby in the house--plus two other kids and a full-time job) dirt gets built up in every single crack.  And once the baby figures out that the numbers and letters come out, and the edges peel off, it just becomes more hassle than you expect.I still have them in my daughter's play area. Now she is a seasoned walker.  We wash them once a week and they do their job.  The edges have all disappeared except for one and the numbers and letters are often taken out, and we use them as a learning tool ("Go put 'A' back where it goes!" or "Can you give me the "M"?")  She actually, at 20 months, identifies many of them.  I give this floor mat much of the credit!I wish they were twice as thick and I wish that there was a backing behind the numbers and letters, so that it would be easier to keep clean.
