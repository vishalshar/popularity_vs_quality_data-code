i actually loved this!!!! so did my daughter! she would stare at the stars up on the ceiling and the music was calming... I have to disagree with those who say it looks like it came from the dollar store it shipped pretty fast it was great! if i ever have another baby im gonna get this again i had gifted mine to someone else and they loved it as well!
