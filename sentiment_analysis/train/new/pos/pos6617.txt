This bed is the perfect bed that meets all the new safety regulations for licensed centers and child care homes. The certification label is easy to read on the foundation so there's no question as to whether it meets the requirements. The bed is super cute and the perfect size for our little ones in my licensed child care home. I purchased 5 of them and the parents all love them as well. I purchased the extra firm 3 inch mattress for all the cribs as the one that comes with it is very thin. The construction is sturdy, the wheels help move them around easily, and they fold up super easy for storage, Couldn't be happier with my purchase. Don't hesitate. You will love this bed!
