Per reviews, this chair is small, and for us, that it is perfect!! We don't have a lot of extra space and we didn't buy it with the expectation that it would fit our child forever.  It folds to further decrease its footprint and we put it in a closet after each use. It doesn't fold very compact, which was disappointing, but on the plus side, it is still self standing when folded (LOVE this). Plus, you can collapse it with one hand and a foot! It is light and there is a convenient handle on the back of the chair. This allows you to move it around with one hand while carrying baby in the other!The wood is of good quality. We unfortunately already put a gouge in it but the wood underneath is dark so it hardly shows.The seat is an easy to clean foam. It has a little lip that conforms snugly to the chair and catches food, preventing grime from building up in the corners in the seat.The tray is easy to clean and can be easily removed with one hand... BUT the plastic guard that goes in front of baby below the tray is a pain. This part must also be removed to but baby in and out and requires two hands. You have to push the buttons on either side very deeply to release the guard. It's impossible if you have any fingernails at all, or if you have big man fingers... Meaning neither mom nor dad can easily accomplish this without frustration and/or broken fingernails! It would be 5 stars except for this.Overall, very happy with this attractive piece.
