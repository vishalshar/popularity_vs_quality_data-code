We have had Kiddopotamus Duomats 2 in 1 (Summer Infant has the same) mats in our two cars since my son was born 2.5 years ago and just ordered two more for our next baby and his seats. These are fairly inexpensive when compared to some of the other brands and do the job wonderfully. The back part folds over to accommodate either baby seats in rear facing position or backless booster seats. Ours have protected our car seats from spills (have a very light leather in one car) to scratching and indentations. Also, it catches most of the crumbs that kids so generously sprinkle all over the seats! I always pull mine our with fair amount of cheerios and pretzel crumbs on it but next to none of that stuff in the car seat cracks. Used 3 different seats with these so far in 5-6 different cars and have had no complants! The backside of the mat has soft rubbery material that grips to seat preventing it from sliding around and provides cushioning. When we remove the mat and baby/toddler seat, we usually see some indendations for hour or so aferwards in car seat but I consider it normal since the baby/toddler seat is pulled into car seat very tightly an no mat would ever prevent the these temporary marks. All and all I woulod recommend this product to protect your car!
