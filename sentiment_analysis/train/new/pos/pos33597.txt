I absolutely love everything about this stroller. It's sleek and easy to use. When me baby was a newborn we removed the seat (SO cool that you can do that!) and clicked in the carseat. You can make the carseat face you or outside. Same with the child seat. Since our baby is now three months-old we use the seat in the bassinet mode, putting her to sleep, and laying her down as if she were laying in her crib. Again, being able to face us or the world.The canopy on this thing is insanely big, being able to adjust it is genius. You can also click in the carseat to the child seat. With both canopies up your baby is completely shielded from everything.I also love the fact that unlike other higher end brands, this stroller comes with both a drink/snack tray for the child, also a drink/cell compartment for the parent without having to purchase separately. The storage on the bottom of the stroller is huge! Many of my friends have commented on how much room I have down there, and how much I can store.This stroller definitely looks like a higher end stroller, but for half the price. After comparing it to the very popular Britax, it wasn't even a question as to which one was better. I couldn't be happier with Graco, their products are great.
