I bought this before our big trip to China when my daughter was nine months old. I figured there might be difficulties accessing high chairs at restaurants there. Even with high chairs, my daughter was kind of small to sit securely. This product was perfect for us! We took it everywhere with us and just used to secure my daughter onto regular chairs at restaurants and she can sit and eat with us - without one of us having to hold her down and the other feeding her. We also used it at my parents' home using a very big high chair that my brother lent us. We were able to "tie" her down without her slipping around all over the place. (And believe me, she is a very busy baby.) It was money well spent! Great for traveling to foreign countries!
