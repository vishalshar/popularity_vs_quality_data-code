I am really liking this stroller. It is definitely more substantial than your average umbrella stroller and is in between the size of an umbrella and full size stroller. It can handle bumps and cobblestones in the city easily which is huge for us- we live near New Orleans and the sidewalks are uneven. It also has a giant sun shade which is also a must to block out the hot sun and sometimes heavy rains here. Folding was a bit tricky at first but easy with practicing a few times.  Best of all my 13 month old daughter is comfortable in this stroller, unlike our last umbrella stroller. It's cushy and she is really able to relax in it. The adjustable foot rest is great.  The crotch strap sits lower on her body than other strollers, but not a big deal in my opinion. I'm happy with this purchase. Strollers with similar features sell for double or triple this price so I think this stroller is a great deal.
