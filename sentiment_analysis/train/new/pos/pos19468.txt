I have used this crib for 3 months now for my twins and so far it is holding up beautifully.  It is all hardwood and seems sturdy enough to withstand a toddler.  The color matches most other brands espresso wood.  The base for the mattress is springs (as opposed to a flat board) which I like.  We have the mattress set at the higher setting which will be good until the babies can sit up, then we will move it to the lower one. Our crib skirt will probably drag on the floor a little when we put the mattress down but that's OK with me.  Once the babies start to roll over I am going to purchase a second of this same crib to seperate my twins - and I wouldn't buy the same crib twice if I wouldn't recomend it to others!
