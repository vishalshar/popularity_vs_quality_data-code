My baby's "baby" toy (3rd name for it we settled on) is her favorite in her crib.  It's small enough that I don't worry about crib safety but big enough that she can still hold it and grip it securely.  Favorite moment was finding the baby in bed with her "baby" petting the twig top of the eggplant's hat.  Very cute.The reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is that after the wash the 2nd time, there is now a watery looking stain around embroidered eyes and nose on the eggplant's face.  I suspect that the dye in the thread isn't colorfast, though not sure why it was ok the 1st wash.  I washed it with whites so I know nothing else ran.  After 4 washes the stain hasn't come out and the toy is looking more faded but very well loved.
