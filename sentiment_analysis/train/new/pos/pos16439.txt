This football is adorable for little boys! (And girls! My 11 year old grandaughter played football last year ðŸ™‚)There are many tags for the children to choose from to find their special one. Well made-tags are really sewn on securely. I took this football to my 3 month old great nephew along with a few "football themed" outfits as a new baby gift!
