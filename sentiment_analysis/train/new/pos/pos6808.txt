With four kids we've tried all kinds of toddler spoons and these are far and away the best. They are not too deep and not too shallow. The handle is just the right size and shape. They are sturdy and don'd bend, we even scooped ice cream with one and it didn't bend. They come through the dishwasher great. The part the child eats off of is stainless steel rather than plastic and there is no paint on them to come off or cause a recall. We have some of the forks, spoons, and knives that have already gone through three of our children and are still in great shape.
