I liked the product.  I received this product in great condition!  The backpack is so large.  I am able to put several diapers and a carry along wipes in here.  With those it also fits several toys for my toddler and his cups.There are several features that I am impressed with on this.  The size for one, as stated above.  The multiple clasps on the backpack that tether my son to it.  It makes for a better fit and more secure on his body.  The multiple adjustments on the straps.  That is a huge plus.  It makes this an available option for many different body types and sizes.  The several compartments is also a great feature.  I can put diapers in one, my keys and wallet in another and still have the side pocket for his sippy cup.Definitely going to have to purchase another one of these for my grandson now!
