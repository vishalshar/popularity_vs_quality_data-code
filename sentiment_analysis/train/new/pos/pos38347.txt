I'm a mother of 4. I have been through my share of bibs. It is only on my 4th that I have discovered these. I HATE velcro bibs. They snag baby's neck, snag my laundry, and wake my baby up when he's sleeping and I'm trying to get it off. Most bibs out there have some cutsie design on them that causes the bib to not absorb the milk or spit and it just dribbles off. These bibs are PERFECT. They are large, but still fit on my newborn from day one. Love the 3 adjustable snaps, love that they are on the side and not behind his head, and the material so so soft and absorbent. Not to mention, cute designs that do not say "I love mommy" on them. Wouldn't change a thing.
