I have had my first Munchkin mirror since my daughter was born in 2007, and I still use it. Since then, I have bought one for all my pregnant friends. The mirror part doesn't give you as clear a picture as your regular review mirror, but it's definitely good enough to see out of. I like this mirror over others because it sticks to the back for your review mirror with velcro so you can take it off (no suction cups that don't stay on your window), and you can flip it up, hiding it behind your review mirror when you don't have kids in the car. After hearing all those sad reports of parents accidently leaving their kids in the car all day, I would highly recommend this. You can't forget your child if you can see the car seat sitting in the back.
