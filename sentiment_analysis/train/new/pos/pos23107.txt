We already owned a Britax seat, it is one of the marathon convertibles, and we loved it. when I got this one I was hoping for the same experience.it is very large and very comfortable for my son and the cup holders and arm rests make long trips very nice.I had no trouble securing the seat to the car in the typical Britax fashion of no movement whatsoever. (make sure you pull the seat belt strap through the opening of the seat when tightening)It fits perfectly in my new town & country 2nd row buckets.It is more difficult to put in and take out of the vehicles because of its size and weight, but that is about the only con I could come up with.  I'm sure it has to be this way to accommodate the 5 point harness and up to 100 pound weight so even that is worth it.I love this brand and would recommend them to anyone.PS if they don't fit properly in the foreign minivans BUY AMERICAN!!!!!!
