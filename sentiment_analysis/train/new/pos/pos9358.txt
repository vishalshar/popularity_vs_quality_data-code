We have a Fisher Price Jumperoo, a Kolcraft walker, and the Baby Einstein Entertainer. At first, I was convinced the Entertainer was best, then it seemed like the baby liked to jump more. Then when we got the walker, it seemed like that was all he wanted.Over time, the Entertainer won out. The walker is still interesting, but my 6-mo old son figured out all its tricks pretty quickly. He still likes the walking, bumping, grabbing at things in his extended reach. But that jumperoo's time was really limited. Now, he can stand it for just 10 mins before he wants out.I am glad to have all of the products, they all served their purpose. But I'm especially glad for the Entertainer's longevity. There's a LOT of activity here. My son played with two toys for a very long time, then moved on to two other toys, then realized his ability to spin in place, then realized that some toys reached his mouth to chew on. He's really circling back to some of the earlier toys now.Since it extends a bit it's "grown with him" and, though he can stand nearly by himself, it's still supporting him properly when he wobbles.When I realized that the product (the little soft blocks) had undergone a recall (they used to have plastic on them) I was freaked out. But then I checked and that was back in 2005, and they fixed the problem. I'm so glad it stayed on the market. This is one great toy.
