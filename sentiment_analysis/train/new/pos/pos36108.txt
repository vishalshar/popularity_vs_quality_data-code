I received the diaper bag yesterday.  Pictures can be decieving but I don't think this picture does the bag justice.  The bag is slightly larger than I had thought it would be, but it's a great size.  In the picture the white lines look eggshell but on my actual bag they are bright white.  My husband was impressed with the quality as well.  A zipper closes the top of the bag and a bottle of water fits well in the outside pockets.  I had hoped there would be more than two mesh pockets inside but there is a zippered pocket inside (like you would find in a purse).  I also like that this bag comes with stroller straps.  There is no way to adjust the length of the arm straps but I fell like they are a good length (not uncomfortably long or short).  I would definetly purchase this again for myself or as a gift.  I originally wanted the same bag but with pink polka dots but that pattern was twice the price???  I settled for the stripes and I am just as happy.Edit: (several months later)  I still enjoy the bag but I have noticed that the zippers on the front of the bag that holds the teal changing pad do not stay zipped all the time.  Nothing has fallen out because I zip it back up as soon as I notice.
