This product works quite well and was as described in the add, except that it is just a quarter inch too short to cover the whole DVD player. So my toddler is able to push the power button on and off still by pushing on the plastic guard. If it was slightly taller in front, it would not be able to wobble and do this. Unfortunately, larger sizes are too tall to fit. The length is good though and it covers the whole front length of the DVD player.My other complaint is that the Velcro they provided to attach the guard is white rather than black like other guards I have seen. As most DVD players are black or silver, this really stands out and looks tacky.Other than that, the quality is good! Sturdy plastic and despite being able to push the large power button, it does seem to protect the smaller function buttons from toddler tampering.Definitely the best I have found for this size electronics, but there could be small improvements.
