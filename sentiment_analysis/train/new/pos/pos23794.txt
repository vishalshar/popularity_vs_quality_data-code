Warning for those of you who mind: these are small!  But they are perfect for my son, who loves them and can't fall asleep without one!  When my little guy was a baby, we bought him a few CuskiBoos.  He loved those and they became his "have to have" lovey.  While I love that brand, they are far more expensive than this one.  Years later, he still has to have one every day so we switched to this brand to save some money.  He sucks on them anytime he needs to calm himself down (and at age 4, that's quite often!), so we go through loveys pretty quickly.  I don't want something that's too big since he falls asleep with them in his mouth (so the size of this one is perfect for us).  And these actually last longer than the Cuskis did - they don't fall apart (i.e. get chewed up) as quickly.  So these are perfect for my son!
