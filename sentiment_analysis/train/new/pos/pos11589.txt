l had bought some muslin blankets from another brand while I was pregnant which were super cute, but since I only had two of them I obviously needed more for when she dirtied those ones up. I found these and instantly fell in love with the black and white print. They were a bit more, but I just loved the prints and colors so I had to have them lol. They shipped super quick and was really pleased with the size of them. They are actually bigger than the other two that I bought. I washed them and they came out super soft and did not shrink which is another HUGE plus for me. I live in Arizona so all you need is a light blanket and these worked out wonderfully. I'm able to wrap my 2 month old up and not have to worry about her getting too hot during naps and at night. The black and white print gets a lot of compliments as well from people who want to know where I got them. The size of them makes it wrapping a breeze as well with plenty of material left which I know will come in handy when she gets older.
