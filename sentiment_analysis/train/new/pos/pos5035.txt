The sheets are exactly as described....pure soft cotton...my son was getting some kind of skin rash from earlier crib sheets which weren't 100% cotton...so I started looking for 100% cotton ones...this matched his bedding so we decided to go with it after reading the good reviews....they were totally worth it..and my son loves the print on the sheets...he keeps trying to catch the animals on sheet :)
