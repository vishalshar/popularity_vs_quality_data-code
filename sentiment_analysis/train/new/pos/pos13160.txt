Wish that this came in more colors, as I would buy it for my sons room as well. It is a very sturdy and safe light, not too bright and not too dim. The only problem with it is that it is made for a vertical plug in, not horizontal. Thus my owl is on it's side, and it is not adjustable. So it works well for bathrooms, not necessarily bedrooms.
