This is an easy way to do a baby book! I just keep the calendar hung in baby's room and write in baby's firsts and special moments as we go. Growth statistics get written in on the day of each doctor appointment. At the end of each month I collage some photos to document what baby did and what baby looked like.This calendar is made with durable heavy matte paper which is easy to write on. It has 13 months. The colors in the picture (blue, orange, green, grey) are true and consistent throughout, including the stickers. Stickers are 1" square and fill the box so you don't have space to write in your own details for that day. The first couple of pages have info on mommy & daddy, birth info, and basic family tree, then for the months, the top half has the same text on every page (sleeping patterns, feeding, likes, dislikes, fav toys, learning to...), except for 13th month, which says happy birthday and has more open space to write. Most pages have designated space for a photo, but even on the ones that don't, there is plenty of room5 rows for weeks. The days of the week and month stickers are not capitalized (cute, but not grammatically correct).The calendar was shipped in a plastic sleeve which protected it in shipping, so it was in pristine condition (there was no risk of dinged corners or folds) when I received it.
