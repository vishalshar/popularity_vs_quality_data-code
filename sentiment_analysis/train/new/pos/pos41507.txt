My grandson lives with us.  He is very hard on his mattresses.  This is a very nice mattress that fits perfectly on his youth bed.  This is the third mattress I have had to purchase.  This one looks a lot sturdier than the other 2 that were bought locally.  I examined this mattress when it arrived and it is very well made.  He sleeps better now and we have difficulty trying to get him up in the morning for kindergarten.  I would highly recommend this mattress to anyone looking for one.
