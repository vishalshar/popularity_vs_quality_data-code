I obsessively look at this mini-library for several months before actually purchasing it, and I am so happy that I did. It is a solid piece of furniture and it looks beautiful in our nursery. I know other reviewers have posted about the smell, but I did not notice any noxious odors at all. I considered other "mid-century" type shelves from west elm and crate and barrel but I am very happy I decided to go with this one. We installed the shelves into the wall too so it's extra safe when baby starts getting adventurous (the shelf comes with these attachments)I decided to order the oeuf mini library from this seller because of the free shipping (if you order from the oeuf website you have to pay additional shipping). Plus they had it in stock and they were on back-order from the oeuf website. They shipped promptly and the furniture arrived in perfect condition. Before I ordered I did check them out because I was a little nervous ordering an expensive product from someplace I never heard of. Their website is super cute and they have other really cute baby stuff on there that I will probably order when I put together a play room.
