Lots of burp cloths are either too small (they look like teeny table runners) or made of fabric that doesn't absorb spit up very easily (and please, you don't want to have to wonder if the spit will slide off). We have about 20 of these Gerber cloth diapers that we use as burp cloths, and they are perfect. In fact, our home has at least of few of these in arms' reach in nearly every room. Not very chic home decor, admittedly, but very useful and hopefully just a short-term accessory. The grandmas in the neighborhood tell me they will continue to be handy as our child grows up, so there's that.
