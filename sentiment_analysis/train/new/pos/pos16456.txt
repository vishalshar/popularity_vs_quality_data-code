This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me!  Well, at least as far as potty training goes.  I've got a 40 lb 3 year old that absolutely refused to leave his toys to go to the potty.  No amount of M&Ms or cool underpants, or potty trained friends would lure him to the potty.Until we got... the Potty Bench!!!!!We have the potty ring, the Bjorn potty, the First Years potty, and nothing worked.  The biggest problem was that they stuck to his butt when he got up, and they just didn't seem to fit right. He would always scoot back too far. He was not interested in them at all.But what I love, love, love about the potty bench is...1. He puts his books and toys in the "secret" side compartments to play with when he has to pee.2.  He uses the splash guard to adjust his penis down so we have had no spills.3.  He hops on without scooting his butt all over the place, showing that he's comfortable.  I don't know why people say the hole is too small.  He is a big guy, and the hole is perfect.4.  He likes it so much that even when he doesn't have to pee, he puts the top down and just sits on it and plays with his trucks on it.
