I just bought these for my 18month old. After researching and buying one of various trainers, I like these the best. They are easy to pull and down, they absorb well (more if inserts are placed), they are very comfortable and soft around the thights (not leave marks), well made. I am currently training my daughter, she does not use the potty yet and I am trying to get her to realize that she is going potty. Since I switched to these she now tells me. If just pee, with pants pulled down and shoes on, I quickly unsnap used diaper, put a clean one on by snapping each side and then just pull them up. SHe is happy to continue playing and not having to lay down :) I bought size 2T and loved them. Since my daughter is still using these as "diapers" I needed to be able to stuff them, so unfortunately 2T would not fit well with insert. I just went onto AntsyPants website and ordered 3T/4T size. Perfect size for my now 19month, 27lb who is in size 3T clothing, she is on the chubby side and has long torso.  These are pricely, but disposables will cost more in the end.
