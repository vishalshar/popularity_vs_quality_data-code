I noticed my baby biting the front rail of her convertible crib and scrambled to get a cover. I read a bunch of reviews on different products and ended up with this one. I made the right choice!  My crib has a wide rail that curves and this covers it just fine. The cover has a waterproof bottom layer (white) that is kind of a crinkly plastic material, a layer of light padding in the middle, and a soft fleece layer on top. There are 5 ties made of the fleece that are kind of stretchy, which I like because they tie nice and tight! I ordered pink which is more of a medium pink and matches my decor well. I wash it cold/delicate and hung it to dry and it is holding up well. My baby still bites the cover and I'm happy her slobber won't soak through. She likes to play with the ties but they are short enough that she can't hurt herself with them. The center tie had to be tied a little off-center around the slat but it was no problem, the tie was long enough. A good buy and I would recommend it for cribs with a wide rail. I included pictures to show the bottom and my crib rail as well as the whole product.
