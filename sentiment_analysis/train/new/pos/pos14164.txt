This gate works fine when installed properly.  We originally purchased one of these because all others were simply too tall to put at the top of our stairs.  This one was just barely the right size, although it did require custom mounting.My 1.5 yr old son gives this gate a serious workout nearly every day, shaking and rattling it.  Our dog also tries to "dig" it open (and if we leave it unlocked he succeeds!) and still no harm.While others point out that the mechanism is difficult to use ... isn't that the point?  Our children cannot get this open, and after we had a little practice we can open and close this with one hand.To be safe, this should NEVER be installed directly into sheetrock walls.  You should mount a board to the wall, preferably screwing it into a stud, and then mount this gate to the boards.
