i love this bib for it's sturdy snaps as both of my kids enjoy pulling their bibs off & throwing them on the floor dumping out the contents in the process... i love the sleek & simple design as i'm not fond of in your face baby bibs.this is our 2nd bib since after normal wear & tear our 1st was trashed. let's face it, bibs don't last forever & if they start to develop mold it's time to trash & replace them.since another {store} retailer no longer carried this & i couldn't find it locally i was forced to buy it through amazon but was pleased with the free super saver shipping! plus the price was just as reasonable had i been able to find it in a store, drive there & use a coupon. bottom line: you have to consider what your time, energy & sanity is worth, for me being able to shop from the comfort in my own home without having to deal with traffic, lines, car seats, tantrums, meltdowns or forgetting a coupon is totally worth it!
