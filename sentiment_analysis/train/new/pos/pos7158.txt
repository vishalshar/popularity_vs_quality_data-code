I like how I don't get to smell even a whiff of the dirty, poopy diapers even when opening the lid. I've had the genie diaper pail before which was ok and the Safety First pail (stinky even with deodorizer), but only with Munchkin Arm and Hammer was I satisfied. I keep the pail in my room and am quite impressed that it doesn't smell of diapers or poop at all which it did with the previous pails I owned.AND the best part is you don't need to buy the refills.  Heres what you do:The product comes with one blue diaper refill bag with a hard plastic blue ring at its opening  that attaches it to the lid.  Don't use this plastic refill bag. instead, detach it from the plastic Blue ring by cutting it off with scissors.  Then use the plastic Blue ring to hold a regular garbage bag in place by tucking in the edges of the regular garbage bag over the blue ring. Then just reinsert the blue ring back on the lid.
