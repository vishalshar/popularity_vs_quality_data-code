When you ask for outlet covers, everyone tends to point you to the tiny plastic things that fit into the sockets of your outlets. If you need something that will keep little hands from pulling your television's power cable out of the wall, however, this is what you need. I use surge protector with my entertainment centre, and the power cable from it is very thick. I was most concerned about this cover because all of the photos had a rather small appearance. But when you hold the box in front of you, before you ever open it up, you can tell this has all the room you are likely to need. No, it is probably not big enough to house a wall-wart (depending on its shape), but it can accommodate some very large plugs and the hole out the bottom will fit a very large cable. The kit consists of three pieces: an outlet plate that you must use, a lower cover that slides around it from the bottom, and a top cover that slides around that cover from the top. It is very easy to put into place, and at least as easy to open and close.I can finally play Halo without sitting in front of my power outlet! :)
