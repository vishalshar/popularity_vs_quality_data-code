This diaper fit my daughter well from the time she was a couple weeks old, and still fits now, though it has begun to get snug through the legs.  My baby is smaller, so I can't say how it would fit on a baby with chubbier legs or belly, but for her this diaper has worked wonderfully.  It hasn't leaked but a couples times in the nearly 3 months she has worn it, much less often than most of the other covers and pockets she has and has held in messes that I would have never expected it would.  It is well made and still looks practically new after many dozens of washes.  For the price I definitely feel I got my money's worth and would recommend this diaper to any new mom.
