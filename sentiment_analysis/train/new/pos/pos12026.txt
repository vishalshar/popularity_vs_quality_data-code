I bought this as a gift for a couple of friends in the past and they just gushed about how much their baby's love this toy. So, I bought one for my baby girl. I'm not sure who likes this monkey more, me or my 2 month old. Monkey usually rides in her carseat with her. She especially loves to look into his face and talk to him. She also loves grabbing all the little rings and attachments to hold or to eat. Lastly all the textures are fantastic. She especially loves his crinkly ear.  Right now she isn't impressed with very many toys, but she loves this monkey! Quality product at a great price!Update: at almost 5 months old, this is still my baby's favorite toy.  When I hang it on a toy gym she always gravitates toward the monkey to play with.  It just has so many fun features that it keeps her engaged.
