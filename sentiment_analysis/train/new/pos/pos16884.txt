I got this sanitizer at my baby shower. At first I was really excited about it. I loved how compact it is, very simple to store on the kitchen counter without it taking up too much space. But as a lot of other reviews have stated it rusts very quickly! I was ready to throw it away and buy one of the microwave sanitizers but I decided to check here and read reviews first. The rust is very simple to remove! Take 2.5 onces ofvinegar or even apple cider vinegar and 0.5 ounces of water, let it sit for 30 minutes then wipe clean. Its good as new!
