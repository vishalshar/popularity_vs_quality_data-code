I've tried a lot of different nipples and this is the only one that works for my newborn. The other nipples, including Dr. Brown's which the pediatrician recommended, I've tried and he would suck and suck for 20 minutes and only get a half ounce in. At times he would get frustrated and just cry with it in his mouth. I've tried faster flow nipple as well and the forumula would just pour out of his mouth. He feeds much better with this nipple. I think it's the wider base that helps him really latch on and feed well. He does get a little gassy, but I think that's a newborn thing.
