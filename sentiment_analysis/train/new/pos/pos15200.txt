This is the only pacifier our son would take. We have tried the soothies and Nuk brands, but he would just spit them out. They have a cute design and I love the pacifier cover that comes with it! My baby has been using this since she was 2 weeks old and she likes them much better than any other pacifiers we got for our baby shower. In fact, I only got these because she would spit out everything we had. I guess these are closer to the shape of the nipples or something... I haven't tried :) But my daughter (now 2.5 months) likes them.I love these pacifiers. The design is cute and they hold up well in the dishwasher. My favorite part is that they come with a snap on cover so the pacifier stays clean in your diaper bag or purse. Much better than using a baggie or pacifier holder that just takes up more room. I will be ordering more of these.
