It was my daughter's first Valentine's Day this year, so I wanted to get her something to celebrate. I thought of getting a single rose, but she won't have any use for it. So I searched for "toy flower" and "baby flower" on Amazon, and had to pass up listings of clothing before I found this.Perfect.It wasn't red and it had that large bulb at the bottom for the rattle, but it was close enough. So I ordered it. My daughter loves it. She's about 6 months right now, so she constantly puts the flower rattle in her mouth. It's great, though, because the petal part is flat and small enough that it fits in her little mouth, and the texture allows her to bite down toothlessly on it hard without bother. It's actually got two layers of petal: one where it's fabric and the paper material inside makes a crinkling sound for her stimulation, and then the firmer portion that's more like a teether.The stem is wide, but not too wide to prevent her from grabbing it with one hand.She likes the sound of the rattle, though I found it kind of annoying. It's a little more high pitched than other rattles we have, but I'll tolerate it if she likes it, which it seems she does. She almost always grabs it when I put it near her.
