I can count on one hand the baby products that I would rave about... but this is one of them.  I am not overly concerned about germs and my son never really chewed much on shopping cart handles - HOWEVER - he is a really SQUIRMY.  We've had a terrible time getting him to sit forward and stay seated in a shopping cart.  Which makes grocery shopping precarious.  He is very quick to stand up and turn around in the cart if we take our eyes off him.  I looked and looked for a five-point harness that I could use with a shopping cart and then stumbled across the Shop n' Dine at TJMaxx.  IT WORKS WONDERS.  He was so secure and comfortable.  We never once had to sit him back down, turn him around, or anything.  I also had a place for my own drink that was out of his reach (the cup holder on front held my fast-food super-size drink).  My son never complained about the seat and I wish I had found this months earlier (he is 14 months now).  It's perfect.  One thing I found was that I was able to use the shopping cart strap in addition to the 5-point harness on this product which in effect made a 7-point harness (over the shoulders and between the legs with the product and around the chest with the shopping cart strap).  Another thing - My son usually pulls shoulder straps off, but these stayed in place and he never messed with them. And even though he was straped in securely, he was comfortable and able to play with us, point to things, play with toys, etc.  He wasn't at all paralyzed or completely immobilized by the straps.  Both my husband and I were extremely impressed and pleased with the Shop n' Dine.
