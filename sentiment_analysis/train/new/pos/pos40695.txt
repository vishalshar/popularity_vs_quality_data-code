The rare unicorn of narrow booster seats exists, finally. We got ours yesterday (pre-ordered from Amazon) and it is PERFECT in the middle row middle seat. I want to order 2 more to split between my car and my husbands. My boys are big enough, and weigh enough but are just a little too short to go without that extra boost and this allows them to sit in the middle seat between the infant carrier and a bigger booster seat comfortably AND still buckle their seatbelt. (I drive a Mazda CX9) With this we can also get more room in the backseat of my husbands small sports car (C class Mercedes) which is hard to do with an infant seat, too. Love this so much more than the Bubble Bum, which is so far the only competition for narrowest booster - but at nearly 2x the price.
