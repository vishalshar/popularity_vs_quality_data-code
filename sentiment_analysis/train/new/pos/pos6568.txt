Please ignore the reviewer who rated the seat one star due to the rebound issue.  I am a certified child passenger safety technician and this is NOT a safety concern.  Almost all rear facing seats will rebound in a crash.  The only ones that won't are infant seats with rigid LATCH (the only one currently available in the US is the Baby Trend Latch-Loc with rigid LATCH) or one with an anti-rebound bar like the Britax Companion and convertible seats that tether rear facing (all Britax convertible seats, Sunshine Kids Radian, etc).  As long as your seat moves less than an inch in any direction AT THE BELT PATH (i.e. on an infant seat with a base, right at the seat crack where the other poster said it was tight) it is safe.  The Chicco KeyFit is a very good seat.  It is without a doubt one of the best on the market currently.  It installs like a dream and fits small babies very well.  As a tech of seven years, I would not hesitate to recommend this seat or use it for my own child.
