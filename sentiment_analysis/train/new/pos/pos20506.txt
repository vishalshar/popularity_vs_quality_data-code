This was a replacement bottle for one that disappeared. My wife thinks Dr. Brown's really help with gas and spitting up. Thats all that really matters right. I agree with her about the the benefits...but as a slightly older first time parent, I can't read the numbers on the bottle without reading glasses! I don't think they could have imprinted smaller, more translucent numerals on the bottles than they have. Heck, I'm sure my son has gotten the wrong oz. to formula ratio because of this. Why make a great product and forget those who's eyes aren't what they used to be. This may be a non-issue for younger parents but for us 40 somethings, these can be frustrating.
