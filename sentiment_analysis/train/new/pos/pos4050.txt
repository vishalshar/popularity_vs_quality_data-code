The bag is great.  It's got a low profile, but it holds everything that I need and I can access everything quickly.  (Even if the little one is in the carrier!)  With a little practice, it's a seamless transition from a bag to a carrier and back again.  I haven't had any issues with  construction like some other reviews have.  The zippers don't line up on both ends, but I think that might be by design - to strengthen the longer side.
