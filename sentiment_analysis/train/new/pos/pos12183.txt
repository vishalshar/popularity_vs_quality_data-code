Our breastfed son was not into taking a bottle, and it was causing us a lot of stress. We tried all strategies and all brands and nothing worked -- until the doidy cup! He loves his doidy cup, and has taken to it with a lot of enthusiasm. I have to help him drink out of it, since he can't yet sit up on his own, but he really enjoys it! I can't recommend it enough. It saved us!
