I like them because it easy to set up and the monitors stay quiet so you do not hear constant working noise of it,only when it catches the child noise.But I do not like that when you turn it on,it makes a few beeps in my room so if I forget to turn them on and later my husband does it,it wakes me up.Overall good monitors
