I use this changing pad every day with my newborn son.  I did not buy a cover to go with it and I don't think one is necessary.  The material is waterproof and my son has already put it to the test several times, it wipes completely clean and we usually just put a cloth diaper down for his head and leave the rest of it open.  If you buy a cover for it, be prepared to change it constantly (at least if you have a little boy) because it will likely get peed on on a daily basis!  I believe the pad says that it has a slip proof bottom, however I have not found this to be entirely the case.  I find that I can slide it myself at times when I am trying to shift my son's position - although he has not been strong enough to move it himself and we do have it attached to the wall behind the dresser as well.  The pad is a good size and seems like it will be long enough for him for quite some time. Overall I definitely recommend this pad for anyone that doesn't want to spend the money for a changing table - ours works perfectly fine on top of a dresser.
