I ordered this for my nephew for Christmas as my sister had it on a wish list for him. Shipping and everything was great, the only think I would say about it and my sister agreed is that it is much much smaller than expected. We both thought it was going to be the size of a playmat would be And it is maybe 12inches long. But that could be partially or fault as Amazon does usually list dimensions. But if you want something the size of a playmat this is not what you want.
