We use this all the time! We found that the bassinet that comes with the UPPAbaby Vista stroller was just not working for us (baby lies on her back and she didn't enjoy that for her stroller rides). Since she is still too small to use the actual stroller seat, we figured we'd use her infant carseat. This adapter works like a charm, and just clicks right into the stroller frame. After that, you just lower the Chicco car seat into the frame, and it clicks on both sides to let you know that it's installed correctly (the car seat still wiggles a bit if you push hard on it, but it doesn't move at all during normal stroller use). We use this every day!
