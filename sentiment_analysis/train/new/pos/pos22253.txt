I had this blanket on my son's wish list for a long time.  He loves Yo Gabba Gabba so I thought I'd just get it.  It is a toddler size blanket but perfect because you don't want your little ones falling all over when they carry their blanket all over the house (which they will with this one).  It is a perfect weight for snuggling on the couch with Mom and Dad and watching tv or for taking a nap, also great size for in the car.  It's lightweight enough for little ones to carry around but because it's 100% polyester it's warm (kinda like fleece).  Its super fluffy and soft, and really nice and fuzzy.  The colors are fantastic and it washes well.  This is the blanket you will love the more you wash and use it :o  Can't say enough good things...if your a Yo Gabba Gabba Mom, like me, you will need to get this to match the rest of your home decor which no doubt, like mine, is Yo Gabba theme! LOL Don't know why it's 3yrs and up it's great for any age.
