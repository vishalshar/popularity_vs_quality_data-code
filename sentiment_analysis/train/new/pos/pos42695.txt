While seat is slightly bulkier than many seats it has features that outweigh the size.  I install car seats through fire department I work for. This is the one I bought for my children.  It is one of the few seats that can recline while installed.  Many claim they can but most you must ininstall adjust and reinstall.  Not only is it stylish it is also very easy to install in most vehicles properly without complications.
