Bought this Color Changing LED ball for my 2 year old grandson. It's AWESOME! I am back to order more for my nieces, nephews and my friends' babies.I don't write reviews as soon as my order arrives. I have done that in the past ~ given a raving review about a product that arrived and seemed amazing, only to break, fall apart or short out within a few uses. I ordered this a few months ago and was happily surprised to receive it within 2 days of my order ... I have been nothing but happy with everything about this purchase!!If you're here reading this then you're at least mildly interested ... it's an awesome product at a price you can't beat! I recommend it and I assure you that you won't regret itUPDATE:*I ordered 2 more of these as Christmas gifts for my niece and nephew. The products I received are from a different seller, which I did not know when I ordered them. They ARE NOT ROUND! They have a flat side which means they are NOT a "ball"! I feel this product was intentionally completely misrepresented and is a horrible substitute for the awesome one I initially received when ordering in the exact same manner.  I have not and will not give them to them. I would return them but it'll cost me too much.****BUYER BEWARE ****FYI:*The awesome LED Color Changing Ball that I ordered came from Magic Matt ' s Brilliant Blinkys*The crappy semi-spherical knock-offs were from niceEshop (TM)
