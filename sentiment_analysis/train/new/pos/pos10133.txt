My son is developmentally delayed and has a hard time coordinating to feed himself. This spoon bends at any angle we need to help him be able to get it to his mouth. His self-feeding has vastly improved with this spoon/fork set and I would highly recommend it to any child with special needs that could use some assistance at meal time. I also like that this is light-weight as he can easily hold it and the handle is a good size for his small hands. It's also nice that they bend both ways in case your child uses different hands to feed himself.
