A friend recommended this item based on her 2 year old son's love of it.  My husband and I put the border up this past weekend and my 2 year old son loves it!  In fact, he is sleeping in his own bed again!  Since they just became available, we will be ordering the valences as soon as possible to put the finishing touches on the room.  I'm glad we found this!The border was very easy to put up.  I had some wallpaper paste for pre-pasted wall paper borders and worked wonderfully.  We didn't want to mess with the water, since it doesn't always work like it should.  The paste made it so easy.  If you follow the directions, it tells you to use a damp sponge to go over it once you put it up.  Then wait a few minutes and do it again.  When you put one up, then try to measure for the next one, it looks like it is shorter than the other, but once you past it up, it matches.  It must expand with the paste.  I got the Wallpaper Border paste for prepasted Wall Borders at an Ace hardware store and I talked to someone there that suggested this process.  It made it easier than dealing with water.
