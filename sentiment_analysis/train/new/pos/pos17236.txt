These are great bottles. Our son can hold them well in his own hands and I've never had any problems with leaking. They also fit well in the Philips bottle warmer we have.For our first bottles, I wanted glass because I wanted to be sure it was sterile when he was an infant, so I also got some Philips glass bottles - the Natural style, since these Classic ones don't come in glass - but those had horrible leaking problems. (More on that in my other review, here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2T2QJ0HPFVO/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083TTLGE)I was worried that these, being plastic, would get those scuff marks that turn the bottle opaque and harbor bacteria, are hard to clean, etc., but that didn't happen. I do still wish I could get these in glass, but otherwise I have no complaints about these bottles.One thing on the nipples for this bottle: Be sure to get a bottle cleaner with a small head to get all the way into the nipple to clean it. Milk can build up in there and needs to be scrubbed out. I think I remember other reviewers complaining about cleaning the nipples, but I've had no issues with them.
