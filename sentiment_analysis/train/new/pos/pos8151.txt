My 2-year-old was waking up earlier and earlier, often before 5 am.  We got this product to help us all get some more sleep.The "sundown" bedtime process was useful from the get-go.  You push a button that sets a 10 minute count-down, during which the side light fades from sunny yellow to night time blue, and at the end there's a chime and the main light switches from day to night.  So every night we do that and when the "bunny goes to sleep" we turn out the light and do our last hugs and goodnights.  It's a great "blameless" prompt (meaning you can blame the clock for it being bedtime instead of it being you!).The main purpose though, the mornings, took more time to work for us.  Our daughter was getting up and coming in our room no matter what "the bunny" was doing.  But every morning we would walk her back to her room, tell her we don't get up until the bunny gets up, she would seem not to get it or care, and we'd all be sort of miserable waiting for the appointed time when we could "wake up" and go downstairs to start our day.  And every night at bedtime I'd say "good night honey, see you in the morning WHEN THE BUNNY GETS UP".  The consistency paid off though - after a couple of weeks of this, she started to be the one telling US that we can't get up til the bunny gets up.  Then one morning, like magic, I heard her get up, shuffle over to the clock to check the bunny status, then GO BACK TO BED!  Hallalujah!  We now have "wake up" at 6 am and if she wakes up earlier she almost always checks the clock and goes back to bed, sometimes more than once. And more and more often, she just sleeps til then anyway, because now her body is on a better schedule.So long story short, it takes some "training" but this really does work to keep those early risers in bed, and as a bonus also helps make bedtime easier.
