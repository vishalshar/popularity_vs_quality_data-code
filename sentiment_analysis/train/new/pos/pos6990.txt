I love this backpack bag. Its a must, can't beat the price either. Ok, I have one child a 2.5 I stopped carrying a traditional diaper bag a year ago and I carried a huge purse. It started becoming a problem when we were out on an outing my arm would hurt, it would slip off my shouler, could never find anything. So I started searching for backpack style diaper bags I thought what the heck I'll try this cheap one to start ( I have an expensive Petunia Picklebottom that i hate as diaper bag and use as swim bag now), perfect, couldnt have designed better myself. I was skeptical of its appearence it looks a little small but it is not BUT its not huuuuge backpack either. My sons camelback drink cup can fit in the side pockets (some ppl said couldnt fit bottles...I have no idea what type of bottles they are using then lol) and a water bottle for me as well. Inside is so spacious and has some pockets as well. I can fit all of the things I need for a big outing in here, snacks, my large camera, change of clothes for kid, drinks for both of us. I'm larger than average and it fits well on my back easy on and off. If youre a busy mom with a busy kid who you chase from one thing to another when out and about this bag is just right
