This is great to place on bottles to label when milk was expressed.  I like how it is re-usable.  I just label it and when it is time to wash the empty bottle I just rub my finger over the label and the ink rubs off.  I found that if you stretch the rubber a little while rubbing the ink it comes off more cleanly.  I love that I don't have to label bottles with masking tape anymore.  This is a nice re-usable alternative to bottle labeling that works pretty well.  I labeled it 4 stars because it doesn't fit well on smaller bottles like the thin Dr Brown 5 oz ones.  Otherwise it fits on most other bottles.. I have medela and born free wide neck, and it fits on the Dr Brown 9 Oz.  I bought two packages.  It works great for daycare as well.  The item got 4 stars because if you are not careful you could accidentally rub off the ink when you don't mean to, and the ink on the yellow band seems to not come off as cleanly as with the other two colors.  But honestly, the flaws are not a big deal and for the price and the convenience it is worth it.
