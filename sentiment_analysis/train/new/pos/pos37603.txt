I have been looking and looking for bibs that can catch at least more than half of the food that falls out of my little one's mouth. The silicone bibs are fantastic in concept but my son loves to dump all the contents out of the bibs and so he deems them useless. They are also stiff and get in between him and the highchair (he is 10 months old). I really love the bumpkins super bibs because they are soft and my son is not as bothered by them. he doesn't scream and yell when I put them on him. Although they do not catch food as well as the silicone ones, the  food that it does catch - stays there. They are seriously very durable even though they are a really lightweight fabric. I hand wash them after each use with mild soap and water and they dry very quickly and then look like new. I throw them in the wash every few days, and they look spotless (even after tinted foods that have stained my silicone bibs).I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend these bibs to all moms out there. They pack up really small and fit into a small pocket in my diaper bag which is also a huge plus. Basically, they are my go-to bib whenever I feed my baby, regardless of whether I'm feeding him yogurt or finger foods. he DOES make a mess but its way more manageable with these bibs.
