We have the B-safe carseat and b-agile stroller (LOVE the stroller!). Our 7.5 lb newborn fits well in the carseat but the head support that came with the carseat caused the straps to fit badly. The head support included with the carseat makes the shoulder straps too wide to fit properly. After contacting Britax about the issue and emailing them photos of the unsafe fit, the CS rep agreed that the straps did not fit right due to the insert and sent me the head and body support pillow free of charge. Now the straps fit properly (actually over his shoulders verses barely on his shoulders) and he is very snug and safe in the seat. I could have removed the insert and just used rolled up receiving blankets in it's place but honestly the insert included should fit a baby correctly. This solves the problem and as a bonus it's also usable in the stroller. This is fairly large so I expect it to fit my son as he grows for quite some time. I would highly recommend anyone who is using the B-Safe carseat for a newborn get this product as well if you want a proper fit for the straps, which should be coming from below or at level with the baby's shoulders rearfacing and lay over the shoulders, not the arms. Great product! It does make my son sweat but so did the infant support that came with the carseat. I would give it 5 stars if it were made of breathable fabric.
