I had hoped that the textures squishiness factor might vary among these balls since they are supposed to supply a sensory experience, but the only thing that differentiates them is color. Not much sensory value; they are packed practically flat and you need a pump. The texture and sizes are all the same. Caution: dogs will want to pop them.  1/5/14 edit: After reading a comment, I bought this pump Champion 12" Inflating Pump W/ and they do inflate and hold air. I might add that they bounce fairly high, so I gave them and extra star. 3.5 might be more appropriate.
