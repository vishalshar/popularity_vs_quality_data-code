I always buy these when any of my family or friends are having babies because I remember what a life saver it was for me. You don't have time to get into the container and scoop out formula when your baby is hungry and crying as if someone pinched him/her. You just want to hurry up and get the formula in the bottle and shake! With this you can carry around bottles of the amount of water you need and all you have to do is heat up the water, pour the already scooped formula in the bottle, shake it up, and you're good to go. The opening of the container fits perfectly into the mouth of the bottle too so no spillage! GREAT for OCD moms like me. HAHA!
