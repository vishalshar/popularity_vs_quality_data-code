These straw cups are awesome.  And, if you purchase all Munchkin brand, interchangeable which is great for your sippy up drawer sanity!  They will leak if they are turned completely upside down or, left laying on their side for an extended period of time.  I believe drinking from a straw has helped my children's teeth as the liquid doesn't sit on their teeth as long.
