I chose this mattress for the cost #1 and #2 for what it would be used for...napping a toddler IN A MINI CRIB.It is a PERFECT fit for the mini crib and no gaps left that might pose a problem of toddler getting caught between the mattress and crib rails (unless the toddler is of Hulk genes). I WOULD buy one again.IF you are wanting something for daily, 12 hr sleep, this is not the mattress you would want. AGAIN, it is perfect for toddlers napping or for taking trips to grandma's house for a weekend and sleeping a few days. It's support, LONG TERM, isn't a #10, but I am using it for naps.
