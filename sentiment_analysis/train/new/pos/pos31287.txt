I just got this today. I can't say enough good things about it. While I have not received my moses basket yet, I think this little rocking unit is brilliant! It was easy to put it together - it feels sturdy and strong and safe once assembled and it's really simple and beautiful in its appearance. My favorite thing is that  it's made out of solid wood (at least the "Natural" version is) which is beautiful but most importantly to me - there are no chemicals or off gassing issues because it is pure raw wood - no stains, no paints, no glues - just natural. I'm so glad we got this. I like that I can have it right next to our bed - its the perfect height. The price is amazing for a solid wood product. You  can buy this product with confidence.
