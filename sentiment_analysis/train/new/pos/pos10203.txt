I ordered this off a baby gift registry. Amazon shipped it quickly, as usual. When it arrived, I was so disappointed to see that they had shipped it without another box around it. I wasn't upset about the box, really, but the circle of fabric that shows through the front of the box was totally nasty with dirt and grime! I thought I was going to have to order another one to replace it. However, I finally decided to open the box and try to clean the chair and was pleasantly surprised to see that the fabric was not actually part of the chair, but a sample that was only part of the packaging. That's the only thing I can review about this item. The recipients are enjoying it, I'm sure;  I was just happy to give them a clean chair.
