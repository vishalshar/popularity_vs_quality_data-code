I don't regret my purchase, however there are a couple issues:1.  The picture shows the "Animals on Parade" style seat pad, but I received the "Whisper" design.  Not a big deal to me since I was already settling because I originally wanted "Safari Friends".  Just be aware that what you see may not be what  you get.2.  The seat pad is not that padded.  The picture shows a pillow-like pad, but it is flat with hardly any stuffing - if any at all.  It's definitely not a high chair for a baby under 6 months old.  Your child should be sitting by themselves with little help.  The pad is vinyl except for the top 1/4 behind babies head.Overall I'm quite happy with the chair.  It is very solid and sturdy and will obviously last a very long time.  It's a timeless design and doesn't take up much room at all.  It's nice that there is a larger removable tray and a small stationary tray that insures my daughter will never slip out due to the center piece between her legs.  It has a 5 point harness and reclining back which are both handy.  Even though it's not on wheels, that doesn't make it impossible to slide.  I put some furniture felt pads under each foot and I can easily pull it towards me.  My daughter is 7 months old and is very happy and comfortable in it.
