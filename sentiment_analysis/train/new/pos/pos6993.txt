It does everything I wanted it to do that no other baby monitors did all in one. Vibration alert, sleep mode, rechargeable, night vision, great range even in a 2 story house or outside in the yard, volume control, sensitivity setting on the camera itself, you can add up to 4 different cameras to 1 monitor, what else can I say... it was worth it !!! It's also discontinued and the newer models DONT do most of these things. I wouldn't change it for another. I love it!!
