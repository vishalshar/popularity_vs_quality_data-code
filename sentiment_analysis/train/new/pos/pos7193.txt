It has everything I was looking for to make my own cloth wipes solution but premade and more convenient. It smells good, clean, not to strong. I was using the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer. At first I would make the solution and inter-fold about 20 of the cloth wipes so they popped up like disposables then poured the solution over top. The top wipe had thick residu so I don't know how much made it through to all the wipes. The bottom wipe would be green by the time I went to use it usually. This worked but melting the drops and folding wipes was time consuming. I then was just filling the warmer with water and 4 Bum Drops, let it heat for a while till they eventually melted then stir it. Especially in the winter I liked having warm solution to use. I just lay the wipes flat in stack next to the warmer and dunk as needed, squeezing them out to be exactly as wet as I need. I absolutely loved it.... until the green sludge came around. I would make half the solution so I used it up faster but it didn't matter, it turned into a bad smelling sludge. I cleaned the warmer with bleach to kill any nasties but it wouldn't stop. I started filling a small spray bottle with HOT HOT water and dropping one in, waiting for it to dissolve, but it takes a long time. It was ok for that but a bit of a pain waiting for the drop to dissolve. I just put a pump or two of her baby wash in the spray bottle, shake it and I'm ready to go. It's a good product and described well so i'm still giving 4 stars.
