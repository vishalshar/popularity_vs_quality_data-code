We have been using crib mattresses and a fitted sheet as a bed for our Great Dane for years. Others have withstood the test of time a bit better than this one has, but it may be more of a gigantic Great Dane law placement than quality of product. Granted I realize it's not a baby rolling on this sheet but a gigantic dog. It only took about a week and a half to get a hole in it. Now. That being said, I have been very impressed with how it has NOT unraveled. The small hole (undoubtedly from a dog nail) has stayed the exact same size through countless washes and daily use by the big dog.  Color has stayed true.
