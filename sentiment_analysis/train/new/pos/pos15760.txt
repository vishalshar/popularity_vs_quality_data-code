We have 3 children 3yrs and under in our house.  I purchased this wrap when our 2mo old was 4wks.  My original intent was just for wearing when we were out and about on errands so my other two could stay in their original position in shopping carts.This wrap has gone far and beyond my expectations!I use it not only for my intended purpose but also:* around the house when she is fussy and I need my hands free* when we go on family outings like apple picking/corn maze/children's museum/etc.* when we are around a crowd of people and I'm nervous about germs. She is nice and tucked in and people don't feel comfortable getting close.* I've even started walking for exercise b/c I can push the other 2 in the double stroller and carry her in the wrap.It has really freed me up to live life and take care of young kids without the stress I experienced when my second baby was born.My favorite thing about this wrap is that I don't have to take it off/ put it on every time I get in and out of the car.  I can just put it on before I leave the house and wear it the whole time I'm out (just make sure you tie the knot on the sideIts machine washable.Its easy to learn to wrap. (watch youtube videos...don't just rely on picture instructions that come with product)Its very versatile in ways to hold and ages of use.  again watch youtube)My baby feels much more secure in this wrap then she did in the snugli I was using before.Downsides:1. It gets a little warm in the summer if you wear it all day:  If I'm around the house I just wear a cami under it.2. If I'm doing something with a lot of repetitive movement (like walking for exercise/hiking) I have to make sure it is a tight wrap or she is not secure and bounces too much.
