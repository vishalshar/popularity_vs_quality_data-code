This is just a great classic toy. Obviously needs some supervision (would you really give your kid a hammer and then walk away?!).  The end of the hammer did mark up the wall, but I think it will wipe off fairly easily. (the paint came off the end of the hammer when it rubbed against the wall). Overall though, a great toy that was NOT made in China!!! Will keep looking for Made in USA/Canada options for our children's toys!
