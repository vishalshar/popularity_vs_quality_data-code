Soft, cuddly, and cute.  Havent had a chance to use it for it's intended purpose yet (baby is only two months old and really doesn't have a "neck" to speak of), but I love to use it to make her feel secure in her cosleeper by the bed.  It seems that having this wrapped around her head (kind of like a huge headband while she is lying on her back) gives her a sense of security.
