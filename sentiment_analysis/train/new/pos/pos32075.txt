We bought three of the Sassy Suction toys for our 3-month old.  Out of all three, she likes the one with noise (with a spider on it), then the illumination one, then the plain one.  But, she does really like them all, but when we put all 3 in front of her on her little bumbo table, she plays with them in that order, usually the one with noise most, but then when we start hitting the other ones for her, she'll move onto them.  The toys also can come apart from the suction cup, which can be used with those colorful hooks to be hooked up on a jungle gym or activity jumper to dangle.  These don't seem like she'll tire from them easily, so I envision bringing them to restaurants to play with, or anywhere else they can be suctioned to.
