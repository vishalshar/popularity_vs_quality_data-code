Some people complain that it's difficult to turn or dismantle. The initial turn was hard, but not it moves freely.  You can take the spoon apart from the base for better cleaning.  I found when I put the spoon on the "open" setting and bent at a 45 degree angle in (so if you have the spoon in your left hand, switch it to "on", with "on" pointing left, and lean in towards the right), it pops easily off.
