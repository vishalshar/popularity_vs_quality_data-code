Love it!PROS- Super cute, the item looks just like the picture- The ties are a perfect length.  They are long enough to tie around the crib without straining.- Sturdy.  The product is not flimsy like some other bumpers I have purchased.  My baby loves to kick her feet onto the bumper.  This one doesn't collapse under the weight of her foot.  This prevents her from plunging her entire foot between the crib slats.- Arrived 2 days before the estimated arrival time.  Took 5 calendar days to reach my doorstepCONS- None.  Like I said, I love it!
