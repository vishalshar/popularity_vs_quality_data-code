I love this thermometer.  I have bought several of them over the course of my 4 kids and will continue to buy them as long as my kids are young enough for rectal temps.  Be careful when cleaning as water too close to the digital display will destroy it and give ridiculously high and inconsistent readings.  Also, most of them will work better and be more accurate if you use Vaseline each time.  Another tip for getting the quickest, most accurate reading is to make sure you turn it on and wait for the dashed lines prior to taking the temp. I will not a use different brand.
