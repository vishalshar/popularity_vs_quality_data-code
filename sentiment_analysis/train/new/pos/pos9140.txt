Love this walker! Purchased for my 7 month old daughter and she is enjoying it! Love the features on it! The steering wheel is removable to make for a food/toy tray and the sounds keep her entertained. It doesn't bounce but why want a toy that bounces your baby when it could teach her to walk instead?The rear wheels do not swivel like the front which actually is a great learning experience. We have a big house but the furniture makes for limited room and twisty turns, so Daughter learned the first day how to maneuver around them. If she hit a wall, she would reverse and drive around it. Mind you this is also the first time she is learning to walk, she hasn't even mastered crawling aside from launching her body forward and just started sitting up on her own with support from her hands.If you want a unique walker, this is it. It's stable and strong. Perfect for your baby to exercise her legs, strengthen her back, teach her to walk, engage her thinking skills. My only disappointment is that the emblems on the walker are stickers so with enough abuse or the grandmother sticks a 7-month sticker photo prop on top of it (see photo), the emblems will come off and there are no replacements (unless your computer sticker printing savvy). Did I mention you don't have to carry your baby continuously anymore or have to stay in bed with her because if she wants to move around she will aim for the edge? No more worries. You can watch her without holding her and she can roam free! Just look out for low tables with easy to reach edges, she attempted to grab cereal boxes and potted plants. Assembly super easy.Happy playtime!
