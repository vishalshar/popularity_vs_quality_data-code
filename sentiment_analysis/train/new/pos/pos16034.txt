I bought two of these so I would always have one for the crib if one was in the wash. I layer them (mattress+cover+sheet+cover+sheet) in case of middle of the night accidents, just take off the top sheet and cover and you still have bedding for the rest of the night without having to remake the bed or wash immediately.
