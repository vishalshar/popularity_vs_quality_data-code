What I love about this product:-The padded kneeler and elbow rest are comfortable.-The padded kneeler and elbow rest allow me to bath my child with minimal discomfort as I wash him. (I am five feet, two and a half inches tall)-The elbow rest is attached to the rim of my tub with suction cups, easy to attach and remove.-The padded kneeler has rubber, "feet" on the bottom that keep it from slipping on my wet, ceramic tile bathroom floors.-I have not encountered any mold or resulting smell from kneeler or elbow rest.-Both kneeler and elbow rest are easy to clean.What I don't love about this product:-The mesh bag that hangs between the kneeler and elbow rest was not long enough to keep attached and use on my tub. (I have a pretty standard tub) BUT, it was easy enough to remove from the product so that I could use just the elbow pad and kneeler. I keep bath products and toys on and in tub anyway.-The rubber, "feet" of the kneeler come off too easily.-My twelve month old has figured out how to remove the elbow rest. Fortunately, the product is safe, without sharp edges so, this is nothing but, at most, a mild nusiance.I've been using this product for over six months and it provides my knees and posture support and comfort during bathtime. I do also like the fact that the kneeler can bonus as a storage space AND a step stool for my child in the future. The padding on the top of the kneeler may not be slip resistant though so, that is something to take into consideration when using it as a child's step stool. Still, that is easily fixed with some sort of adhesive material that prevents slipping, like the kind of strips you would put on stairs.Overall, I'm glad that I purchased this product. It is sufficent and comfortable for my needs. At the time I purchased it, I felt this was the best product on the market, for price and comfort.
