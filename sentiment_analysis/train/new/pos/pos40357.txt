These are so easy to use with the kiinde bags & bottles. We give my baby about 1 bottle of pumped milk every day and he has not had any confusion (3 weeks old). He actually seems to have LESS gas after drinking from these nipples than my breast (with nipple shield) and the slow flow makes him work hard for the milk so he doesn't get too impatient on the boob.
