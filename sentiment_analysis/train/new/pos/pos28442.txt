I got this swing with a bad motor. It made a sound, like it was gearing up, when starting up but then it stayed loud the entire time. It sounded like it was having a hard time moving the swing. Like it was working way too hard. It was not a soothing comforting sound at all. I contacted fisher price and they said the motor should have some noise but if I was unhappy they would send a replacement. The sound was unacceptable, so I asked for a replacement.The new motor arrived and although the color of the metal legs is a little off, the sound is so much better! it still makes a sound while gearing up but it gets quieter once it gets started. The sound of the new motor could definitely be considered a soothing sound.If you get one that is too loud make sure you contact fisher price for a replacement. Looking at the reviews, I see that it happens sometimes. Make sure you tell customer service what color the metal is on your swing, so you don't get a different color, like I did. I don't really mind but some people might.I like that the whole seat of the swing is machine washable and it goes in the dryer too!The whole seat is cloth that stretches over the frame and is secured with buckles underneath. Looks comfy.To change swinging positions you just turn the seat. Super easy!The swing is close to the floor so you will be bending over. But it really doesn't take up a lot of room, which was important to me. You can fold one leg up against the other to make it more portable, although it's not really necessary, because it's already small enough to move around even without folding.I love that you have the option to use batteries or plug it in.I would recommend it.
