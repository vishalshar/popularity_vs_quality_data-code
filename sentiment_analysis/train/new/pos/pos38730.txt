As a business traveler that needs to take chilled medication with me on my journeys, this bag matches my needs. The two reusable cold packs are easy to store in the freezer and easy to insert in the side pouches of the bag, and once sealed up my medication stays cold for the entire six hour trip plus two hours of travel at each end. Worth every penny!
