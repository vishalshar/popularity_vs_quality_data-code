After reading through reviews I was worried that the mattress would not be the right fit and that I would have to return the package. But I took my chances since I went to babies r us and other stores and could not find the exact size for my vintage bassinet. I was so happy to see that the mattress was the exact fit and it was the exact measurement of 15x33. My package was delivered in a thick cardboard box and the mattress was protected in plastic wrap, everything was delivered with care. It even arrived a day earlier than expected. Overall I'm very happy about this purchase.
