I ordered this for my daughters upcoming birthday. It arrived early almost 2 weeks early. Would have given 5 stars but it was smaller than expected. But still big enough to fit a small snack and pullup so worth the price. It is soft to the touch and well padded and the wings are securely fit to the back of the pack. The tether is a good length but not so long it will cause tripping. And it is centered so less pull over possibilities I believe. Over all I would buy this again.
