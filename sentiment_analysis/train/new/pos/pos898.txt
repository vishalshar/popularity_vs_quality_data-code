I purchased 3 units to use as night lights for my girls and they have by far been the BEST investment for night lights I have ever made! I am writing this review after having these lights for 5 full years. All 3 are still working as they should and the battery is still keeping a charge for a full 12-18 hours. I say this b/c there have been some mornings I have forgotten to turn it off and it is still on when bedtime again. I then of coarse place it back on the charger and use a different one. Both of my girls normally would end up with one in their beds. The little GloMate remains cool to the touch and does not have anything that can harm your little one. I keep the docking station for the Mobi Tykelight GloMate out of reach so they do not get damaged. You will not be disappointed. I cannot say enough good things.
