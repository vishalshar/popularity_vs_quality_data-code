I saw these in a shop and started playing with one, loving the texture and colors.  I tend to struggle with anxiety, and these bracelets make the perfect undercover stress ball.  I can fiddle with it all day at work, and I think it really does help in stressful situations.  Plus, they look pretty nice, to boot.  Took a little getting used to, since I rarely wear thick or chunky bracelets, and the ribbons do need to be trimmed and re-tied so they don't get in the way.  I'd suggest these to anyone who has a lot of stress or anxiety in their life.
