I don't know why there are so many negative reviews about this carseat and stroller.  My husband and I love both of them, and our daughter settles down everytime we lock her in.  Our baby was born in the fall, so I can't say anything bad about the fabric either.  The carseat is heavier than most, but it makes me feel better knowing that if we were in an accident it's less likely to move around like the lighter ones.We chose this set after extensive research online.  We were orignally going to register for a Graco set because of the price difference, but right before we did that carseat was recalled for missing parts.  Then I read an article in a magazine which ranked this Peg Perego set #1 for safety.  I also liked how this carseat is anchored into the seat portion of the stroller compared to some carseats which locked into the tray portion of the stroller.  That just didn't seem very safe to me.I also don't understand why people complain about their baby outgrowing their carseat.  It doesn't matter what brand you buy, almost all infant seats go to 20 pounds or 26 inches.  If that is a problem for you, then I suggest you buy a convertible carseat.
