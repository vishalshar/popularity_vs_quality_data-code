I needed a good stiff small brush to clean the stem and spout of my coffee percolator, and the permanent straws of my sports bottles.  Initially, I ordered Dr. Brown's set of 4....they do the job, but aren't going to last long; they seem flimsy, bendable, and the bristles are sparse.  So I ordered this Sippy Stuff Brush Set.  What a difference!  This seems a substantial brush, and appears very well made.  The wire handle is MUCH thicker and not so bendy as the Dr. Brown's, and the bristles are thicker. It fit and brushed out the stem of my perc, and also fits all my straws.  I only just received this brush today; when I logged in to review it, I noted that this Sippy Stuff Brush Set is no longer available.  That's a shame, because it seems a very good value.  I hope Amazon will continue to carry them in the future.
