My son started having issues with biting at daycare at 16 months to the point where he got kicked out of his first daycare. We tried books, various traditional teethers, role playing, etc. When it started becoming a problem at his new daycare they recommended "chewlery" that he could hang around his neck so that it would be constantly available. We were concerned about the fact that this goes around his neck. He is under the recommended age. The break away clasp seems very safe. It comes apart easily but is solid enough that it does not fall off of him. He only wears it when he is being supervised, but we have not had any issues with it being around his neck.It has made a big difference on his biting. He has had it most days at daycare for about a month and a half. He went from biting almost daily to maybe once a month since introducing this. He likes the frog shape, color, and seems to like chewing on it over other children. He chews on it a fair amount and it has held up, but he does not chew it aggressively. Overall a good purchase and I would recommend to anyone who is having issues with a child biting.
