Got this at recommendation of other mom on list serve. Used it thru winter while baby was between 6 and 10 months. Much thicker and warmer than I expected. Would wear it under my coat, which I left unzipped, or over my coat If I was worried about myself getting too cold. I live in Boston! Horrid winters! Found it was a good second layer when baby wore a polar fleece bunting.The top cinch is really easy to tighten around baby. The bottom one is a bit harder and a little fussy. The shoulder would occasionally slide off from time to time. Wish the pocket zipped so I had more comfort that my wallet or keys or phone wouldn't fall out.But overall, this is a great product. Allows mom and baby to share body heat and i appreciate the easy on/off!
