This is by far the best door lock I have ever used! I use it for the laundry room door so my cat can get to his litterbox while keeping my daughter and my dogs from getting to it. It's also great for keeping on a door that you don't want little ones getting into. My daughter has learned how to open the traditional door knob covers so this stays up high where she can't reach. It has an anti-close feature so she can't accidentally close the door either. I have three of these in my house! It's a great product and a genius idea!
