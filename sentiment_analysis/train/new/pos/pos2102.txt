I bought 2 of these when my twins were born and that was almost 4 years ago. They have used it EVERY SINGLE DAY since then. They have endured all kinds of flipping and abuse by the children since they grew up a bit and the chairs are still holding up in excellent shape. The fabric teared a bit but again they have been subject to extreme use. They are 3 years and 8 montsh old now and still use it every day to watch tv and most days fall asleep in it while doing so.Don't think it twice, buy it! Also, this older version seems to me much more durable than the newer ones, which seem to have a lot of plastic and focused more on esthetics than durability.
