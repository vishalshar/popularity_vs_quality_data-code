I always hated hearing people say, "Well, at least you won't have to wean her off one later," when I'd say I couldn't get my baby to take a pacifier. Babies have a strong, innate desire to, well, suckle, both for food and for comfort - that latter one is called non-nutritive sucking. Without a pacifier, newborns (too young to reliably keep their hands in their mouths) end up tying up one of Daddy's fingertips indefinitely, or - lucky Mama - hanging off those abused nipples even more than they already do. For the love of my nipples (weaning can wait), I was determined to find a binky for baby.Long story short, these are the only ones that work. They're shaped totally differently than all the orthodontic pacifiers you'll find in stores. The nipple is a good deal larger than on Soothies. Like their name says, they're most similar to Mama. Some reviews of these question whether the nipple is too big; the age range is meant to be 0-24 months. I started my baby on them at about 6 weeks with no problem. Comparing the size of the pacifier to the size of me, I don't think she'd have had a problem from the start.  Preemies might find the nipple too long at first, but anyone who's seen a screaming baby knows they can open wide when they want.The butterfly shape works really well too. The nipple can fit in baby's mouth in any direction, and no matter how askew the butterfly wings are, they don't inhibit her breathing.  The softer plastic on the outside is a nice touch too. (Bad pun intended.) The handle gives a perfect place to attach a pacifier clip.  Highly recommended.
