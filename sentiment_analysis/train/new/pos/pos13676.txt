I had some issues with these pads at first. After only having them for a month, a pair of them molded! I contacted the company to complain and they replied within 2 hours to my email and offered to either refund me or send me another set to try. The trick is that they MUST be dried in the dryer. (I was letting them air dry flat). I am giving them another try.
