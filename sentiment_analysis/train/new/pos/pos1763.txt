I love this foot muff. I got two because I have two grandsons I watch. I use them in the stroller and in their wagon, which has back rests. No more fighting blankets! They are warm warm warm! I like that they don't fit like a jacket up top because I can put a jacket on according to the temp and take it off if need be and don't have to worry about messing with the muff, but if it does turn suddenly warm it's easy to unzip the muff and push it off the child. I can't think off any drawbacks with the muff, I wish I'd had them when my kids were little. I got the green which matches my stroller real well.
