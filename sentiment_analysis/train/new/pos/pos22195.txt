This is just a hammock for my son's collection of plush. Before purchasing this my son had a big mess of plush toys all Over his bed. He could not comfortable sit there much less lay because the toys took up most of his bed. As soon as I received this I put it up. It looks pretty good and it's very sturdy. I had to come back and buy a second one since he has mte plush toys on the way and this one is full of toys. It's a good product and easy to mount on the wall. I would recommend to anyone. It holds about 50 plush toys
