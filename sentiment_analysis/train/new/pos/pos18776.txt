I love these bottles.  We were using the wide mouth Dr. Brown bottles, but got frustrated with all of the parts.  Our day-care provider likes these as well.They have helped keep the spit-up under control and DO NOT LEAK!  I'm not sure why the other reviewer had problems, but we have not.  Just make sure that the nipple is pulled through all the way and that when you tighten, you do so until you hear the slightest click.
