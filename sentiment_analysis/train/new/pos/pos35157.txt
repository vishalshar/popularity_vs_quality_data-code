If you are shopping for this hat for a brand new baby photo shoot, it is going to be too big. This was our intention with it, and it swallowed our newborn's head. He is 6 months old at the time I am writing this review and it is still too big for him. He is big for his age too... While I was disappointed, I still love this beanie and plan on maybe putting this on him for a one year photo op. It is soft, obviously made with love and a passion, and looks really adorable hanging on the corner of a decorative shelf in our baby nursery.
