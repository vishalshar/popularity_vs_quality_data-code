My baby is 5 months old and since day 1, he has loved this more than any other toy, rattle, anything he could look at and play with.  I don't know what his fascination is with this little book, but this was the BEST money ever spent.  He can spend 30 minutes just looking at this, pulling at the things that come out, and seeing what happens.  it is amazing!  This is a must purchase!  This goes with him daily to grandma's house (she keeps him while we work).  I thought he would get bored with it, but he is now actually pulling the little animals out of their place.  He has looked at this since he we got him home from the hospital.  We would keep it on the black and white side a lot.
