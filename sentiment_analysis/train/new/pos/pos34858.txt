This is the most clever and cool training cup! It works great. My 20 month old son soak his shirt the first 2 times he used it, but by the third time he mastered the flow of the cup. He loves it! I would love to see a stainless steel version in the future. My only concern is that my son is very clever and I am worried he will figure out how to unscrew the bottom. For now I don't let him see me fill it. Hopefully by the time he figures out how to open it he will be past needing the training cup.
