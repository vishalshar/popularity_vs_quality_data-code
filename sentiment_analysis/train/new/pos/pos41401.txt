We bought this for our master bedroom to store insulin for my diabetic husband.  When we travelled, we were able to plug the frig into the car adapter on the trip (the frig was small enough to fit comfortably between the front seats of a mini-van) and into the wall outlet at hotels.  Since we didn't need to have a hotel with a frig, this item did pay for itself.  Although it is marketed for baby food, it is great for older people too.  After my husband died, I passed the frig on to a niece with a new baby, and it worked well for her too.
