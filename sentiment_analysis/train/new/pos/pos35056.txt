Well, my oldest son is now 39....and when he was a baby/toddler he had this shape sorter...this being I guess the updated version.  He spent hours, days, months conquering this toy...his fascination with it never ended.  And the many . many different shapes are a challenge.  This toy is timeless.  Pieces big enough to not go in baby's mouth.  His son is 8 months old now, and I bought this for him.  I start with a very few shapes (the easiest) and as they get figured out, I add a couple more.  The only drawback that I see, is the baby/toddler cannot open and empty it alone, but that also keeps fingers from getting pinched.  It neatly stores all the pieces so they don't get lost. I was delighted when I found this on Amazon, hoping grandson gets as much enjoyment as his dad did 39 years ago.
