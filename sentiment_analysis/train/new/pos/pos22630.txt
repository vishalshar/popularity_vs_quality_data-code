This car seat cover is universal and designed to fit a variety of car seats. Of course such a design has its pros and cons.Pros:Fits our GIGANTIC Britax MarathonMaterial is Soft and seems like it will wash wellCons:Because it is "universal" the car seat straps slip through two long slats that close via velcro. The slits do not always close well so you can see the original cover below it.Looks a bit like a slip cover on a couch with some loose fabric here and there but thats not too big of a deal for me. However, this may deter some who are looking for the tight/countoured look the genuine cover gives.Overall I still give this product 4 stars. We are keeping the cover and expect that it will come in handy. While the velcro slits are kind of annoying the cover still does what it says and "covers" the car seat.
