I received this in the mail yesterday and immediately put it on my Mountain Buggy Terrain and took it for a run. Mountain Buggies come with drink holders that attach to the angled side of the stroller, and it's extremely hard to pull a water bottle in and out, and forget about using them with a cup. This console was a dream! No bounce or sway what so ever while I was running (5 mile run). I used a tall CamelBak water bottle, and it fit nicely into the holder (it wasn't too tall). The water bottle stayed put the whole time I was running. I didn't have to worry about it bouncing or falling out. The middle pocket was great and deep for holding two bottles of sunscreen, a jar of vaseline and my car keys with room to spare. The front zipper pocket was perfect to put my large Samsung Galaxy S5 phone in. It was easy access to pull out while I was running, and again, no swaying of the pouch! So glad I bought this. It will make my runs so much more enjoyable!
