I ordered this same seat protector in black for my middle child and I loved how well it protected the seats from the car seat damage. It would get dents in it from the seat being strapped in so tightly but it didn't put one dentin my leather seats which I was so grateful for. Of all the other brands of seat protectors I've had experience with or family has had experience with this one is by far the best! BEST!
