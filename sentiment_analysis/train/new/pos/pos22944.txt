Can day enough good things about Oly!!! This has saved me from screaming rides in the car. My son LOVES his Oly. I can see him clearly while driving except at night, but it usually puts him to sleep.  If he's awakes it's laughs and giggles the whole ride. The remote is very convenient. You can see his eyes and mouth light up even in the bright sun. Easy to attach to headrest. My son is now 5 months and has enjoyed Oly since he was 1 month. Worth every penny to me and I would buy it a 100 times over.
