I had a pair similar to these that I've been using almost 3 years... and then I lost them :( These Nuby ones are the only ones I found to be similar so I took a chance despite some of the bad reviews. In fact, I ordered 3 in case I got some dull ones. Well they came 2 days later and all 3 pairs are sharp and work wonderfully! I find these little ones MUCH easier to use than any of the big ones from Fred Meyer, Target, or WalMart (you know... the kind with the magnifying glass and "easy grip" and whatever else is out there... they all seem to have fat grips, which for me made it harder to use & harder to actually see the tiny fingers). I feel in control every time I clip with these little metal ones. The only time I've ever clipped my babies and made them bleed was from using those big baby nail clippers. I'll never buy any other nail clippers again other than these little metal nail clippers! I'm SOOOO glad I found them on Amazon! These are definitely a must if you have children... and I have 3 under 3 right now so they will definitely come in handy... and with that being said, I'm glad I ended up with 3 pairs in case I lose one! The price I feel is a bit stiff only because I bought my original pair at the dollar store, but for how well they work and how sharp and precise they are, I bought them anyway... and I'm glad I did! :)
