I bought the newborn pacifiers for my son, who has a strong need to suck for comfort. He took to them right away. I love, love the containers that can be put in the microwave to sanitize. I bought the mini air thinking they were smaller than the 0-6 month, but they aren't. I don't see the difference other than the design on the side of the paci.I didn't think I'd ever buy a different brand for my son, but then I discovered the tommee tippee pacifier. He won't take the maam anymore... Which are still good pacifiers. It's all about preference :) but if you're having a hard time finding a good brand, these and the tommee tippee are the best.
