Easy assembly, easy to clean, little to no leaks!  Love these cups!  My husband and I purchased about every cup on the market and did a little study on them.  These seem to be the best cups out there.  It's easy enough to get liquid out (some cups you have to suck very hard on to get little in return).  The valves don't fall out when the cup is dropped.  It really doesn't leak.  Overall, the best cup we found!
