When i placed this order, i wasn't sure if it was compatible with the model i purchased back in mid 2012.  The model number on the back of the monitor says 2000z.  I contacted Amazon Customer Service, while helpful, they were unsure as well.  When i received it, the box says compatible with the 2000/2004 monitor.  We set it up and it works!!  Very happy.
