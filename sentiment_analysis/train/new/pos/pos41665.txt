Before these clips I would have to hold my baby in one hand while using the other hand to move the straps from behind his back and over his arms.  This doesn't sound too bad but when you're tired and exhausted bending over to do this it can get even more tiresome.  My wife found these when browsing Amazon one day and after trying them, I'm sold.Pros:- Holds the seat belt firmly in place so you can put your baby in easier.- Easy to install and adjust as your baby grows- Nice design and color.Cons:- They will leave holes in the fabric of your car seat if you tug on them hard.  To avoid this, install them so that they are not putting to much stress on the fabric and don't yank on the seat belt when you remove.Overall: These harness clips make life easier.  I'm glad to have them.Please watch the video if you would like to see this "in person."
