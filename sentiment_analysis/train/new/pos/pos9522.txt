This is a great dump truck for any older baby/toddler who loves cars.  My thirteen month old is a big fan of peek-a-blocks and this is my favorite toy in the line.  The truck is constructed wonderfully, the blocks are GREAT (more interesting than other toys in the line), and you can incorporate the blocks into the truck very easily.  My only complaint is that the song gets annoying but that's what the off swich is for.  Highly recommended!!!
