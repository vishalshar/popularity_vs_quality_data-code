I 100% recommend this product to new moms! It fit every bottle brand I had so I assume it should fit almost all standard sized bottles. When my daughter was first born the standard bottle(s) flow from the nipple was too much for her (I tried multiple name brand & generic bottles). I had noticed that this was the disposable nipple that the hospital sent home with us. It worked perfectly for her until she could handle the faster flowing nipples! I used each disposable nipple a couple of times washing between each use and then disposed of it before I opened a new one. It is quick, easy and perfect for newborns and small babies learning to balance their liquid intake. It's also a perfect diaper bag accessory for if or when you need to replace your bottles nipple on the go! It always came on time and was always in the quantity and packaging as advertised. I give it a Mom's Approval and suggest it to all my friends!
