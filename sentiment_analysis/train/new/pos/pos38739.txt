Our baby wasn't gaining weight at first.  We bought this about week 5 and started using it before each bath.  This item isn't good if you need to measure daily gain of less than 1 ounce.  BUT it's great if used every few days to give the parents piece of mind the baby is growing (which ours wasn't).  I wish I would have had this at her birth...so we would have seen her weight decreasing sooner than her 6 week doctor's appointment.Remember, though, the weigh can vary during times of the day, so if you are worried about weight gain...weigh at the same time of day in the same way!  I'm happy to report our little one is gaining wonderfully now...so we now only weigh her every week or two...just to confirm what our arms are already telling us...she is growing.
