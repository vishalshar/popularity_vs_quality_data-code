We have a Boon tub that we got from baby shower and love it but it is slippery when we put our baby in.  We couldn't really hold him and bath at the same time, and it became a two people's job to just wash our baby. So we were sad that the Boon tub was going to waste but we came across this cushion so we wanted to give it a try, and it was a perfect fit for the Boon tub.  Our four month-old baby can lay down on the cushion placed in the tub and is supported.  Now he really enjoys his bath!
