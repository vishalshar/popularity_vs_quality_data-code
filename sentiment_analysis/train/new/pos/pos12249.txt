I was a little worried when I ordered this, but the price was great and after checking the dimensions shown it looked like it was the same size as other sheet savers I'd had for my daughter. I haven't been disappointed, they washed up well, have cute teddy bears embossed on them and fit into the crib well with tassels that are long eneough to tie it to the side of the crib securely.I think the confusion in other reviews may have been that some confused this item with the Ultimate Crib Sheet, which is a fantastic product that acts as a full size sheet and which I use in conjunction with a sheet saver.  The sheet saver is designed to be smaller (think pillow sized) and when you put your child to sleep they rest their head on it so that if they spit up or drool during the night this can be easily removed and thrown in the wash. So while the Ultimate Crib Sheet is great, especially when your child becomes more mobile at night, these are great to use also and save a lot of room in the laundry early on.
