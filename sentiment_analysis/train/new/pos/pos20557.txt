I had the older version with my first child in 2010 and it was AMAZING.  This new version is still good, but not as great.Pros:Pan/ScanGreat video clarity & night visionThe lights on the monitor make it easy to "see" if there is noise when you can't use your ears (i.e. taking a shower, listening to the radio)Decent rangeCons:There is a lot of static noise & popping sounds.  I'm a light sleeper so it drives me batty.The signal for battery dying is a very quiet sound.  I was awake with it next to me and barely heard it. (Easy solution: leave it plugged in at night).There is no way to turn off the lights on the monitor and the bright lights can be annoying at night.
