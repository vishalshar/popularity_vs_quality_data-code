These work great for our cabinet doors. We tried 2 other kinds of locks that had the same concept as these, with disappointing results. (hint: as soon as I put on another brand, the baby walked over and pulled it right off, since the straps had a little bit of stretch/pull in them) These don't budge, it is the perfect solution for our kitchen. We have been using these for several weeks now, I am very pleased with how well they function. Unlocking them is a little annoying, but once you get the hang of it, you get very efficient.
