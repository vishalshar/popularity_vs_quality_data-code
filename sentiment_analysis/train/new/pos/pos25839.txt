This is a great purchase for a newborn, I definitely recommeend it. My one month old son loves it - when he's fussing, looking in the mirror sometimes calms him down which is really helpful. And when he's just laying in the crib, he often gets very quiet and still while staring into the mirror, which prevents him from fussing. I included pictures of the crib/mirror so you can see the size. I'm not good at visualizing sizes based on measurements, so it was bigger than I expected. However it fits perfectly in the crib with the mattress at the highest level. I deducted a star for a couple reasons:- the mirror quality is a bit distorted, though that is probably fine for a baby- purely aesthetic: I wish other colors were available, and the design on the back is not centered- the straps are not very long and may be too short for some crib railings (it fit our cib well, but if you have a thick top rail you may need to gerry rig it a bit)
