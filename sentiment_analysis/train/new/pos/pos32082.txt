I ordered four different kinds of prefolds to try: Gerber birdseye, OsoCozy bleached, OsoCozy unbleached, and these Kushies. Initially, I just used the OsoCozy diapers because they were smaller in size than the Gerbers or the Kushies. However, they were all dirty one day and I pulled out a Kushie and a Gerber. HELLO!! The Kushies are so much more absorbent than either of the other two brands. Even though they are large, they fit very well into my son's Thirsties Duo Snap Wraps Size One, which was my initial concern. The extra material increases their effectiveness, but the fabric itself (flannel) is more absorbent than the other fabrics. Even when the diaper is soaked through, it does not feel as wet and soggy as the other brands. For that reason, I think that it is more gentle on my son's skin--AND it's softer than the other fabrics! For now, I just have one pack, so they have become my overnight diapers. I will soon be ordering more and make them my sole brand.My diaper system:I use Thirsties Duo Snap Wraps with prefolds; I have tried several brands, but prefer Kushies. I stash dirty diapers in a Planet Earth wet/dry bag until I have a chance to spray them off with the Mini-Shower Bidet & Handheld Sprayer, them I dunk them in the Bambino Mio diaper bucket half-filled with water and a 1/2 cup of Borax until I wash them. I run them through one rinse cycle, then wash them in hot water with Charlie's Soap with a single rinse. So far, no stains, and no skin irritation! I do one load of diaper laundry per day.
