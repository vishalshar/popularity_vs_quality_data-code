I love anything Foogo! When I saw that my fiance's sister had one of these little bottle carriers I knew I would have to try one out. I was on my second munchkin bottle bag and in need of a new one. I love the fact that the inside is easy to clean when it gets wet. And I love that you can attach it to a diaper bag. The design is very cute and looks as pictured. The only downside to this is that it doesnt not nicely fit the bottles I use. I use the Tommee Tippee bottles and to get them to fit I really need to cram them in. But it does fit a bottle and sippy cup well together. I would highly recommend this product and the price is good as well. I just wish Amazon sold more of the foogo brand stuff and different designs to select from.
