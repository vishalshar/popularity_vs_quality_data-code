I bought this looking for a cheap replacement for the Munchkin bottle brush I was using, and I'm sold. It has a softer sponge on the end, so your bottles won't get as scratched as with the Munchkin brush. It's also lasted twice as long as the Munchkin did (the sponge was getting gross and falling apart). Will be buying these again!
