Perfect second base for our Graco classic car seat to use in my truck. These bases work well in my truck with seat belts if you don't have a LATCH setup like my older 2000 ext cab Chevy truck. Also works well with LATCH system in newer vwhicle and is easy to install and adjust. Now I can just drop the seat in the base when the little one is riding in my truck and I don't have to mess around with the seat belt every time we put the seat in.
