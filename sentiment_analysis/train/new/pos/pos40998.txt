I don't know what manufacturers are thinking with the standard changing pads.  I would have to use two of them to protect my daughter from whatever is left over on the restroom changing tables from other users.  This one at least protects her from head to toe.  I wish it was 6-9 inches wider so she wouldn't be touching the not-so-sanitary surfaces with her hands.  Occasionally I do turn a second one sideways under her shoulders to help protect those restless hands.
