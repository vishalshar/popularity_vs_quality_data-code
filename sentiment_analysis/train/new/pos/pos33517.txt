What you see, is what you get! Set is well designed, high quality material, colors are very vibrant, Cinderella design is beautiful, comforter is soft and comfy, the sheets are smooth and soft, and it holds up very well in the wash. Best of all my daughter loved it the moment she saw it and it looks terrific on her bed, I couldn't be happier with the purchase!
