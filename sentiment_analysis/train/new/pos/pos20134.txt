These stickers are just adorable. I'm SO glad that I purchased these back before my little guy was born. For some reason, I missed the 'just born' sticker and started with the one month one -- but now, a year later, I have a gorgeous collection of photos of him from each month. Having these stickers made me take regular, high quality (not just with my phone) photos of him, and I might not have thought to regularly otherwise. I liked these so much that I purchased the 13-24 month ones as well! They are thick, high quality, and tolerate several 'sticks' onto shirts or onesies. My little guy started to take these off but I was able to put them back on and snap a few more shots without a problem.
