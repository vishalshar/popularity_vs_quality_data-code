My 2 year old loves it. She calls it her comfy cozy bed. The comforter and pillow case are a soft microfiber material and wash nicely. The sheets, on the other hand, are not. I purchased softer sheets for her, but will use both sets. It would be nice if they also used the microfiber fabric on the sheets. Even though they are not real soft, the sheets are very cute.
