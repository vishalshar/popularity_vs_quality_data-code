This was a lifesaver for us. My daughter was Co-sleeping in our bed for the first few months. When we went to transition her into her crib, she would toss and turn SO much in the night, resulting in constantly waking up crying, wanting to come to Mom and Dads bed, and I believe thats because we have a more plush bed compared to her firm crib mattress. After MUCH searching and sleepless nights,  I came across this mattress. I didn't have much hope, but I was desperate. When the mattress arrived I WAS in LOVE! The mattress has a nice thickness, and it is a great quality. Also, I read in some other reviews it doesn't fit their crib mattress, however It fit our mattress perfectly. ( we own a; "Sealy Signature Prestige Posture Crib and Toddler Mattress"). I do recommend a deep pocket crib sheet ( I used this one Babies R Us Organic Crib Sheet - Ecru ).The first night my daughter slept in the bed, she slept through the night! Lastly, there was no chemical smell in my mattress. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND!
