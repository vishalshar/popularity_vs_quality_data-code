Looks great. The material is vinyl and it creates a great contrast with any whitish type wall. Putting up the decal took me about an hour. Mine came with a small picture for reference.A few things:I put the bottom of the tree at my where my baseboard starts and the overall height goes up to about 6 feet. The picture cutouts are also a lot smaller than what it seems in the photo. Overall the tree still looks fantastic.The design is very similar to but not exactly as shown in the picture. In fact, the design was not even the same as the reference picture that came with the decal. The reference picture had 5 birds in it, yet my decal set only came with 4 birds. Not a big deal and I am still very happy with the result but thought you should know.I messed up on 2 pieces and had to remove them and restick them. They were easy to remove and I don't think having to reapply them have significantly weakened the adhesive.Also some of the larger pieces can tend to curl/fold and end up sticking to themselves right before you try to stick them to the wall. Just gently pull them apart and you will be good to go without any adverse effects.
