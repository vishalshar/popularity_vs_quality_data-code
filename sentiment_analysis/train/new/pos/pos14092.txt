We bought Evenflo Big KID AMP booster seat last year in January and have been using it daily. It was our first purchase of no back booster seat and I questions if this is as safe as my older version with a back, but it seems to be fine.Unlike my previous car seat this is so convenient and takes less than one minute to get ready! The pad is easily removable and thrown in the washing machine. This booster seat is lightweight and can be carried by my son in the airport or transported to other cars.The only drawback is while the main seated area is a nice shiny easy to clean plastic, the handles are not the same type of plastic. The handles for some reason get dirty really fast and it's difficult to remove the dirty appearance since it seems to be part of the plastic now.Overall, a great little booster that is convenient and has two side cup holders that hold more than drinks (toys) in our car!
