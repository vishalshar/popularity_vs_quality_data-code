This is a great product!! When I first discovered it I did not know exactly what it was for. After some research I discovered that it is actually amazing. So what you do with it is take it and put it under the sheet on your bed near the edge of the bed. What this does is work kinda like a rail that you would put up to protect your child that is sleeping in your bed or their own from falling out of the bed. I had one of those but it was really hard and bulky and when the baby leaned up against it is was really hard. I felt so bad for him that I needed to find something else. I was really skeptical about this product because it didnt seem like it would work the way the other one did. But it is so great! My son, by the time I purchased this, was two years old (and still in my bed). I put this under the sheet on his side of the bed and it work wonders. It was tall enough to trigger my son while he was sleeping to know not to roll over any further than that! The most important thing was that it was extremely soft!
