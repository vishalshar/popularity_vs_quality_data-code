When my little great granddaughter was born this past December, I began to look for a frame for her baptismal picture and was very disappointed in what I found.  I got on line and Amazon had exactly what I wanted.  Our baby is blessed to be born into a christian home and the frame for such a significant affair is perfect. Some of the beautiful things that we treasure in life, seem to be disappearing from the market place but fortunately I have found them at Amazon.
