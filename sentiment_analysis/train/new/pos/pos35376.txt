I love these chains and have had one or two for every one of my children.  The only issues I have are:1)  Kids chew on the metal clip and it's very dangerous for little teeth.  But then, we're supposed to be watching out for that sort of thing!  So not such a big deal.2)  The metal clip loses its grip over time and we've had to replace our latest baby's paci chain twice.  I now clip it to my nursing bra inside my shirt, and she can only get to the bead part, not the clip.3)  This is an item we all expect will be chewed on, but the paint is very easily removed by little gums.  It's supposed to be safe for kids, but who wants their child eating any paint at all?
