I am an Early Childhood Speech Language Therapist, and I want you to know that his is a much better cup for your child's teeth and oral motor skills than a sippy cup with a spout.  Spout cups can inhibit the tongue retraction needed for development of speech and feeding skills.  Many children do develop just fine with spout cups, but a straw will not cause problems, so why chance it?  If your child has any muscle tone issues (Down Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, etc.)  I would highly recommend the use of a straw cup rather that a spout.
