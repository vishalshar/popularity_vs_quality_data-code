What a simple and easy contraption! I was super nervous about my first solo mommy and toddler trip! I decided that I needed to find an easy way to cart around my daughters car seat throughout the airport. The last time I gate checked my stroller on Delta the ramp people broke it, so I didn't want them to ruin my stroller on my trip again. With this go-go babyz strap for my suitcase I was able to connect her to my roller bag and push and pull her through the airport with ease! The people that saw this contraption were amazed at how easy it looked. Many people stopped me to take pictures and find out where I bought this. It was easy to get down the aisles of the plane and when I needed to load or detach it it was super simple. It has a wench type of cranking system that helped me tighten the strap to the bag and my daughter was able to sit in it and enjoy the ride throughout the long walk in the airports. When I needed to take it off it had an easy release system. I felt safe with her in it. Most of the time my little girl was smiling and kicking her legs with the rhythm of the bag being pushed. I would highly recommend this to anyone planning on traveling with your infant! Even if you check your stroller in a protective bag at the ticket counter and then drag kid on your bag through security check point. That was a perk not having to put the stroller through the x Ray machine...I did love this product!
