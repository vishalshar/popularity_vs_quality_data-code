We lived in a small apartment when our son was born and could only accommodate a small crib.  I liked that this mini-crib was mobile with wheels, so we could move from space to space easily if necessary.  Those of you living in small apartments/condos in urban areas will really appreciate that feature.  It also is thin enough that the crib can be moved through doors with no problem (UNLIKE the grace pack and play, I might add).  One other feature that is really nice is that this crib is easy to fold and throw in the trunk if you need to spend the night elsewhere with baby.  I liked that my son always had a consistent space to sleep in, even if we were in a different location for a short period of time visiting friends or family.We used this first as a bassinet, and because of the wheels you can move it right up next to your bed, which I loved.  At about 6 or 7 months, we moved the position of the mattress downward when our son began pulling himself up.  We then continued to use this crib until he was about 13 months.  He seemed to like it and slept well.  He has always come in at >90% for his height, and we never had a problem with the size.  When he was 13 months, he just seemed like he could use some more space so it was time to purchase a bigger crib for him that was more permanent.  By that time, we had moved to a single family home so we had more room for furniture.I LOVE this mini crib.  Yes it was expensive, but it worked fantastic for us and was a perfect solution for our small space.  I plan to use it as a bassinet and crib for our next baby too.  Don't worry about the reviews that say there is not enough space for baby.  I suppose it is a matter of opinion, but our son had more than enough room to sleep comfortably until ~13 months.
