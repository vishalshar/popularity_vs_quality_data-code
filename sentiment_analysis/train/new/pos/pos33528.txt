It is huge! My baby loves it, she is teething so the little square that comes out is perfect for her to chew on. It also makes a noise that definetly gets her attention. I wish I would've bought it when she was 3 months and started to put her on her tummy. Now she is almost six, but I am sure I will use it for a long time. It is better to place the baby on this play mat than on the floor. That was my main reason when I bought it, the mirror, the noisy square piece, and rings for other toys are nice accesories to use. I gave it 4 stars because the top part is made of a type of material that gets everything stuck on it, like little fussies, hairs, whatever small stuff falls on it stays there...I use the sticky roller every other time to clean it. Other than that, it is perfect. I would recommend it to my friends.
