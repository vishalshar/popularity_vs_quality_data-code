This is a powerful little bunny!  It seems really simple, a soft plushie (stuffing free) with a one hand with a velcro portion that sticks together but it's totally brilliant.  This little guy has helped our 3 month old nap and go to bed at night SO MUCH EASIER. Before, we were replacing her pacifier about 5 times each time she went to sleep and this guy has cut it down to one or two!  Our first daughter was better about keeping her pac in, and less concerned if it did fall out.  Our little one however simply can't do without.  Poor thing has pretty nasty reflux and the sucking/swallowing w/ a paci helps her sleep, esp. as the doc wanted her in a crib not a rock n play faster.  For whatever reason she has a tendency to launch her paci out if left to own devices.  Little crazy even bats it out at times, she can be her own worst enemy!  Bunny by the bay, we love you!It's got SUPER soft fur, and drapes nicely and at just the right angle to help her keep track of it and I'd imagine, as she gets older, locate her paci and replace it on her own.  She also seems to really like the feel of it and sometimes rubs it with her little hands.I just wish we'd had this thing 3 months sooner!
