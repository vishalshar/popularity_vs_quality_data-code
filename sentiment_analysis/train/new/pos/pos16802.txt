Old fashioned cup with the purpose of going from bottle to cup IF you don't plan on carrying it in a diaper bag. If you need that convenience don't buy this cup.  But I like it because the same cup transitions from a sippy cup to a big boy cup with no need for the sippy lid.  Most of the sippy cups now come with a screw on lid which means toddlers have to switch to a different cup when they no longer need the sippy lid.  This cup has a smooth top edge that lets a child go straight to drinking from the cup. Grandson likes it and he knows that he can find his cup in the cabinet every time....I don't care for those inserts that control flow and get full of bacteria if not sanitized properly, if used properly they are great but dishwashers don't get everything.
