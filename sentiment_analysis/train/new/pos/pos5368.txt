We have the smaller one (what this product page is selling though not what's in the picture as mentioned in the previous review) and LOVE it. Our daughter is warm as can be but never sweaty. She's always kicking off her socks and shoes, which probably sounds familiar to you, and yet her little feet always come out of this thing dry and toasty. I would have purchased the larger one had I know how much we'd like this product. This wrap also seems soothing to her. If she's cranky when we put her in the stroller it isn't long before she begins snuggling the wrap with her cheek.
