We have a large and unsightly rotating drying rack at home which has much more space.  This would not be a good replacement for that as the capacity is limited.However, for travel, this is really wonderful.  It's cute so you don't mind taking up your in-laws' counter space as much and it collapses easily for packing.  Capacity was sufficient for breastpump and drop-ins parts for about half a day, now definitely sufficient for just bottle parts for a full day.  There are 12 long points plus 6 shorter points.As a bonus, this is a safe and fun toy for an older baby/toddler.
