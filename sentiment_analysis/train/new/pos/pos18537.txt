My daughter seems to enjoy the activity bar a great deal. I got it for a road trip we were going on, wanting to provide her with an activity while we cruised along.  She slept most of the ride- so we didn't get to use it much.  Fast forward a few weeks and we cannot leave for an afternooon walk without it! She's just about four months old now and loves the zebra.  She's curious about the bananas and has gnawed on them a bit here and there.  She loves the mirror and the crinkle ear!  All around a great addition to our toy rotation!
