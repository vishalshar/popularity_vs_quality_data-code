I am always looking for the best "on the go" products, and this one is a cinch. It rolls up nicely and only takes up a small area of the diaper bag (plus it is pliable plastic and can pretty much fold up any and every which way). I love that in the car I can quickly clean it up with a diaper wipe, no water needed. Also love that it is soft plastic, so it doesn't absorb milk or water for a sloppy mess in the car, everything just pools in the bottom portion. We haven't tried it with any stain-inducing foods like spaghetti sauce - but seeing as I only use this when we're traveling I don't think that we ever will. Based on the feel of the material, I think that it would probably absorb stains from pasta sauce and such, which would be a downside if you used this frequently at home. Baby is 12-months old and still fits around his neck, though it is starting to get snug. We have used this for 6 months now, and it still looks new. Great buy!
