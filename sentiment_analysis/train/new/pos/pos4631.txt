My daughter is on the edge between 4t and 5t.  I ordered the largest size and it fit her very well other than being a little low on the chest.  But she wore a top underneath to solve that problem.  We put a pink tutu on underneath to puff up the skirt and she looked absolutely darling.  She wore it in a Pirate themed fair parade and got lots of compliments.  However after wearing it a couple times the pink ribbon across the front started fraying and pulling away from the edge where it was stitched.  However for what we needed it for it worked very well.
