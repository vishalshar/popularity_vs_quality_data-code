I gave this to my parents to announce my pregnancy with my 7 week ultrasound photo. I didn't want to cut up my original strip of ultrasound pictures, so I scanned and made a copy of one of the photos at CVS and printed a 4x6. This fit into the frame (I removed the mat). I added a little note that said "Can't wait to meet you Jan. 17!" They were very happy and proud to display the picture.
