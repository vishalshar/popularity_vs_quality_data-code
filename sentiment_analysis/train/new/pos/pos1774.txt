I've used a few different covers, and really liked this one (the plus size version). I got when I had my twins, thinking I might use the extra-wide feature when feeding both babies at once. For the few times I did tandem (simultaneously) feed the twins and needed privacy, this worked great. But it was also awesome for just being out and about and feeding one baby at a time. The material breathes and so it's not too hot for mom or baby, it folds up pretty small and stays compact in it's little carrying bag, and I could be very relaxed knowing that it was both long enough and wide enough for baby to move around a little without taking the cover off.
