This has saved half of my TV from destructive toddler fingers.  The other half, not so much!  I wanted to post a photo for others in my situation, so you can decide if this product will help you.You need your buttons to fit underneath the plate with an inch or so to spare on either side for the velcro to fit, and my TV didn't have this.  On the right side, I was able to slice the velcro into little strips and place it between buttons and along the bottom in order to get the plate to stick on.  This mostly solved our problem, as the "on" button and DVD open/close button were covered, and those were the main two my kiddo liked to push.  He hasn't been able to get it off, and hasn't even tried. It's like he forgot those buttons were there!  Hooray!On the left side though, as you can see in the photo, there is no way to affix our other panel to the buttons, as on one side the velcro would block the remote sensors, and on the other are connector ports.  So, we can't use our other one.Just know when you're thinking of purchasing this that you'll lose a chunk of under-panel space to velcro tabs, and take that into consideration.  If the buttons you need to cover are next to remote sensors or ports or other such items that need to be accessed, this may not help you too much.  When in doubt, get a much longer one and cut the velcro to fit anywhere it can!
