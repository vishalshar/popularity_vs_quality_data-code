This is an amazing stroller! I have not regretted this purchase. Even if you are not jogging, this stroller can go on any trail and road. It goes over rough ground because the wheels and it goes over curbs so much easier! It has a nice place to put your phone, ipod, or other items. I love that it has two cup holders for you and two for your kid. The back adjusts and the baby trend car seat snaps right in. I would definitely recommend this stroller and buy it again.
