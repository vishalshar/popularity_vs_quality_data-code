I love this bath mat.  We're an adult household with no children, and it does add some fun color to a white bathroom.  (It reminds me of that dot candy - you other old people know what I mean!!)  Honestly, the "dots" do take a bit to get used to, because they are raised and hard - but I tend to go crazy with the bath oil during the cold months, and it keeps us from breaking our necks.  From what I've read in the reviews, it doesn't stick well to textured bathtubs, but I have a smooth one and it sticks great.  I do replace it every 8 months or so because it gets kind of discolored and grungy - but I can handle that for $10 a pop.
