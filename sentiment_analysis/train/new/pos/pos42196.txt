I found this adapter on Amazon after we bought a Britax stroller in Belgium for our new baby.  As I did a bunch of research it appeared the Britax stroller we bought was a branding initative with UPPABaby Vista for the European market.  This adapter allows us to use our US Graco car seats with our new stroller.  It works perfectly and is leightweight, but durable.  It is nice to find companies willing to make retrofitable accessories for use with other brands.  If you have a Graco carrier/car seat and want to still get use out of it with your new UppaBaby Vista/Britax Strider get this adapter.  It is well worth the price.
