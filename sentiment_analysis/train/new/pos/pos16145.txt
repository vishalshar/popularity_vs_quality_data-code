I have a Graco IPO umbrella stroller I purchased second hand and like most umbrella strollers its compact and has very little storage. I got the Carry You Sicily Double Stroller Organizer and it fits nice and snug across the handles and I have not had any problem carry a cup of coffee in the beverage holder - I usually order 12 or 16 oz size. Most coffee to go comes with a lid, but I could see not having a lid would be a spill hazard, but that would be true of any cup holder attached to a stroller! Fits keys, phone, 2 diapers and a few wipes, all the necessities for short outings.I highly recommend this product.
