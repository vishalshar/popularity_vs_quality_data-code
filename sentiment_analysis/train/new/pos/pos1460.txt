I applied these to an outdoor table that had sharp corners and was low enough that people could easily knock their shins on it. It is wood and has an "espresso" finish to it. First off, the corner guards match the color perfectly and actually improved the look of the table. I was afraid they'd look big and bulky, but they look as pictured, pretty well squared off for a "puffy" object. I used the double sided tape provided and applied it on all four interior sides of the guards before holding it against the cleaned wood surface of the table for thirty seconds (I had cleaned the corners of the table with Windex and waited for them to dry). In order to apply the guards, I had stretched each open slightly as I aligned the interior edges with the edges of the table. I did this so that the tape would sit in the right place and not stick to the table before they were pushed in all the way. When I let go and pressed down, the guards stuck onto the corner of the table perfectly. They seemed secured immediately, but I still held them down for 30 seconds to help the glue of the tape adhere. They haven't budged since. We don't have kids, so it is possible that lower rated reviews are accurate in stating that kids will pull these off easily. If you don't have someone actively trying to remove them, they seem very well secured. We have them in an area that gets dampened from sprinklers and they still haven't loosened. We've kept the second set as backup. It seems like we won't need to replace them any time soon. They provide a lot of cushion, so if you are thinking of using these for kids, I'd give them a shot. Even if kids pull them off with the provided double sided tape, other adhesives could be used to reapply them.
