Though this pail is a tad spendy for what you get, I would buy again and again. I bought 2 planet wise pail liners (7 gallon) to go with this. Thankfully, the lid closes fully and the clamps easily slide on even with the pail liner (the washable / reusable pail liners are quite thick, so I was a bit worried). It is much better than a regular kitchen-style trash can, which is what I was going to buy before finding this item. If tipped over, the contents stay inside and it prevents cloth diapering households from smelling like a cloth diapering household. ANYONE who CLOTH DIAPERS their children should have one of these. The side is PERFECT for 1 - 3 days, and contains my AIO diapers, liners, and cloth wipes with ease. TIP: There is a carbon filter on the top (with a cute little plastic bear cut-out!), take it out and trace the same circle on a few pieces of bamboo or microfiber (because they are highly absorbent) in whatever color you want to show through the bear cut-out. Buy some of your favorite essential oil and soak your disks in it - then simply place over the carbon filter and change whenever you empty your pail. It will smell wonderful (though it sill smells fine without the cloth disks)!!!
