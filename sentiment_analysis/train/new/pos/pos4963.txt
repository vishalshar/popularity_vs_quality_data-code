This car seat is gender neutral and true to its size and shape. Was delivered on time and with the base attached. Sometimes they come without one and that is frustrating to have to find one separately. The durability is great can be machine washed, which is great for moms and dads. The seat belts worked great and the head rest was supportive to baby's head. The handle is great for complex situations too. You can grip it from many different angles.
