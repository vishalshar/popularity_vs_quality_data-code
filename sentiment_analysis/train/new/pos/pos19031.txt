This is such a great blanket to give as a gift. It is super soft, warm and easy to care for. I always buy these as gifts because they are so decently priced and long lasting. Young babies enjoy laying on them for tummy time because they are soft and well padded. As the baby grows into a toddler they enjoy the patterns on the blanket and love the soft comfort as they snuggle to sleep. I have personally washed these Carter's printed Velour blankets MANY times and they retain their size, softness and patterns without fade. This should be a must on a baby registry.
