Was looking for something to cleanse my body and my face with something all natural. I first ordered the sponge for babies, and found that to be a lovely thing to use for my face. It leaves my face clean and my skin is very soft. I do use a cleanser with the sponge. I was so happy with this baby sponge that I ordered the red clay sponge for my body.  I am extremely happy with the red clay sponge as well. I do have small patches of eczema and this sponge has helped tremendously. The dry patches are smoothing out and my skin is very soft and moist.  I stopped using lotion after my shower and no flakes or dryness.  I am very pleased with these purchases.  They are a very easy to rinse out and you can sterilize them every week or so by placing them in boiling water for a minute or two. I also love that it creates a great deal of suds.  I feel that it gently exfoliates  my skin and it doesn't scratch like a loofah or mesh shower thing.  Great product!
