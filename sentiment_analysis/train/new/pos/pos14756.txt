I take care of a 3 month old and a 2 year old. Finally a double stroller that is functional for such a disparity in ages. I can use the car seat for the 3 month old in the 60 section and my 2 year old goes into the 40 section. The stroller turns very well. It is absolutely the lightest double stroller on the market. The twin shades are independent in operation. The large storage area under the seats is nice. I have purchased separate third party hanging bags for the back of each seat. It is very easy to open up and fold up once you disengage the side flip locks.I just wish the trays were larger and allowed a cup to go on the trays. I also wish the cup holder for adults on the handle was stronger and less apt to pop off. I have purchased a third party cup holder.I looked at double strollers for months and stopped everyone I was with a double stroller before I decided to buy this one.I would absolutely make the same decision and buy this again.
