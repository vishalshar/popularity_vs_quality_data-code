Perfect for the blue daycare cots. This is not meant to be a sleeping bag. Some daycares require you to bring a cot cover. They told me I could just buy the fitted sheet for a pack a play mat and bring in a blanket. I saw this as a recomendation on Amazon and thought it was brilliant. A cot cover with a light blanket attached to it. Came with a small pillow too! My daughter is 2 yes old and has plenty of growing room in it. Great quality material was used. I still was it on the gentle cycle, but it's holding up well.
