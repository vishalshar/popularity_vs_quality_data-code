I love my joovy stroller, I have a 5 month old, 2 year old and a 5 year old, the 5 year old is size of 3-4 year old so he fits on the back step and seat. It's so much easier going to places with this because I have my youngest children all secure. It is big so if you have a car or small vehicle it won't fit. I have a 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan SXE and fits side ways. I have to take off tray and canopys and infant attachment each time I load it in van and re install those pieces back on to use it but I don't mind it. It's smooth ride, a little heavy turning but it's a good stroller over all.
