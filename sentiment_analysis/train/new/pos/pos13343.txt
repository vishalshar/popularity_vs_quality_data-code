I am very happy with these sheets.  When I was expecting my son I could not see the point of purchasing a crib sheet set that was expensive because it included a quilt and bumper.  (We were not planning to use these items according to the recommendations of the AAP) I still wanted a cute baby blue skirt, sheet and curtains.I purchased these blue checked sheets and even now that my son is 9 months old I am very happy with the quality and appearance of the product. They fit snuggle and are a nice quality cotton.  The blue is a classic "baby blue." I also purchased the coordinating dust ruffle Tadpoles Classic Gingham Crib Skirt - Blue and window valances Tadpoles Basics  Gingham Rod Pocket Window Valance, BlueThe classic look of the sheets, valances, and skirt allowed me to use a nursery theme (Hey Diddle Diddle) that was not popular at the time.  It was not difficult to find things that coordinated with classic baby blue gingham. With the help of some wonderful crafters on Etsy and these wonderful classic sheets I created the nursery I was dreaming of!
