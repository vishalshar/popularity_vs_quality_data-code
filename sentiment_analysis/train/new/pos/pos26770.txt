We have been co sleeping with our son since birth! He's now turning 2 and we purchased him his own big boy bed (a corvette) and we thought this bedding would fit it perfectly since he loves cars! Well he also loves his bedding, it's so soft, he carries the blanket everywhere! May need to purchase a spare, since this is going to get a lot of wear hahahaha!
