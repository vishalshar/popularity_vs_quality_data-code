I bought this for a baby shower gift for my brothers little girl and since he hunts the pink camo is perfect. It comes nicely packaged and I will just keep it in the box since it looks so nice. The quality of the items looks great from what I can see. I looked at buying the items individually from other vendors and this added up to be the best price plus I like that the colors are pale and not hot pink. I am sure my niece will look adorable!
