This is the best solution to toddler feeding (or learning how to) I have found yet.  We've tried a variety of suction bowls and they never seem to stick.  These guys do the trick.  I actually bought my first one in store and stuck it to one of their walls first and tried to rip it off to make sure it would stand up to my daughters attempt to feed our floor.  Sure enough, didn't budge.  So, I ordered 2 more.  The lid snaps on tight (though you need to push it a little harder than you would a simple piece of tupperware) to ensure a tight seal.  I adore that I can snap a spoon on top in the event we need to eat on the go, and the dirty spoon can snap right back in to keep it from getting on stuff in her diaper bag until we can get home to wash it.  Microwave and dishwasher safe in our house are a must, and these are both (as stated from their website, and through experience.)  I think what I love the most is that if I go through the "trouble" of making lunch and my daughter decides she's not hungry, instead of letting food sit on the counter until she is, or having to transfer it to tupperware, all I have to do is toss the lid on, throw it in the fridge, and reheat when she decides it's time to eat.  Seriously, perks everywhere.  We carry one in the diaper bag at all times in the event we opt to eat out without thinking ahead we can put her servings in this bowl so that she can't toss plates on to the floor at restaurants.  Though, if it's winter, I usually have to run the suction through some warm water first so it'll stick. Suction cups don't stick well when they're cold :)
