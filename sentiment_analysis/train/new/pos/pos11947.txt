The material is strong and secure and it really holds the pump very well especially if you are very chested, i am a triple D.. It will not move or wiggle if you strap it tight. If you strap it lose, alot of milk wont come out. I love it! Its perfect! I might order me another one. I can multitask with this breastpump bra. And you can have your maternity bra on as well if you dont want to take everything offUPDATE:Ive had this pump bra for almost 4 months and it still works good as new. However, make sure you wash buy hand and let it air dry. You can wash it in the machine but DO NOT put it in the dryer machine. It might lose it strength of elasticity. Let it air dry. If you feel like the pump bra is getting loose and old anyway, just buy another one. Its worth it. Elasticity life spand of this pump bra vary .. Depends how much you wash it.. I would wash it only once a month. No need for weekly wash cause you want to take precious care of the elastic
