I bought these because my son has pretty bad reflux and I needed burp cloths that were more absorbent than the ones I had. These are great! One side is towel-like, so it's great for cleaning spit-up off of a rug, car seat, strollers, and of course baby. They are soft, too. I was a little worried that they might be too rough but they aren't. They hold up well to frequent washing, too. I've had these for a few months now and still love them. In fact, I liked them so much after a few weeks that I bought another pack. They are a good size, too. I can just slip one in my back pocket for when I have baby in the carrier and no diaper bag. I would definitely recommend these.*Update* After having these for a long time, I have to say these are still the best! Now that my little one is older, I use them when he's teething; for both snot and drool. They have been washed a hundred times and are still in great condition. The color has faded, but all things will fade after numerous washings. These have become my go-to shower gift!
