We inherited an older "original size" model, which didn't really work for us because it was too wide (didn't fit well in the room, and newborn baby didn't like all of the extra space) and it couldn't be raised (the older models are incompatible with the leg extension kits). We bought this one to replace it, and couldn't be happier. It's a much more reasonable size for a newborn, and fits really well in the room.We don't intend on taking it up and down a lot (to make the play yard), so I can't speak to the other reviewer's comments that it's a pain, but it was super easy to assemble in the first place, and seems very sturdy, even using the full set of leg extensions to get it to a reasonable height.Also, it packs down to a really reasonable size, so we intend on taking it on flights to visit relatives because it isn't bulky at all. Much more compact than the "original size" model.
