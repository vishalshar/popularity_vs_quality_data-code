I am bewildered by all the negative reviews complaining they had to cut the straw.  The back of the packaging clearly shows that you must cut the straw, depending on the type of cup you're using. It shows a cutting diagram and lists the different cup capacities as a reference guide for cut length.I am just happy to have found a cup that works somewhat well for both my twin toddlers AND has straws that can be purchased separately because there's nothing worse than losing a straw/having it crack/finding it has fallen to its melty death in the dishwasher/etc. and realizing your entire cup is worthless and belongs in the trash.  These straws are perfectly functional for the Click Lock cups.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do AFTER you follow the trimming instructions.  Besides, better to end up with a too-long straw that you need to trim than one that's too short, leaving you with 2" of liquid in a sippy cup and an angry toddler, no?
