This is my son's favorite object. It's small size is wonderful. It's just the right size for tiny hands. Since it's too small to become wrapped around his face, I love that I can let my baby sleep with his lovie without worrying about the risk of suffocation. I purchased his first one last spring when he was only a few months old. I just bought him another for Christmas so that he can have a spare while the other is in the wash or in case we lose the other. However, I'm only giving four stars because I think the price is a little steep for what the bunny is.
