These are the best straw-sippy cups I've been able to find. They don't leak terribly (I haven't yet found a sippy cup that is TRULY "leak/spill/drip free").Sometimes it's hard to get the straw-valve to work properly when these are new - you might want to "test" them before giving them to your child... because they will get frustrated really fast sucking on the straw and getting nothing. If squeezing them (the recommended procedure) doesn't work, I recommend sticking a steak knife into the valve and wiggling it around a bit... or pressing down on the straw and rolling it back and forth on the counter or table for a bit.Because it's a straw/valve... pressure changes will wreak havoc on these... if the temperature rises too much, or you go on a plane the pressure change will cause the liquid to absolutely POUR out of the straw, soaking everything nearby.Other than those minor, easily-fixed-or-dealt-with issues... these have been great sippy cups for both my daughters. As leak-free as they get, and easy to assemble/disassemble, we love them.
