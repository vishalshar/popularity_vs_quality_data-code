I love these bags.  I have a wet bag for my diaper bag and then saw the recommendation to put a wet/dry bag in your swim bag.  Genius!! It will be so great for our wee one to have a dry diaper and clothes in one section of the bag, and then a place to put his wet suit in the same bag. Not to mention you can toss your keys, phone, book, etc., in the dry section and not worry about them getting wet.The fabric feels very durable and appear very well made.  Not to mention the designs are great!  I purchased a "coral sunset" for my wet/dry and the monkeys for the wet only.  I was a little hesitant to purchase because of the price, it seemed a little steep considering I have hundreds of plastic grocery bags I could use for dirty diapers on the go and wet swim suits, but when the bags arrived I absolutely loved them.  I really wish I had more uses for these bags because I'd buy more in a heartbeat.
