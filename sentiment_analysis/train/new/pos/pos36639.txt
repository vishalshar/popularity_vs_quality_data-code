I was doubtful when first purchasing this stroller, as in do I really need it?  I have a Britax stroller that does the job. Well I went for it to give me a push to run with my toddler. It was the best decision ever. Big difference! It was easy to run with, huge area for diaper bag, and my extremely tall toddler fits in it comfortably.  My husband is 6'2" and I'm 5'5"and we both use it and it's not a problem. If you are in between, choose this one, you won't be disappointed.
