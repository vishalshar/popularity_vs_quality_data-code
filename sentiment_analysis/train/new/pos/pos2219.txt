I'm giving this 5 stars because I can't imagine what another mattress cover could do better.  It's soft, fits well.  Waterproof membrane is sandwiched in there somewhere, barely noticeable.  Did not notice any rubber or chemical odors when I opened the package.  Very good quality at a reasonable price.We bought this for our 1 yr old's crib.  Leaky milk bottles were trashing the mattress (I know, I know.  Giving them bottles in the crib is apparently a crime against nature.  Yeesh.).  I got impatient waiting for it to arrive, and bought a Circo brand mattress protector for half the price at a big-box store.  It's garbage compared to the Serta.  The Circo has a scratchy top, thick rubber backing, stunk when like rubber when I opened the package, and is so tight that it bows our 4-inch Ikea mattress.  Needless to say, it only comes out when the Serta is in the wash.
