Using this for relief from teething, and it really seems to help. I freeze breast milk in it, and when she gets fussy (which is rare), I can give it to her for some cooling relief on her gums and the comfort of mommy's milk.I haven't used it for food yet, but for the purpose of teething relief alone I will give it five stars.  Also worth noting, it is very easy to clean and easy for my six-month-old to hold on her own.
