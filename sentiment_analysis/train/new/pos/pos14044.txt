My very first Amazon review! I saw the bad review and took a chance and got it anyway. So glad I did! I then felt the need to come back and say something. This is my new favorite necklace! I wear it nearly everday because the peach color goes with everything and I get tons of compliments on it. The beads are shiny, but I like them that way- they kind of sparkle and I have a pair of earrings that I just got from Old Navy that matches this necklace perfectly. I have not had any issues with fuzz sticking to it at all. I shortened the necklace (as I do with all my chewbeads) and I have a friend that liked this so much, I'm making her one out of the extra beads!
