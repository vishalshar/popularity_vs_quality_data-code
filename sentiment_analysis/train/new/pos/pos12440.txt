The mirror itself works great, turns on with the remote from the front seat with no problems.  The only drawback is that there are two volume settings, "loud" and "ear splitting".  Can get a little irritating when you have a longer than 10 minute drive with the same 4 tunes playing at top volume.  But my son does love looking in the mirror and listening to the music, so I can't complain too much!  All in all a good product.
