I bought this sheet to use with the CRESCENT MINI CRIB 50 COIL MATTRESS ( http://www.amazon.com/CRESCENT-MINI-CRIB-COIL-MATTRESS/dp/B000U0R5D0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1357143456&sr=8-1&keywords=CRESCENT+MINI+CRIB+50+COIL+MATTRESS) .  The sheet isn't deep enough to come to the bottom of the mattress.  It is about 2 inches short.  Otherwise, the length and width of the sheet is perfect.  I think we will still keep the sheet and use it as a "backup" because I think it will stay in place reasonably well.  It would probably work best on a mattress 3 inches thick or so.
