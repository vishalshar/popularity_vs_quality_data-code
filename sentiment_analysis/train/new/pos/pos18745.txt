We received this yesterday and put it on the bed.  It's adorable.  It is not all cotton, but to me, that is ok, because I don't want the bumper pad and quilt shrinking and wrinkling up when I wash it.  The sheet is almost a sateen and seems to be good quality.  The quilt is very cute - Kitty's head is made of a soft minky fabric while the bow and other parts are corduroy.  It would make a wonderful play mat if you don't hang it on the wall.  It doesn't say in the description, but the back of the quilt is the pink polka-dots of the sheet.  The sheet also appears to be a lighter pink, which I was happy about.We put the bumper pad facing in so our baby can see Kitty.  The back is striped like the dust ruffle.  It tied snuggly and easily to our crib.  Our baby is almost 9 months old, we waited until she was sitting up on her own before buying a set with a bumper pad.  This will, however, keep her feet from sticking out of the crib and keeps her from hitting her head when she throws herself around. We bought the matching blanket to use and it is nice, but small.I would buy this set again.
