I love this for my chaining table and overall nursery look.  It is very soft and fits my Summer Infant changing pad perfectly.  It has two tiny slits on either side to pass the changing table belt through, but I usually just hide the belt in the fabric (it's a fitted changing pad and so the elasticated sides work well as pockets for that).  It washes/dries well in my machines and I have even used stain removers on it (which have worked great!)  I highly recommend this.
