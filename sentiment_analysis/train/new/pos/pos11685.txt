We have twins and are having frozen breast milk shipped to us via fedex twice a week on a combination of wet ice and freezer packs in a styrofoam container (Insulated Shipping Containers, 13 3/4" x 11 3/4" x 11 7/8"; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZJSH3I/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6). The bags were not overfilled and were frozen flat. We found out early that some bags do not hold up well so I ordered every single breast milk bag I could and kept track of how they did (I am a scientist). Here are the results from worst to best (NOTE: this review is most relevant if you are shipping breast milk as fedex is not gentle on packages; if you are not shipping other bags we don't like might be fine but I can tell you which is best overall). Hope you can learn from our experience.Honeysuckle breast milk storage bags: terrible. More than half of these broke during shipping whereas in the same shipment other bag types held up well. I would avoid these.Lansinoh breast milk storage bags: second worst. About 1/4-1/3 of these typically broke/leaked upon shipping. It is not hard to tell they are the flimsiest. P.S. If you use these, a tip I found to help thaw them is to put each bag in a zip lock so it the bag leaks you can still use what stays in the bag (versus what leaks into the ziplock).Medela breast milk storage bags: ok, not great. Hold up better than Honeysuckle and Lansinoh. About 1/6 - 1/5 of these would break/leak. They are also more difficult to pour out of and tend to lose a little milk in the pouring process (trick is to pour fast out of these).Ameda breast milk storage bags: never used them as they come with twist ties and not ziplock seals.Dr. Brown's breast milk storage bags: work great. never had one break. stand up well on their own. very easy to pour out of. Recommended except there is an option just as good and cheaper.NUK/Gerber Seal N Go Disposible Liner: the winner! One bag out of very many has leaked. Stayed intact even when other bags did not survive. Good to pour out of (not as easy as Dr. Brown's but good enough). Thaw well. Better priced than Dr. Brown's (which is why we went with these).
