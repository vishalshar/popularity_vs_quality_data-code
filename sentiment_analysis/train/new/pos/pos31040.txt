I love this blanket and wish I had gotten it after my first child was born rather than waiting until after number two.  It is lightweight, though a bit bulky, and very easy to use.  Yes, you have to zip it inside itself, but it's not hard (even when there's sand in the zipper) and you can carry it on your shoulder or on your back.  The little cooler zips off completely, so you can just use the blanket if you want.  We use this for the beach and the sand slides off so much easier than a towel or blanket.  And it dries very quickly if it gets wet.  It's also cushier than a towel or blanket, for when you are sitting outside at a concert or picnic, like at the park on grass.  I love the design, the color, and the use of it.  My friend had the polka-dot version and I fell in love with it, so I bought this one after my son was born.  For a small family or two adults, it's great.  If you want something bigger, there are likely other things out there.  I love that there's no velcro, which gets full of sand and hair and is almost impossible to clean out.  The zipper is much more efficient to me.
