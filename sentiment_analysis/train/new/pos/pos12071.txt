Let me start by saying these are great! I have mine on the first of 2 shelves on my changing table and want to get another set eventually for the bottom shelf.Pros -1) Huge size, triple the size of some other character printed nursery baskets I had previously purchased! Those probably will be used to store some items under the baby's crib until he's old enough to really get into things on the floor. These ones are much nicer.2) Appearance - very classy looking. The ribbon colors are more vibrant in person. I'm having a boy and couldn't decide between the green, the blue, or the plain white. Great thing is even though I chose green for now I can change my mind later on!Cons -1) When they arrived, both baskets had problems with the holders that hold the ribbons into place ("belt loops," if you will, there's about 6 of them if they aren't ripped). One belt loopy was completely ripped off on one basket. On the other basket, the same one in the same position was only sewn on the top so I just ripped it off myself to make it match the other. This wasn't a big enough deal for me to send them back, though.No other cons so far. I feel these are a great value and are at a great price at 19.99 I bought mine with a TY Pluffies monkey toy to qualify for free shipping. :)
