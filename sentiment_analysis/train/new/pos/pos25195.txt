I love this!!! I wish I had one with my other two children it is so convenient! I love having all the changing stuff handy without having to look around and waste time. It only has one drawback and that is the changing station part is not machine washable only hand which is yucky so always put a pad that collects stuff underneath baby. It has a great spot for the baby to nap as an infant and includes vibration to sooth baby and sounds. It is just as nice as in the picture and the design is beautiful.
