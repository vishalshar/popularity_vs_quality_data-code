If you are someone who is has dexterity issues with your hand for any reason and have children in your life you will want to buy this Buckle Bopper.  I am currently pregnant and went to the store to try pushing the buttons on all of the car seats to find one that I would be able to push and ended up bawling my eyes out in the middle of the store because I could not get a single one to budge.  It was the most devastating thing for a new mom. I thought for sure I was going to be stuck going places with someone and could never be independent with my child due to the fact that I could not get them out of their car seat.Thankfully I was told about this Buckle Bopper by another person who is handicapped with CMT like I am and instantly came to Amazon to find it.  I was still nervous that I would not be able to push the button down, but I was wrong!  I went straight to the car seat in the store that I have been wanting (the Chicco NextFit Zip convertible car seat) and pushed the button with ease! It was the most exciting thing ever!  I then attempted to take my nephew out of his Graco car seat and managed to get him out with only three tries pushing the button in.  I can imagine that it will only get easier as I learn how to do it just perfectly for me.So, if you have a neruomuscular disease, muscular dystrophy, or arthritis I highly suggest you invest in this.  It does not cost much and it is surprisingly easy to use.  I was scared because I have issues gripping anything, but the rubber that goes against your hand and the rubber that goes against the button makes for a world of difference.
