I love this food mill. Small and mighty is the way to go. This doesn't take up much space on the counter. I am able to steam and puree anything for my six month old son. This food mill is a god send to any parent on a budget. The mill will pay for itself in no time.One large carrot steamed and pureed produced 8ozOne medium sweet potato gave me  16ozThree medium bananas pureed came out to be 16ozOver all, it is much cheaper to make your own purees rather than spend on premade jared foods. I did that with my first child and ended up spending well over 150 each month just to feed my child. I can spend a fraction of that now thanks to this food mill.This mill is a bit on the loud side but that isn't any thing for me to complain about, my old blender is just as loud if not louder. This mill is also 110V so it can only be used with American/Canadian outlets. My only con is the way the mill opens. There is a place where the top locks in with the cup. You have to squeeze that in in order to take the top off. Found that out the hard way after spending far too much time trying to open it the normal way of turning the locking mechanism.  I highly recommend this to any new parents and as a option for a baby shower gift.
