I bought two of these for quiet time timers for my toddlers. They are attractive to have out and easy to set and they have a nice loud ring so I can hear them from the other room. My kids love them especially when they ring because that means quiet time is over. My kids has been pretty rough on these and they are still work, although the top comes off it's easy enough to put back on. I also like that they are true white and not off white like some plastics. I would recommmend this egg timer is an eggsellent deal. ðŸ˜‰
