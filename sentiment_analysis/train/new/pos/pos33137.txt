Brought this as a gift to my SUPER FANATIC cousin.She likes it so much, but based on her. She dont think its real life sizes - Its lifesize, she just dont really think its the exact size of the real human.The carton is sturdy enough but I think it can be thicker if possible.THE PRINT! is awesome, not too crisp but good enough to scare me... YES... I AM SCARED.. I know that he is a fake and I just placed him somewhere, but when I turn my back, it feels like someone is watching me and then I got scared... lol.. but my cousin get chills sometime still and she told me she turns this backwards before she go to bed.WHY? cause it looks real and freaks her out everytime she wakes up with this looking on her..All in all this is a good buy... would be 5 stars if the carton was thicker and a little bit crispier on the print.
