Item Reviewed: The Rockabye Glider Square Back Glider With Sherpa, Micro Beige/Ivory (purchased from Amazon)with matching ottoman (purchased directly from Stacks and Stacks)Reviewed By: Skip Steller, Alex, VADate Purchased: 4 April 2012Newco manufactures this Glider/Rocker/Swivel Chair (chair) and the matching ottoman. Stacks and Stacks sells both, but only offers the chair through Amazon.The chair is advertised everywhere as "It rocks, swivels, and glides".  Never-the-less, it does NOT Glide. (The ottoman, however, DOES glide.) Read on....On 4 Apr 2012, I had this chair and ottoman sent to my daughter Lisa and new granddaughter Reese in Tampa; the chair from Amazon and the ottaman from Stacks and Stacks. Lisa got both on the same day; four or five days after the order.  The ottoman was find, but the chair, "flopping around in a big cardboard box" as Lisa put it, was damaged.  The back frame was loose and the cloth on the back of the chair was pulled away from the frame (loose staples).  Not so bad it couldn't be used short term, but bad enough to need a replacement.Lisa's initial reaction was "the chair is great, I love it, it's just the right size and it's nice and cumfy, but it's stuck in the rock mode and I can't figure out how to change it to glide mode.  Must have something to do with the damage, and, no, there is no button, lever, or pull to change it to glide mode."Lisa called Newco and Stacks and Stacks immediately to get a replacement chair on the way and sent the required photos and forms.  She was unable to get an answer on the change-to-glide issue so I called Stacks and Stacks and they said I would have to talk to Newco.  What???....well, whatever...I called Newco.  Melissa, a sales manager, explained that -- are you ready for this -- well, the chair IS called a Glider, and it DOES have a glide motion, kinda, when it rocks, but, NO, it does NOT actually GLIDE.  I then ask if we were talking about the same chair -- you know, the GLIDER that's advertised everywhere as "It rocks, swivels, and glides."  Yep, she replied, that's Newco's ad and it's standard in the industry to call that style chair a GLIDER, and besides, it does, after all, have that gliding motion, kinda, when it rocks."  I told her it sounded like pure false advertising (and a few other choice words) to me and that they should change the ad.  She repeated the "standard in the industry" stuff but said she would bring it up at their next sales meeting....and that, oh, by the way, I was the first person to bring it up.  Yea, OK.  I'm holding my breath to see the change in the ad.Meanwhile, over the next several weeks Lisa pinged Stacks and Stacks for the replacement chair. They were VERY non-responsive, so I suggested she call Melissa at Newco and she did.  And wouldn't you know it, Melissa and Jaime had the replacement chair shipped the next day and it arrived a few days later (27 Apr 2012) in perfect condition.  Thank you so much Melissa and Jaime!Lisa says she just loves the chair and that it's the perfect size to rock Reese and she doesn't mind that it doesn't glide because the rocking motion -- dare I say it -- glides so smoothly.Overall:***** Chair quality and comfort -- and ottoman (according to Lisa)***** First delivery time (may have been factory or shipping damage so no stars off)**  Second delivery time -- Due mostly to Stacks and Stacks non-responsiveness*  Newco ad -- Glider that rocks, swivels, and glides.  Just plain wrong!**  Newco response to ad (well, she tried. And it does, after all, kinda glide....:)*  Stacks and Stacks response on the replacement chair (Lisa is still waiting on a call back)***** Newco response to take up the slack for Stacks and Stacks and get the replacement chair shippedAll's well that ends well....:)
