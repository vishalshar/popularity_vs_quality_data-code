We were first introduced to the Nuk pacifier in the hospital as it was the brand that the hospital gave to our newborn daughter.  She took to it very quickly.  We had some Tommee Tippee ones at home but she didn't like them as much as the Nuk and would keep spitting them out.I like that they have the hooks attached to them.  It makes it easy to attach a pacifier clip without it getting in the way.  And now that at 4 months old, my daughter can hook her little hand in them and pull it out when she doesn't want it any more.Water can get in the nipple when you wash or sterilize them. I found that same issue with the Tommee Tippee pacifiers too.  But with the Nuk, I was able to get the water out by squeezing the nipple (you can hear the air leave the nipple as you do this).  The Tommee Tippee ones I found I couldn't get rid of the water as easily.I also squeeze the nipple to rinse the inside of it.  If you place the part where the hook attaches to the pacifier under running water and squeeze and release the nipple, you can add water to inside the nipple (kind of like a bath squirtee toy).  I would do that several times to rinse the inside of the nipple.  It is just my preference to be able to rinse the inside of the nipple out.After a while, the nipple does start to get cloudy.  That's when its a good idea to replace it.  Pacifiers aren't meant to be used long term anyways and its good to change them out often.  We change ours out about every month to two months depending on how much she has used it.I wish Amazon would give you the option to choose your colors.  But we ended up getting pink and purple pacifiers which worked out well for our daughter though.
