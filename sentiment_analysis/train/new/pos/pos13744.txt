Bought this stroller for the twins. Really wanted a side by side one. When it arrived we assembled it which was easy but unfortunately the fabric at the foot rest ripped without our doing. We called company and they will ship out complete new seat, as one can't take off the fabric of the footrest to replace it. Great customer service, seriously. Issue got resolved in less than six hours.We enjoy walking with this stroller, such a smooth ride.UPDATE: this stroller survived New England Winters without any problems, we've had it now for 2 years and no issues. Still going strong.
