I first purchased a Munchkin Deluxe Bottle Brush when our son was born. The small brush is great for cleaning bottle nipples or other small items. We used it for cleaning bottles until we no longer used bottles.Later, we used it for cleaning dishes. I guess it wore out after a few YEARS of use, so I found this 2 Pack and ordered.The brushes are just as great as that first one was. We can get dishes clean in seconds and throw these in the dishwasher too if they need freshening up. They don't scratch any of our dinner wear and get the job done quickly and easily. I recommend Munchkin Deluxe Bottle Brushes for cleaning baby bottles and for everyday dish washing.
