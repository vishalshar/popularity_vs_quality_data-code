I love to go walking but on windy or rainy days I don't want my daughter to suffer because of my desire to walk.  This has been a life saver (more like sanity saver) for me.  My husband threw mine out by mistake so now I have to buy a new one but it is definitely worth it.  I also have a double jogger and have a cover for that one also, but, when my son is in school, I like to just take the single jogger.  If you have a jogger this is a must!
