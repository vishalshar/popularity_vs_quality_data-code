I looked forever on the products website, amazon, etc. trying to find the exact models of infant seats this stroller would hold. Most reviews or product descriptions said only Graco, Peg Perego and Chicco but gave no specifics. I purchased it anyway hoping it would fit. Finally found my answer, it says it on the owners manual that comes with the stroller:Chicco KeyFit 30, Graco SnugRide 35 and Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30/30.I have a Graco SnugRide (not a 35, a Classic) It does fit, but it takes a little more elbow grease to snap it in place and then to unsnap it.I like how this stroller uses the infant seat's own locking mechanisms to "click" the seat in place on the stroller. All the other strollers like this one use straps to hold the infant seat in place.I love how sturdy this frame is. Super easy to put together, comes with two adapter bars for the different car seats it is compatable with.The only reason I give this product 4 stars is the difficulty in finding what seats will fit the stroller. The company should make it more clear other than when you purchase it and find the compatable seats listed in the owners manual.
