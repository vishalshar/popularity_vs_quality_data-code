Love the function of these bibs, even catches water! Started using them at 6 months for pur√©es and they worked great. Beyond the initial introduction of food they are a little small. Within a month I was buying the superbib. Unless you are starting cereals etc. with your little 4 month old I would skip this starter bib and go straight to the second size superbib. It might be a tad big at first but will save money on something used for a month.
