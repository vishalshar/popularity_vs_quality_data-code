With chrome legs, a white seat and tray, and an orange pad, this high chair is as stylish as it is functional.  It's also affordable!Pros and cons:  The pad rests on the seat with no attachment, but doesn't come dislodged, as it folds over the back of the chair.  The pad is easy to wash -- I pop it into a lingerie laundry bag and put it in the wash with all my light colors.  I do find that food sludge can accumulate in the areas where the tray attaches to the seat and where the leg divider attaches to the seat.  You'll need to use a tooth pick or Q-tip to clean everything out.  The high chair is lightweight and easy to move from one spot to another, but the legs are fairly widely splayed, so it can be easy to trip over if your kitchen and/or dining room is not spacious.  The leg divider is not adjustable, and neither is the height of the tray.  However, my 23-pound eight-month-old fits just fine.  I do wonder if it will be too snug as she grows older/larger.  But, for the last three months or so, it has been perfect.So, this high chair isn't perfect, but for me, anyway, the style + price outweighs any cons.
