I gifted this to my sister on her baby shower. This is a very beautiful crib for my new baby niece. We set up her room before she is born, and this crib makes her room look gorgeous. There is NO BAD Smell and it is absolutely gorgeous, specially the bow in the front and in the back ( sooo cuteee). I have uploaded the pic, you can take a look at it.
