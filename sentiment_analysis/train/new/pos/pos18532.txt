I wasn't sure if this would fit my 2 year old since all the reviews seemed to be coming from parents of infants just learning to crawl.  My daughter seemed to be going through a clumsy stage where she'd skin her knee then re-open the same scab again and again by falling some more.  I was worried that she'd be left with permanent scars (which isn't the end of the world, but is a sort of unsightly reminder on my own legs of my rough and tumble tomboy childhood), so I got these kneepads.  I can tell that they are a fairly high quality item, made with plenty of padding and stitched very well.  The velco is adjustable; I can see that they could be a bit bulky for a crawling infant, but it will certainly last you through your walking and biking toddler years too.  They fit my daughter just fine, but I have to say that unfortunately, she refused to wear them for very long.  She couldn't get the velcro off herself, but she managed to push the whole kneepad down her leg to her ankles.  Oh well, it was a great idea and well executed.
