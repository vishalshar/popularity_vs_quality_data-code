Pros:Light weightComes with a convenient bag to carry on to planesSimple to install (using latch system)Cons:Must use latch systemTakes a little more effort to installWe travel by plane at least once a month and I wanted to find a more convenient car seat to use from car to car. I decided to give this one a try. Glad i did because this one fits the bill being light weight and relatively easy to install.  At the airport I witnessed several families hauling heavy Britax car seats (which I also own) to the check in counter. With this light weight car seat. There was no need to check in as a baggage. I was able to easily carry my Go Hybrid in the travel bag that came with it over my shoulder through the security checkpoint and into the aircraft baggage bin. No worries of checking it in, getting damaged, or getting lost or delayed (happened twice to me already this year.Only compliant is it does take a little longer and effort to install the top latch to secure the car seat back rest compared to a fixed back car seat.
