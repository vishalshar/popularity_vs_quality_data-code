I plan to use the 12 small photo windows to house Birth through Month 11, then put the 12 month (one year) photo in the big 4x6 window.  Unfortunately, the 12 small windows are all labeled (on the matte)  "Month 1" through "Month 12".  I thought the big window was for the 12 month shot. It's like they expect you to repeat this same photo in both slots.  I wanted to warn you all about this.  I am going to spray paint the matte in a light beige or something to cover this unfortunate labeling up. I guess I missed the lettering before buying. Overall the frame is quite nice, and it came very well padded.
