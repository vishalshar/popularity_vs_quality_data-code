First of all, the description at the top of the page says the size of the Large Bartholomew bear is 21", but when you read below in the actual "Product Description" section, it gives you the actual breakdown of the sizes. The Large Bartholomew is 15"--not 21"--so please make sure you pay attention to which one you're ordering. I know that other Amazon sellers also offer the Medium Bartholomew (which is only 12"), so again, just make sure you look.That said, I would tell you that I do think the Medium bear would be too small. I debated because it is a chubbier bear, thinking maybe the chubbiness would also equivocate taller, but per Jellycat M.O., this bear is smaller than you'd think. So their 12" animals are always just a tad smaller than 12" and, therefore, a tad too small for bigger kids or adults, but this 15" guy is just right. I mention this because if you're not familiar with the Jellycat brand, you may be expecting something else entirely. Just know that overall, Jellycat toys run smaller than expected.Also, this bear is probably the softest ever. Based on the pic, I thought it would have thinner hair, but it's actually a swirly, a little bit curly plush--which I don't think you can easily tell just by the photo. It's belly isn't overstuffed, but it's nice and plump and perfectly huggably squishy. Sometimes Jellycats can be a bit understuffed (which definitely works for some of their toys' charm), but this bear is just the right amount of plumpness. There are beads in its butt and paws so it's weighted nicely and sits ho-hum and adorable, ready to be hugged. The nose is a nice velour texture, which gives the face a nice contrast. And what a sweet face it is!Definitely a must-buy for any bear lover. Also, Jellycat lists all their safety guidelines on their website so you can check it out if you have any doubts. But, to be sure: it's safe for even the youngest bear lover in your household.
