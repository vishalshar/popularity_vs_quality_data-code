In this video review, I show how these breast shields look, how they work, and especially how they fit with a Medela pump system and how they compare to Medela breast shields.  There seems to be a lot of confusion on breast shield sizes and functionality and I hope to answer some of those questions in this video.I learned a lot as I was researching all sorts of these products for my wife so hope this information can also help others too!  So if this video review was helpful, please click on 'yes' below and happy shopping!
