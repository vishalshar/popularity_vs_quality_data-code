Updated review - Monday, October 15, 2012:I have changed my mind about the product. I think it would be wise for JJ Cole to put this information on their website or make it clear in the instructions when you get the product at home. After writing the original review yesterday I went to their site and sent them some feedback regarding the short straps on the back. Below is the email response I got back this morning:  >>  "Thank you for your feedback.  >>  >>  The Bundleme system is compatible with  >>  almost all car seats and strollers that  >>  have a 3 point or 5 point harness system.  >>  With car seats that have SIP (side impact  >>  protection), the strap that goes behind the  >>  car seat may not secure properly due to the  >>  SIP.  The strap is not a necessary  >>  function of the Bundleme and is a feature  >>  mostly for strollers so the Bundleme does  >>  not slide down when removing the child from  >>  a stroller.  The strap does not have to be  >>  used when using the Bundleme in a car seat  >>  or a stroller; it is not a safety feature.  >>  If you are unable to place the elastic  >>  strap around the back of a double stroller,  >>  due to the design of the stroller, just lay  >>  the elastic band underneath the bundleme.  >>  As long as the car seat has a 3 point or 5  >>  point harness system, the Bundleme will  >>  work in almost all car seats and strollers.  >>  I hope this information is helpful,  >>  Karen  >>  Consumer Service"After recieving this response from them I better understand what the straps intent are and am fine using the product without them. When you don't use them as indicated in the email the bundleme still fits snugly into the back of the Chicco Keyfit 30. The seat belt holes are all aligned as they should be and the bundleme does not interfere with the restraints in any way. I have raised my review to four stars because I'm still not sure how warm it will be for a Colorado winter. I am satisfied and indeed very pleased with the content of the manufacturer's response as well as their promptness in getting back to me about the strap. I am no longer going to try and make an extension as I understand it is not necessary. Hope this information helps others with a Chicco debating this item.My Original Review on Saturday, October 13, 2012(3 out of 5 stars):The bundleme arctic "sleeping bag" itself seems like it will do the trick, our little one isn't here yet so I won't know how well it keeps her warm just yet. The down side is that the straps on the infant size are at least 6" short of what they need to be to wrap around the car seat securely (we have a chicco keyfit 30).I  can make the straps work but then the bottom side floats off of the car seat, if you press against the back as if a baby were in it, the back just opens up. So if you were to strap it up securely and then put your baby in the baby would bust through the velcro back area that is designed to go around the car seat straps. If the baby wouldn't do that then they would be suspended above the car seat as if in a hammock, which would mean they wouldn't be safely seat belted in.My fix is to make a strap extender myself so that the bottom side can rest securely against the car seat back and the straps can close to keep it in place. Definitely a big negative considering the price. Still the bag part itself seems like it will be plenty toasty which is why i'm keeping it. If you don't sew, don't buy this product in infant size as it will likely not work with your infant car seat.
