This breast pump works wonderfully. I was a little hesitant to get this since it wasn't the popular name brand that everyone was recommending. My sister actually told me to look into this pump as she had an older model she loved. This worked great for me. I was able to get flanges that fit my large breast comfortably and found it easy to clean. I liked that never once did breast milk get into the air tubing and that everything was easy to wash and sanitize. I had to take this to work with me and bought extra parts so that I would always have clean pieces for pumping and didn't have to worry that someone touched or dropped them in the shared lunch room turned into my pumping room. I also like my option for suction.  It was nice to be able to adjust higher or lower depending on what you needed that day. I can't talk much for the option to use it one pump because I always used both. Overall I found this to be a great pump.
