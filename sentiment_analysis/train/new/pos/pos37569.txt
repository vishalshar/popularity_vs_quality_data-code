This First Years baby monitor is easy to use and has a very long range.It's a two way system,so if the baby is crying and upset you can talk to them and try to calm them long before you get to them in certain situations,which is very useful when you're at the other end of the house,or you're outside shoveling snow.The only complaint I had was when one of the wall wart chargers stopped working,but with a simple phone call to the manufacturer they promptly mailed me a new replacement free of charge.It's a great buy for less than $20.
