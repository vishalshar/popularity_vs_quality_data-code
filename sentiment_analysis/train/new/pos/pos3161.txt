I've purchased so many of these lovely blankies now for my grandchildren and finally for my husband!  As a tummy warmer when he has indigestion.They are wonderfully soft and very very durable.  Also have purchased the little pillows and small carry along blankies by Little Giraffe to take in the car for little ones.
