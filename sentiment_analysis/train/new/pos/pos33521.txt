I've tried these three liners, Grovia,  Bumpkins, and Imse Vimse Bioliners and I like Grovia best.  I do not reuse or flush liners, so that doesn't factor into my rating.  Reuse without laundering is unsanitary.  If it does not break up when wet it should not be flushed. If it breaks up when wet it doesn't work as a diaper liner. Therefore diaper liners should not be flushed. They will get caught in your sewer system and cause clogs. Just used the garbage.That said, Grovia kept my baby's skin driest, and her irritated skin cleared up.  Bumpkins were very soft but became wet to the touch.  The ones that accidentally made it into the washer left an awful mushy mess.  Imse Vimses were pretty good, paper like, not especially soft.  They were faintly damp after use.  They survived the wash and dryer and could be reused once.  They were significantly more expensive.  Grovia are smooth and soft to the touch.  They are translucent.  I place them flat on the diaper and let the edges stick out.  They feel dry after use and have not caused wicking problems.  Strays in the wash shrivel up and become unusable, but don't dissolve into a mess.
