This cup is good for my 1 year old, his first straw cup. he is able to drink from it easily. The handles and height are great. The cup does have to be relatively upright for the straw to work, so when he tips it like a sippy cup, if it's not almost full, he isn't able to drink out of it. Also, the last probably 2 ounces is almost impossible to drink, and ends up poured into another cup or wasted. The claims that the cup doesn't tip over, so the straw never touches the ground are untrue - it rolls around constantly, a little hard to set down upright. The pieces I just clean by running hot soapy water through, but I'm not sure how clean I'm getting them - over time I guess I'll have to watch for signs of mildew in the hard to reach places. All of these negatives listed, I still like the cup and will probably order another.
