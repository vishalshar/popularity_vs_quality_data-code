My 6 month old is playing in his activity go round right now. He loves it. His favorites seem to be the piano and the little spinning dolphin. This must be a newer version, because there are no strings w/ fish attached, like I've read on other reviews, so the makers must have realized the hazard and removed it. We haven't had any problems with it yet at all. It took my son a few days to realize that he can walk around it, but now he does it like a champ. Lot's of fun, and I would recommend it over the excersaucer simply because when he outgrows one function of it, we can just remove the seat and he still has an activity table. My only complaint is against Amazon. When I ordered it, it was at full price. The next day it went on sale, 25% off (or almost $20 less). I called to see if I could get the sale price (I hadn't even received the item yet!) and they would not do it. So rude! Anyway, what I did was ordered it again at the sale price, and refused the first shipment, sent it back to them. They credited my account for the first purchase, and I just had to wait an extra 2 days to get the next shipment. I dont get their new policy, but whatever, I still got the discount in the end, just took a little longer. To sum it up, yes, I'm very happy with the product, and my baby loves it!
