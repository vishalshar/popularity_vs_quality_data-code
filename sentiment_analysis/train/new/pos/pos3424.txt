I accidentally bought the large size silicone feeder nipples when I originally purchased the Kidsme self feeder, so I picked these up to use since my son is younger and just starting solid foods.I thought that the holes in the small size would be smaller, but they are the same size holes as the large nipple.  The only real difference is the actual size of the whole nipple.  I think my 6 month old could easily use the large nipple (and he does not have a large mouth - he is actually on the small side and about 15 percentile).Next time I probably would skip the small and just get the large size to save money.  It holds more and is easier to get the food in and out.Despite that fact, these work well and I love them better than the mesh feeders that we have so I gave it 5 stars.As a frequent online shopper, I look to reviews to help me make decisions about my purchases and always try to leave helpful information in my reviews for others.  I did not receive a discount on this item, but provide my observations to hopefully help someone else.
