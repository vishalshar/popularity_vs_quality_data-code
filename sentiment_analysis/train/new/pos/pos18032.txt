I get very frustrated by the over "toy'd" baby products out there. Too much crazy color, too many silly plastic toys, just too much! This is simple and elegant. The mat is not very padded, but it is padded enough, especially if you are putting it down on top of a carpet. The pillow is quite firm and does not feel like it will compress quickly with use. You might actually get some life out of this pillow. The toys are simple and detachable. It would be easy to attach your own toys if your child isn't interested in the included ones. It is hard to tell from the picture, but there is a height scale printed on the mat. I think this is kind of cool! Tummy time is really important for infants, don't get one of those mats with all the toys hanging above their heads, get something like this that encourages motor skill development!
