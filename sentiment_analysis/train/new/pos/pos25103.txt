I am SO glad that we are allowed this forum to discern a product's quality and/or worth...Like others, I had assembled this gate in a fashion that APPEARED to follow the cryptic instructions included. The locking mechanism seemed arbitrary (at best) and I assumed it was nothing more than a magnetic latch. After reading OTHER reviews, I realized that it needed to be adjusted somewhat to facilitate the need to LIFT the gate (to open). Voila! (Check out "Great pressure mount gate for top of stairs" and "Good once you learn how it works" reviews that are both under the four star rating...)This is the first day I have it "installed." I was disappointed that it came with "cups" to screw into the wall for the recommended installation. I have chosen to disregard those instructions and use it simply with the tension (it is to confine dogs, NOT as a safety measure for a child...).The quality appears to be solid and durable.I am disappointed that it is made in China.The instructions are pathetic.I WOULD purchase this item again, but the seller should be embarrassed that the most legitimate instructions were shared by other reviewers, not their booklet....
