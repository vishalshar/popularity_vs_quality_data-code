I needed two rain shields for a trip to a Disneyland last week (just in case).  Babies R Us carries $28 stroller shields and since I needed two that wasn't an option.  As usual I turned to Amazon and so glad I did.  These weather shields are a terrific value for the price and work great.  It did rain and these were easy to remove from the package, shake out and have on two umbrella strollers in about 45 seconds.  Not only did they keep my grandkids completely dry but kept them very warm too despite the two mesh air vents.  The front panel is plenty big enough and covered my long legged granddaughter all the way down to her shoes.The shields fold up easily and fit into the storage pouch that is included.  I highly recommend this weather shield for any type of rainy or cold weather.
