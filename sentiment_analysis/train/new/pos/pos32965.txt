Perfect little teether for the little one.  No matter what side he/she chooses to gnaw on, it works.  Very flexible, so the little one can grab it easily.  My grandson, who is 7 months old, adapted to the design very easily.  He was able to hold the teeter and chew on it at the same time.  He also would bend it in half and still chew on it.  He really enjoyed getting such a great workout on his gums!Please NOTE:  the material this teether is made of clings to lint, dust and hair.  If your little one drops it on the carpet, even the carpet fibers will cling to it.  Just make sure you keep an eye on the little one when crawling around.  He/she might end up with more than just a tether in his/her mouth.  We have to make sure we have wipe available to clean it whenever it takes a dive for the floor.
