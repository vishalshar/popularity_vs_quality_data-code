My daughter got one of these for Christmas and it quickly broke  at the hands of a ceramic pig hunter. We no longer let the new pig wander so far off the ranch. As advertised it is a pink and yellow polka dot piggy bank. My 4 year old loves it. It was packed well and received in one piece. The finish had a few more defects in it than I had hoped, so better quality control would have been nice. So that is why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars.
