THE GOOD:**Cute - Nice color and I love seeing my little one in it. :)**Ease of portability - Extremely lightweight yet really sturdy. It's easy to pick up and move around to places like on the big couch in lvg rm, bed, floor opposite kitchen, etc.) EVEN while he's in it. Love that I can do my chores while he hangs out with me.**Thumbs up for Arc of hanging toys - When I first bought this, I would just leave the arc of hanging toys off because my baby wasn't old enough to appreciate them. Now that he's 9 weeks he really seems to be enjoying the toys!**Baby enjoys being in it - My son loves this bouncer. He watches me from it but most of the time he just sits quietly in it, checking out the "scenery". He likes to kick his feet, smile, and "talk" to me from it as well! :)**Hands-free care - Also found I can "bounce" his bouncer with my foot by gently nudging the frame up and down while I do computer work or check emails, etc. Invaluable for getting stuff done WHILE he's awake.THE BAD:**Hanging Arc of toys is NOT a handle - I was a little frustrated about this at first but then I realized you could pick up the bouncer from the metal base. The arc is really just for toys and nothing else. IMO, this issue is hardly consequential as this product gives such great value for the money.OVERALL:Awesome buy. You might be tempted but try not to leave your baby in this for too long!! LoL
