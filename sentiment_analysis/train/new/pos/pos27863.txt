I don't jog, so I can't say it's a great jogging stroller, but I bought it at my local Target last year on sale for about $80 and I LOVE IT!! The only thing I could have asked for more than what it already has would be a child tray, although just now I was wiping it down and noticed great mesh pockets in by the child. That will be great when he is old enough to figure out how to use them. It folds down very nicely for a good sized jogging stroller, and has pockets just about everywhere (I've had mine a year and, see, I'm still finding pockets!). I think that the very best feature it has is the hood - it is very long, and the whole thing rotates so you can adjust it as you turn into and out of the sun. Personally I have noticed no problems with the front wheel, but, again, I only walk with it.  This is great for almost any use - even every day.
