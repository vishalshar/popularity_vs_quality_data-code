I bought this stroller at Target while they were having a big sale so I only paid $49 for it!!! So for the money I paid for it I love it and think it is worth every penny although there are somethings that I do not care for. I do not the fact that there is no tray for the baby..it's just a bar that goes across?? I also find it kind of hard to sit my son all the way in this seat since you have to pull the string in the back and I can't get it to where I want it so he sits pretty much laying down. I also don't like the canopy I think they should have made it bigger so that the baby gets protected more. And I also wish that the basket was a little bit larger but other than those few minor complaints I love this stroller. It is lightweight enough for me to carry up 3 flights of stairs since I live in a 3rd floor apartment. It take up very little room in both the trunk and in the house. I use this stroller around the house alot since my son is not yet sitting up on his own yet and is very heavy to carry with me it makes it convenient for me to just wheel him into the room. and it is small enough to manuver around the house. I also like that the stroller handles are alot higher than other strollers so its easier on my back when we go for walks. So I do recommend this stroller for light travel like walks or shopping but when we go out on an all day trip or are doing alot of shopping we usually bring our bigger stroller.
