Great for early education, even for a 9 month old. To my surprise, these were yet another inexpensive toy we could afford along with other purchases without breaking the bank. Simple fun without being too complicated for fast and easy learning. The cup sizes and material are made well enough even for our daughter to grab a hold of the largest with ease. Also, because they're lightweight and stackable, they can be put away very easily. Easy to clean and can't hide any dirt or grim in unwanted places. Smooth design allows cups to slide in and out without getting stuck. Each is numbered, and has a unique pattern imprinted on the bottom. Overall, very pleased with the quality and price.
