This is my 5th year using this food mill and it has saved me countless hours when making marinara sauce.I no longer have to skin and seed the tomatoes; I just cook them down run them through the mill and I have beautiful smooth sauce.  (I usually run the pulp through twice)While I don't use it daily, it's held up well for the last five years.  It's easy to use and easy to clean.They may be "old school" but a food mill is the way to go when making tomato sauce.
