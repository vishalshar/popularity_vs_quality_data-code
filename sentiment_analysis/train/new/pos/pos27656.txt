I really can't stand all the Velcro in baby items because it has a tendency to stick to everything you don't want it to, especially in the laundry, and cause runs/snags.  I found a few bibs with snap closures, and they are OK, but nothing fantastic.  I received this Ah Goo Baby bib as a gift and I love the magnet closure.  Also, my 3 mo old has a thick neck and a lot of the baby bibs are pretty tight on him.  This bib has a decent size neck opening that I can use it for a while.  The terry cloth is also much thicker than other bibs I have and is therefore more absorbent for my drooly/messy son :)  Am buying two more!  Would buy even more if there were more fabric patterns that are either more "boy oriented" or gender neutral.
