I have several of the Lamaze Play and Grow toys. This is one of the better ones. My baby got this around 4.5 months and is now 6.5 months. The tentacles are nice for chewing on. He really likes the felt feather in the hat. The rings are probably his favorite part of this toy because they are easy to hold and he can chew on them. He's getting better at grabbing the rattle ball. The mirror does nothing for him, surprisingly. Over all, the toy is very cute and kinda reminds me of Captain Jack Sparrow which makes a lot of adults that see it like it as well.As far as comparing it to the other Lamaze Play in Grow Toys we have, I'd probably rank them in this order:1. Jacques the Peacock (excellent toy and perfect length to hang off the side of my diaper bag, I highly recommend)2. Freddie the Firefly (very good length to hang off the stroller visor)3. Captain Calamari4. Tina the Tiger5. Logan the Lion
