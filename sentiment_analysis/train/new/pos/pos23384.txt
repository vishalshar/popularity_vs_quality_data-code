My son loved the FS Bouncer and we used it from when he was an infant to when he, at around 9 months, would kick so hard he could start rocking the seat off its legs.  I don't blame the bouncer for that- he was kicking really hard!  He loved that seat and would kick and bounce away.  Or, when he was sleepy, the vibrating function would get him to fall asleep in minutes.  My son never cared for the activity bar thing that comes with it, but it was easily removed.  I loved this seat so much, it has been my go-to purchase for baby showers!
