(Review by wife) After enjoying many months of the HABA Sunshine Mobile above the diaper changing station, we wanted something more interactive for the always grasping 6-month old.  So, we hung this mobile with the lowest yellow "butterfly" within arms reach.  I quote butterfly, since these look more like bugs or at most a dragonfly.  Diaper changes have never been as fun!  She loves to reach, grab, and shake which will create a storm of baby rattling noises.  Each has its own sound- squeak, rattle, crinkles.  Plus, the center green donut shape has a jingle bell.  It's just pure fun.  Plus, if she yanks too hard then she ends up with a toy in her hand that she can continue to play with.  Sometimes she's playing with that toy for a good thirty minutes after a diaper change.  Perfectly sized, happily bright, super light and soft for a baby.Apparently, we have a different model because the 3 butterflies are attached by Velcro (& not magnets, like previous reviews) to the mobile. The butterfly has the soft side & the mobile string ends in a flat dot that has the hooked side.
