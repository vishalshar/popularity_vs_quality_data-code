I read the other product reviews on this and went with this despite some of the less than good reviews because it matched the DaVinci items I has purchased previously. So glad I did! The color matches perfectly, the quality is actually pretty good, and my husband installed it with no issues. It took about an hour and a half. It is not very large but a good size for a nursery. My nursery is long and narrow. It looks like solid wood and the drawers are sturdy. Definitely better than IKEA although I see others disagree. And I am very picky. I recommend this piece!
