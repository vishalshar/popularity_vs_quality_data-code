I am a complete car seat nut, I did hours of research wanting to make sure I put our daughter in the safest seat possible. I purchased this seat October 16, 2013.. the best decision I have EVER MADE! On February 2, 2014 we were involved in a serious accident on the freeway. Our car was "t-boned" on the driver side causing our curtain and side airbags to deploy, sending our car across 5 lanes and landing facing oncoming traffic. I am happy to report our entire family walked away unscathed! My 17 month old daughter was safely secured in her Recaro seat and thanks to their impeccable side impact testing my little girl is unharmed. I am on Amazon this evening purchasing her replacement seat because I cannot THANK Recaro enough for keeping my girl safe and sound!!!!
