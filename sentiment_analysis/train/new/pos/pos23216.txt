Haven't used for diapering, but found a ton of other uses! We bought 2 packs initially, but went back for another pack after having our daughter for about a month. Some highlights of the many uses:1. We mainly use these as burp cloths. They are super absorbent and her larger messes don't get through like they would with towels and other cloths. They are also larger than your average burp cloth...super helpful because the spit up is not usually well contained!2. We keep a few in the diaper bag and use these when changing her in areas outside of the changing table. Great to put under her head to catch any spit up that occurs during a change. Can also place under her diaper to catch anything the happens during the change.3. I tuck on of these into my bra when nursing to effectively line the area under her- catches any overflow or accidental spit ups that occur when eating. This has saved quite a few shirts... and probably pants too when there's a big spit up.4. This sounds strange but it works - line my nighttime nursing bra with one of these folded lengthwise. Way better than nursing pads since the bras shift during the night and pads aren't alway positioned to catch the milk. This covers me from side to side and top to bottom and with the double layer, nothing gets through to my shirt or sheets!This is the list after 8 weeks. It's not 101 yet, but you get the idea. Worthwhile purchase.
