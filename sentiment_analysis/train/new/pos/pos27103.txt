I purchased the Diono Travel Bag for my daughter's car seat to take on vacation. First, I'm a stickler at keeping our things as clean and damage-free as possible. I wanted this bag because I planned on gate checking the seat. I never check it in at the ticket counter because I've seen car seats falling off the trolley on their way to the plane.  The baggage handlers don't even notice and sometimes the seats get run over.  Not happening to our seat!  The bag comes with dual straps so you can carry it as a backpack. However, if you own a Diono Radian RXT, you know very well how heavy they are.  I wasn't going to put my husband through that so I also purchased a $22 luggage cart so I could just pull it behind me.  It worked out great!  Once it was time to gate check the seat, I just folded the luggage cart and stuck it in the bag too so it wouldn't get lost.  The bag itself is made well. The zipper is pretty heavy duty and did not rip.  I will have to update this part once we've used it more, but for now I feel it's a must-have for traveling.Luggage cart: Sparco Compact Luggage Cart, Easy-Grip Handle, Flip-Out Support Platform, 150 lb.
