My 4 year old son and I were in a wreck in which our truck flipped and landed upside down.  This is the car seat he was in and he walked away without any scratches or bruises (I was using the 5-point harness).  The only negative was the difficulty I had getting the harness to unbuckle but at the same time it gave me extra security in knowing it kept him tight and secure in his seat.  Recline features are nice and size works well for most vehicles.  He has been in this seat since he was a year old.
