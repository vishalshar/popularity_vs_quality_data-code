These work well to mark my son's bottles for day care. They are durable, and can be washed in the dishwasher with the bottle. I saw several complaints about the writing not staying on, but I haven't had that problem. To be absolutely sure, I wrote on the labels, boiled them for 2 minutes, took them out, then wrote over my original writing, then boiled once again. The writing is still as clear as original after multiple uses and washes.Top critical reviewSee all 65 critical reviewsâ€º13 people found this helpful
