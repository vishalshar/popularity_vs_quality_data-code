We did a lot of research before buying this and it was rated in the top 10 from Parents Magazine, had very good ratings from the NHTSA, and was ranked high by Consumer Reports.  It is very lightweight which is a little surprising.  It is a roomy carseat, has cup holders on both sides that can be pushed back in if you are not using them.  The arm rests are nice.  My daughter seems very happy with the seat.  We previously had the Sunshine Kids Radian 80 as her toddler car seat--it was nice, but much narrower, no cup holders, no arm rests, and no head cushions that stick out like this one.  We have had it for a month now and are very satisfied!
