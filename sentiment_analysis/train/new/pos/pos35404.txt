Plain and simple, I love the orbit baby line. We have outgrown the infant seat and the toddler car seat is easy to install and use. Not the highest rear facing limits around, but the ease of being able to settle my son into his seat and be sure he is properly fastened more than makes up for it. Although we also have the stroller seat, being able to plug this into the stroller when traveling is great. So glad we invested in this system.
