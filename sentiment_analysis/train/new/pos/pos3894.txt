This sling was absolutely terrific, especially when my son was a newborn to about 5 months.  I also have a Baby Bjorn, but that was better for later on.  At first, the Nojo is excellent because the baby doesn't have to be upright and you don't have to worry about the head floppiness.We had actually purchased another, more expensive sling but it had more of a "bucket" for the baby to go into and my son hated it! With the Nojo, you really can adjust everything - where you put them, how you put it on, how high or low you wear it, etc.There are two excellent uses that I found for the sling, but DIDN'T like the Baby Bjorn for:1) At night when the baby is very young (up to about 4 months), you can "wear the baby down" in the sling by walking around till the baby falls asleep.  It's a great way to calm/ quiet and get the baby to sleep.  It used to work when even rocking wouldn't work.2) You can literally do the dishes, laundry, even have a snack while wearing the sling.  This was somehow a lot harder for me with the Bjorn because I kept bumping the baby.Don't get me wrong, I love the Bjorn too and find it much better for walks.  But around the home, the sling was always the carrier I would turn to.  It's just so easy to throw on, throw the baby into - not a lot of straps and so on to deal with.Outstanding purchase for yourself or a shower gift!!!
