I like this cover because it was the color shown- a very bright red. Some products come faded or slightly off but this did not. Fits perfectly into my son's NY Giants themed room. The only reason that I didn't rate it with all the stars was because it is thinner than my other changing cover from another company. But I suppose that's just because of a different material used. I would buy it again if I needed to though.
