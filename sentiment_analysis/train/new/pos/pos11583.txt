This video was taken moments after I showed these training chopsticks to our 2.5-year-old daughter. We eat Asian food regularly and she got frustrated trying to use regular chopsticks (but wanted to try), so I offered to get her these. She was so excited to use them, she didn't want to wait for an actual meal...and she's been using them ever since, with no issues. Sometimes she asks for a reminder of how to hold them, but mostly she's able to pick them up and use them entirely on her own (she'll sometimes take them out of the drawer of her own volition, even when we're not using chopsticks ourselves). Our daughter is fairly small for her age, and she's never had a problem with these being too large for her. Excellent quality product. Dishwasher-safe (we've put them in multiple times so far and they still look brand new). Super easy for anyone to use. I wish these were around when I was learning to use chopsticks!
