I've been experimenting with nursing pads for months now.  I've purchased a huge range of pads and none have been just right -- too small,  too bulky, too thin, oddly shaped, etc.  So, I was resigned to the fact that there wasn't one brand that would do the job, and I made due.  And, I would often wake up un the morning soaking wet, or at the grocery store with a wet shirt, because the bulkiest pad still couldn't manage.  The most absorbant pad was the Bamboobie, presumably because it had bamboo fibres, but because of its awkward shape (and resulting small surface) I didn't wear them too often.Although I was no longer actively shopping for pads, I saw these at a breastfeeding supply store in Canada a few weeks ago.  I noticed them because they're really BIG -- definitely bigger than anything else I had seen to date.  And, they're bamboo, so I thought they might work well.  After trying them out for a few days, I must say that these are AWESOME!!  They are so absorbant, lasting through a full night and even into the day.  They also cover a much larger surface of your breasts than the others so are less noticeable and are smooth and soft (and hold up really well in the wash).Really a superior product to all the others.  Wish they were a bit cheaper, but I've invested in a few sets anyway because I have a really hard time putting up with the others now that I know how much better these are.  Wish I had these from the start!!---update two years in!I still use these pads (now for my second baby) and love them.  The bamboo pads are the best and most absorbent of any pads I've found.  I also purchased the thinner pads from this company and they are not nearly as absorbent (they often don't even last through one feeding) although they are also large and comfy.
