When I opened the package, I thought like may reviewers, I was conned. Then I read the instructions!This has an adjustable clasp which you control with a coin! That is the part so many people have missed. Out of the box, it does not have a wide opening. Using a coin, you can make it wider to fit the thicker City Mini GT handle. Check out these photos for yourself.It is sturdy, swings well and holds large, heavy cups and bottles. My picture includes a wide and heavy 1 liter bottle of water.1 - Unscrew the two pieces.2 - Using a coin, open the clasp as far as possible.3 - Attach to the handle using the small screws.4 - Tighten the clasp using a coin.5 - Insert bottle and go for a walk!
