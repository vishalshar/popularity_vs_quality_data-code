This is so inexpensive and one of the best purchases I've made for my newborn. Nothing fancy, but very soft and warm. My baby has not been thrilled with flannel receiving blankets or cotton jersey blankets. This one has really worked for her. Her hands and feet stay warm and she doesn't struggle and try to push it away from her body; she snuggles right into it. Great buy and a terrific, inexpensive gift idea.
