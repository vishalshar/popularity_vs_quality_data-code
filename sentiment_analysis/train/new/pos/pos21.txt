These work fine to contain most spills.  My 12 month old likes to eat on the go and I wanted something I could leash to the stroller and also that he could grab easily with one hand.  The handles are PERFECT for that!  He still hasn't figured out the actual mechanics of the top, but he's able to get food out.  It just takes more effort than if he were a few months older.  HOWEVER, in the car, he was shaking it like a maraca along with the music, and when I went in the back, there were graham bunnies and cheerios surrounding him in the carseat...so it isn't fool proof.  Also, the listing is for a GENDER NEUTRAL product and though it indicated colors may vary, I was fine with pretty much any gender neutral option.  I ordered one for a friend, which ended up being green with an animal on it.  But when I ordered for us, it was blue with a race car.  I have a boy, and I'd still probably use it for a girl since we have it, but it's certainly not gender neutral - so beware the possibility.
