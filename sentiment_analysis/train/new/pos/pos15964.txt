I absolutely LOVE this nursery set! Just received it today, & it couldn't be more perfect! The reviews helped me decide on buying it since I was skeptical about ordering online, but the material isn't cheaply made and there aren't loose strings or stitching! I can not wait to set it up! Yes the stripes are Brown instead of black but to me that doesn't matter a bit! Definitely worth the price!!!
