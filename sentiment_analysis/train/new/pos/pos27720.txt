Such a sweet mobile for my little cowboy! But, it only plays for about 15 seconds...wish it played longer to put the baby to sleep, but it is so cute and adds a little cowboy flair to my farm animal nursery, I just love it! I have gotten so many compliments too! It looks like it's gone down in price since I bought it just 3 weeks ago, I would highly recommend buying on Amazon since I can't seem to find it in any stores....LOVE it!
