My daughter started wearing these around 6 months and outgrew them by 10 months.  She is small (skinny - has never had baby chub) and has average size feet.  at her 9 month check up she was in the 50th percentile for height and weight.  While I do love the socks - don't hold off on washing them if you buy them wash them much sooner than you think! I cannot imagine any child wearing these at 24 months.
