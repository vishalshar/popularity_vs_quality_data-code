We just started to use this with our daughter (5 months), and so far, she loves it.  It has made nap time much easier, as often, she lies there and just stares at the ceiling until she falls asleep. Unlike some others we tried, the music is not too loud at the low setting, and it's actually nice music.  Starts with voice (a very soothing voice) and moves to classical.  Projection stays on awhile, but is pretty bright, so I'm glad it doesn't stay on longer than the 12 mins or so....Remote control seems to be iffy, but we're okay with that.  Still give it 5 stars.  NB: The device comes with AA batteries as a "demonstration" in a blue box inside the battery compartment.  You're supposed to take out the batteries AND the blue box thingie and use C batteries.  This seems really dumb to me.  I think I'm missing something---why would you want to demonstrate the use of batteries with the wrong size batteries? Anyway...read the directions and use the C's---it will last you much longer this way.  I think that's why other reviewers keep mentioning having to buy a lot of batteries.
