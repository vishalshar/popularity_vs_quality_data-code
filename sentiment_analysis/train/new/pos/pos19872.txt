I ordered several calendars, since the descriptions and photos were not very helpful. I gave this calendar a four because I will be returning it due to the divorced grandparents issue below, which does not apply to everyone.I did not remove the shrink wrap on this calendar, so my review is based on the back cover. My issue with the calendar, and the reason it will be returned, is because of the format of the Family Tree page, which is pictured on the cover. There are spaces for grandmother and grandfather instead of grandparents, which does not work well if the grandparents are divorced. You would only be able to include the biological grandparents, which does not accurately depict the family that the child knew as they were growing up.The calendar contains (per the back cover):- Humorous journal prompts (I love to watch, my favorite place to visit, etc.) and space for a large photo.- You write in the month and year, so none of the 81 stickers are "wasted" on month titles.- Birth announcement and family tree pages.
