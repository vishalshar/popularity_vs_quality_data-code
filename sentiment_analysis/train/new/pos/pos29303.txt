I bought these to use as a doubler with the Alva charcoal bamboo inserts.  They are very floppy and thin, so they are a great doubler because they don't add any bulk.  They are very absorbent (I did a little test: I put 1/2 cup of water in a dish and found that this doubler absorbed the water very quickly, and when I picked it up, no water dripped off at all!  It even had a little bit more room left to soak up more! ... very scientific, I know! ðŸ˜‰) These are a great purchase!
