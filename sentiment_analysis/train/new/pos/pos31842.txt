The Capri Lightweight stroller is a good balance between weight, size and durability. We took it overseas to visit family and it held up to the rigors of travel well. Our son loves using it. The only reason for the 4 star review is that for me it isn't quite tall enough, but to be fair I'm 6' 8". I would say anyone 6' 4" or shorter would be able to comfortably push this stroller. It's super easy to fold away and has a basic reclining feature which works well for longer uses. I would purchase it again for travel, but at my size I'll be using our full-sized stroller more often.
