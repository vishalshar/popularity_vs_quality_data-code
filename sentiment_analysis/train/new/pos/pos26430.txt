We got this stroller to replace our old umbrella stroller. We got an excellent sale price for it when we bought it (under $200), but normally it is priced over $300 (I think). It was very easy to assemble, It is also a very smooth ride, opens and closes very easily, and my son loves it! He loves to look at us through the window in the canopy. I wish that it had a cup holder inside for the child, or even better, a front bar console that can hold drinks/treats/toys and also serve to hold the child in so that you don't have to strap in a toddler. I also wish it had a cup holder/organizer on the handle for the pusher. I have ordered one, but I'm not sure if it will fit since the handle is not angled like many strollers. Anyway, I definitely recommend this stroller if you can get it for about $200. I would not buy it for more than $300.
