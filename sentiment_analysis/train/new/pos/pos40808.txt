This is such a fun idea and the makers of this cover have it figured out.  There are separate pockets for baby and whoever is pushing the cart!  I have the Evening Bloom print, which (as mentioned before) is more of a gray color than blue but is still pretty.  It can certainly be used for a boy or girl, very neutral.This is made from quality material, strong and soft.  It has a very simplistic idea, but it will take only a couple tries before knowing EXACTLY how to put in on the cart with immediate success.  Nothing complex or embarrassing.  It is a good size for average carts, and I think it would be big enough to fit on Sam's Club carts too.  There are loops to attach toys to the cover so you don't lose them.  The matching pillow also uses a loop to help keep it in place.I have only had this cover for about a month and used it a few times.  My baby girl is now 7 months, so she has VERY much enjoyed sitting up using this cover versus staying strapped in that uncomfortable and boring car seat.  She feels like she can see the world!  She loves shopping with me and has much more patience than she used to.  She now sees so much more and is excited to explore the stores.  Plus with the attached pillow she can lay down (while she's still small enough) or over and take a nap!This is exactly what I was looking for.  What a perfect cover!
