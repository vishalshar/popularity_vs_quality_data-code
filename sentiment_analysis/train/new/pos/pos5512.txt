Works as advertised. My kid was able to stick his hands in the drawer and grab cords out, but there's nothing you really do against that. I didn't like the fact that sometimes my baby would get his fingers in and he would close the drawer on his fingers, but again the point is to make sure they cant get into it completely and wreck havoc. We did have one latch break, but it was our fault because we forgot it was on and yanked it open. Overall I like it and its easy to install
