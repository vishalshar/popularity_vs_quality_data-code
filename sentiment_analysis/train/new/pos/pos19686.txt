I bought these for my 2 year old daughter's bedroom after much searching for the "perfect" curtains.  These are a nice mild pink (not a super hot-pink like many others) and the gentle gingham pattern is nice.  I bought this to work with the Circo Puppies & Kittens comforter set - this fits the bill and allows us to pursue a nice pastel palette for her room instead of adopting a full PINK! bedroom.  Only 4 stars as I wish they had a little more than the standard width to them... but otherwise are fine.
