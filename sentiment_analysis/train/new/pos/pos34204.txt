This changing table is solid wood--much heavier and higher quality than other offerings in its under $200 price class. I particularly like avoiding particle board, which can "off-gas" nasty things like formaldehyde. I highly recommend this table in spite of some negatives. It was relatively easy to assemble, as another reviewer described quite comparable to an IKEA product. The instructions were clear, and every piece was very clearly identified by letter. My husband lacks enthusiasm for all furniture assembly products, and totally relies on manufacturer directions. He was able to complete this changing table in slightly under 2 hours, with no unexpected headaches. The assembled product is a very sturdy, very solid piece of furniture, on par with much more expensive pieces, except for a few small negatives.Here are the small negatives:1) The silver screws are very visible from the sides. I have included a picture. You could minimize this look by painting the screws white, if it bothers you. I'm okay with it generally, but you would not see screws like this on a higher end changing table.2) The drawers come in and out without a hassle, but they do not slide as smoothly as they would on a higher end table.3) The basket openings are very large. You might not consider this to be a huge negative, especially if you want a basket large enough to fit several diapers, but it is hard to find something that takes advantage of the non-standard size and fits perfectly in the space. Each opening is roughly 16W x 16D x 11H.4) The assembly stickers are really stuck on and will take several attempts and tricks to remove. Annoying.Having said all this, overall I am happy with the changing table. Great value.
