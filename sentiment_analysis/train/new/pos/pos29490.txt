Cannot say enough good about these! This was actually the third time I purchased these bibs. First time I bought the girl set to try with my daughter. Loved them so much that I got rid of her other bibs & bought a second set-we were going through them like crazy. Messy munchkins... :) This set was for a friend's baby shower. Definitely something I'd give again & again. I LOVE that these are waterproof and can be run through the dryer. And that the waterproof layer is hidden nicely between two soft cloth layers. You can't tell the waterproof layer is there (doesn't make a sound) and stops liquids from sinking through to babe's clothing. Fit around the neck is just right, and they're cute colors that hold true after multiple washings & stain treatments. Worth every penny!!!
