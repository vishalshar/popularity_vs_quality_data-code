Seems like an ok toy but my son just doesn't care very much for it.  I also don't like how the inside rings are plastic.  If you are looking for a completely non-toxic, non plastic toy, you may not like this one.  But it's on the inside and a little one wouldn't be able to suck on the inside rings so not a big deal.
