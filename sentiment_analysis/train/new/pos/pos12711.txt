LOVE.  I use this to wash our bottle nipples, and it works wonderfully.In the past I had tried several different dishwasher baskets, but none would work for our bottle nipples.  I even tried baskets that had spots specifically designed for nipples on the top of the basket (ie the Oxo Tot dishwasher basket), but the nipples would never get clean enough for my liking--and that was probably due to me cramming the rest of the basket underneath full of sippy cups lids, bottle caps, straws, etc.I can easily fit 10 nipples in this basket, but can squeeze in up to 12 when necessary.This mini basket allows me to easily secure the bottle nipples and have them in direct contact with the dishwasher spray (without all the sippy cups lids etc underneath them, as with traditional dishwasher baskets).Overall, HIGHLY recommend.  Keep in mind that you will still need a larger basket for other cup and bottle parts, but this is a nice addition to the the arsenal for bottle nipples.  Works wonderfully for sippy cut valves too, and they won't disappear as sometimes happens in the larger baskets.
