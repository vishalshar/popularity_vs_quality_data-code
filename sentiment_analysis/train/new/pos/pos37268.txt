Good to note: once installed, you can't lift the toilet seat, so this has to work for the men in your house.Otherwise, it is great! So nice to just have it on the toilet and not have to pull something in/out all the time. Very easy install (5 min).It fits well on our toilet - not super snug, so sometimes needs to be jiggled, but no complaints.
