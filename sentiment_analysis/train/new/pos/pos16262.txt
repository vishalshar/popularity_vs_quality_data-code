I bought 10 of these handy caps and couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase! I have twins, so not only is this super convenient but it's very fast and easy to prepare bottles using powder formula for two little ones. I prefer using these over the munchkin powder formula dispensers any day. I find it much easier to use and I manage to get ALL of the powder into the bottle without having to shake the dispenser to death to make sure it all comes out properly.Yes, this cap does increase the height of the bottle (just keep that in mind when you're thinking diaper bag space) Although it seems as though the cap makers did not leave enough space for the nipple, it does fully close squishing the nipple inwards....BUT, I have never had a problem with ANY leaking. Other powder containers are smaller and usually come in a three storage container. When not in use (however, these almost never get a break) I just usually stack these up to four caps (any higher and it starts looking like a mini Tower of Pisa)I'm a prepper and with two babies I have to stay four steps ahead.  I keep my pre-measured formula in these caps up to 3 days (although it says you can safely keep it in there up to 5 days) on top of the Similac bottles. Whether I'm on the go, or not they're ready to use. Overall, I like these much better than the typical powder dispensers! These are a must and I love the convenience factor. I would definitely suggest these in a heartbeat!!!
