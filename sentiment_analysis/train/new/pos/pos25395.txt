Used these for my four month old who is cutting teeth a bit early. I bought two anklets- one for each leg - and keep them tucked in his little socks. After about 24 hours, his fussiness was gone and he seemed in much better spirits- even though I could still see the teeth coming through. I was a skeptic but now I'm sold.Product came quickly and correctly. Highly recommend.
