We were originally using the Nuk Orthodontic pacis but switched to the MAM when we went to the 6+ month pacis and the long bulb shape has made all the difference in helping my son keep his paci in all night. We have at least 20 MAM pacis now and this is the only MAM that stands out from the others because of the design. The nipple is highly textured which helps my 10 month old keep hold of the paci much better because he likes to feel the different textures with his tongue. My son is also constantly cutting teeth and having that texture is great for helping distract him from the teething and keep the paci and the drool from falling out. Many parents find that clear guards make the pacifiers much more difficult to find, especially in the dark- but my son loves these pacis more than the others and the wavy texture on the front is something my son really grabs for and he often runs his fingers over it and gazes at it in curiosity. Keep in mind that when you are buying pacis on Amazon that if you purchase any that are labeled "Colors May Vary" that 9 times out of 10 you will get pink pacifiers. The pacis we received are pink and purple, but I anticipate this when I buy on Amazon because of the many times I've purchased pacis on Amazon, there was only one instance where I did not get pink pacis. We are fine with this though as we cannot find the Diamond pacis anywhere else. If you have an older baby that uses MAM I would definitely give the Diamond MAM a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised!
