These cards were just darling.  They were a little more expensive than other thank you cards out there (and we've bought many), but were definitely worth it.  Even the little keepsake box they came in was cute, though I don't know what I'll do with a box that says "thank you" on it (would be better without it).  The only thing I didn't care for was that the cards were bound together with a ribbon in the middle, which made all the cards a little bent/curved in the middle part and they never straightened out entirely.  Still, I would purchase these again.  So cute!!!!
