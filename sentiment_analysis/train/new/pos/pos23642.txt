I really love this seat cover. It fit over my car seat perfectly and keeps my little man snug. A huge help because i dont have to worry about bulky coats or snow suits (colorado). I would have given it 5 starts except for the fact that there can be a small draft through the seat belt holes in the car seat but i doubt that can be prevented. In CO where the winters can be brutal i still tuck an extra blanket inside with him. Another negative is when the flap is down over his face it is right on top of his face. No real breathing room. I have to put the flap down right as we are walking out the door and put it right back up as soon as we get out of the cool weather sense it lays on his face. All in all for the price this is a great product.
