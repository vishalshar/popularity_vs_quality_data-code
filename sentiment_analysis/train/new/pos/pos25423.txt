I bought six of these (the girl and boy styles) for every day use for my toddler and I really like them. I would like them to be a bit bigger or at least longer to cover more of my daughter's belly but it wouldn't prevent me from purchasing these again (hence the 4 stars). I wash them once or twice a week (I go through about one or two every day) and they are still looking great (although a bit faded from all the washing). I would suggest these over the plastic ones that you wipe clean because this is so much easier - just toss in the wash.
