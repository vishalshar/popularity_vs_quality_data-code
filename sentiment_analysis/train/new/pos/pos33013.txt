I wanted to get a stool that looked less like a potty training stool and like something I could re-purpose once my son has finished with potty training.  I also wanted something that was nice enough that I could leave it in the dining room for him to climb into chairs and most "potty" stools are not really appropriate for the dining room.  This is an attractive little stool and very sturdy [at least when I (130lbs) or my husband (185lbs)] stands on it.  It has non-skid rubber floor protectors on the bottoms of the legs which I like because they don't slide on tile or hardwood floor.  Unfortunately, they are just glued on, so I'm not sure how long they'll stay on.  The stool measures 14.25"(W)x9"(D, at bottom of legs where there is a slight flare, which doesn't show up in the product picture) x 7.125"(H)
