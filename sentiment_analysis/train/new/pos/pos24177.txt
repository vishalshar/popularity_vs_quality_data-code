I am very happy with this carseat. It is a good quality car seat.Pros:Light weight- I have to take my daughter to the babysitter and leave her car seat. It is lightweight and easy to move.It fits well in small cars- my husband has a ford fiesta and this seat fits easily and he does not have to move his seat far forwardThere is good amount of padding in the head areaThe price is great- if you are looking for a good looking, comfortable, lower price car seat then this is a great choiceCons:It does not recline like some of the other convertible car seats when rear facing.The latch system is not very easy if you are taking it in and out of a car a lot, it has the hook latch not the easy press one like my infant seat had. I use the seatbelt option, that is easier for us.Overall I would recommend this carseat to a friend.
