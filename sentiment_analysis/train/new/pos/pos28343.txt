I got these inserts in the beginning of 2011. I don't know about the post below that said they are thin and different from the ones that come with the diaper...the ones I got are actually the same thing that came with the diaper...thick and great quality... my baby is a heavy wetter, so at night time she needs two inserts to last her 8 hours of sleep... I find them great! Super absorbent! :D so unless they changed since the beginning of the year, you can buy with confidence :) ... also any problems you can always talk with fuzzibunz, their customer service is great! :D
