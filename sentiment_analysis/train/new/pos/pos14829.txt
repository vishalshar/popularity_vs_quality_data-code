The best part about this thermometer is you can quickly get a temp check on your baby while they are sleeping. While digital thermometers like this one might not be exact, it sure as hell beats waking up a sick sleeping baby :) I was apprehensive about getting this thermometer due to some reviewers complaints about the thermometer not beng exact and giving slightly different readings each time. IMO the difference between a 101.8 and a 102.3 is still the same: THE CHILD HAS A FEVER. It's time for some Tylenol. That is all I need to know.
