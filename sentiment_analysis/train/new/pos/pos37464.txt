My daughter is 10 months old and LOVES mommy and daddy's books, however she also loves using her 7 teeth to chew them to bits and create a choking hazard.  Enter this adorable set of chew-friendly books to save the day.  Despite the set's title, the books do not make sound; I thought they may moo or make music when pressed, but this is not the case.  The cube that comes with the book set jingles a bit but that is it.The cube is a fabric-covered foam block that encases a jingle bell; since it is slightly muffled by the foam it's not annoying to adult ears.Each book covers a different sound: ma-ma, da-da, and ba-ba.  Inside each book shows things that start with that sound.The drawings are very cute and clear; it is a nice tool to start teaching different animals, concepts and relationships.The colors are awesome, very bright and stimulating; every page has a contrasting graphic and background color.I love Sassy toys, they are always so colorful and have held my DD's interest longer than her other toys.I highly recommend for the smallest bookworm in your life :)Only gripe: These books have only one center page each and I wish that they had 2 or 3 inside since my daughter loves turning book pages.
