Update:  3.5 years, two babies, and still going strong.  Upping rating to 5* given that.  It is pricey, but it is a one-time investment for the life of the crib (which is also still going strong, btw).This product is a bit pricey (probably due to the fact that it is the only option to fit the Athena Daphne crib I have), but it does its job.  Others commented that it was too thin / uncomfortable for baby, which concerned me before purchasing, but I think it provides enough cushioning.A tip on a cover:  go out and buy some cheap, standard pillow cases.  They fit this pad perfectly - no need to buy specialized covers.
