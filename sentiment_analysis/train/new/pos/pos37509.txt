I bought these replacement valves and membranes for my Medela Pump in Style. The suction on my pump wasn't working properly, and a friend suggested replacing the valves/membranes. I ordered these and hoped for the best! Replacing these parts made all the difference in the world - I thought the motor on my pump was dying, but it just needed to have the valves replaced. Now it works great!This package comes with 4 valves and 6 membranes, which gives me several extras! They work great - just as good as the original Medela parts! 5 stars for Maymom!
