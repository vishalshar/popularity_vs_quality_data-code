I'm seriously in love with this crib. Based on the price, the design, color, and the reviews, you really can't go wrong. When we were planning my daughter's nursery out last year, I was a bit skeptical about ordering a crib from Amazon -- even though I practically buy everything here. When we finally assembled the crib in August, I was extremely happy with my purchase.Some reviews complained of scratching. There were some minor marks on the crib, but they were very superficial. Others complained about the smell of the material. I didn't notice any weird smells?The crib was very easy for my husband to assemble, and it appears that it will be easy to transition the crib to other stages as she grows.
