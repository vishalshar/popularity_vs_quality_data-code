I absolultey LOVE this hat, I thought it would be really large on top of my daughters head but it really isnt that big, its bigger than the normal party hat. So hers will be the biggest. It is just so adorable and the strings to tie around her neck says "happy birthday princess" on it. I got the matching bib and the matching daiper cover for her birthday outfit (her birthday is in june). All together is amazing. I love this and it is highly recommended by me :)
