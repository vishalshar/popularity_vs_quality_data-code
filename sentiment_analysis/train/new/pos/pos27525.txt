We have a large opening that regular baby gates wouldn't fit.  I found this gate and my husband assured me that it would rip off the wall in a few short months.  4 years and 2 kids later we finally took it down ourselves!! I can't believe it lasted that long...I would have been happy if it just lasted through my first born's crawling months!  It even lasted through the kids swinging from it, hanging on it, driving their tricycles into it, etc.  Be sure to install it in a stud or using anchors.  My husband used super long screws....not the ones it came with originally.
