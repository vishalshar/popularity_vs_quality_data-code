I have to admit, when I first opened the box, I thought this would be too small for our needs. I'm surprised and pleased by the capacity, and it has yet to fall off our wall like other reviewers have mentioned. It's currently holding: 84pc foam letter/number set, the soup toy (Alex brand, minus the bowl), 1 normal sized rubber ducky, 3 mini rubber duckies, 3 squirter toys, 2 hot wheels, and a couple of small plastic cups with no issue.
