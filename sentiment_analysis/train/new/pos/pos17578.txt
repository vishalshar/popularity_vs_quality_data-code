We originally bought a wifi camera, but it didnt work that great. This was the second choice. I have had a couple problems with it. It geeks out once in a great while and points itself to the ceiling, but overall its a good camera. We have a 3 month old and a three year old and purchased an extra cam for the baby. Happy with this product.
