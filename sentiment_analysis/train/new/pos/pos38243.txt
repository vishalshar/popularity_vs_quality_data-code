We have owned the Cloud B Twilight Turtle for 2 1/2 years. We love that guy so very much, it has really helped with night time sleep issues and my child loves it. As soon as my son started sleeping in his own room we noticed he was showing some of the same issues with being unhappy when we laid him down in the dark room. So I gave him the turtle and problem solved, except that we needed to get another turtle so both kids would be happy. The Cloud B twilight friends are expensive, although they work great, I decided to give Summer Infant a chance. They were about half the price and included music, nature, and heart beat sounds which is just an added bonus. They are smaller and seem to look more like a stuffed animal compared to the Twilight Friends. I have used other Summer Infant products and haven't had to many complaints.So far its been a great addition to our home and I have no regrets. Now we haven't had the Slumber Buddy as long, so if anything changes I will come back and update this review. I have attached photos of the two side by side.
