If your child uses a pacifier to fall asleep, this will make your life easier. Our daughter is quite the head mover while sleeping. She is swaddled but whenever she would push a normal pacifier out of her mouth just a bit it would fall out. Then she would cry, we would wake up, go into her room and put the pacifier back in her mouth. Much less waking up is needed with the Wubbanub! It stays in her mouth as she moves her head allowing us to get more sleep as she stays asleep longer.The pink bear is very soft and easy to clean. It was accidentally driven over and after a quick clean was no worse for wear. The pacifier itself has maintained its shape despite constant use and she has no problems going from this pacifier to drinking from her bottles. We highly recommended it and have one in the car and her room!
