we bought this play yard sheet for our first trip with the baby. We planned on using the hotel's provided crib/pack n play to cut down on the amount of luggage we needed.We stayed at two different hotels, both of which brought out two very different looking cribs ... one was a standard looking pack n play that didnt have a mattress and only had the little floor insert (couldnt tell which brand. Had mesh sides like your typical pack n play). One was an old-school looking white crib and a mattress.This sheet fit both perfectly, and provided extra cushioning and was VERY VERY soft! For some reason, my daughter slept through the night all nights on our trip - something she never does at home. Is it the sheet?? Well, to my dismay i'll never find out because it doesnt look like (at least on AMazon) Eddie Bauer makes this sheet in normal crib dimensions. Darn!
