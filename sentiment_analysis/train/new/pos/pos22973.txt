Made In USA.  Automatically 3 stars!  1 more for toddler liking them.  1 more star b/c they're easy to clean and durable.  I would like to think I got them at just the right stage...our daughter is in full teething prime time, and clingy as heck, and trying to bite/chew/gnaw/gnarl/grind/etc whatever she puts in her mouth or can put in her mouth.  These spoons make feeding time a lot smoother and gives her something to massage her teeth with after every spoonful of food.  Or, it's great to just let her hold onto one and let her do her own thing.  I got two packages of two, just so it wouldn't seem like we're washing these every single hour, just so we can have a clean one during feeding time (you know what I mean).  Great product, I remember using these on my younger sister (I'm 10yrs her elder), and now, I'm using these great American products with my daughter!  Secretly, you'll question why don't they make adult sized spoons, and thicker soft-bite?!  Haha!  (If a company does, and they're USA made, let me know where I can find them, thanks!)
