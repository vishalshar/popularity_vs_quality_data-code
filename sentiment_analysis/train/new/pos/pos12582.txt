My wife and I researched quite a few high chairs before deciding on this chair. We have twins, so we bought two, just in different colors. We are both glad that we went with this model. Below are some Pros and Cons from our PoV:Pros:1) Sturdy and well built.2) Easy to adjust up and down with several heights to choose from.3) Tray is sturdy and easy to clean.4) Adjustable back is great for even smaller babies for feeding bottles while mom or dad clean, cook, etc.5) Can be folded to store out of site if desired.Cons:1) The tray can be difficult to get on/off for someone with strength problems in their hands. My mother-in-law cannot do it on her own.2) Really wish there was a break of some kind on the wheels. As babies begin to crawl and grasp to stand, the high chair can slide away from them.3) Straps are solid and well built, however can be hard to clean. There are small woven grooves in the straps that hold food toughly. They can be cleaned but it takes some elbow grease. Smoother straps would make this much easier.Overall we love these and would recommend them to anyone, but that is not to say there is not room for improvement.
