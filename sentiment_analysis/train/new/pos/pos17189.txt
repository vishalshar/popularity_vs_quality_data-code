I am very disappointed with my purchase. I bought it knowing my grandchild would enjoy learning the alphabet with these, but the "E" was missing! I left calls and emails to the company (Big Fly Sports - 201-653-4414) and received no response. It defeats the whole purpose of the toy if it is not complete. Most of the ducks were very cute, but the lettering on several of them was crude and hard to read. I did contact Amazon and was told to contact Big Fly Sports. Their information was hard for me to find, so I had to call Amazon again to get a phone number. All in all, not a good experience.Thank you for your time.Craol Gordon
