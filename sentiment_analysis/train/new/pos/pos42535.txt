This base has made taking the infant car seat in and out of the car very easy. Occasionally, the latch gets stuck and I have to wrestle with it to get the carseat out, but I think this has also coincided with my baby getting bigger and harder for me to lift with one hand while the other is unlatching the seat. Overall very convenient and user friendly.
