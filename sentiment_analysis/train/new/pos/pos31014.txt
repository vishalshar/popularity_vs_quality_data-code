My kiddo gives this two thumbs up. It's been his sleeping buddy since he turned 1 I think it was. It's the one toy I keep a spare for just in case something happens. And from the reviews it seems like it could get dirty enough that I'd want to try to machine wash it and if I did it would fall apart. So I may have to use the spare one day. He's just over 2 and I haven't wanted to machine wash it yet. Still going strong.
