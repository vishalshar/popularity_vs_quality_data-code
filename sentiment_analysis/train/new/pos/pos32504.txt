We have a Toyota Highlander and with it having large windows on second row - this shade works well.  It is super easy to install, sticks well to the window, and can be stretched to cover small to large areas.  We tried other "roll up" shades previously - they were useless compared to this.  I would have given it 5 stars if it would actually totally cover the window (could be a bit larger)- but was still a great purchase.
