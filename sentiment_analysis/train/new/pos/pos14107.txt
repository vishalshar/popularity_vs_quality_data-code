The clip was shipping very fast. When we received it, we immediately noticed that one of the beads was cracked. It hasn't grown worse, but we will probably break it off so our daughter doesn't choke on it when it does break.I wouldn't hesitate to order this, just make sure nothing is cracked when you get it. This seems like bad quality control of the manufacturer and it could be harmful to a child. We didn't bother exchanging it since we wanted to start using it now and we know to watch out for it or will break it off and tie the knot up a little higher.Don't let this prevent you from ordering it though! The clip is very strong and it seems like a solid product.
