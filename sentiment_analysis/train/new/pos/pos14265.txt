You've no doubt read all these other reviews and all are true.  This is the perfect little rocker glider for a small nursery like mine. It's perfect  for rocking even my 25 lb grandson to sleep. My 6'1 husband sits comfortably in it too. No problem nursing just wrap a Boppy around your waist.  If you saw the reviews about the uneven seating of the feet, unfortunately that is also true. The center plastic bolt is too thick making the rubber feet on the perimeter unable to reach the floor so the metal  base noisily rocked back and forth. I fixed this in 2 seconds flat by placing small round felt stick okn furniture pads to all the outer rubber feet. That elevated the swivel base higher than the center bolt. Now the ride is smooth and steady and whisper quiet. The size is perfect. The seat is cushy, the fabric is super soft and stain resistant so 5 stars for the little chair that could!!
