We bought this for a one year olds first birthday.  He had already been checking out dad's drum kit and we wanted something with a "real" drum head that would look, sound, and feel, something like dad's.  It doesn't sound much like a real drum but the baby doesn't care and really seems to enjoy playing it.  The head seems quite strong but because it is a tight plastic sheet I assume that something will eventually get poked through it.  Well worth the low purchase price.
