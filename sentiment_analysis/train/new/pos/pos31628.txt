I am a new mom of twins and needed a good pump since mine were both preemies.  I used the medela in the hospital which worked fine but it kept leaking all over which resulted in me losing a lot of my colostrum...plus the fact that I needed 2 hands all the time was bit difficult.  The lactation consultant at the hospital recommended that I rent the same hospital pump for a month while my babies began to breastfeed.  When I came home I decided to try this pump before going out and renting since I had already received it as a shower gift.  I love it!!!  The suction is great and it's much easier to use only 1 hand.  Now one of my babies is nursing while the other is starting.  I am able to pump so much (10 oz between both breasts in 5 minutes) that I need bigger containers!  I have not had any problems with the lids leaking unless I overfill the bottles (which I tend to do with such a great supply).I have recently encountered a minor problem with this pump but it was easily fixable.  I noticed that it was taking forever for my flow to start (not a problem in the past) on just 1 side.  I figured out that it was only happening with one dome and it wasn't my breast because it was random on one side or the other.  The little plastic removable piece on each dome was getting stuck open causing it to not seal properly.  I found that I needed to clean the pieces more thoroughly (not just the quick rinse with warm, soapy water that I was doing) and take off the bottom plastic flap disk.  I have also noticed that if I run a quick shot of water through the parts before using it, I have no problems!  That may be something to try if you are one of those who are having problems with suction!I am so glad to have this pump!
