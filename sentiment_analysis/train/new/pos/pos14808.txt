We used to get another brand at Target, but they stopped carrying the 24 pack and it is not worth the price for the 10 pack, which is larger sheets.  If you are in diapers, keep these in your diaper bags - if you have any leakage pees during changes, then these protect your diaper bag pad and you can toss them away with the dirty diaper.I also use these on top of our changing table, which helps protect the fabric on our changing pad for the messy diaper changes.  Another tip I found helpful for messy diaper changes - get 2 table pads and keep the second one under the changing table.  If you have a midnight messy change - you will have a fresh changing pad ready for the next change and you can do the laundry and change the cover when you are awake.We are finally out of diapers, but these sheets really helped keep the messes and cleanup easier for us.  I hope this review helps someone else get through the diaper years with a little less work/cleanup.
