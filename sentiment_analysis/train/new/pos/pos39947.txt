These were cheap, but worked pretty well. It leaked occasionally, but mostly from pressure and wicking through the middle of the fabric itself. The legs were good with the elastic, and fit and contained messes fairly well. A little cheap on the snaps, but for the price I paid, it was all worth it for what little cloth diapering I ended up doing.
