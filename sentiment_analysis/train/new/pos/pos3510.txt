Bought this for my son when he was 3 months old. This may have been a bit premature, but he's my first kid so I'm eager to play with him, plus it was just so darn cute. When we first got it for him it was too heavy for him to pick up, so we hung it from his car seat. He didn't seem too interested in it. I loved the dotted bottom, which is supposed to be a newborn attention grabber. I actually liked this one because it didn't have a bunch of toys dangling off of it(like the Lamaze Zebra we also bought for him), but rather had more of a textural stimulation. The feet and every other stripe crinkle. Half of the stripes are satin, the other half are a textured cloth. The quills are satin ribbon and felt. He is know 9 months and like most kids will play with anything that's not a toy before a toy that we actually spent money on(lol a pop bottle or an empty box beats an awesome toy anyday), but of all his actual toys this is one he tends to spend more time with-he loves making it crinkle.
