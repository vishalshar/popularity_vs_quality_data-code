These bibs are awesome. We originally bought them for a 15 hour flight so that I could wipe it off easily and not have dirty cloth bibs to keep up with while traveling. After returning I ordered 2 more and these are the only bibs we use. The cup part holds its shape well even after folded up for travel or storage and works great to catch most food dropped. They are super easy and fast to clean. We really love them!
