these nipples were great especially for the price. my husband was worried that the drip would be too slow for our then six month old baby however this was not the case. the flow in my opinion seems a little fast for younger babies, i would compare the flow to a standard flow nipple. we like that this nipple does not collapse like some other nipples do while my son is drinking milk. we love that we can reuse the collars with any standard nipple. we have tried various disposable nipples from both similac and enfamil and the texture of these is by far our favorite. these nipples come individually wrapped and are especially great on the go. we will definitely be buying these again.
