I have several other MH Safe-er products and have been happy with the suction. So, when needing a hook for the shower, I thought this might be a good option. I am happy to report that I was correct :)This is a sturdy soap dish, with small linear slots for drainage. Holds my man's natural round soap that's a little too big to fit in other dishes.It will also very nicely hold your razor (great for mid-shave, when you need to set your razor somewhere and lather up the other leg/armpit...) Check out these razors, they fit well and are good for the earth Recyclable Razor w/ 2 Triple Blade Cartridges 1 Count (and no animal testing!)And, I use the other side to hold my fiancee's washcloth (he lets it dry in the shower before tossing in the hamper).As with the other MH products, this must be mounted on a completely smooth & dry surface (no grout lines or textures). I "manually" push the suction cup in and THEN flip the grey switch. They always hold great for me.I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review has helped you :)
