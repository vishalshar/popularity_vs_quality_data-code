I bought two of these to place at each of the streets that 'T' in front of our home. The neighborhood kids are always starting a game out in the street and I wanted some CAUTION signs that would not blow over or fall flat like the bright green guy sign (the one holding the red flag). I am SO happy I bought these orange signs! The photo does not do it justice on just how BRIGHT and visible they really are! I put a flat basketball inside one of them and a small bucket inside the other to weight them down in the street. The handle on the top makes it easy for the kids to place them out when they are playing. I love that they flatten and if you have a hook on your ceiling or wall of your garage, you can simply hang them, OR you can twist and flatten them back in the box. I chose not to put them back in the small boxes they arrive in because I want the kids to be able to get to them and use them easily.  The cars driving down the street slow to move around these signs and that was exactly what they were for....to SLOW them down.  Thanks Amazon!
