I love this pregnancy calendar!  I had one for my previous pregnancy and knew I wanted it again to record all the important feelings and events of this pregnancy.  I couldn't find it in any of my local stores, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  It is fully able to be customized for me starting at the beginning of my pregnancy and even going 2 weeks after my due date.  I also love the stickers to note important milestones and feelings throughout!  It is great to look back and remember when certain things happened in my pregnancy.  I highly recommend it!
