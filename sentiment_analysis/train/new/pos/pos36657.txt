Do yourself a favor and purchase this item, it will be more helpful to you than any specific nursing pillow.As a first time mother who really struggled with breastfeed I spent a great deal of time in my glider rocking chair working on getting my LO to latch. I was using a kids stepping stool because without it I feet wouldnt touch the ground completely (I'm 5'6). The problem with that stool was it was a flat top and I found myself placing my feet at the edge to  at an angle which was not comfortable if barefoot. In hindsight it was  Also  to high. I made an appt with a lactation nurse because of cracked nipples and problems with latching and she had this or a similar stool. One of my first question was where can I get this? But she didn't know because she had bought it from a closing store in town. My feet rested so comfortably on the stool, at the perfect angle, which supported my posture and helped with my back.After continued struggles at home it dawned on me to Surch the Internet and ofcourse came to find it on Amozon!By the time I purchased it my LO was 2.5months. Feeling more comfortable with nursing I feed her in bed a lot using the laid back aproach (biological nursing?) but when I nurse in a chair/ couch I drag this little baby around because I just can't do without it.Registered or not I now plan on purchasing this for my friends who will be expecting their first baby. It's an item that most people don't know they need!
