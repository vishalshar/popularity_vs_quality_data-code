After initially getting a faulty clip, the sellers graciously offered to send a new one.  I am very pleased with the quick and friendly customer service.  I received the new clip and am very happy with it.  I especially like how the clip attaches to the pacifier with a snap, it's easier than most of the clips we've used in the past.  I have to say we use this one all the time and I would definitely recommend this to others and/or purchase again!
