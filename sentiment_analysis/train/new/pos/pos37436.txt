We recently bought a house and despite having been fairly well renovated before we moved in, there was one holdover from its birth in the 70s, a black plastic shower in the master bathroom.  This thing is hideous, but we aren't going to have the money to swap it out any time soon. Renovation may be out of the question, but safety isn't, and after a few near falls, I decided to order some safety tread. Yah, we're full grown adults with no kids but if you are stuck with an ugly black shower, who is going to fault you for a few monkeys on the floor?A lot of reviewers have complained about adhesion but we cleaned the surface as indicated and haven't noticed even a corner coming loose. It takes a little diligence but it pays off in monkeys.Would definitely order again were the need to arrise, but since I don't buy a lot of houses and most of human history has been too wise to install black showers, I probably won't have much need to do so.
