I bought this because I knew I was going to move and needed the portability. My baby and I love this. It's soft , not huge and best of all is portable! (Lightweight enough to go in a suitcase). Price wise is also a plus, since it can be used even as the baby grows to a toddler. I clean mine ever so often with very diluted clorox to keep fungi away. Very convenient.
