My son is very big for his age.  He is almost 18 pounds, and I love these so much I bought 3 of them.  Yes, 3 of them!  They are gigantic. I hate the little changing pads that they sell in the stores.  It's very hard to find pads that come in this size.  I do agree with the other reviewers that they do shrink a tad bit in the dryer and they do become a tad bit fuzzy, but who cares!  It's still durable and lasts a long time.  Buy one for your stroller, car, and diaper bag. I really love these!
