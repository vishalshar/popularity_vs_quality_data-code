I thought I'd write a review, since there wasn't one for these blankets. These blankets are really nice. After washing, they were larger than the Carter's blankets, so I imagine they didn't shrink as much although both are supposed to be 30x40. Cutest pattern (Love the Malawi!). Softness is great (of course not as soft as microfiber or fleece, but equivalent to the Carter's). They seem sturdy, and have a nice reinforced edging on all sides. They are greener than they appear in the picture, but this is of no concern to me. They are one sided patterned (like most), so you know.
