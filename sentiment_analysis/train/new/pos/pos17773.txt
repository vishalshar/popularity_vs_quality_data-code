I'm currently using these as cloth wipes and they are working out beautifully. I ordered two packs in different designs and I have certain ones I use for bath time and the others I use for wipes; they are great for both purposes. I wash them along with my cloth diapers which go through a hot prewash and hot regular wash then the dryer, and these have held up great so far. I also ordered a different brand of washcloths to try for cloth wipes but I prefer these, and they are less expensive than the actual cloth wipes out there which I think are too big and cumbersome anyway. These have a terry side that is good for cleaning up after a dirty diaper, and a softer side that is good for regular wiping. These are also a great size to use for baby's bath. You could also use these for face washing as the terry side would be good for gentle exfoliating; I have not done so but I think they would work well for that purpose also. Overall I am very pleased with this product and would definitely order again.
