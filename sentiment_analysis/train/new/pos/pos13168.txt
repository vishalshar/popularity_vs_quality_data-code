I have had this stroller for over 3 years now and I absolutely love it. I used it for my son, when he was a baby, and now for my 16 month old daughter. Its cute, and slightly different looking than your average strollers, but thats mainly why I love it. It still works just like new, and looks perfect too. I highly recommend it, if your on the lookout for a simple stroller.
