I learned about this gate from a professional baby proofer.  The most popular gates on the market are all heavier than this one, more difficult to operate, and more likely to be installed imperfectly and/or to pull out of the wall.  I know because we had those others, had all the problems I just mentioned, and finally replaced them all with this one.  We even replaced a perfectly good, functioning gate with this one, because this one was so much EASIER to use.  Even though it's called a stair gate, you could use this anywhere, and there's no bottom piece to step over when you walk through.  The description doesn't make it clear that this is one of the few gates out there that can be installed at a slight angle without affecting its latch or effectiveness in the least.  Go to Cardinal's website and see their video on the latch. It's not a great video, but there are no springs involved (so no spring parts to break), and simply requires a dextrous hand to press down on the two J-shaped latch pieces to open.  An older child, like 8 or up, can easily learn the trick, but it'll keep your 4-and under crowd (or 60 and over grandparent crowd) confused but secured. Once you experience the latch for yourself, you'll wonder why the other gates are so complicated and so hard to open.  The gate itself is very sturdy (though light weight).  It's so effective and so simple.  I can't rave enough about it.  AND it's the same price or cheaper than many other gates out there.  Do yourself a favor and don't debate this one.  Just get it.
