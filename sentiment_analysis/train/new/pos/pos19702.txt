I used these at both 4th of July fireworks (sitting outside all day) and at a music festival.  I clipped it to my bag at the fireworks and to my cross-body purse strap at the festival.  Everyone was totally high-fiving me and stuff because thought I was a genius or something for having a portable fan while they were sweating their asses off.  It was funny but I was totally getting a nice breeze.  It puts off an adequate breeze and won't hurt you if you touch it or run into someone.  Just two AA batteries lasted me for two entire days.The only complaints i have are that the battery compartment isn't totally secure (a little tape will help keep it closed) and that the fan head popped off in my bag at one point.This fan combined with one of those chamois towels that stays wet for hours and you will feel SUPER cooled even in 90+ degree heat and humidity.
