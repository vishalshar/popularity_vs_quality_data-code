I bought this cup for my 6 month old, who is just learning to drink water. He's able to hold this cup easily. Liquid doesn't get stuck in any grooves because it's completely round. It's easy to clean and doesn't spill easily. My only complaint is the cap is not integrated. It gets lost in my cabinet.
