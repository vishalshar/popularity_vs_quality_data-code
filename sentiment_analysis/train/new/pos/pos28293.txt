These swim diapers are great. They're obviously pretty cute (my shallow reason for choosing them), but they also do their job well. A little bit of padding in the crotch helps with absorption, good leg elastic and a PUL outer keeps messes well contained. My ONLY reservation about this diaper is the fact that it is a pull-on style. If my son does happen to make a mess of it, it is incredibly difficult to get the diaper off without that mess getting all over his legs, feet, and the towel he's laying on. If your kid doesn't poo in the pool, these are the swimmy diapers for you. If your kid does, then get a swim diapers with side tabs.
