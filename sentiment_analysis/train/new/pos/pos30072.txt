This is the easiest to use high chair I've seen.  No frills design, super sturdy and really intuitive!  Yes it has a large footprint but it makes up for it in the design.  I've owned the FP Rainforest high chair with my other son and this one has it beat!  I love how the entire seat reclines and tilts back, straps come out easily for cleaning and the tray holder is genius!!!Awesome, awesome, awesome!
