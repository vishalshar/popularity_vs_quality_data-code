I held off before using this and regret we didn't use it sooner! My 12 month old is very wiggly and this helps to restrain him from rolling over as he pleases. I didn't realize it would stay on so well but the elastic goes entire around at the top and bottom ends of the pad. Works great! Soft and nice color too!
