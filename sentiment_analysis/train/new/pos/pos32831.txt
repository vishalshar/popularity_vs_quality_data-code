I bought this to squeeze silicone into an ipod shuffle in an attempt to waterproof it.  It did the job pretty well.  This review won't help most people, but what I can say is that the syringe filled easily, and worked perfectly.  None of the silicone, despite it being "greasy" was left behind when the plunger passed down the syringe.  The measurements were easy to read and appeared to be accurate, but I wasnt too interested in that.
