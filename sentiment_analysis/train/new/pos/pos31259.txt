I was looking for a stroller that would keep baby comfortable, grow with us, and be easy to use. Our son has outgrown his infant car seat and I need something to drive him around in.  He loves his new ride!pros-  The one handed recline is not flat but just about.-It is heavy enough (22pounds) to hang purse, diaper bag on the handles and not have it tip when baby comes out.-You don't have to use the 5 pt harness, you can make it 3pt.-It rides smooth on roads; paved and dirt (within reason- definitely not for trails or sand) you can kind of feel the tred on smooth floors but the ride is still smooth.-Green color is attractive.-Handles, while not adjustable are comfortable (I'm 5'8"), the grip feels good.  This stroller handles great with one hand.-The tray is great for entertaining toddlers with cheerios and gold fish!  And if you really don't like the tray for whatever reason it is completely removable.negs- sun shade might as well not be there for when baby is sitting up but is nice for lying down as it has a tinted window.-cup holder does fall off but, snaps on pretty easily.-When seat is reclined basket can't be accessed but you can always move your purse to the handles.-5 pt harness might not work for all kids. while adjustable the arm straps might allow your baby the movement they desire.- we use 3 pt harness and it works great but our baby doesn't try to jump out.-hard to unfold while holding baby but if you put your foot just right on the release it is possible. and once you get the hang of it, it gets easier.-I like that it collapses so that it squeezes together but, it just fits in our Prius trunk on a diagonal and you have to put it in just right once its in other things fit too.
