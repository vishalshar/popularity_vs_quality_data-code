These are by far my favorite wearable baby blankets. The fabric feels really nice, even after several washings. The Halo Sleepsacks I used felt nice out of the packaging but after a few washings, they started to pill and feel a bit rough. These, on the other hand, felt softer after washing, like well-worn sheets.Some wearable blankets have a bell shape with fat bottoms. When my toddler was a baby, she didn't sleep well in those because the freedom of movement allowed her to get her legs tangled. These still allow for movement but are narrow in comparison which kept her from getting tangled and kept her feeling secure.My only very small complaint is that there isn't one suitable for walkers. We've reluctantly switched to the Halo Early Walkers Sleepsack so that my toddler can easily stand up and move around in her crib in the morning when she wakes up. If SwaddleDesigns made one of those, we'd switch back in a heartbeat.
