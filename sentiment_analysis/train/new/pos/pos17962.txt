This was a good solution for us, since baby didn't like being in the bassinet by herself. It was very easy to roll the baby out of the co sleeper for nighttime feedings, and roll her back into it when she was done and sleepy again. This made for a nice experience where mom lost less sleep than she would have otherwise done. It's a pain in the butt to set up the co sleeper to tether it to the bed, but once you do that, you are good to go for quite a while. The co sleeper is basically a mini pack and play with a fold down side. It fit our baby until she was about 6-7 months old. After that time, we needed to move her to a pack and play because the walls of the co sleeper were too short and she had the ability to pull herself up and possible tumble over the side of it.I would recommend this for the first several months if you plan to feed regularly at night (i.e. breastfeeding). It's convenient and it doesn't take up too much room.Cons: The white fabric can get stained with formula, milk, or baby's slobber.
