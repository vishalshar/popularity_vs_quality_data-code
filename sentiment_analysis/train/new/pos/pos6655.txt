My daughter was born in May, so traditional swaddle blankets are too warm for her. Also, she has fought every swaddle we had her in since birth, but she can't sleep without one, so I was on a mission to get something that works! We bought swaddle me, halo, swaddle buddy, nested bean, ergo, miracle blanket, and a few more brands that didn't work at all. Then this Swaddle Strap popped up on my screen and my prayers were answered. It's easy to use, easy to wash, cool enough for summer, safe in a swing or bouncy, and she can't break out of it! We have three of them now, and every mom I meet asks where I got them. I wish these were better advertised because it would have saved me so much money and trouble to start with this product.
