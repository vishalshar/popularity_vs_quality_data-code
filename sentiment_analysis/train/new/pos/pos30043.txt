Our baby had very sensitive skin early on. We tried various bath and body products. Some would be better than others at times and bother her or make her smell sour, at other times.I read reviews on this one when she was about 14 months old and decided to give it a try. She smells much better than the unscented or some other scented products and her skin is back to being so smooth. It is still dry in places from time-to-time but much better since using this product.I like this lotion. The baby's skin feels so silky. The smell is great, yet not overwhelming. And a strange thing that when you smell it from the bottle it smells like the cheapest Jonson's lotion. But once you put it on skin, the smell is light and pleasant.I have used it on my shaved legs as well and have to admit, bought some for myself too!We have probably been using it a little over 2 weeks. Before that we had Weleda Baby Calendula Body Lotion, 6.8 Ounce but it's pricier and I wanted something as good but for less money.Besides, the packaging is very presentable and can serve as a baby shower gift.+ Silky, nice smell, easily absorbent.- The pump would work better for the lotion
