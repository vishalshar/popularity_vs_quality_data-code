This is my first woven wrap so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I am pretty happy with it. It is more affordable than most of the other brands I looked at. I love that it is lightweight, since I live in a warm climate, but still holds my son securely. The colors are prettier in person- the stripes are three shades of green, but the weft is blue and gives the greens lovely jewel tones. I am still breaking mine in but it is getting nice and soft. I was afraid the fringe on the ends would get tangled and matted but it is still doing okay after a few washes. My only complaint is that it cannot be machine dried; I don't have a clothesline and this is a lot of fabric to deal with! Also it would be nice to get it washed and dried more quickly so I can use it again sooner. If you're wanting to try out babywearing and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a great and versatile choice.
