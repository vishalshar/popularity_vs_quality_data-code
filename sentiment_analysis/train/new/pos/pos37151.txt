We ordered this gate to keep the dogs confined to the kitchen during the day.  It spans a very wide, 53" doorway and is very sturdy. The tension is controlled separately with knobs on top and bottom. Some people in various reviews claimed if you have baseboards, you can't use this.  Not true since you can set the tension differently at the bottom.  Ours is mounted on the baseboard and we have had no issue.  Very tight hold even with two crazy terriers pushing on it.  This gate is very tall and there is no way our dogs or two cats can jump over it.  I'm knocking a star off of my review because this product claims to fit a 53" opening.  Technically, yes, but not properly.  The gate won't close since there is not enough tension. There will be a large gap if you attempt to cover a 53" opening.  This gate comes with a 7" extension and a 3.5" extension.  We had to order an extra 7" extension and replace the 3.5" with that one.  You can only use one extension on each side.  This worked perfectly with a 7" on each side.  Hope this helps....
