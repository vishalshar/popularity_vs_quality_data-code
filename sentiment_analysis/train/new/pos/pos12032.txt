I was gifted first year calendars for my first two children and loved the idea; it was so easy to fill in milestones or even just little thoughts for the day.  With #3, I probably won't get around to doing a baby book, but I did want another first year calendar.  I read a bunch of reviews and finally decided on this one.I love it!  It was a bit pricier than some others out there but it's a nice, big size so there's enough room to place stickers AND write comments in the date boxes.  I love how the first month - whatever month your baby is born - has a spot for a picture and all the important details.  Every other month has similar spots, and while I love the idea, the sizes are somewhat random so you may have to cut down your pictures or put something else in the box (my daughter's name is Adeline, so I'm considering typing up the words to "Sweet Adeline," an old babershop song from the early 1900s).  Either way, it's open to customization, which can be fun.  At the back, there's even a spot for "A Letter from Mommy and Daddy."Another plus - the pages are really sturdy, like thick cardstock.  And the month/milestone stickers are really cute.  Someone mentioned that they thought this was a unisex calendar, but I think with the pink on the front, flowers and what not, it's obviously for a girl - which is another reason why I chose it!While it's a neat option, I probably won't be tearing the pages out and putting them in a scrapbook - I'm going to save the calendar as-is!  In fact, that calendar comes in its own big pocket, so when it's completed I'll put it back in there and store it in my baby's keepsake bin.
