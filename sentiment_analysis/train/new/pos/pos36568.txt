I love these stickers!  My daughter is 28 months and I am beginning to potty train (will do the 3 day method in a couple of weeks).  I bought this to be an added reward to a small piece of candy each time she uses the potty.  She absolutely loves it.  You could definitely make something like this yourself, but I am not crafty and don't have the time or patience to make something like this, so it suits my needs.  My only negative would be that they have different levels-she can put a sticker every time she pulls her pants down on her own or sits on the potty, washes her hands, etc...she sits on the potty ALL the time!  So I am just going to use all the different lines for each time she actually goes while she's sitting on the potty.
