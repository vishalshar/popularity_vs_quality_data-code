My daughter really likes her car seat.  Good for short and medium length trips. We have not had a long trip with this seat yet.  Longest trip 1 hour.  Easy to recline while sleeping to make more comfortable.  Easy to adjust straps. She loves the arm rest.  The only problem (minor) is in my car the cup holder sticks out too far and falls down.
