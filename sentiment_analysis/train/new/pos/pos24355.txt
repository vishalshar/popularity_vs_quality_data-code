I would definitlely recommend this item.  It is just so convenient.  My 2.5 year old is really comfortable sitting on it in public - at the park, in the restroom at a restaurant, even in the car (when its stationary!).  It means that we can travel all over town or out on a hike and not have to worry about finding a public toilet, so she is able to stay dry, dignified and confident that if she needs to go quickly she can just ask and the potty is there for her.  We even lent it to another child who was caught short at the park!  It is just so light, easy to keep clean, and fits easily into my little backpack which I keep all my daughter's 'travelling' things in.  It is very easy to carry around. The only reason I gave this potty 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is fractionally unstable, so I have to make sure I hold my daughter whilst sitting on it.  But really the pluses way out weigh this one con.  The other reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is that the refill bags get a little pricey after a while, but again, it is a price worth paying for such a convenient and genius product.
