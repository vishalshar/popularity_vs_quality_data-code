I bought this blanket for my granddaughter . My daughter love it ,she is crazy about it. The only think i would like to mentionned is about the color . The inside is not white as on the picture ,it is rather beige . If you are expecting to have it white inside, you will be disapointed. But it is nice too with beige inside . Otherwise. I would give a 5 stars.
