Great product, but not your cosleeper!We bought this originally to use as a cosleeper. Although we have a CAL king bed, this is way too huge for that. It would literally take up half the bed. Because of this, we nearly returned it, but having it around, we realized we needed something exactly like this. I lay her on this rather than on her prickly carpet to change her clothes. I lay her on this rather than on the cold bathroom floor when we get in and out of the bath. I bring this along when a trip to a friend's house will run in to nap time. We bring it on vacation for diaper changes and sleeping. I have come to prefer using this on the floor, over using her changing table as she has gotten older and rolls around a lot more and I am afraid of her falling.  Since she has gotten older and rolls around in her sleep a lot, I feel much safer with her napping on this when we are at a friends house then on their floor where she could hit her head on the furniture.  We have also begun dragging her around the house in it shouting Toot toot! Here comes the Baby train! while she giggles her head off!On the cosleeper thing – – I will mention that a hotel we stayed at had a large desk next to the bed that was just the same height as the bed and big enough for this monster. We put it on that with the open side toward our bed and it worked great as a co-sleeper! By pushing the large desk chair in, we felt relatively secure it would not fall off. So if you have something like that at home, this could work for you. But if we were doing that every day rather than just once, I would definitely put in the time to permanently secure the back so there is no way for it to fall off.
