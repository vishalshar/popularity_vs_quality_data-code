After your 20 covers you can use this with just about any covers as long as they are similar.  You don't have to have their brand.....and you probably couldn't find their brand.  After using other brands... realize that you can use this thermometer WITHOUT probe covers. Yes you can.  Just be sure to clean the tip with alcohol.Bought this as a gift for my daughter, who has twin girls! She doesn't have time to use other thermometers. This one is FAST. Works great with the small kids.Works great on the big kids and adults.  I've used the thermometer a couple of times on myself while I was over there babysitting the twins.I do recommend this product.
