I am a second time mom, new to cloth diapering and these are amazing! I purchased a few brands in addition to these including: bumgenius freetime AIO, bumkinz AIO and alva pocket but these are my FAVORITE! They are most importantly easy to use, have not had any leaks, offer a great fit and the price is spot on for what you get. Moving from disposables to these has been SO much easier than I ever imagined and I am just in love with cloth diapering now.I've seen many people complain about the dry time and yes it is long. However this hasn't had much of an affect on our routine since I wash diapers before bed, so I toss them in my dryer on med. for 40 minutes getting them dry most of the way then flip them inside out and hang them to air dry overnight so come morning all my diapers are ready.I have the snap and velcro versions in my "stash" and I Iove both equally. My only wish was that the snaps came in colors other than white that would match better with the fabric on the diaper. I asked Thirsties about this and received a super speedy response that they only have white snaps made in the USA at this time which is why all snaps are white. Can't blame them and thought I would mention in case anyone else was wondering.
