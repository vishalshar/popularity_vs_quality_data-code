I have had this carrier for almost a year now. It is much easier to use than other styles and my baby loves to be in it. Without it grocery shopping with a baby and a toddler would have been so much more of a challenge. It has faded a little with frequent washing but otherwise  has held up very well. Just wish I had bought on with my last baby.
