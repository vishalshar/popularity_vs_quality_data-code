I hung this right in from of my daughter's window when she was two months old. She started smiling at it when she was 3 months old, and now at four months old she is simply fascinated by it!I do agree with another person on how the material is just wrapped around the wire & then hot glued into place which makes it look kinda cheapy. But when you look at it from below it, you can't even tell it's like that.One thing that I didn't like about it was that it was just far too long. We have standard ceiling heights & it hung to about the middle of the wall height (about 4.5' off the floor). It was so low that I was constantly running into it. To solve that, I simply wound the main strings around the wire hangers (the same number of winds for each of the strings), and shortened it considerably. I am 5'8" and am now able to walk under it, though my husband is 6'6" and he runs into it all of the time.
