I found the American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Pad very useful when placed under the baby while changing his pamper.  Invariably he goes to the bathroom while being changed and this product is very good at protecting the mattress from getting wet or soiled. One side of the pad is plastic and the other side is quilted cotton.  The cotton side is absorbent and the plastic side serves as a second layer of protection - together they contain the mess and protect the mattress below.  After being used you can wash and dry the pads in a standard washing machine and dryer.  No special care is necessary.  I would recommend this product to parents of infants.
