I do have the medela automatic double pump but I purchased the manual breast pump for multiple reasons. 1. Great for travel either road trips, longer day outing or airport. It fits easily in a diaper bag. 2. When I want to pump in bed and my husband is sleeping the manual pump is very quiet. 3. When I have blocked milk duct I use the manual to pump in the shower.Pros:-quiet and does not need a plug therefore you can pump anywhere-small-easier than you think and oddly quicker than the automatic-all parts fit with the automatic pump accessories, medela bottles and lifefactory bottlesCons:-you are still pumping by hand although easier than you would think, your hand can get tired-the handle can turn 360 which is actually pretty annoying because it can cause you to slip-there is a plastic piece in the neck part which connects to the handle which I do not like. See attached photo. I like being able to see through all parts and having access to clean everything this piece does not allow that. Therefore I will not use it after 10 hrs (recommended shelflife of non refrigerated milk) without boiling it even with rinsing.If you are exclusively pumping there is a definite use of both the automatic and manual pumps. Overall I am happy and would recommend it.
