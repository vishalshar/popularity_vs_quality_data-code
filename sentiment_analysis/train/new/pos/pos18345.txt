My daughter turned three in August, a month after I had our second child. Since I had been carrying him in a Baby Bjorn, she wanted something to carry her dolls in. I found the Ergo and thought it would be perfect for her. It is almost perfect, but there are a couple things I wish I knew before buying it.1. It is a little big on my daughter. She is average size for a three year old, but it is a little long on her torso.2. She cannot put it on by herself. It requires help from me, which I don't mind, but my independent daughter doesn't like.I think this product would be perfect for a 4/5+ year old, but is a little difficult for my 3 year old.
