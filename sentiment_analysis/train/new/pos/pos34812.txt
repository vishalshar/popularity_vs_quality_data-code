The Good:Blocks are made of high quality dense foam.  The blocks can be stacked very high and don't give out under their own weight.  When they do fall over they fall over NO SOUND!!  I was originally concerned that 30 blocks was not going to be enough for enjoyable play, but I found that it was an excellent amount.  My boys play with them more than I thought they would.  The curved pieces can add a bit of a challenge for younger children and keep it interesting and creative.  I'm very happy with this purchase for the amount I paid.The Bad:The only thing that I can say is that our dog also enjoyed the blocks as chew toys and we now need to reorder.Overall:High-quality stacking toy that is easy on the wallet and ears.
