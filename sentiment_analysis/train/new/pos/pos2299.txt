I have seen this bedding, and other bedding similar to this, going for around 250.00 $. Let me tell you, it is NOT worth more than 100$. Mainly because the fabric isn't high quality; however, the pink fabric is very soft and very nice. I still love this bedding because there aren't any other Asian theme nursery bedding out there (as of when I wrote this review)! Also, wash it with EXTREME care, otherwise dry clean.
