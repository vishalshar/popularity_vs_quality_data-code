These magnetic locks are one of the best kid proofing purchase I have ever made.  We have used them for years in two different houses and feel that the cost is worth the child safety we have been afforded.Pros1.) They stay locked2.) They avoid screws in the cabinets3.) They are easy to open with the key4.) They can be used on furniture in many casesCons1.) We have had a few casualties when adults have been unaware of the locks and pulled too hard.  Refitting the locks when one of the pieces is pulled off requires using screws or finding another alternative for the double sided very effective tape that is provided (as no extra tape is provided and I have been unable to find a place to purchase a similar product on it's own).2.) They do require patience with installation as lining up the pieces can be a challenge depending on the set up of the cabinets.Advice1.) Get extra keys, they always seem to go missing2.) Do not place the lock too close to a screw or hinge inside the cabinet or the magnetism is thrown off and the lock may not work correctly.3.) If anyone finds comparable double sided sticky tape to reattach the locks when broken off, let me know as it would be very helpful.Overall a great purchase.  I have purchased many times and will continue to until we no longer have little ones in the house.
