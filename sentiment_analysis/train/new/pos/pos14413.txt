My four month-old loves this caterpillar! The combination of different fabrics and wood makes it a tactile delight. It must also be pretty tasty! I love that is mostly made of natural materials. The head squeaks and the "tail" make crinkly plastic bag noises when touched. All parts are securely attatched. To clean I wash it in the sink with a little dishsoap and warm water. I rinse it well and hang it over a chair to dry overnight. We own several other toys in this collection and I really like them all and my son is starting to know that he can explore more!
