I was a little nervous about purchasing this dresser from the other reviews but I am glad I went with it. I bought Stork Craft furniture for my first child 2 years ago and I was looking for a dresser to match the crib and glider we are reusing for the new baby. We had ZERO problems putting it together and none of the pieces were scratched or damaged in any way at all. We were able to put it together in about 1.5 hours. The assembly was exactly the same as the other dressers we have (a Stork Craft Beatrice 5 drawer dresser, 3 drawer dresser, and the combo tower with hutch). Maybe since we knew what we were doing from assembling other Stork Craft products it helped us finish faster, but I don't understand what trouble others were having. It is definitely not rocket science. If you are looking for an inexpensive dresser and you can build other furniture from a box (think Ikea), then you shouldn't have any problems at all.
