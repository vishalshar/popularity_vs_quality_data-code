The product works as advertised. The 'standard' size (126-140mm) is NOT QUITE LONG ENOUGH for today's 8-ring hubs, which is the most common hub for hybrid and street bikes, these days (24-speed). I got mine to work, but there is less than 1/4-inch of thread at the right end for screwing on the special bolt and being able to tighten the quick-release lever all the way. It would have been safer and more secure to have purchased the next longer size. So far, so good, however.
