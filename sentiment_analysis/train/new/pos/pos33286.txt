Based on the 5 star reviews I ordered these bibs in all 4 colors to give 2 to my local hairdresser (who was flying out to see her pregnant daughter) and 2 to my favorite downtown Vegas waiter who would be doing the same with his daughter.  These bibs seem unbreakable, lightweight, and took up very little room in a suitcase.  Not knowing the daughters or what their "baby themes" were, I liked the fact that these bibs were colorful, cute and generic and gender neutral.  I also liked the adjustable neck, crumb catcher, and the fact these could be wiped or rinsed off instead of having to be put into the wash.I was very pleased with this purchase and the bibs seem to be good quality and a very practical gift.  (So many people seem to focus on newborn gifts, and 6 months later when something like this is needed and appreciated the parents are on their own)  My toughest decision was deciding what color bibs to give to which person.
