This battery is a bit larger and heavier than the 3800 mAh one I bought a few months ago, but fortunately it still fit into the water-proof dry-box I am using for a home-built underwater dive/video floodlight.The battery looks and works very much like the other "black brick" type batteries such as this... It has a standard 12v co-axial power connector jack (comes with a cable) and power switch, which must be in the ON position to charge.Inside are three Li-ion battery cells which are wired in series. Each cell has a small PC board attached, which limits current flow and protects the cell from extreme conditions. The battery will cut off current when the voltage drops below a preset level (which protects the battery), and also when the leads are short-circuited or an extreme load is connected. The short-circuit protection cut-off can be reset if tripped, by turning the power switch off and then back on again.In its first use for testing, the freshly charged battery pack provided 12v (more or less) at 1.5 amps for 2.5 hours (powering an LED light array) before it automatically shut down, resulting in about 3850 milliamp hours (3.8 Ah) of usable capacity. If new Li-ion batteries need some exercise before reaching full usable capacity, then this pack may return better results in future tests.
