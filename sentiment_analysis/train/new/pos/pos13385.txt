I love this camera. It does everything I need it to do. Let me start by saying I've had one for 6 years and a second for 3 yrs. It is perfect for watching the kids/babies. Because it is a 2 way monitor I can speak to my kids which is a BIG deal for me. When they are scared or want to wake up too early I can talk through the camera to calm them or let them know it's too early. My kids will stay in their rooms for a good while as long as you don't disturb them, so with this feature If I see one of my kids getting into trouble like maybe jumping on the bed I can just let them know this is not allowed without actually coming into the room because as I'm sure most mothers know the moment they see you they want to cling to you. Also for when they were smaller the luluby feature is handy and I can check the temperature in their room. Also has a nightlight feature. The main complaint I've read from other reviews is the signal or connection. This is very simple fix... when you loose the signal there is a button to search for the camera signal I press it and it is always resolved. It beeps because well if you were to loose the signal at night you won't wake up to fix it.  Also if you keep losing the signal I have found that moving the monitor away from other electronics will help.when I purchased it was about $80 or $90  give or take but I really love it. Oh and it also has a clip which is great for when you are in the yard you can clip it on your clothes. After 6 years of abuse it's still in great shape I can't complain. I've seen others with the real modern expensive cameras and they barely get any use out of them. In fact they stop using them altogether after the first yr. Because without the 2 way feature it becomes useless when the baby is older.
