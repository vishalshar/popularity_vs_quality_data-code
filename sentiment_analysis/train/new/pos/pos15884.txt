Valances really small but would be good for a nursery w/ only one window. Set gets REALLY wrinkly after washing but good set. Pillow pointless and gets all out of shape after washing but a good toy for my older daughter for her babydolls. I would recommend though for the money. Also comforter is not so big that it can't be used in the crib as some quilts are due to suffocation risk.
