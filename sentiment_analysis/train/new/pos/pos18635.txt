We started tummy-time late with our son. He would SCREAM for the entire time that we would lay him on his tummy. He quickly learned how to roll over (since we did start kinda late) and wouldn't stay on his tummy. This mat was WONDERFUL! Because of the pillow it has, he was unable to roll-over when on his tummy. AND he remained on the mat for about ten to fifteen minutes before he would start crying to get off his tummy.This mat helped us out so much. It has little rings that you can add toys your child likes to it so they have their own favorites to keep them occupied. We have another son on the way and we will use this for him, as well. Would recommend this to anyone who has a child who has problems staying on his/her tummy.
