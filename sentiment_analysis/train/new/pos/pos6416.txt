I absolutely love these blankets. They are incredibly soft, and very large. The uses for them are practically limitless: nursing cover, swaddling, a light-weight cover for an infant car seat to protect your baby from the sun, burp cloth... The list could go on and on. My older daughters are constantly trying to steal these away for themselves because they love the feel of the muslin fabric on their skin.
