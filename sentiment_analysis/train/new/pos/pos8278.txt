I have two boys, ages 2 and 5. They both enjoy playing w/this toy but in different ways. The 5 yr old makes patterns with it and uses it for imaginative play in various ways. (only when I am playing with them with the 2 yr old... I wouldn't recommend purchasing for a 4 or 5 yr old but just pointing out that they can continue to enjoy them over time). My younger son was not able to snap them together when we first got him (before age 2) but shortly after turning 2 was able to put them together although I have not seen him pull them apart yet. I like to use them for teaching colors... (give me a red one...) as well as talking about the different textures of them and how they feel. To some extent you can also talk about shapes (triangle shaped one vs round vs barrel) as well. He likes to make a very long chain and is so proud of his work when completed. Once i tear them apart, he likes to "clean up" by putting them back into the plastic carry bag (nicely made and sturdy) and zip it shut. Good for hand/eye coordination/dexterity. Highly recommend them... would be a great gift for a child turning two.
