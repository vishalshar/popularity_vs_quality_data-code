My son, who is exclusively breastfed, has been using these pacifiers since he was 1 month old (he's 3 months now) and he took right to them. But whether or not your baby will like these pacifiers is a completely individual thing, so I'm going to focus on why I like them.The cap that comes on each pacifier is brilliant and so convenient that it amazes me pacifiers without caps even exist anymore. I can pop the cap on and throw the pacifier in my purse or pocket without worrying about it getting dirty, and then whip it out again to use when necessary.These pacifiers are very attractive with the clear plastic and subtle design on a nice color for the main part. I always hated the way babies look with a pacifier in their mouth -- with a big ugly hunk of plastic in the middle of their face -- but these don't bother me at all. They're almost nice enough to pass as a chic (and very functional) baby accessory.
