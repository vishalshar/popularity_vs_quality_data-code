Aside from the great reviews I read, one of the reasons I chose this diaper was because I thought the chocolate color on the outside and yellowish color on the inside was adorable and I really like it. However, when I got it in the mail, it was just a plain white on the inside; kind of a disappointment. But as far as the functionality of the diaper, it's great. We haven't had any leaks and it fits perfectly. I also love the how you don't have to take the insert out since it comes out during the wash cycle. I do love the diaper, I just wish the color was right!
