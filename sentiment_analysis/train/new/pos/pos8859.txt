with it being so hard to find family tables that fit "booster seat high chairs" this was perfect.  We have it on the lowest setting because the way the table is built, booster/transition high chairs dont fit because the arms that hold the tray are too high.PERFECT for us enough to buy a second and they are great to travel with!
