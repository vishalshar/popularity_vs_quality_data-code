This is a great product. I was expecting a smaller charm but the size is not overwhelming. It also hangs at a nice length in the middle of the breasts and I have 40DD. I've got to say that I am not a fan of the black nylon rope, but that is an easy fix with a trip up to Michaels. I'm not a big fan of the style of fabric of the nylon rope either. I would think that it could easily harbor bacteria after the baby has been chewing on it for a bit or if it doesn't get the chance to completely air out after washings so I do plan on replacing the rope a few times but that is just a personal preference. I bought this for the pendant anyway and I'm not disappointed. It looks like the pendant is about 2-2.5 in diameter (I'm including the measurements bc I'm not sure what is listed in the description) My son LOVES the shiny pearly pendant, he will sit in my lap before bed and lay his head on my chest and just hold it and look at it. During the day when he sees me wearing it, he will spit out his binky and come to me lol! It seems to be the only way I get to hold my baby anymore.
