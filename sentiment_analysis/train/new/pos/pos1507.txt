when i read the reviews about this potty i did my best not to buy it but i didn't find all what i was looking for exept in this potty.I have 2 very active girls so i needed very attractive potty, has a cover, easy to clean & i liked the idea that it looked like a real toilet which turned to be a great idea because the moment i assembeld the 1st potty they opened the cover & raced to sit on it.I found it's never too much fun for my girls because at the begingin even with all the fun features they didn't want to sit for enough time but after this they started to enjoy them.Also i found we can switch it off so it's never realy noisy,it has light so you can see when your kids realy go & it's extremely easy to clean.The only negative thing about it is the messeges operated by the sensor because in nearly 2 months & with 2 potties for 2 girls NOT ONCE it said the right thing in the right time.In my opinion this can be solved easly if the messeges change to less specific meaning.
