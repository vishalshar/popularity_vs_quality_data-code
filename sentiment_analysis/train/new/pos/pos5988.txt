These washcloths are the best.  I didn't order them because I have a baby.  I ordered them because I am an adult with very sensitive skin due to an autoimmune disorder.  I wash my face with these washcloths nightly and my skin has never looked better.  I would encourage you to consider these for uses other than sweet baby skin.  You will not be disappointed.
