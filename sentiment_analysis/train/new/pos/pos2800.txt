My 4-year old, who is small for his age, could not sit on the potty and go both #1 and #2 without making a mess. To get his little bottom in the right place meant there was pee all over the potty and/or floor.  (I can't imagine I'm the only one with this issue....right?) I did a little research and found that this potty chair was supposed to have a larger bowl. I hesitated at spending thirty bucks on a potty chair, but since the Amazon ad specifically offered a free return, I decided to try it. I'm so glad I did.....the combination of the larger bowl and generous guard in front means no more messes.My *only* complaint is that I wish it came with a lid for travel and/or to use as a stool.
