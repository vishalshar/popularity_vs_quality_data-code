The Kidco Adhesive Mount Magnet Lock keeps from having to drill holes in your cabinets. My husband who is not at all handy was able to install them fairly quickly. The first one is the hardest to figure out how to do it but after that you can quickly install the rest. As grandparents we like that we can flip a switch on the lock and then the magnet is blocked so we don't need the key when she is not here. Just the day she is coming to visit I quickly go to each lock and switch it back to locking magnetically. Highly recommend.
