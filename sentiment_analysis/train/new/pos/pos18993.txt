I know everyone knocks a banana slicer and how "ridiculous" it is and why would anyone possibly want one when you could simply cut up your banana with a knife?  Well I thought the same thing until I started dehydrating.  I was sick of paying outrageous prices for dehydrated fruit when it didn't even taste good.  So, I purchased a dehydrator and started making my own.  Although I love banana chips, it's incredibly annoying to cut up 6 Costco size bunches of banana's 1-2 times a week.  I bought this after seeing it on Amazon and have not been disappointed.  Easy to use, and I cut my prep time down to less than half of what it used to be.  Plus my slices are uniform and all the same size.
