I bought this for my 4 year old son.  He loves it!  It hasn't leaked for us yet, but I can tell that the straw needs to be in all the way for it not to leak.  I also noticed that the straw seems to touch the bottom and be held in place when it is screwed on, so I don't think that will be a problem.  The straw is not spill proof when the cap is open.  This is not a problem for us since he is 4 and can handle closing it when he is done and not throwing it or leaving it on its side when it is open.  It is great for preschool aged kids or older, but I think you will be disappointed if you are looking for something for a baby or young toddler that will be spill proof 100% of the time or can withstand being hurled at the ground repeatedly.  We haven't dropped it yet, but with a hinged lid, it is common sense that dropping it while open could cause the hinge to get damaged.  Overall, I think this is a good purchase for us.  I love that it does not look baby-ish and is not plastered with trademarked characters.  It keeps liquids cold and does well not to leak in the lunch box.  It is no more complicated to assemble or clean than any other sippy cup or leak proof waterbottle we have owned and seems to be well made and of good quality.
