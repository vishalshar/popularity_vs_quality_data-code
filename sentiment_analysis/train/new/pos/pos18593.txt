I recently gave this to my sister who is expecting their 1st born, a baby girl. Having had some baby bags before (we have 3 kids), I trusted my instinct and got this one. I haven't seen this item personally before purchase and relied mostly from the reviews here in Amazon. The bag is definitely stylish and of the right size. It has a zipper to close the major compartment which definitely is a relief from other totes. The side pocket is also zippered. The two small outside pockets can hold an Avent bottle each. Nice thing about this is that it has a diaper mat, wipe case and a seperate pouch that you can put small things in it. Like what other reviewers said, not many pockets inside to organize stuff if you really want to be anal about it :P. I also got this for the brown color of the bottom part of the bag so it's not as dirt prone. Bag is still fairly new so I don't have any idea on how long can this last. Feels and looks sturdy though. This bag is just right and for the cost, an alternative option to a Skiphop baby bag.
