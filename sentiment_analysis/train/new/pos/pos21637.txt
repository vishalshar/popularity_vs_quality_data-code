I have never written a review before but am grateful to everyone who has in the past and I can't let this one slide.This highchair is perfect!  I love how easy it is to clean.  We've been through a few highchairs over the years with our children and this is by far the best one.  Finally a company catches on.  Besides being super easy to clean (no more stained straps or having to disassemble the entire chair to get it clean), it was easy to assemble (15-20 minutes, with little ones trying to help), and love the design.  I love how the part of the tray comes off for cleaning, leaving another tray for baby, yet still stays attached and doesn't go flying off when baby grabs it.  I also love how the tray actually goes in toward baby's chest instead of leaving a huge hole for food to fall into baby's lap.So glad we spent the little extra money for this highchair.  It will be well used for quite a while.
