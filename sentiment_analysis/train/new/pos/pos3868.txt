I love my bugaboo stroller and this umbrella is as flexible and easy to use as the stroller itself. It attached very easily to my bugaboo cameleon (took under 5 minutes to unpack, read the instructions and attach). It has a grooved swivel as the base so that the umbrella can rotate 360 degrees, and also has a spring along the handle for more minor position adjustments. You can also adjust the height by fixing the umbrella anywhere along the stroller handle frame. When not in use, you can fold the umbrella and position it facing downwards and along the stroller frame such that it is completely unobtrusive. It is sturdy and has a nice lining and keeps my baby cool and protected from the sun. The orange color matches my stroller perfectly.My only issue with the umbrella is that it is a bit too large and almost completely blocks my view of my son (I use my chameleon back-facing) when it is open.
