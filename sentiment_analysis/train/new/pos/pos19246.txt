we bought this for my 2 1/2 year old for our daybed that we put into his room so the new baby could have the crib and the first side rail was terrible it was from another company and slid under the bed what a piece of nothing.  So i returned it for this and oh my goodness it was like a dream.  being 8 months pregnant i needed something easy, and quiet.  I am going to definately buy another for my daughter when we transition her in to a big bed.  I highly recomend this rail and my husband set it up in 15 min.
