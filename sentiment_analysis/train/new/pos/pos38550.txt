My wife and I bought these pillows because we have a little one who likes to play on our bed and occasionally sleep there and I wasn't thrilled with the cheap foam pillows we had. We try to buy organic whenever we can, so I was delighted to find these. These are adult-sized pillows, by the way, although many stores seem to list them under "baby" items online, probably because most Naturepedic items are geared for babies/toddlers.The long and short of it is that we love them after having them for four months. They are quite firm, and while I usually prefer a softer pillow, I got used to them very quickly and actually think I sleep better because of them (less neck pain/stiffness). Be aware that the organic cotton fill (Naturepedic also makes one filled with something else that is washable--the organic cotton fill is not) has a noticeable but "natural" smell--my wife likens it to line-dried laundry on a summer day; it's not unpleasant, but it's there when you first get them. After four months, though, the smell has pretty much dissipated. Incidentally, not sure how Amazon fills these orders, but our pillows shipped right from the factory--seems they were made to order (the "production" date stamped on the attached tag was three days after we ordered).I really don't think there's anything I dislike about them--very pleased with this purchase and recommend them highly. We bought a Naturepedic crib mattress before this, and based on these two purchases will be buying a Naturepedic toddler bed mattress soon.
