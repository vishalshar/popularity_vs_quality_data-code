I looked and looked for a wetting doll as we planned to used the potty training in one day method.  The cheaper ones all seem to be babies. I took a deep breath and forked over the cash and bought Patty. She worked. I don't have any complaints. We used her for about 20 minutes and don't plan on taking her out again until our 2nd daughter is ready to be trained. She will not be a toy. Potty Training in One Day worked. It is pretty intense but I am glad we did it and bought the appropriate doll. No poopy toddler diapers is worth every penny Patty cost me.
