I purchased this cup to help my daughter transition to using normal drinking glasses. The cup is angled so it's easier for her to see how much liquid she's getting, & she doesn't have to tilt it as much to drink when the contents gets low. It's a cool concept. I really like the different color options available & that it's not made in China.Be warned: because the cup is at an angle, it will tip easily. I still like the design, but I believe it could be improved upon by weighting the bottom so as to resist tipping & spilling.
