Got these for my 10 month old, 20 pound, chubby thighs, little one who is just starting to walk. Along with with walking comes tumbles as well. These were/are great. Not too tight around her chunky thighs. The knee area does not have obnoxious cushioning. The material reminds me of a ankle or wrist brace that can be purchased from a drug store. These do slip every once in a while, but now i just start off pulling them up a little higher onto her thighs.  I also purchased the  Plod Ons by Soc Ons and love these for indoor use. Both of these products are great. We love using the Kneekers outside to prevent scuff marks on those little baby knees.
