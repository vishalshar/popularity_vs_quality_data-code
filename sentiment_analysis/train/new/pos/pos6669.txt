They are press plug protectors. Not too easy to pull out but not too tough that you bend your nail backwards to pick them out to plug in things. I've used these for all three of my kids for the last 10 years and would recommend them over and over again. If you don't like using your nails to get them out, they have a pull tab which you can pull back and pull out to get it out.
