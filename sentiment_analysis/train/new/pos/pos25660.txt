When we had our first child we received a Fisher Price monitor and just accepted the static as a part of the baby monitor experience.  The fisher price was also fragile as can be, (both monitors power bricks failed within 18 months.)  When my second child was born we received another Fisher Price as a baby gift.  Within a few WEEKS the second set had begun to fail as well.  Now we had two sets of very flaky monitors eating batteries and working only sporadically.  After much frustration and missing screaming kids because the monitors failed during the night we decided a change was necessary.Despite mixed reviews on Amazon we decided to buy the Graco two child IMonitor.  The device is crystal clear with no hint of static.  I believe it works on 900mhz because the only interference we get is when the microwave oven is on (which operates in the same frequency.)  The earlier reviews did complain that it doesn't let you hear both kids at the same time, instead it flips from one room to the other.  This does take some getting used to but is not that big a deal.  However if Graco is reading this they should have this a feature in their next revision.  The other complaint I have is that there is no simple way to turn of the scanning and dedicate the monitor to only one channel.  This is a feature needed when one kid is napping and the other is not.The units are compact and sleek.  The rechargable batteries are a wonderful addition.  I hope they are Lithium Ion, not NiCad.Overall this is a great device and worth the scratch.
