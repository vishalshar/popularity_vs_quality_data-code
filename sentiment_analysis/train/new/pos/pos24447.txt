My son is 7 months old and really enjoys these shakers.Pros:- Each makes a different sound.- Durable and easy to clean.- Keeps my son's attention for a while.- Can be used as characters in imaginary play with blocks for older children.Cons:- Some of the green coloring comes off with continued use.  (I would still purchase again despite this.)- Younger infants may have a hard time gripping or picking these up.  My son had difficulty at first but got the hang of it quickly.- I'm not sure how long my son will want to play with these.Overall, I am pleased with this toy and would recommend this toy to others.
