Yes, I'm lazy and have two of these.  :)  One for downstairs, one for upstairs.  (I have two kids and own a very busy business that I manage from home, so I do not have time to go up or down stairs every time my son needs his diaper changed.)When pregnant with my daughter, we had bought the Baby Trend diaper pail.  Yes, it uses regular grocery bags which is a money-saver, but do you really want to smell dirty diapers all the time?  What's the point if you can still smell them?  We got rid of that and tried this without regret.First, it holds a lot.  We empty them once a week for trash day.  Because we have two we typically do not have to empty them more often than that.Second, the spring-loaded mechanism creates a pretty tight seal so you don't smell anything.  Yes, when you put a new diaper in there you might get a whiff of another dirty diaper that was already in there.  The smell disappears quickly.I think it's funny that one reviewer wrote that this is unsanitary because you have to push the diaper down and your hand touches the inside bag.  Well, A) the bag also moves down with a new diaper (if you're using it correctly), so your hand is probably touching clean bag.  B) Aren't you going to wash or sanitize your hands after changing a dirty diaper anyway?I highly recommend these diaper pails.  NO complaints here!
