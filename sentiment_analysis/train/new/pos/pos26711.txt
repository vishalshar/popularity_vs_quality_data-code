This was exactly what you'd expect. Just a top but it did fit the cup perfectly and did not leak or spill. You do get a random color so I have a neon orange top with a blue bottle. So it'd be nice if the seller let you choose which color you want. Still it's no big deal. This cup is for a toddler and they don't care at all. These sippy cups are my favorite as they close and don't spill, unless you have a toddler that chews the straw like my own. Even still it won't leak until it's totally destroyed.
