I was in the market for the Baltic amber necklaces that supposedly help with teething, but was nervous about the choking hazard of my son wearing it. As I was researching those necklaces, I found these and thought we'd give them a try. When I first put the necklace on I wasn't overly impressed with the length because it fell at the top of my cleavage and looked awkward. Once my son noticed it and grabbed for it I was thankful for the length, and as my son chomped on it he was thrilled. I could tell it felt good on his gums and he continuously goes for it whenever he sees it. I wear it when we are out and about, and I know I'll be carrying him around. I recommend this for any mother with a teething baby. :)
