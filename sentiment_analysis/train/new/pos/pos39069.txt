My little one had a problem with latch early on, and the lactation consultant hooked us up with the Medela nipple shields a 5 days. Worked like a charm! Unfortunately, we weren't warned that baby would become dependent on them - after about 2 weeks, we tried to wean her off but we were stuck!!! With using them for every feeding, I realized I needed more, but the Medela ones were so pricey. The NUK nipple shield was cheaper, came with a case, and honestly worked SO much better - it was easier to put on, and it stayed put SO much better. I wish they came in different sizes (a little smaller nipple size would be nice!) but honestly, these things kept us breastfeeding so I can't complain. Recently, at 2 months old, my baby knocked off the shield mid-feeding. I didn't put it back...and she latched back on PERFECTLY. So, we're off the shield now!
