My daughter has been picky since Day 1 about pacifiers, and LOVES these to pieces. We buy 6 (three 2-packs)at a time.For those with the mold issue, after a day or two we take a nail file and clean the gunk out from the ring then sterilize with a medela microwave sterilization bag. It's not impossible, and since we sterilize her bottles a couple times a week too it really isn't that bad.We replace every couple months anyways just because they get lost!
