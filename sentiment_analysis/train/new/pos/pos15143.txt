I am a cloth diaper lover, and for the most part have used the Gro-via Hybrid system. Our daughter has been using the potty off and on since about 9-10 months old, so moving on to big girl undies just makes sense. I have tried the Gerber trainers, and they were ok, but these are by far my favorite because less is more with this pack. My love for this may be generated for the same reasons I loved the Gro-Via hybrid system. I am all about practical hardworking products.  I keep both this and the Gerber brands of trainers in my rotation, don't get me wrong but the Gerber  I use only when these are soiled. These seem to fit my 22.5 pound 15 month old very well and are not as bulky as I expected.To put her in them full time, I purchased 2 of the starter packs of one shell and 3 inserts,  and one of the add on 3 pack of inserts, as well as 2 4 packs of gerber. This is more than enough.I keep a wet/dry bag in the bathroom for quick easy changes. (Bumkins Waterproof Zippered Wet/Dry Bag ) We keep the clean/dry undies in the front dry pocket, and the soiled ones in the zippered wet bag Pocket. it makes it a snap to change out while she is on the big potty, or pick up and leave the house if necessary. It is a great medium sized wet bag - and holds a good bit. It works well for any accidents resulting in soiled clothes as well. Smells stay in and clean things stay fresh and clean. Super product.We have also had great luck with the potty training book: 'girls potty time' - We have used it for our daughter from about the 9 month time frame, and though she was/is young but the pictures of real girls, real potties, and real big girl undies are very helpful. I can recite this thing backwards in my sleep now. Thanks.
