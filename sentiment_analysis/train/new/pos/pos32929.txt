My 5 month old just started really grabbing things and of course they all get dragged to her mouth. My son never did this so I was at a loss of how to handle it correctly. My son never even had a bad night with teething. They came through so fast he never got the chance to fuss about it. I use the soothies you get at the hospital since my daughter likes them so much and I was ordering some on Amazon when I saw they also had this product available. I figured I would try it and see what happens. She didn't use it for a while but like I said she just reciently began figuring out how her fingers work and now everything goes in her mouth. She chews on her fingers so much they are red most of the time. She loves this thing because it is easy to grip and any part she gets in her mouth she can chew on. I love it because I don't have to worry about her choking on it since it is way too big for that and nothing will pull off and because it is easy to clean since it is all one piece. She loves the color too.
