To those saying it doesn't sit evenly - you don't have it pushed down all the way. I made the same mistake. However the sit clicks up higher to allow easy slip off of the cover.Overall I really love this swing. Comfortably padded, and sturdy base my now four month old loves it. ALthough she only will stay in it for about 20 minutes at a time. That's just her personality. The music is nice, the speaker is wonderful with volume control, and it even features water and nature noises. The swing automatically turns off after so long, as does the music. Another nice feature.I love the fact that you can make this either plug in or battery operated. We typically dont move ours, but when we had to we didn't have to worry about an outlet.My biggest and probably only complaint is the harness. I don't feel like it adequately extends. After struggling with it for sometime, we gave up on using the top two straps. Even with just using the bottom straps our kiddo is still perfectly secure in there.I do say this overall is a great buy for the money.
