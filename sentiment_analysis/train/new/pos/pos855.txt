I highly recommend these inserts and Charlie Banana diapers as well, EXCELLENT products with proper care.Cloth diapers are harder to care for if you have very hard water like me; if you are wondering about your own water, see the map on this site:[...]I have found that for my hard water problem, periodic chlorine bleaching of my inserts is the only thing that works to strip them, which maintains their absorbancy and keep them from turning stiff and dingy-gray. The care instructions on the tags specifically warn against using chlorine bleach, but I've done it many times and my inserts are in great shape still.
