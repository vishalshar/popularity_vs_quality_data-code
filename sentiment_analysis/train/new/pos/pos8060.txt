I looked everywhere for functional car seat covers which protect the back AND the SIDES of the front seat. Our son's forward-facing carseat is in the middle of the back seat so his shoes always come in contact w/the inner side of both front seats and none of the seat-back covers on the market that I found cover that area. This cover is made of a very sturdy and nice-looking material (similar to luggage material). It has a sleek design and looks square and trim and neat on the seat-back. It goes all the way down to the bottom and covers the back portion of both sides of the front seat. It just fit our seats (2006 Toyota Highlander) so I think it would work w/most large seats. If you need 2 like we do, it's a little pricey, but there's nothing else out there that I've found to solve this problem. It has a nice clean design that doesn't junk up your car too much. Prior to my purchase I corresponded several times w/the manufacturer and they were very helpful, supposedly they are coming out w/other colors soon (like tan). Kudos to Rover Gear for filling this unmet need w/a well-made product.
