This is a pretty awesome product. It has some pros and cons, but mostly pros. I'd say this was my favorite pouch until Infantino's Pouch Pals came out.Pros:- Super easy to wash- Really durable and reusable- Bright color is hard to loose (we're talking toddlers here)- Soft and easy to squeeze for kids- Wide mouth is really easy to fill with apple sauce, yogurt, or whateverCons:- The cap is a pop-on instead of a screw on. My little girl has squeezed this in her hand and filled the cap with apple sauce... a mess. Some might prefer this, without the screw, the spout is smooth, and kids with sensory issues might like the smooth feel better... it's a trade off.- I wish it had a solid base so I could stand it on the counter while filling, or my kid could put it down without leaking out- Not translucent, so you can't see how much they have leftWe have one of these, and used it all the time until Infantino came out with their silicone pouch. Their old "Keeper Pouch" had a narrow mouth, pain to fill. But, their new Reusable Pouch Pals have a wide mouth, stable base, translucent silicone and screw on cap. So, my current favorite. But, when they are dirty, this old stand by isn't bad, especially since she figured out not to squeeze it BEFORE it was in her mouth. A great product.
