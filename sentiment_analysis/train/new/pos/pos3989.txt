We have a very small house and the playroom doubles as a nighttime sleeping space for our 9 month old until she's sleeping well enough to share the bedroom with her sibling.  We've popped this thing up and down twice every day since we bought it in May and it's holding up beautifully.  About 75 days, so 150 popups and fold-downs total.  No sign of wear or breakage.  She sleeps very soundly in it.  I don't put the mattress bottom in the sleeve like they recommend, I put it directly in the bottom of the crib,  so it takes me 30 seconds to fold down, less to set up.  My child is 9 months old and can roll easily, crawl and cruise,  so getting stuck  between the mattress and bottom of the crib isn't an issue. If you put the mattress in the sleeve under the crib bottom it would take longer to set up and fold down ... but not much.  This crib is TRULY popup. No tools or additional steps. One smooth move to fold down.  Stand back and let go of it, now it's popped up.  This is truly what I'd been searching for but could never find.  Highly recommend. *pictures are taken on a twin size mattress*folded up measurements in inches are 32Lx38Wx3D (thick)footprint in inches when popped up is 60Lx38Wx25H
