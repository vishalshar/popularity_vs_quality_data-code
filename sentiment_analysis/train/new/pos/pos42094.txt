When you have a baby you will need lots of burp cloths, these were great. They are super soft and comfy and easy to clean. I could throw them in the washer or hand wash when needed. My son has sensitive skin and these worked great with no reactions, I constantly recommend them to friends and would buy again if the need arises.
