so i read a lot of reviews about these hangers, and most of the bad ones were related to color. a lot of peeps got all blue when they had a girl, or all pink when they were having a boy. i thought, heck - if the worst thing is the color of hangers that will be forever hidden in a closet how bad could that be. plus - though i'm having a girl, i'm not going to force pepto-bismal pink down her throat so i didn't really care if all three sets were (worst case scenario) blue. well the hangers came yesterday and all three sets were white! sure - I probably got lucky, but its also possible that the company, after seeing the drama the wrong color was causing so many folks, have decided to start sending neutral colors. who knows - regardless, I did think I should say that I was pretty happy with my hangers :)
