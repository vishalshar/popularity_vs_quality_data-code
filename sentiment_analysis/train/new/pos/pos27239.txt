Recently I was browsing in a trendy clothing store (not going to mention any names!) and I saw beautiful letters covered in maps. Unfortunately the price was not as beautiful as the product; on my college budget, there was no way that I would spend over thirty dollars for decor!When I got home I immediately went on Amazon and purchased the products that I needed to create my masterpiece (for those interested, I usedStreetwise Manhattan Map - Laminated City Street Map of Manhattan, New York - Folding pocket size travel map with subway map, bus mapand Mod Podge CS11202 Original 16-Ounce Glue,  Gloss Finish to glue the map to the surface of the wooden letter). When I viewed this product on Amazon, I was skeptical; how good could the quality be if it is priced under four dollars? Yet upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the wood and its beautiful, deep brown color. At six inches tall, it is not large but it definitely can still be seen by visitors; I like that its size is not overpowering and distracting. It is also able to stand up by itself which is important for me, since I did not want to lean it against a wall.Overall, I found this letter to be absolutely perfect for my craft, and I have recommended it to friends who have commented positively on its appearance.
