My wife purchased one of these for our 6 month old daughter and our daugther loves it!!! The cart cover is tough, durable, actively colored to capture children's attention and has enough doo dads and dangly things for kids to play with while sitting in a shopping cart.We found ourselves taking the cart cover with us everywhere we go because it's so versatile. Impromptu picnic.... pull this bad boy out and let your child play safely on it.  Questionable location for emergency diaper change, you now have a sanitary haven for your child to play comfortably while getting a heiney cleaning!
