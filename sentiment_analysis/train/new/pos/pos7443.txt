We love the sliding closet door lock on our wooden pantry door.  It's so easy to use and keeps the little one out of the pantry.  However, the adhesive tape that comes with it doesn't hold up.  As you apply pressure to the lock, it falls right off the door.  So instead, we just used one screw and screwed the lock on to the door and it's perfectly fine.
