Clearly, one's review of this depends on how much interference is in your house.  Buy it, test it out, return it if it doesn't work.  That was my plan, and it turns out it works great in our 2000 sq foot, 2 floor townhouse.  No problems with range and I can literally hear every breath even though the monitor is about 5-6 feet from her crib.  I particularly like the voice activation feature, which allows me to only her crying/noises above a certain decibel level if I choose.  This was a better choice for us for two reasons: 1) it's analog, and I had been reading too many scary articles re: radiation and DECT and wifi monitors and 2) it keeps me from being too neurotic with a video monitor.  Honestly, we tried one and I just stared at that sucker all night long.  It had infrared---and I didn't sleep.  That's just me though.  You might be less neurotic!UPDATE: It's 3/2016 and this thing is still kicking in great shape and perfect sound.  We tried a camera for a little while to get more of a feel for what she was doing in there, but this one has better sound---I like being able to actually hear her breathe and I can on this one.  We were happy to be able to see what she was doing, but came back to this one for health/safety reasons and because the sound is so good.
