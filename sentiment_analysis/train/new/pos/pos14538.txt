My daughter had stubborn cradle cap that stuck around until she was 18 months old (until I got this).  It only took using it two times to completely get rid of it.  That little plastic comb/brush did the trick.  The wash mitt was pretty useless except my daughter like to play with it. I treated my daughters scalp with coconut oil about 30 minutes before her bath, then in the tub used natural baby soap/shampoo and sure enough the cradle cap came right off.  I didn't want to irritate her delicate little scalp so I left some of it one for the next bath time.  After the second bath it was completely gone.  Every new mom should have this.
