I got these for my neice, as sort of a gag gift for her first baby boy. She is from a family of girls, so didn't have the "boy" experience. She LOVED them and found them to be more than helpful in curbing the little surprises that wee laddies like to spring on new mommies! Now that MY daughter is in that category, too, I wish I'd ordered her some!
