I recently had my first baby and wanted so badly to breastfeed exclusively. Unfortunately my milk production was low and baby became very frustrated about that and he began to clamp down on my breast with his gums and twist his head side to side. Very painful for me! Because of this, I decided I would try pumping and giving him breastmilk in a bottle. My nipples became very sore and scabbed from pumping to the point where I had to take a break. This caused me to become engorged. A friend had mentioned that she used theses nipple shields for breastfeeding her little one. I ended up sending daddy to the store in the middle of the night in search of these. I used it right away and really wished I had known about them sooner. I feel I could have avoided much of the stress, pain, and frustration that I experienced with breastfeeding. These are pretty thin but protected my nipples from soreness and biting. I could still feel if baby clamped down too tightly or sucked voraciously but it was not painful any longer. I found that theses stay on well even though they seem like they would just fall off. A couple drops of breastmilk is all that I needed to keep them in place. I also found that once I had the shield in place, it encouraged my milk let down. The tip of the shield would start to fill up with milk after getting it in place and waiting a very short time. I would recommend these to any breastfeeding mother, especially if the are new moms and working to get the hang of breastfeeding. You cannot live without them!!! Make sure to have them on hand before baby arrives so you are not sending daddy out to hunt them down at all hours of the night.
