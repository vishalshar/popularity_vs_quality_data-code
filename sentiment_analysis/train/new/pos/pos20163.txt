We purchased 2 of these strollers for our vacation and the Prince Lionheart connectors so that one of us could push both together - or we could go our separate ways at times.We are thrilled with these strollers.  They popped up and down quickly, they are lightweight, our 2 yr old and 5 yr old fit fine in them and they both slept while being pushed through Disney World.  The 5 yr old is 40 inches tall and about 32 lbs. and I think her height is about the tallest a child could be comfortable in this stroller.  Her head was almost touching the canopy but she never complained.The canopy is a great asset by allowing us to pull it out a little, bend it down in different spots - or even bend it back and up.  There is also a square zippered pouch hanging down in the back from the canopy which was perfect for tissues, cell phones and camera.  The basket underneath is shallow but perfect for a Ziploc bag with 4 diapers and wipes.We also purchased the Jolly Jumper stroller caddy for each to hold their juice cups and bottles of water.  They fit perfectly and worked like a charm.  Pushing both kids was easy even our ten yr old was taking turns.  And when the two strollers were connected as long as you push the heavier child and locked the front wheels, it was great.This stroller is so much more durable, sturdy and safe than a regular umbrella stroller.  We are really pleased with this purchase and have realized it made our vacation so much more enjoyable because they are so portable in and out of shuttle buses and train rides.
