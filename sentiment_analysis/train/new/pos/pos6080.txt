We used these to soften the corners of our slate hearth. Having a little one learning to walk, we didn't want to spend time or money on unnecessary trips to the ER for gashes or knocked out new teeth. These blended beautifully with the black slate and actually created a more finished look when paired with the black foam strips as well.
