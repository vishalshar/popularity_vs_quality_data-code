Bought for my new granddaughter that hasn't arrived yet so I don't know how she will like it.  It arrived in good condition and is so cute that even if she doesn't play with it, it will look great sitting in her crib.  It looks just like the picture.  I was not disappointed with this purchase.REVISED REVIEW:  My Granddaughter is now 5 months old and is now playing with her Taggies Elephant.  She loves it and will chew on the tags, ears, feet and anything else she can get in her mouth.  It is so soft and cuddly that if she falls on it there is nothing she can hurt herself on.  It's nice when toys are cute, but it is better when the child enjoys and plays with the toy.  Still happy with this purchase.
