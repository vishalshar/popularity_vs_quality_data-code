This is a great baby swaddler!  We were given one in the newborn size as a gift for our new grand baby.  It was great and I immediately ordered another in the next size up for him to use when he outgrew the little one.  The are easy to use and perfect for this swaddling trend popular now.  When my children were born we didn't quite do this tight swaddle/comfort wrap so I'm not very good at it...this Sleepsack solved that grandma problem!  We bought the t-shirt knit style as we live in California and don't really need the heavier fabric that is also available.  I would highly recommend this to anyone with a newborn, especially if everyone caring for the baby isn't an expert in swaddling the baby with a regular blanket. Mom & Dad are much better at it, but I had trouble making it tight enough to stay with a blanket!  He sleeps well all swaddled up and comfy!
