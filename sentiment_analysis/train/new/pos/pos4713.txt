This is a great changing pad cover. Very cute, fits nicely (we're using the LA Baby 4-sided changing pad).However, there is one tip I want to give first time parents (my daughter was born 4 weeks ago) that I would have found useful when registering ...Along with a changing pad cover like this one, register for disposable "pee pads" (dr. office calls them "chux", or "underpads", etc). Amazon sells a bunch at reasonable prices (brand: Dynarex). They use these at the hospital and dr.'s office. You put these little pee pads over changing tables and they absorb any accidents. It will save you a LOT of laundry!!! Yes, you can minimize the occurences of accidents by putting a new diaper under the old diaper and other tricks, but no matter what you do you WILL have pee/poop getting on your changing cover frequently!! Downside is you will have more trash than you would have normally, but trust me  --- when you are sleep deprived, it is a LOT easier to just throw away a dirty pee pad and lay a fresh one down then to realize that you have to do a load of laundry in the middle of the night holding a crying baby! :)edit:here's a link to underpads that i bought. amazon sells many more, i just particularly like these. They are often on sale for $13 for 100.Dynarex #1341 Underpads, 17x24 in. 22 gram, 100 ct
