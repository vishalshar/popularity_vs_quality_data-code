I don't own Bbox cups and actually bought these to replace the straws from some Zoli BOT cups. The Zoli replacement straws were out of stock, and the picture of this product looked extremely similar to the picture for the Zoli replacement straws, so I took a chance. The top portion of these straws appears to be exactly the same as the Zoli straws, and they fit perfectly in the lids of the Zoli BOT cups. The Zoli straws that I replaced were all made of the same material as the top part of these straws, but the lower portion of these straws seems like it is a different type of plastic than the top part of the straw. This doesn't cause any problems, however. Also, the lower portion of these straws is about half an inch longer than the Zoli straws that they replaced, but they still fit and work fine (and it would be easy to cut them shorter if it were a problem).
