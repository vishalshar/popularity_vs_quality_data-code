This safety harness is great! It freed me up so that I am not constantly wrestling a child who just wants to get down & explore, but also allows me to keep them "connected" & not roam freely. However, the child feels pretty free to explore so they are happy! For those concerned about the velcro closure, let me put your concerns to rest. The velcro area is large- it allows for a good amount of size adjustment, as well as providing plenty of attachment area for making the closure secure. I never had problems with my children "breaking loose." Now if the harness is too small for your child, then I could see that happening because there would not be enough velcro to attach itself to. But if it's used the way it was designed to be used, there is plenty of velcro to keep it strong & secure. Some other pros, are that the shoulder straps are adjustable, & it is lightweight & compact. It barely takes up any space. I would really recommend this brand for anyone looking for a harness because it keeps the child happy & safe, & therefore keeps Mommy (or Daddy etc) happy. It's a win win! ;)
