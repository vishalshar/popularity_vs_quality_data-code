I love the print! It is perfecr for my little girls room.I was looking for  a way to tie together Hot pink and teal. Sadly the colors are not  true. The hot pink is more of a medium/bubblegum color. Also, the pinkish peach color is a true peach. The teals are true to color so if you are picky about those go for it. Even with the colors being slightly off I still love this product.
