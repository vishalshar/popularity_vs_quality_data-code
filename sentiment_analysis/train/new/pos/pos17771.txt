I have only had the chair for about a month but I am really impressed.  Our 6 month old fits in the high chair attachment perfectly.  It wasnt that bad to assemble, although they could have used more finger screws/wingnuts instead of regular srews that necessitate the use of a philips screwdriver.  Compared to most stuff I have had to assemble (Graco swing, Million Dollar Baby crib) its MUCH easier with straightforward directions.  Chair looks great in our dining room, not an eyesore like every other highchair.  Very sleek and modern.  Definately recommend getting the plastic tray cover--the baby food usually winds up all over it and its much easier to clean than if it was all over the wood tray.  Very sturdy and WILL NOT tip over by any effort of our kid.
