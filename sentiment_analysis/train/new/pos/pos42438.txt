Found this 60% cheaper in a famous toy store. I got the pink and purple combination.I dont know why it is way too pricy here on Amazon.My daughter who is 11 months old is now transitioning to sippy cups. She didnt like the Avent trainer cupsher older brother use to have. So I went to the store to look for something else I saw online but the store didnt have them.I ended buying this instead upon seeing the attached spout cover and the word that says, "Leak Proof".The spout isnt really as soft as it claimed to be but when I tip it over and tried to sip myself,the fluid just flows easily without difficulty and when you stop sipping, it doesnt leak at all.My daughter learned to use it and loves it by the first 20 minutes. She is now 100% on sippy cups. No more bottles. Woot!And one thing I really love is the attached spout cover. Genius!The inside valve is also easy to clean. I handwash them so nothing gets warped by hot dishwasher water and affect the leak proof valves.I only have them for 3 weeks now and so far so good. I will come back to update it if I see something negative with these cups.My daughter empties her milk from this sippy cups and she will drool from her mouth, thats because her mouth is not leak proof.
