I had purchased the S.S. Noah Bedding set by Lambs and Ivy and was excited that this product was also Noah's Ark themed.  Although it doesn't match exactly, the animals are very close to those in the bedding set so that it goes very nicely.Although the previous reviewer was correct- it does only come with one blank card to put the print on- the cards are very solid/opaque card stock.  If you mess up on the first try, you could easily use the other side of the card to take the print-I don't believe that it would show through.  Also, if you get really desperate, you could probably get a third try by using the back of the card(s) that has the demonstration print on them that you see in the picture.Overall a very nice product.  I am happy that I can display my prints in such adorable fashion!
