I was a little unsure at first because the dispenser was bigger than I expected, but I absolutely love it now.  At the beginning, I just used one little container for formula.  It was perfect.  Now I usually carry all 3 containers.  One with formula, one with rice cereal, and one with cheerios.  Someone mentioned the little spouts never line up.  My husband realized if you get the order right, they will line up.  For me, it's orange, blue, and green.  Then they line up just like when I first got them.  Every time.Cons:The lids are a little hard to go on and off, but not as bad as everyone else says.The little lids could get lost.Can't stack them in the cupboard when apart.Pros:Can take a choice of 1, 2, or 3 containers with you.The formula comes out much better than the munchkin containers I've tried.I can feed rice cereal to baby right out of the container.Dishwasher safe (At least I put them in dishwasher and they seem fine).
