I bought two of these around Christmas, and despite numerous binky buys later (from those time we forget to attach these to the shirts, I can always count on these to be the holy grail of a full nights sleep.  They have been through the washer (on numerous accidental occasions and one spilled coffee incident on purpose) and still work as smooth, and look as sharp as the day they were bought.  If I wasn't trying to toss the binkies before age two, I would buy a second set (I have twins if saying the set throws you off), just to attach to the car seat for headache emergencies.  The owl design is cute and seemingly hard to stain, as we have yet to do such damage.  It is easy to attach even the big disc binkies they now give at hospitals as well as the Nuks.Disclaimer**  I get discounts on items sometimes to test them, this IS *NOT* one of those items, yeah, it's *sometimes* a cool job, as someone has to give you the heads up on whether on not it's worth your time/money and being a mom of twin toddlers, I know and respect the value of both time and money, so I keep it real.
