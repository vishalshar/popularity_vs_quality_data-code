I bought this for my twin girls for on their twin pack n play bassinet. It fits perfectly and gives the "mattress" part a little more softness and comfort. The material is pretty soft but thin, yet breathable. I like that it gives me the option to wash their bedding in case they have any diaper accidents. I recommend getting this if you have this twin bassinet.
