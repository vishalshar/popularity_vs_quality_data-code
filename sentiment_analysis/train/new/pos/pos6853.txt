Work perfectly... I use them to cover the edges and corners of our marble fireplace ledge. Color is slightly off white not a true crisp white which is kind of what I was hoping for... but for the price of $8 I can't complain.Contrary to some reviews I read on this product they stick incredibly well... but I only used them on a smooth marble surface so maybe that's the difference?Minus the off color I am super pleased with this product and would purchase again.
