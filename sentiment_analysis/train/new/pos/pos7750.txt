Fuzzibunz are my choice of cloth diaper without question.  My daughter is average,  not considered chubby by most standards, and Fuzzibunz offer the best protection of the 5 brands I tried,  including more expensive ones.  These inserts can be folded for my little one to provide even better leak-protection.  This is not to say we never have wet outer clothing.  Wiggly babies can "un-adjust" even the best fitting diaper but these have lasted for 15 months and still absorb very well.  One not --  they do need to be "stripped"  every four or five months even using a special soap such as Charlies.  Not a big deal and helps restore your diapers to optimal success.
