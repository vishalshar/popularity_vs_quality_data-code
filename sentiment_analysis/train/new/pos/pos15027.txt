Babies arrive when they want and we needed these blankets ASAP. We contacted this company with a few questions. Within the hour they responded with answers and help. We ordered a pack of 12 hospital quality receiving blankets. This company had our order delivered within 24 hours. So from asking questions, getting feedback in an hour, we ordered, got delivery confirmation within an hour and got our package delivered all within less than 24 hours. We by and are sellers and have been for many years, by far this company puts their customers first. Honestly we can say with our large family of 9 this company is the best with customer service. All 12 receiving blankets are perfect, they are the same blankets they have at the hospital but these are new. They are all washed with Dreft, dried and each is perfect! We like the measurements of this blanket, we can fold it to swaddle our grand baby. We did read other reviews but knew exactly what we were ordering. Our oldest child is 27 and we still have the blanket she came home in. The quality of these blankets is outstanding and we advise anyone to get 12. Look in all the baby store like we did, we have some brand name blankets but after washing you can't swaddle a baby the size is way to small. We also have this company's other blankets with pink and blue pin strips they are also perfect! Thank you Linteum Textile for your quality products and taking great lengths to get us blankets right away. We are happy customers but believe our grandchild is the happiest.
