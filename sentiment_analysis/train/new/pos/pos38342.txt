I was looking for a plush doll for my infant to snuggle with. She likes looking at faces and feeling textures to comfort herself and this was a great solution! Held up well in the washing machine. The hair is braided and tied with ribbons, this provide a great texture for comfort. There is also a rattle in the doll which provides great entertainment!
