This gift was for a coworker who is having his first son. He's into the weightlifting thing. At first I was thinking it was a ridiculous price for a baby rattle. But after receiving and seeing the size, I was happy. And all was worth it when they told me it was one of their favorite gifts and they appreciated the amount of thought I put into it to make it personal to them.
