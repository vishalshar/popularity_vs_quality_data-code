I like this mattress cover, and it is well made.  However, I'd like to note that I have an older version of this same one, and the older one is much better.  It's more padded and much softer (more comfortable).  There is nothing particularly wrong with the new version, except that it's obvious they've lowered the quality from previously.  Overall, it's still worth getting, but I'd like to see a reduction in price to go along with the reduction in quality.
