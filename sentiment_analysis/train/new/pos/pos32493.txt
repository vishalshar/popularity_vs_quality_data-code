I purchased this toy for my grandchild who will be born soon.  The parents decided to name her Sophie, so of course the Lamaze Princess Sophie was a must-have.  The skirt crinkles when you touch it and this is a sound that my other grandchildren have found to be very interesting and captures their attention.  Sophie has bright eyes that will definitely be an attraction to very young babies and the clip to attach to car seat, baby carriers, etc. is perfect.
