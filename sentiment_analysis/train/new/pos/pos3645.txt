I waited 9 months to write the review so I have a good idea about these diapers. I think they are overall GREAT, the only downside is I can fit an extra insert for overnights or else it would be a 5 stars. My baby was big at birth 8lb 10, and he could fit in these dipes very well early on. The adjustable straps are a great innovation. I also have BUM GENIUS and those took longer to get into. I like the trim crotch of the dipes, and the fit is dare I say it better than my BUMs. I do love my BUM G's but do think these are  a better fit.Around month 5 when baby started solids I had an ammonia problem. The inserts do hold a lot of wee, so I changed up my routine to rinse wee as well as poo and wash every 2 days, bleach once a month and no problems since. The manufacturer directions say wash warm, and do not say to use bleach. I have been using it anyway one a month with my Bum Gs. My routine is a cold wash, then a hot wash, TIDE and they are holding up very well. The inside of the covers are a little more pilly than my Bum Gs, but they are still soft and work very well.One more thing after the newborn stage you are supposed to use both inserts, which were pretty bulky for a while there. With use and repeated washed the inserts got flatter, not less absorbant just flatter, and now they seem less bulky. Or maybe baby got bigger? Not sure the reason, but they have gotten better over time in that sense.Good diapers I would buy them again, especially for the newborn phase.  But love my Bum Gs too.
