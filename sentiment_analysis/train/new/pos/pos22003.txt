We love this stroller!  When we were stroller shopping, I was single-minded about picking the carseat first and from there, the best stroller available to match.  We decided on the Britax Companion infant seat and I still am 100% happy with our decision.  Where we went wrong was underestimating the importance of a great stroller.  The Buzz is far superior to the stroller we bought to match our Companion.  The reasons it is better are things that I didn't understand the importance of before baby was here.  I'm not even going to touch on how unbelievably sexy and innovative this new stroller is and as you can see from other reviews, it lives up to the hype.  Here are the two reasons that have made me a believer:1) Comfortable seat.  -- The buzz has thick, dense, cushy foam and hugs our little one like a dream.  She is incredibly content in this seat which makes long walks fun again.  Our other stroller has a canvas covered thick cardboard seat.  I now understand why she was not happy in there for long.2) Sunshade is incredibly flexible and can keep the sun out of her eyes from any angle.  -- I live in Seattle and this was a detail that didn't seem important to me pre-baby.  I was wrong.  The sunshade on our other stroller is short and inflexible.  It worked great, as long as the sun was behind baby.  When we turned to walk the other direction, I would need to use a blanket thrown over to shield her.  Not the case with the Buzz.  The sunshade is incredible, it can fold down flat to completely encase the baby if necessary.I'm not sure what I would have done differently from the beginning because I love our carseat and loved having a stroller frame to put the carseat on.  But, now that we're at the stroller phase (5 months) I see incredible value in the buzz and am really happy to have one!
