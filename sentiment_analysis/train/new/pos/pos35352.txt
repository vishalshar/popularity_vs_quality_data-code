First of all these instructions are horrible. I figured out a way to connect this camera wireless. First of all the reset button on the bottom of the camera it's not where it says reset button. If you look above the sticker there is another hole that is the actual reset button. Press the button for 10 seconds and left the camera initiate setup. Once you start hearing the tone you will need a lan cable. Plug in the camera in the back of the router that you're going to be using. Click press add camera. Then click search camera UID from LAN. Once you see your camera connect, press the settings on the right hand side of the box. You will see a list of settings. click on Wi-Fi settings. Then click Wi-Fi manager find the name of your router then type in the password then click the link button on the right-hand side. Once you do all that it should say connected. Then you can unplug your land cable and move your camera wherever you want. It took me awhile to figure this out but it actually works. The camera has really good resolution if your Wi-Fi signal is very strong.
