I bought this pump to use at night after my baby's last feeding (to relieve for comfort, as he sleeps through the night), and on the go, instead of lugging around my electric pump.  To say I was pleasantly surprised at how much I would like this pump is an understatement.  I actually prefer it over my electric in regards to comfort and ease of use.The parts are very easy to clean.  I usually just rinse them, soak them in soapy water, then rinse again and sterilize.  Because there are so few parts, it is easy to break down and clean quickly.  My only "con" with this is that you cannot sterilize the O ring or the pump handle.  As a self-proclaimed germophobe, I want to be able to sterilize all parts.  I just make sure I clean these extra well.Also take into consideration that you likely will not respond as well to a manual pump as you do to nursing or an electric pump, but for the reasons that I need it, it definitely fits the bill.  I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a manual pump.
