My daughter has always been off the charts for weight (<3%) and unless she wore a dress or leggings her bottoms always fell off. I hated that most shorts and pants and even some skirts didn't fit her even though the length was right. Thankfully, a good friend whose also has small children told me about this product and I can't thank her enough! It is so easy to use and my daughter could care less that it is on her clothes. I have been using the same 2 pack for a year now (bought when she was 2) and they still work great. I actually just leave one on her favorite pair of shorts so she can just pull them on whenever she wants to wear them.If you have a small child I highly recommend this product since most clothes, even with an elastic waist, will be too big. I am about to purchase some for my son since he is also small and can't choose to wear a dress or leggings since pants will be too big!
