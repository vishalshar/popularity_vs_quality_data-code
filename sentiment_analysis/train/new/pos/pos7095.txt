This is absolutely amazing. We have used this with our 2 year old on a lot of long hikes. She'll last about 2-3 hours on it. It's a little hard on the adult's shoulders, but that is to be expected. We also had to replace the water bladder because the water always tasted completely foul and gross. But, it still earns 5 stars because it is unique and we can't live without it. We constantly have people ask about it and inquire where they can get one. I hope to see a updated product, maybe with hip support for the adult. But, this is worth every penny and a life-saver for a family that likes to hike.
