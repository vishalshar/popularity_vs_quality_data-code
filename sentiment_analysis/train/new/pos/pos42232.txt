I bought this for my baby neice and she loves it.  She's been playing with it since she was three months old and never tires of it, even now that she's ten months!  With all of its colors and moving pieces, I'm not surprised.  It has kept her entertained for hours!I was sad to hear they discontinued this model.  I haven't seen what they've chosen to replace it with, but this one has been a reliable standby for her in all these many months.
