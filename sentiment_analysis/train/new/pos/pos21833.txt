It is incredibly difficulty to find air plane themed bedding. This was a very great deal for the price! You can tell it's not the most expensive set but it's very cute and will serve it's purpose. I liked that it came with so many pieces, the crib bumper (for later use), bottom fitted sheet, comforter, crib skirt and diaper stacker were the most useful pieces. The wall décor and window valance was just ok and we probably won't use it. It came with 3 cute little pillows that we obviously won't use for a while for safety concerns but will look cute in the crib later.Pros: Great price for the amount of pieces and reasonably good quality.  It's cute without looking too cartoonish.  Air plane themed without other automotive and/or looking too red/white/blue as most are.Cons: Would have loved if it came with the mobile instead of some of the other décor.
