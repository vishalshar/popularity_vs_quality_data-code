I'm very happy with this mirror for my 2 month old.  I originally bought it to hang next to the changing table for some distraction during diaper changes. We had trouble hanging it at the correct angle, so we ended up putting it in his crib. Turns out that is the perfect place for him to get the most from it.  We use it when he just wants to hang out and he loves it.  It's also been great for tummy time.  We prop him on the small boppy and it motivates him to look up.  There's something about the melodies on the Baby Einstein products that really interest him.As far as installation is concerned, I found it much easier to install it on the side of the crib, than some other similar items I've purchased (and returned) for this purpose. If you are wanting this for the car, it is marketed for baby's entertainment only.  It doesn't say anything about being used to see your baby while driving, which is probably why there are so many negative reviews on it for this purpose.  The clip is actually quite effective at hanging it from the headrest for your child can see him or her self.I highly recommend it if you are looking for a good mirror for your baby to interact with and to be further entertained by the lights, colors and music. I only wish that it had a remote. That would make me want to use it in the car too.  For now it's in the crib.
