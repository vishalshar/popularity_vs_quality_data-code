My husband and I LOVE this bag. We wouldn't spend this much money on something sub-par. We are absolutely satisfied with this purchase, even the value for money. The conversions from backpack to shoulderbag to hanging-on-the-stroller-handle are SUPER easy and hassle-free. The multiple compartments organize everything perfectly. The straps are comfortable, sturdy, and well-padded: more than a normal run-of-the-mill backpack, but less than a hiking pack. The three front zipper pouches are perfect for smaller items that we need fast (pacifier, phone and wallet, burp cloth, hand sanitizer...). The size is perfect for daily walks and day trips. Finally, the list of must-have items, printed on an inside flap of the bag, is indispensable when you're sleep-deprived! They even include "baby" as the last item on the list! Thanks, Diaper Dude.This bag is not for Daddies only. This Mommy LOVES the utility and practical nature of the whole thing and recommends this bag to everyone.
