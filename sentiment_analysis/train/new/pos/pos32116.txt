I have been very happy with the Graco Vie4 stroller in general, though I was a bit surprised at its size.  It IS a full-sized stroller and it takes up the entire trunk of my Hyundai Elantra!  Definitely not something I can leave in my car if I am going to go grocery shopping!  A little heavy/bulky to maneuver folded, though can drag it along one-handed quite easily.  The one-handed up and down is great, and it was easy to put together.  Nice big basket below and space for 2 adult-sized beverages above is definitely convenient.  Handles the cobblestones and craggy sidewalks in our neighborhood with ease--big enough wheels that it doesn't get hung up on curbs, etc.  Sturdy, have not been worried about it breaking.  My son is a bit annoyed that the seat back doesn't go to bolt upright position, though he is 7 months and can pull himself into the position he likes as long as we only have the lap strap fastened.  Aside from the size, my only other complaint is the child's tray--I think the mechanism to allow it to swing is a little hard to operate, and I have to 'persuade' my son to sit back while I lower it into place.  Would over all recommend it--works for the mall as well as around the neighborhood or park.  Looking forward to several years of service!
