I purchased it for my 7 year old as a present so we haven't used it as of yet. Upon inspection the box came and it was very thin cardboard and poor quality. The box was crushed and ripped in places. The chair inside was wrapped in plastic and the legs are wrapped separately in plastic. The chair IS a tiny bit smaller than I expected, but my daughter will still be able to use it. She is very tall and slender. I don't think it would fit a "chubby" 7 year old.This chair seems to be of great quality. The fabric is felt like and feels plush and soft. The stitching is done well. I'm disappointed with the legs on the chair, they are cheap, thin plastic. They really skimped here. I will probably replace these with some wooden legs of my own. Also, you have to install the legs yourself which includes having to drill the holes for the screws - this explains the user pictures of the chair with no legs. :)Other than the legs and the packaging, I am in love with this chair and I think the quality is good enough that after my 7 year old outgrows it I can pass it down to my niece. It would be nice to have some long term user reviews to see if the quality holds up. It's def. worth the money in my opinion.
