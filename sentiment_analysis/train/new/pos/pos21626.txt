I ordered this dish for my six-month-old infant to use while navigating her first foods. It is absolutely perfect for this purpose -- once you see it, you will see that it was probably designed for this purpose. It is not really meant for toddlers to use as their only dish or only plate.At most, it probably holds two ounces of food on each side, but I haven't put much more than one ounce in each side.As an infant dish, it is terrific! The recommended amount of infant cereal fits perfectly on one side and the recommended amount of infant pureed food fits perfectly on the other side. Having them side by side allows you to mix the foods, or not. It's easy to hold while feeding your infant, and the lip around the ring reduces spillage.Once your infant is larger, you can put small snacks in it or side dishes in it at meal time, and continue to use it that way. Again, you will not be able to use it as a full plate or a meal container. I would not purchase it for older children.
