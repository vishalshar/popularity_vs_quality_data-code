The mom didn't even think of any signs for her car, what with all the other things a new single mom has to worry about when she's getting ready for her first baby. But she, her mom and I all thought this was the cutest way to ask others on the road to please be extra safe around her car because of the baby. I need to remember to get a couple more for the sides of her car, instead of just the back.
