This has been perfect for us! My toddler really needed something consistent and since we spend a lot of time out and about this was a good fit for us. We use it mostly at home but took it with us during vacation, play dates, and every day excursions. Only took a few times for him to realize we'd always follow through. Tough material and good grip on wood floors doesn't slide around at all.Like other moms, I rely on quality Amazon reviews to make my purchase decisions.
