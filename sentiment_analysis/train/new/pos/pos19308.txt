With a 21-month-old toddler and incoming newborn I needed to upgrade my medium sized diaper bag to something a little larger. My first Carter's diaper bag lasted nearly 2 years and I honestly could continue using it, if I weren't needing more space for two kiddos; so, I figured I may as well see what larger options were available from Carter's. After comparing numerous bags and brands I ultimately decided to stick with Carter's and buy this bag.While my second child isn't here yet (due in 14 days), I can say since switching last week that I have a ton of room. I usually pack 8 size 4 diapers for my daughter a full pack of Pampers sensitive wipes, Desitin, an extra 3t outfit, my makeup, credit cards, phone, water bottle for me and my daughter, snacks for us both, nursing cover, and nursing pads. I have room for that and certainly will have plenty of room to add diapers for my newborn, an extra outfit or two, burp cloths, and small toys.I am please with the space and the simple design of this bag. I am especially happy with the price of this bag and the fact that it comes with stroller straps, which is an absolute life saver when we are out and about.The only thing I miss from my first diaper bag that this one is lacking is the internal zipper pocket. I used to be able to discreetly store my feminine products within the zipper, but now I have nowhere to do so.
