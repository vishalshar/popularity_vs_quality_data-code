Was fairly easy to set up and quite sturdy. Love that all fabrics are removal and washable.  I will primarily use this as napper and changing station at first. I love that the changer has FOUR supports instead of 2 like many other more popular and more expensive models. I feel confident that the changing station will be functional for us longer since it's all so very stable.UPDATE: So baby is 15 weeks old now and we continue to use the changing station daily.  Baby will outgrow length of changer before she reaches weight capacity, and she's a chunker.  I still love this playard! I've had to remove and wash fabric on the changing station a couple times now. Very easy to do and fabric has held up fine machine washed and air dried. We did use dream center when she was smaller (16 lbs now!) and she liked it. The fabric is so soft and plush. I've since removed dream center as I was mostly just storing bibs and toys there because baby outgrew it.  Looking forward to using playard as an actual playpen.  For now we will continue to use as changing station and for storing baby stuff. Although my baby is in 97th percentile for weight I feel she is supported very securely during diaper changes.
