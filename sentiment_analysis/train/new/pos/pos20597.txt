There are dozens of dramatic reviews on different versions of the Diaper Dekor refill and system. People are apparently very passionate about diaper pails.I'll keep it simple. Here are the reasons why I kept the Diaper Dekor and tossed the other three systems:1) Simple, straightforward re-fill design. The plastic is one long roll which you tie off as you use it. Super easy and will save you money in the long-run.2) NO STINK. I have used the Diaper Dekor system and these refills for 2 years now and I have never had a problem with stink. I think we need a little common sense-- NO diaper pail will smell fresh if its kept full for days on end and never cleaned out. I empty the pail every 4-5 days (you just tie it off, so you're not wasting liners), and I also run a sanitizing wipe along the inside. That keeps it fresh.3) Price: because of the "tie it off" system, you end up only using as much of the refill roll as you need. Want to empty the pail after a particularly smelly diaper? Fine-- tie off after a couple inches. Leaving it full for many days? No problem-- tie off a few few feet. Its a much less expensive system.I have tried the biodegradable and non-biodegradable versions of the refills. I have not noticed ANY difference in smell/quality between them. I also use biodegradable diapers, so it makes sense to keep everything eco-friendly when I can and I like that Diaper Dekor gives you the option of choosing from green or regular liners.
