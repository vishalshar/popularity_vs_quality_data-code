I just got my seats on Saturday and my boys love them!  I replaced my Britax Frontiers with these and was a little nervous about switching due to not having the 5 point harness. However, both of my boys fit the specifications for height and weight. They are both over 40 inches and one is 34 pounds and one is 37. The seat is cuter even in person. We did get the Paul Frank Zoom Julius. Really not sure it is worth that much extra money but ours were being replaced for us due to someone hitting my van thus voiding warranties on my existing car seats. One of which was an Orbit that was only 3 weeks old, OUCH!  Anyway, my boys were so excited, only problem is my middle daughter (who is 2) wants a monkey seat. She got the Orbit Toddler. I only have latch in my front row, so the other 2 rows just have the shoulder and lap belts, so although I would love to utilize the latch, I have my to youngest latched in the front seat.Pro's:Love the Fabric, Love the bright clean white of the seat sides (hope it stays that way)My boys are excited about getting in their car seats instead of wanting to sit on the seat like their big brother and sister.Con's:PricePossible Con:wondering how the fabric will hold up in to washing in case of  "accidents" or spills.
