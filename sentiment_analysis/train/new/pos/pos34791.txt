I have a new walker, and this ugly thing absolutely prevented her soft little head from all manner of dings and divots.It really is ugly as sin, and smells kind of like new vinyl sheet protectors for the first few days out of the box.  That's a plus for me though - reminds me of high school.The elastic is strong, so I was able to really pull the bejesus out of it to make it fit on my very long coffee table.  Then when I put my foot through the coffee table and replaced it with a smaller table, the elastic rebounded nicely.Seriously though, it's ugly.But you know what's pretty?  My 11 month old kids perfectly round head.
