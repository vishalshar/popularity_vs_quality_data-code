I bought this item for my son and his wife's baby shower. It will go well with their Dr. Seuss themed baby's room. The towel arrived on time and well packaged for a safe delivery. The towel is of good quality, but the price is high. Non themed hooded towels comes in sets of two or three for the same or even less money. I bought other Dr. Seuss bath items to go with the towel, but they were in keeping with similar non themed items.My son and daughter-in-law are happy, and it does looks gorgeous with all the other Dr. Seuss themed items in the baby's room. It is bright, colorful, and beautiful just like our baby will be.
