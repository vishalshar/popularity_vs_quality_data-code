I bought this cover so I could have a backup when my other cover got dirty.  Overall I really like it, and it serves its purpose (plus it has a cute pattern).  The only bad things I'd have to say about it is this:1. The cover is a little tight and it fits but it's hard to get on and I have to stuff the Boppy pillow into it to get it zipped shut (my other Boppy cover fits much better).2. I have two dogs with black hair and I'm constantly finding their dog hair stuck to my pillow and it's hard to get off because it really sticks to the cover for some reason.  My other cover doesn't seem to do this, just this one.
