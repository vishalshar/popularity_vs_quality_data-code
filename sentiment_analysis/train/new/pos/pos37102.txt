This is a must have for any family with multiple cars. Makes going places an easy task. Don't have to worry about the hassle of moving the car seat base between cars. Just have a base in the cars you use, snap the car seat in and be on your way. If you are on a tight budget though (and this thing isn't the cheapest), Britax car seats can be be manually buckled in (in other words, you don't NEED a base). However, the difference is an easy snap versus stringing the seatbelt through the correct holes in the carseat, etc. The extra base saves you a lot of time and ENERGY, which you'll probably be short on, especially with a newborn. Definitely a convenient thing to have though.
