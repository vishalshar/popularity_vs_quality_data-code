My husband and I bought this for our first baby just recently and we absolutely love it. It was very simple to assemble, despite what some of the other comments said. We also ordered a dresser from Stork Craft and that was a little more involved, but as far as the crib is concerned the directions were helpful and it took my husband and I about 45 minutes to put together. It is incredibly sturdy and looks stunning, not cheap at all. I had read a lot of reviews that said people received their crib with missing or damaged pieces, so I was a little leery, but that was not our experience at all. Everything was in great shape and we had every piece needed. Lastly, everywhere I looked online in my research for this crib said that the mattress support was made of MDF particle board, which I was not too thrilled about. However, when it arrived I was shocked and beyond excited to discover it came with a metal spring crib mattress support! I have looked numerous places online and nowhere does it say that the crib support is metal. I'm not sure if the information hasn't been updated since Stork Craft decided to use metal instead of MDF board, but as far as my experience goes, this particular crib is designed with a metal spring support.
