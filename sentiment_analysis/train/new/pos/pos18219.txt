I ordered the gracco playyard sport, the primo playyard and the summer infant. This was by far the best quality. It is smaller than summer infant but locks into place so I'm not concerned with it collapsing on its on or if barely pushed on (like summer infant). Also the canopy comes with it and has a secure for which would keep bugs out and the sun. Also love the door access. My little one is 4 months and it gives her a great safe place to explore. The bars are also all covered unlike summer infant so no worries about bumped heads as she begins learnin to sit and or roll. The bottom is also padded which is one difference in this and the gracco. The gracco is very similar but the floor is not padded and the place to attach the canopy is not covered on gracco as it I as on primo. Also the legs seem to be better quality on primo. I've included pictures of all three for comparison. I think it will be great for daily indoor use as well as trips outside and to the beach.
