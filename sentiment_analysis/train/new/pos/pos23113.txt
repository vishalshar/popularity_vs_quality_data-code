This has been a wonderful bowl.  The suction works great provided you are putting it on a flat, clean surface.  I have found that if the surface is slightly uneven/warped (like the highchair tray cover) or if there is junk on the table (once 1 piece of cooked oatmeal stopped the bowl from sticking), then the suction does not hold.  On the clean table or counter top though, the suction works great and keeps the bowl off the floor and wall!Pros: - Strong suction on the right surface - Spill catcher - works wonderfully with foods like yogurt that drip between the bowl and his mouth - Durable - We've had this bowl for about a year and so far no problemsCons: - Suction does not work when the surface is uneven or if there is some food under the bowl - The spill catcher part of the bowl has a few light stains - Shape of the bowl makes it a little difficult for our son to scoop out yogurt or other thin/runny foods when there is only a small amount of food left in the bowlI have not tried placing this in the microwave or dishwasher, so I am not sure how it stands up under those conditions (or if it is microwave or dishwasher safe)
