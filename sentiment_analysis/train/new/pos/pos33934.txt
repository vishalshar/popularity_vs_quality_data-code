Yay!  No more lost mittens!  The boys will tug on their gloves but it is rare, rare that the clip comes undone. If it does it is because of the tugging and the boys will have the glove in their hand anyway. When the season started the boys lost one pair and one of another pair within the first 2 weeks. It's been over a month and they have used the same pair since I've put these clips on. These are well worth the money.
