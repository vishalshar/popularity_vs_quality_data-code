I don't know why this got so many bad reviews. I had my twin boys in fisher price space saver high chairs for a while. I got a new dining room table that had chairs with cushions on them and wasn't able to securley attach the space saver chairs. I didn't want to spend a ton on new high chairs seeing as how my boys are now 3. Ordered 2 of these, in mahogany (to match my new dining room set) and they arrived in 2 days. One had a crack in the base. No biggie because Amazon's customer service is awesome. I filed for a return and the new chair was sent out right away. UPS picked up the broken chair and all was good.The instructions weren't crystal clear but it's not really rocket science to put the high chair together. The parts can pretty much only go where they're supposed to fit so it was just a matter of matching everything up and screwing it together. Both chairs were together in 20 minutes or so. One chair did have a scratch on part of the base piece but, really, who cares. It still works great and the price can't be beat.I've been using these chairs for a few months and I have no complaints. My 30 pound kids sit in them great and they're plenty sturdy for a high energy toddler. The buckles work perfectly, although I don't really use them anymore because I don't need to.They're really easy to clean too since there's no pads or crevices for food to get stuck in.It's a basic, no frills, resaurant style highchair. And it was shipped right to my front door which saved me from having to drag kids out to stores to find something similar. I really couldn't have asked for something better.I'd buy another one in a heartbeat and I'd recommend these to anyone.
