We bought this stroller because we needed something that folded up smaller than the big stroller. We have owned this stroller for about a year and a half and I will tell you that it is the best stroller that I have ever owned. I get complements all of the time from other people. All of my friends and family members that have kids are wanting to get the stroller or have purchased it. I have nothing bad to say about this stroller. It's sturdy, has the BIG umbrella that keeps the sun out of my daughter's eyes, you can either have just a seat belt or the 5-point harness, and I love the handle bars. I promise if you buy this stroller you will not regret it! It's been one of the best purchases we have made for our child!
