I bought this in spite of reading some less than appealing reviews regarding durability. While my baby is a little young to play with this yet (3 months old) my wife and I love it. I can not speak to the durability regarding wiping it down, but assume if you don't let your child, or yourself, eat or drink over it, there will be little need to actually wipe it down often. As far as the product itself, it is amazing. I love that you can learn different languages while playing with it. I am anxious for my baby to get old enough to use this. One of the reasons we purchased this item was that as soon as he can start talking, until he is several years old, this can be a teaching tool as well as something fun. Toys and teaching tools that can last for years are something we look for often, and this fits the bill perfectly.
