These were perfect for a rustic themed baby shower I threw for my daughter-in-law.  I used them to put in front of the different types of sandwiches and salads so the guests would know what they were.  I didn't use the cards that came with the holders, but instead used business size cards that fit my theme and were larger than the cards that came with the holders.  At the time I ordered them, they only had a couple sets in stock (I would have ordered more if there had been more!).  I think I will order more if they're available now because I'm sure I'll be using them again, probably for place card holders for a dinner party.  I'll post photos on the Amazon website from the baby shower.  So cute!
