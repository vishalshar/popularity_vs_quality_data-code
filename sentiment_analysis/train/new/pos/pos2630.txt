Just the right size for my 4 year old. If I tie the back very very loosely, it completely covers his knees when he's sitting down to eat. Which is what I needed because he's special needs and a very messy eater. I sent one to school, and kept one home. Will be ordering more soon. Maybe their long sleeved ones.
