Wow, I'm blown away by the very negative reviews on these.  For us, they are perfect.  My DD wasn't learning to lift her cup and crane her neck some to drink from "regular" sippy cups.  The only way we found we could transition from bottle drinking while laying on the floor was THESE cups.  She sits in her chair like a big girl now and uses these.2 complaints about lots of leaking?  If you don't get them closed just right?  I've never never had that issue.  The cap screws on it's good as gold for me.  Now if DD drops it from her highchair a bit of water will leak out but I'd expect no less from any other cup.It was said that the straws are a pain to get in and out.  That CAN be true but here's a trick, to get straw out and back in just have the flip tab top HALFWAY closed, not fully open, wiggle the straw for just a second and it will pull up through that hole easy as pie.We bought a 4 pack from Sam's Club for only [.....].  I can't tell you how much MORE I spent on sippy cups before that in buying ones that didn't work for our family.
