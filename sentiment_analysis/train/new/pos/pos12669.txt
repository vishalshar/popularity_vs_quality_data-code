I have been looking for good quality (and cute) GLASS baby bottles & these bottles are all that and then some! Thick glass but not too heavy; reasonable price; cute unisex design; seem much more sanitary than the plastic (drop-in liner style) bottle I was using; silicone collars make the bottles much less likely to break easily. The fact that it comes in a 2-pack, with one 5 oz & one 9 oz, and two different flow nipples--fantastic!! I bought two sets & feel I now have all the bottles I will need for my now 2-month old baby boy. Currently only using the 5 oz bottles & have only one "complaint" (so-to-speak)--the nipples flowed too fast for my baby (he was having to guzzle & choking due to too much milk), so I bought Avent nipples for wide neck bottles (didn't find any Kinetic/BB Jr.) to replace the original nipples, for now. Just save the original nipples for later (when cereal is added). This does not detract from the product, whatsoever. EXCELLENT PRODUCT--I am very happy with this purchase!
