Bought this for our 6 month old to wear to the US Open this year.  The amount of folks that commented on how adorable he looked was hilarious, and he was on TV twice during, we found out afterwards. The mini Payne Stewart style hat is so cute and lightweight.  It worked perfectly for a surprise father's day gift. If theres a golfer in your life with a baby, this is a perfect gift.  Will be a keepsake for sure. Wash 1-2 times before wear for maximum softness.
