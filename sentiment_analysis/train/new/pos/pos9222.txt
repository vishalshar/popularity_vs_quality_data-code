I really don't get all the negative reviews on this product.  It is awesome!!  It's so cheap and a lot better than a blanket type cover to hide your crib, look bulky, and to have to keep washed.  U can't even tell this one is on the crib and it's the perfect teether!  You can wipe it off with anything to clean it. My son loves to teeth on this and it works perfectly on any standard crib.  My crib is wood and u just wipe with alcohol first and it sticks easily.  For the money, u cannot beat this crib rail.
