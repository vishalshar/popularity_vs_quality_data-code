We received Chunky the Death Cat (as Gran calls him in the movie) weeks before we were told to expect him.  I gave a rating of 4 out of 5 stars just because the plush toy is a little expensive, but I am sure that is because of the demand for him.  Chunky is very soft and cuddly, and we are very excited that we now have him in our family (we are The Croods movie fans and stuffed animal fans so it is part of the family).
