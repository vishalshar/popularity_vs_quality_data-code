My daughter in law is planing on nursing my new grandson when he's born, so I thought she might want this cover to help her be a little bit more discreet.  I've seen these a lot on many different sites, so they seem to be in style.  She loves all kinds of animal prints so I thought this would be perfect for her.  When I showed it to her she almost cried.  She just loved it so much.  She had wanted one so badly but couldn't afford one, and didn't get one at her baby shower as she had hoped.  So now she has one and is very happy.  This is very well made and pulls out at the top so the mother can see baby while she is nursing him.  I'm so glad I bought this for her..
