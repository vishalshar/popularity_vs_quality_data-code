I wanted compact and when I opened this package, I immediately thought it was too small, but I was wrong.  For me I wanted it for my 6 yr old's lunch , specifically grapes, and it was just enough - fit more than I expected and leaves more room in his lunch box for other things. The lid allows you to fill the container right to the very top.
