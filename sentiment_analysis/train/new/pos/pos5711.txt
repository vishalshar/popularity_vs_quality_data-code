We were looking for  a carseat/booster for our 3 year old son who had reached the 40 pound weight and 40 inch height mark. We were not comfortable putting him in a regular booster with the car seat belt and were on the lookout for a seat that would meet our needs for a 5 point harness with an extended weight and height limit. We had asked a friend who is a carseat technician and she gave us 2 recommendations that were in our price range. After looking at them both,  we decided to purchase the Sunshine Kids Radian 65 seat. We are very pleased with it and love the fact that the base is fairly narrow (we have 3 kids across the backseat of our Subaru Outback!) and the height provides a good support. The latch hooks are easier than any other latch system we have ever used and installation is a breeze. I love that it has the ability to fold up for easier travel and there is an additional strap you can purchase so you can carry it over your shoulder if carrying it through an airport. This seat is approved for aircraft travel as well and we look forward to giving that a try. It would be nice of that strap was included with the seat instead of having to purchase it additionally. This seat is heavier than any of the seats we have ever used, it feels more substancial and we feel we made the right choice in choosing the Radian 65. Amazon.com offered a very good price and we had this seat less than 24 hours after placing the order! Exceptional products and exceptional prices! Many thanks!
