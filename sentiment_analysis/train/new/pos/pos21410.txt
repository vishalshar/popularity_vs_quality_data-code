I could sit here all day and talk about how amazing Angel Dear products are! My son has had their loveys since he was born. He's now two and still obsessed! I've always only ever bought their loveys but when our dog chewed my sons green froggy up... I decided to try the blanket. He LOVES it. It goes everywhere with us, he sleeps with it and it's so soft to the touch.I can say first hand that their products hold up AMAZINGLY well and I wash his loveys and blankets every single week and there's never any sign of wear!!! ( I've been washing his loveys for two years and they're all in GREAT shape!)My son is very textural and has some sensory issues. He will only use Angel Dear loveys! (I've bought other brands and he doesn't like or want to use/ hold them) I highly recommend this brand specifically to anyone thinking of purchasing a lovey for their own child or as a gift! I also wanted to note the blankets are BIG. My son is 2 years old but over three feet tall (the size of most three year olds) and the blanket wraps around his body and goes to the floor.* The picture below is of my son sleeping with his froggy lovey blanket and trying out / riding in his new wagon he got for his birthday, clutching his froggy lovey blanket!
