We LOVED this cosleeper! Our baby hated sleeping in his bassinet and pack n play, we assume because it's out of arms reach from us. Being on the cautious side, we wanted something to keep him safe in our bed so we invested in the snuggle nest. Well worth the money! Not only did we all sleep better, it makes night nursing SO much easier because baby is so close. As a bonus our little guy likes the music that comes with it. The only cons to it are the light is a very obnoxious color that seems super bright at 2 am, and the music doesn't stay on for very long, and when you turn it back on, your volume settings are lost so it's loud again. But, those problems are not a huge deal to us because it helps our baby sleep more soundly, keeps him close so I sleep better, and nursing ( which is usually a challenge at night) is less of a pain. now we are planning to use it when we go camping this summer if he still fits in it!
