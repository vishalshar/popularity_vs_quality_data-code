I have two young children and have tried and compared a lot of different seats. In the end, the britax marathon wins the award for the "next step" to the infant carrier seats. I think it gives the needed support for a young baby while also being a comfortable seat for an older toddler. I find that this seat offers fantastic safety features that go well beyond many of the comparable seats on the market.For us, this seat did what we wanted (safe, functional, nice looking and comfortable) so we did not feel we needed to pay extra money for some of the additional features that the more expensive (Britax) models have. In fact, I think some of the newer features feel like an over-kill to an already great seat that is superior in safety!The pros of the G4 to older Marathon models- the crotch buckle stays pointed out so you don't have to fish for it underneath your child. This is huge!The cons or limitations-- this seat does sit up a bit higher than some of the comps (Diono, etc.,)  I actually liked this as it feels better suited for babies and toddlers. However, I imagine that a 4-5year old might feel a bit baby-ish in the seat & the nice cushioned wings (although safe) do block the window view a bit. This was actually another reason I felt it wasn't worth paying extra money for the more expensive versions as I think we will probably upgrade to the booster/combo seat around 4 years old.  If you are buying multiple seats for multiple kids and cars, you have to prioritize what is and what isn't important and if It doesn't add needed safety features, comfort or luxery.. I just don't see the point. then it starts to feel like just spending money to spend money.So again.. great seat and the G4 does feel above and beyond others in it's class!
