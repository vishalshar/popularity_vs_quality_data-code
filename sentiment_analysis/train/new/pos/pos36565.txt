Such a great mat for the price. I have had great difficulty in finding a nice simple large playmat for my baby boy. Agreed that the colours are actually brighter than the picture and comes with some simple great attachments for bub to play with. The size is nice and big to accommodate for playtime when my big 4 month old gets older and is decent enough in its cushioning. I have another blanket underneath it to make it softer on our lounge room tiles which is fine with me as the thicker the mat is, would make it bulkier to fold up. Fits nicely in a small zip up bag. Very happy with this purchase!
