My daughter outgrew her Evenflo Exersaucer by the time she was 9 months (22 lbs 14 oz and 29 1/2" tall) and we were freaking out!  Not only did she LOVE her Exersaucer, but it was the perfect place to safely keep her occupied while I ran to pee or made her cereal, etc.  Without it, we only had the Pack 'n' Play to put her in and she would scream and cry if she was in the mood to spin and jump!My mother went in search of something that would hold a taller baby and found this.  My daughter loves it!!  She had to get over the initial shock of not being able to jump in it (one of my ONLY complaints), but now that she understands she can't jump she is enjoying it...especially since she watches the Baby Einstein DVDs and knows the characters!The only other complaint I have is that this is the only version we have found that is made for taller babies.  I would have gladly spent a little more money and purchased one like this with a little more stuff on it (and one in which she could jump).  Then, I would have purchased that one from the get go (she was a big baby at birth so chances were...).  Other than that, it is a wonderful activity center and I highly recommend it.  **Especially if you have a TALL BABY who will grow out of the other activity centers/Exersaucers quicker than the average baby and before he/she is walking!**
