My three-year-old daughter and I could not be more thrilled over this bedding set. My husband and I purchased this for our three-year-old twins for their birthday and they have been excited to go to sleep ever since ! The sheets are soft and a perfect fit for a toddler size bed. The pillowcase is a little big for a toddler sized pillow but it fits a regular size pillow just fine . Yeah the comforter is thin but it is perfect for the summer and fall and I can always dress my kids a little warmer in the winter ( so the the comforter being thin is not a deal breaker). This was a terrific purchase and I am highly satisfied with the product. I definitely would recommend it for your "Minnie mouse fan!"
