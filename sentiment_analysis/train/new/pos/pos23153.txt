Best baby bath!Economical, space saving, easy to use & easy to clean!  I've had all sorts of bathing products, HARD SIDED INFANT TUBS(wet soapy babies are slippery & you can easily bump their head on these), SOFT SIDED BLOW UP TUBS(sounds great but mildew & mold can get in the creases, yuck), THE YELLOW TEDDY BEAR SPONGE(mold & mildew also! plus they retain an insane amount of water, ever smell an old kitchen sponge?, need I say more)The bath sling dries fast & takes up very little space, just hang it over the shower curtain or on a towel bar.  It's also comfy & hammock like.I like this one & also the one by DEX.
