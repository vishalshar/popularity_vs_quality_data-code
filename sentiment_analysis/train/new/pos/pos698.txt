My son, who just turned 4, is obsessed with tractors. It was the one recurring item that came up every time we asked what he would like for his birthday; he even wished for a tractor when tossing a penny into a fountain (little did he know that it was waiting for him in the living room at the time!).My husband had little trouble putting this together (he borrowed a large wooden block for the pounding part) and we have not had any trouble with the adhesivity of the stickers or the functioning of the gas cap. The trailer that goes with this tractor is available here at Amazon, and we ordered it at the same time. Once the toggle that holds it in place was installed, it works very well.My son is average to a bit taller than average for his age, and this tractor fits him well. We prefer a pedal model to an electric one, partly to prevent accidents, and mostly because he needs to work off energy!We are very pleased with this toy, and I know my son will enjoy it for quite a long time.
