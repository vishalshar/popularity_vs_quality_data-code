I am very happy with this monitor.  I love the freedom that it gives me while my baby is sleeping or playing in his crib.Sound:The clarity of the sound is very good.  I can even hear most movements when he is sleeping .  I give it 5 stars from that point of view.Image:The quality of the image is just ok, don't expect HD quality.  Zooming seems to help but it is still not totally clear.  It would not be good enough for a picture but then again I did not  buy this to take pictures.Signal Strength:We have a four room apartment and have never lost the signal.Battery Life:The battery will last around 3 1/2 hours. Anytime the baby is in the same room as I am I just charge it and it seems to work out ok.Overall I  would definitely recommend this monitor.  Comparing notes with my friends who also have newborns this is by far for the best produict in its price range.  Sure you can spend alot more but this does the job just fine.  I would rather take the extra money that a more expensive monitor would cost and put it towards his education.
