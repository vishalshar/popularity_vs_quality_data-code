My 11 month ok daughter had dry lips to the point that the bottom lip started to bleed. I didn't know what to do. I took her to the doctor and he said she was not dehydrated and that it was due to weather. I tried everything and her lips were still so dry! My mom did a little research online and told me about this. I ordered it immediately. Within 24 hours of applying this on my baby's lips her skin was visibly healing. And now 2 weeks later she's back to her old self again. I am one happy mom and will recommend this to everyone I know!
