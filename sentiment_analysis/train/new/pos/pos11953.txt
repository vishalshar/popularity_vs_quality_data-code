I have purchased this several times over the last couple years because my son LOVE it! He plays with it every single day. One finally pooped out because the string stopped pulling and retracting, another got yucky from being chewed on and picking up dirt, and I couldn't get it clean. I am so sad these were discontinued :( If you can get a hold of these I highly recommend them!
