All in all great product. I think we ran into an anomaly. Set up was easy but the cabinet door wasn't turned during the manufacturing process and the door knob is on the same side as the hings. Have not called for replacement piece yet b/c hours are 8-5 ET and I'm PT.The backing of the dresser is the only other drawback. It's two thin pieces of particle board that have to be screwed into the frame, which has no pilot holes. I had some go in a little crooked and broke through the inside of the frame.Very stable and even comes with wall anchors!
