We bought this for our daughter because we had sold a similar bounce after our son was born.  The fabric is VERY nice compared to the fabric on our previously purchased Fisher Price bouncer.  I only have two minor complaints about this product.  I wish it had a 5 pt harness.  It would definitely extend the amount of time it could safely be used for.  I also wish you could do is remove the hanging toys to clean them.  They are permanently attached.  The whole toy bar can be removed, however.Even with these minor complaints, I would buy this bouncer over and over again.
