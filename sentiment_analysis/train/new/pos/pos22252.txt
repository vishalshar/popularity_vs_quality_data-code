I have 2 small children, 4 and 6.  My 6 year old is very inquisitive and quite clever at learning various supposed "child-proof" locks and has figured out every one I have brought home within days.  So I was looking for something a bit harder to maneuver - I would even be ok with having a half difficult time myself, if it would work well.  These work very well for me, you have to push more than one button at the same time to get it to unlatch, so it requires coordination that may not yet be practiced in younger children.  I use it on my refridgerator and freezer, and the kids have not gotten into it since I installed them!  The only drawback, is depending on which direction you install them, the strap piece is a fairly sturdy piece of plastic, that, if facing a certain way, can prevent the fridge from shutting on it's own, I just have to be cognizant and remind the kids (when they can use the fridge) to move the strap out of the way so the door will shut. There is a way to remove the strap completely, however, so that is one way to resolve it;  just attach it back on and lock it for the night! Great product, 2 thumbs up!!
