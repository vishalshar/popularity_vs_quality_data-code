We are very pleased with this booster seat. It is very lightweight and easy to move in and out of the car when needed. My daughter says it is very comfortable. The only thing is that I thought it was going to be red (based on the picture), but it is pink. Other than that, it's a great seat and we will be purchasing another one for my son when he is ready for one.
