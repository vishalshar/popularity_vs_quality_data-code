We have the Chicco keyfit car seat and our little one would scream and cry in the car after a 20 minute ride as her back would be completely soaked, no matter how much air we were pumping out of the AC. We decided to try this out after it was recommended on a discussion board regarding sweaty infants in bucket car seats. We tried it for the first time on a 3.5 hour road trip (I know, risky...), however, it was a lifesaver. She slept the entire drive and was nice and dry when we arrived.
