I bought this for my mom as a Christmas gift.  She has ben suffering with neuropathy pain for years and has been taking narcotics (prescribed through pain managemnt) for years.  I figured if it didn't work at leawst it was pretty.  Well at first she had it on her neck a few days  and hated it so she asked me to help her remove it. I convinced her to let me wrap it around her ankle instead.  She made me put it on her foot that pains her so bad at night that she doesn't sleep withoiut heavy-duty painkillers.... until NOW!  After about 3 days she came to me in shock after she realized that she hadnt taken a painkiller for sleep since putting the necklace on her ankle!  Now I have to buy one for pretty much my whole family (sister gets migraines, dad has gout, etc.)!!!!! If you don't think yours works try wearing it somewhere else.
