I am a teacher and love these puzzles for my son. The puzzles are colorful, simple, and stimulating. Great for hand-eye/fine motor coordination, learning and matching colors, and learning about animals. My son is a year old, and he likes to chew everything in sight, so I wish that they made these in plastic (in addition to the high quality cardboard). My son has a few of the infantino puzzles. I bought one for my cousin's son, and she and her son like it too. Great purchase and not too expensive.
