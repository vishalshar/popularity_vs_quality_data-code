These little brushes are perfect for washing breast pump accessories. I was having such a hard time finding a brush with the right level of fluffiness and glad I took my chances with these. Everything else on the market is made for washing bottles (too big), nipples or straws (too small).My fingers were getting wrecked and ravaged with dryness because I was washing all of the small breast pump parts by hand multiple times a day. These brushes have really saved me. They work so well for the breast pump flanges and various attachments that are needed for my Medela hand pump and Ameda electric pump.I've been using the brushes for a few weeks and they seem really durable. They're coarse enough that I feel like they give a good scrubbing but flexible enough that I don't worry about scratching.I go back and forth on the length of the wand. On one hand I like that it's short because it's easy to maneuver but there are other times ibis it were slightly longer.Ultimately, I'm very happy customer. I'm thinking about ordering a few as backup in case I'm not able to find them in the future. That's how hard it's been for me to find a brush that would work for my needs!
