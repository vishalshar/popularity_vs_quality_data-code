Yes you do occasionally get a false alarm when the diaper is to loose or when baby moves around a lot and the connection is lost. That is what I thought happened one morning when my 4 month old son was sleeping in his bassinet beside my bed and the snuza alarm went off. I sat up and looked at my son and he was not breathing. I rubbed his chest still not breathing so I picked him up in a panic and when I did it shocked him enough to take a breath. I ended up taking him to the ER to be checked out (he was fine). Two days latter when I was holding him (he was a sleep) the alarm went off again. I looked down and he was not breathing, my husband and I rubbed him, lightly shook him and was about to start CPR when he gasped for a breath. We called 911 and went back to the ER for more test ( could not find a cause) he was then put on a medical apnea machine. With out the snuza my son would be dead. I would not have gotten to him in time. It is the most terrifying experience to see your child not breathing and I wish no one to ever have it happen to them.
