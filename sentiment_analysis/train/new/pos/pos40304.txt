We picked these guard rails based on user feedback on amazon. After our daughter was 2 years and 2 months, we swapped out her crib with a full size bed. Initially we only set up the box spring and mattress with these guard rails in her room.  They are very easy to attach and stayed in place securely. Given the age of our daughter she still rolls around the bed just like when she was in the crib. We have even found her lying right up against the rail and it held her in place. Last month we moved the mattress set onto the bed frame, lifting it even higher off the ground. The railings have the ability to collapse when we need to get things like toys/books off the bed. This is one of the key features we love about it.Ease of assembly - very goodsturdiness - excellent
