This product does exactly what I need it to do, get formula from our house to daycare.  The only complaint that I have about it, is that the lid doesn't feel 100% secure.  I've never had it come off and spill anything or mix between compartments, but I just wish that it snapped on better.  Again, it works for what I need it for so I can't complain about that!
