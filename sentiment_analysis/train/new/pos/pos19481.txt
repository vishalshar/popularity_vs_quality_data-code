After receiving an inferior diaper bag from another store, I ordered this one.  Amazon never disappoints.  This is a quality, well made and thought out designed bag.  Tiny metal feet keeps it elevated and standing up. Multiple outside pockets for quick-grab items.  Outside zipper pocket to secure personal items.  Removable zippered purse and diaper changing pad fantastic for travel.  Lined with gingham cloth.
