The transition to a toddler bed went really easy with my daughter.  We told her to stay in her bed until we came to get her, and she did!  Not so with twin boys.  I wasn't ready to transition them, but they were climbing out of their cribs and egging each other on.  I really wanted to avoid a serious injury, so I decided I had no choice even though they were only 26 months.  I ordered these travel beds for a trip, but we have wound up using them every day.The boys get the feel of being "tucked" into a crib in these beds.  I have them on top of the crib mattresses on the toddler beds and they can't wait to get in every night.  It acts like a full size guard rail.My daughter, who is just about 4, was so intrigued I got one for her and she has it on top of her bed as well.  She says "Mommy, my toddler bed is so cozy" all the time.The only downside is that it is a bit annoying to wash.  I took out the padding on the bottom because all of mine are sitting on top of mattress.  That made step one easier.  I have also figured out that if I put the large side of the side pillow on top and pull it through farther than I need to, it is easier to zip up the sides.As far as travel goes, the beds are awesome and so much easier than traveling with pack and plays or travel cribs.  We have both driven and flown with all three of these.  They are easy to check, very lightweight even if bulky.  And they take up room in the car for sure, but we either put them on top of the minivan (with 3 under 3 for the first year, this was a must) or under each kids' feet.  And they are so happy to see their own little beds.  We travel quite a bit so we really appreciate how easy these are compared to the old travel cribs.  I just fold each kids' favorite blanket and stuffed animal inside the bed, zip them up, and go!
