So I read the reviews before I ordered and knew it'd be on the small size. SO BE AWARE that it's a SMALL BAG. But I have a small diaper pail and it fits perfectly. My only complaint is that I only ordered 3 when I should have ordered 4 so I'd have a backup on diaper wash days!It does a great job holding in odors as long as you cinch it tight. I haven't had any problems with leakage or dampness outside the bag. And I use cloth diapers so all kinds of wet and stinky stuff is going in them. They wash and dry well, don't hold odors after being washed, and I haven't noticed any kind of staining or fraying or anything. Super great little bag for the price and what I need it for. I love these bags.
