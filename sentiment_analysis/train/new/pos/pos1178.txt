My 15 month old and I have tried every possible sippy cup out there. The Playtex Insulated Twist -n Click Straw Cup is the only one we use. It's the only one I've found that doesn't leak.After trying any sippy I could get my hands on, my 15 month old transitioned to them easily from his bottle at around 10 months old. Since then, this is the only sippy cup we've used.The cups that I bought way back then, 5 months ago, are just now beginning to wear out. For the past month I have had some trouble with the straw mechanism coming loose inside. I have begun tossing the ones that don't fit snug anymore, as when they come loose the straw is no longer spill proof.There doesn't seem to be any replacement straws out there, as I can only find munchkin replacements. I've contacted Playtex about purchasing some replacement through them, but have not heard back yet. Until then, I just bought another set of these cups and am using those straws instead.UPDATE: 01/20/12I contacted Playtex via their website and expressed an interest in purchasing replacement straws for these wonderful sippy cups. I explained to them the problem I have been having with the valves becoming loose after a few months of use. They shipped me 4 replacement straws via USPS free of charge! If anyone else has had this problem, here's your solution! I'm not going to bother wasting my $$ on another brand's replacement straws now. They assured me if I had any more problems to e-mail them again and they would send me more!
