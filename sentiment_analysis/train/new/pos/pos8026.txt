My laundry room door has a window right next to the deadbolt.  Not very secure.  I got this to mount on the bottom of the door.  If someone did break the glass and open the deadbolt it would be hard for them to figure out why the door wouldn't open.i was a little confused at first on how to put this on but there is a great YouTube Video.NOTE:  This takes a HEX screwdriver NOT a philips.  I wasn't paying attention and learned the hard way when I stripped the long one half way in.  Fortunately my neighbor had a hex bit and was able to remove the screw and then drill it back in.I'm very happy with this and love the security I didn't have before.
