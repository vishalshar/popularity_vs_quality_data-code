These are easy to use and don't have any weird filters that come loose when "someone" throws them on the floor. My son likes to hold them, it's a good price for the number of cups you get, it fits in the cup holder of all his strollers and it's easy for him to handle. Without the "filter" it is a little easier to spill but my son can spill liquids out of anything, so that doesn't really cost this product any points.
