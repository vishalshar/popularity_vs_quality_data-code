While my daughters infant seat was fine in the little back seat of my 2-Door 2002 Pontiac Sunfire, she was approaching the the length limit. Currently a one income family, we cannot afford a new car, so I needed to find a small enough carseat to fit, and preferably in the middle seat. Thank god I found this seat!! It is the best! My daughter is very comfortable in it, and it is fairly easy to get her in and out considering the circumstances. ALSO it's very light weight if you need to travel. I noticed they make a stroller frame for the seat and would probably be a good purchase if you need to bring a stoller and a carseat (ie. flying and then renting a car). Anyhow, I just love this seat. It may not be fancy, but it gets the job done and I prefer it to the saftey first carseat in my husbands car.
