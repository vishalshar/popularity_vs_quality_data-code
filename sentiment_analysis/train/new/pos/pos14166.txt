I live alone so I don't make too much of a mess. I find this mini duster to work just fine on my tile floors to pick up after I sweep. The rubber lip gets mostly everything on the first try. I added a picture to show you how big it is. I can barely Palm a basketball for hand size reference lol. The only reason I took off one star is because I wish the hanging hole was a little bigger so it would fit on the hooks on my mop and broom rack. It pokes out on the rack and is slightly in the way. It will fit on a regular skinny hook or a nail but if you want to hang it on a thicker hook it won't fit right. I imagine that won't be the issue for most people, so if that's the case for you then it's a five star product!
