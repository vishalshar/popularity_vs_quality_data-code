I have had this for about a week now, and it is working wonderfully for us as a fridge lock.  This keeps my 19 month old out of the fridge and is easy enough for my 4 year old to operate since I can trust him in the fridge.  It's also easy enough to open one-handed.  My husband installed it in about a minute, and that included the time it took to clean the door with rubbing alcohol first!  I know some people said that it popped off easily and that they broke it off because they forgot about it, but my husband and I are both strong and haven't managed to do that yet, even when we forget about it!  We did wait 24 hours after adhering it to actually lock it, so that might be what makes the difference.  All in all, I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to others.  Now I can finally make dinner without having to worry about my refrigerator raider!
