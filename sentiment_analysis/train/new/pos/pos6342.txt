When I was first searching for a potty for my son, I was overwhelmed by all the options out there and decided to read other people's reviews on them. I came across this one and I just knew it was going to be the one for my son. The splash guard, which can easily pop on and off to clean, is awesome! It has the perfect contour and comes clean very easily. It seems to be very comfortable for him. I like how easy it is to use the handle and just lift it up and out to clean it. That is literally the only place urine ends up for us: exactly where it should be! I purchased this potty in July (he was 2 years & 1 month at the time) and now, 6 months later he is completely out of diapers during the daytime and loves to use this potty. He claps his hands and screams "yay!" every time. I love this particular potty so much that I am currently waiting on the Prince Lionheart weePOD (which looks the same, just goes directly on the potty instead) in the mail to transition him to the big boy potty. Awesome design and I highly recommend it!
