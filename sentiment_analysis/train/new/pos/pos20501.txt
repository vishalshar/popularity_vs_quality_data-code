I don't understand the negative reviews either. I have tried every one of the major brands of straw cup now and this, so far, is the only one that doesn't erupt milk from the straw when the cup is just sitting on the table. I have cleaned up countless milk messes with the others. Open the straw cover and the cup erupts milk. Sit the cup on the table with the cover open and come back 10 minutes later to a pool of milk on the table. Don't close the cover at all, ever, and still milk erupts. Put cup in bag and open bag later to find a milk mess. We just haven't had any of those problems with this cup so far. I was ready to give up on straw cups. My only complaint with this cup so far is that my daughter dropped the cup from about 3 feet, trying to get it off the counter and the cup cracked. This was a brand new cup on the first use! The other cup is still going strong 2 months later, though, and has experienced the same type of falls, so perhaps the other one breaking was just a fluke. I'm about to buy 2 more. My 19-month old has had no problem sucking through the straw, so I can't comment on how hard it is to get milk out.
