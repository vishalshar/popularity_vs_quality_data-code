I use this every time I go grocery shopping with my daughter. It seems very comfortable for her and I like that it fits a Target cart which is wider than a standard grocery cart.A few things I don't like:- The straps are not attached to the backing of the cover. I had read about this ahead of time in a review and that person had said they just put a few stitches in to fix the problem. I did the same thing and it did the trick. However, I really feel like Carter's should address this problem as you don't want your baby/toddler flopping all over the cart or being able to lean too far forward.- I wish that the cart cover was large enough to fit on BJ's/Costco carts. A little additional elastic would go a long way.
