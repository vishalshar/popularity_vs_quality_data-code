I've never tried the medela version of this adapter, so I can't compare. I purchased this one because it's obviously much cheaper and had good reviews. I work a very busy job and wanted to use it for times that I'm commuting between sites, or on road trips. I've just started using it recently, but it seems to work great. I didn't notice a difference in the amount I was able to pump, and it was not significantly slower than when plugged into the wall. I did notice it didn't have the same degree of suction, so I had to up the settings a little bit. It also makes a slightly different noise and I think pumps at a slightly different frequency, but this didn't affect the function at all. Breastfeeding supplies can get expensive; this is definitely one place where you can save a little money and get this cheaper one!
