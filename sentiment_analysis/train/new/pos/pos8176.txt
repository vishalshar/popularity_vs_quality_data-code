I actually have a Britax B Ready stroller, not the Uppababy Vista.  Britax doesn't make a snack tray.  The seat size and belly bar mechanism on the Vista and B-Ready are so similar that I thought I'd give this a try.  Works brilliantly!  Fits perfectly into where you would attach the belly bar. There is a button on the part of the stroller the belly bar attaches to that you push to release the tray.  The tray is a little high (on my 1 1/2 year old the tray is closer to chest height), but works great.  Like the older model vistas, probably should only use in the upright position (position 1).  May be okay in position 2, but definitely wouldn't work when fully reclined (position 3).Regarding the holder in general, I love how easy it is to snap out of its frame and clean the tray after each use.  So simple! Also easy to swing one side out to load your child.Note:  The instructions do say this is only sold for Vista models, so this is not an intended use.
