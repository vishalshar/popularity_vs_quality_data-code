We got this gate to use between the living room and dining room of our apartment, which is a 58" span. We rent, and therefore needed a pressure mounted gate to fit the span -- drilling into the door frame was not an option. This gate seems to do the trick. Without locking it, the door is easily opened with one hand; with the lock it's a little harder to do so but still possible with some practice. My son has just started pulling himself up to standing a few weeks ago, and now can walk laterally using the gate as support. Thus far the gate is staying put despite his best attempts. We'll see if it holds up as he gets stronger and more determined.UPDATE: Yesterday, my son (now 11 months and starting to walk) demonstrated he can open the latch quite adeptly when it is not locked. With the lock engaged, he tries and tries, but ends up mad instead. So the lock may be sometimes hard to operate but it is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY with an older child. The pressure mounting has held despite his best efforts (he likes to hang from the top of the gate and try to scale it). The gate does move incrementally over time, so we've had to adjust it once or twice, but that's to be expected from a pressure mount.He has managed to get his foot stuck once or twice between the bars where they curve slightly near the bottom. Getting stuck just got him mad but not at all hurt. Still a 5 star gate!
