I haven't had any problems w/ this changing table.  I saw no reason to spend a lot of money for a changing table, but I wanted something durable.  Yes, the shelves won't hold the Encyclopedia Britannica set, but it holds my supplies nicely  (I keep stuff in baskets for organizational purposes).  I have used this for over 2 years w/ no screws loosening or other issues.  I have never used the belt that comes w/ it, so I can't speak to that.  I did purchase padded changing pad covers to make that part more comfortable for my son.
