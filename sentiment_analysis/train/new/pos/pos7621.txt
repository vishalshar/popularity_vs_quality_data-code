i disagree with the reviews here on Amazon, i got this swing as a shower gift and at first my baby did not like it at all-he just wanted to be held. now he LOVES it. he sleeps in it everyday, he naps very infrequently but when he is in this take a long swing he is comfortable and cozy. this  swing is still sturdy and running like a top. we have to change the batteries approx every 2.5-3wks due to the use of this wonderful invention. i guess not every one of them is made exactly the same but ours is GREAT!! i would suggest to everyone to at least try this swing it is convienient and handy!!
