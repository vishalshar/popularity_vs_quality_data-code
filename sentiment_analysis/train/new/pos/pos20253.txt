Love my ergo!!! I actually had 2, gave one to my sister because I felt she needed one and decided I needed a 2nd one for myself and got this one. Lol! I love how compact this one is compared to the original. If you love the canvas feeling material from the original and want to keep that feel than don't get this, this is sleek and smooth material....more like a poncho. I enjoy both the materials.
