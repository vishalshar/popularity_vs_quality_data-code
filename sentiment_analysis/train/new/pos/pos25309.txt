I love this product! They are easy to clean, can be steam serilized in the microwave (not all baby bowls/dishes can go into the microwave), and the food can be thawed/reheated in the microwave.As another reviewer mentioned, I did have one that popped open when I put it in the freezer, but that was because I filled it too full. Just fill it to the max line and you will be fine. I also like that these cubes (when filled properly) don't leave the food freezer burned. I'm not sure if that's a problem with the ice cube trays, but that was one of the reasons why I wanted to try these. And I haven't been disappointed!This two ounce size is great for my twins. I also love that there is a measuring line on them so I can divide the food evenly between the twins to make sure both are getting their fair share! I believe there are also smaller 1oz cubes you can buy, but the 2oz size seems to be the perfect amount after your baby has been introduced to solids and starts wanting more than just a taste of food. For me, I pull out 2 or 3 of the 2oz cubes and can easily get the twins meals ready in just a few minutes.Instead of writing on these with a dry erase marker, I just put a small round sticker on the front of the tray with the food and date, and it works great for me. The trays allow me to stay organized so it's easy to know how much of a particular kind of food is left... so I know when to make more!I originally only bought 2 trays to test them out and see how they worked. I loved them so much that I've ordered another 2 trays and may be back for more!
