I have tried several different brands of nursing pads including lansinoh and medela.  These are my favorite!  They are soft and very absorbent.  They do not smell bad, like some other brands do, when you leak into them.  They come wrapped in a pair, and they do not have the sticky things on the back.  The back side is sort of textured to help it to stay in place without sliding around inside your bra.  They stay in place well, and I have not had any problems with bunching.  They are not contoured right out of the package as advertised, but they do conform to your body very quickly and easily once put into your bra.  They are not visible under clothing once they have been on for a few minutes.  Just don't put on a fresh pair right before you walk out the door.  Put them on about 15-30 minutes prior, and you'll be fine.  I work long shifts, sometimes without the chance to pump for many hours.  I have leaked A LOT into these pads, and they hold up very well!  The last thing I need to worry about at work is if I will have wet spots on my scrub top!
