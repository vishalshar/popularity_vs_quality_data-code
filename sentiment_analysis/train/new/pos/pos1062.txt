These are my favorite sippy cups because they are easy to clean, don't have a million parts and they don't leak.  and what makes them even better is that you can buy these replacement pieces when yours go down the sink and you don't realize and and you turn on the disposal or they just disappear in the dishwasher.  I'm sure that never happens to anyone else but seriously stop messing around with the expensive 10 sippy cups and just get these.  I feel like the luves commercial. "live and learn and then get these"  3 kids later and I have finally figured this out.
