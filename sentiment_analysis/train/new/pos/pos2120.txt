I purchased several tadpoles green gingham crib bedding items: crib skirt, fitted sheets, bumper & diaper stacker.  I did not pay close attention to the item descriptions however and failed to distinguish between the Tadpoles Classic Gingham and Tadpoles Basic Gingham.  The two are not the exact same color.  While they are both green gingham the Tadpoles Classic is distinctly more yellow-ish and the Tadpoles Basic is definitely more of a bright green.  The set however is very cute and simple.  Looking forward to using it in my daughter/son's room.
