The cup holder came in a box with 2 other pieces. Those pieces are for attaching it to the Xplory stroller. The Crusi (Stokke's double model) already has the fitted groove in the handle bar. All you have to do is slide it down into place until it clicks and you're set.If you have the Xplory, then you have to follow 7 steps illustrated in the instruction booklet. These are for the attachment pieces included in the box. No tools required except when you have to remove it. I believe a flathead screwdriver is needed to "pry" open a certain part of the casing.It is a sturdy, large upholder with prongs inside to hold smaller containers. I took off a star because of its location. I have the Crusi, which has the cup holder groove located directly in front of the button to adjust the handlebar. It also juts out towards the person pushing the stroller. It stick out so I have to always be careful when placing the folded stroller in the trunk, so as not to damage it.
