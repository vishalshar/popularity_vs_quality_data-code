Perfect for busy trips I can just wear it on my wrist and give it to my little girl say when she's trying to chew on the buggy or whatever nasty thing lol and I forgot to bring a toy. Also looks cute, I got the white color that can match with anything I wear. Things do stick to it easily like hair or whatever because of it's rubber-like feel. But you can just wash it so I'm overall happy with it.
