Pros:-Sturdy plastic (a bit sturdier than take and toss cups)-Hard plastic tops means kids can't chew the spout and deform it-Nice size-Cute design-Fully interchangeable with each other-Easy to wash without extra pieces, machine washableCons:-Can be hard to catch the threads right to screw the top on-Even when the top is screwed on correctly, a drop or a good squeeze can pop the top and the milk goes everywhere-Leaks, doesn't have a spout-cover like some other brands, so don't throw one in your bagOverall: would recommend for home use, perhaps at the dinner table.
