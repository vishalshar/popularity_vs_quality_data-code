These filters are exactly the same as the one that came with the American Red Cross humidifier.  The only down side is that they aren't always available.  Originally got my filters at Target, then when they were no longer available, I turned to Amazon.  They've had them for awhile, then went to order more last month and it said they aren't available and don't know if they ever will be.  Very disappointed that I will have to keep searching for these filters.
