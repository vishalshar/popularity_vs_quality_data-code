Bought these to replace the smaller sized cups in this style. The cups will leak, just like any cup. I only found them to leak once they got older and maybe the seal was just wearing down. Also, when my toddler would slam the cup it leaked as well. Then eventually it would leak whenever it wasn't standing right side up and left a mess on carpets and the couch (my son loves to hide this cup and let it leak on everything if I don't pay close attention to where it is going at all times).We decided it was time to replace the old, smaller, leaky cup we had. We have had this cup for maybe a month and my son seems to enjoy it. He drinks a lot more during they day and seems to enjoy having this larger cup. The seals are doing great so far and no leaking problems yet. My friend recommended this product to me over a year ago because her kids loved it. My son tried theirs (took her kids drink and wouldn't give it back) and absolutely loved it. Decided to buy one that same day and now we are repeat shoppers!
