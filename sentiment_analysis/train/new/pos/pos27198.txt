I got this for my son when his pet bunny passed away so "Sam" would always be with him. He loves it n sleeps with it every night. It's been through the wash many times n still is in one piece. The only thing is it's not a little blanket, unless ur child is the size of a Barbie doll I took a picture of it next to a standard roll of toilet paper so u can see the size ratio. But it's a good product n holds up well through years of snuggling n washing. I would buy it again if my son ever lost or misplaces it.
