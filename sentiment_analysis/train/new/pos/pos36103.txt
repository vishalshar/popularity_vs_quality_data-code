After using the Peanut for the last month, I thought I better write a review.  My wife and I got this for our first kid and at first were a little leery because of the cost.  Since then it's been a life saver.  We have a 4 week old boy and not having to strip down and clean a changing cover at 4am when he pees all over is priceless.  To all other dads or soon to be dads out there, do yourself a favor and get this product.  The first time you sleepily wonder 'why is my shirt getting wet and warm...?' you'll be glad clean up involves a paper towel or rag, not a trip downstairs to the washing machine.  My wife is making me clarify that if you get peed on you should indeed make a trip to the washing machine to clean your clothes, all I meant was you didn't need to wash the lining to a changing table.
