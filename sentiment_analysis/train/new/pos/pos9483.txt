Got this for my two year old daughter for her birthday and I just love it. Great price and it is super cute. Because of all the colors used in the blanket, you could use almost any color to decorate the child's room too. The blanket is the perfect weight so my daughter doesn't sweat at night, but is never cold either, and it's super easy to wash. I would reccomend this to everyone, and my daughter loves it too (she counts the butterflies:).And I have washed it over 20 times since buying it and the colors are still bright and in perfect condition, just like it's brand new. It did not get "bunched up" for me at all.
