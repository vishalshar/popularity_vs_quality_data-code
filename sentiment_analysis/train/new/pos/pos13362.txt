My daughter and son-in-law chose this crib and are thrilled with the end result. It is beautiful, sturdy, and really nice quality!We worked with Bill at CarefreeKidz. He was great about communicating. There was an issue with getting it from the manufacturer and shipping it cross country. Bill called my daughter weekly letting her know the status of the crib. Ultimately it took about 8 weeks rather than the anticipated 2 weeks for it to be delivered. When it was delivered there was a dent from shipping. We spoke to Bill and he gave us options of a financial discount or to have a new headboard shipped. We appreciate him taking care of us after all the trouble we had been through with shipping process.Ultimately we are thrilled with the product and understand that Carefreekidz did the best they could in the situation they were presented with from the manufacturer.
