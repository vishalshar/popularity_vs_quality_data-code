I use this thing all the time, and not just for feeding my kid.  The toys on the seat are genius!  My child is 8 months, so sitting still even to eat is a chore for him.  But having a washable insert tray means that I can distract him with toys while I prep his food (or dinner for that matter).  He's up and not on the floor and feels like he's part of the conversation and what I'm doing.  When I'm feeding him, if he's being particularly wiggly I just pop in the toy tray and he is distracted enough to continue eating versus trying to escape... I have a very active little boy.  It's all dishwasher safe as well, which makes for easy and quick cleaning.  I can see this growing with him too, as he can use the booster and sit at the table as he gets older.
