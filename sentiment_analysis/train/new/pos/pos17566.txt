We just got this, but my baby seems to love it already! I love that each of the rings is a separate toy...flower crinkles, mirror, ring with adorable chicken bead, fish rattle, and a teether. Even the base makes squeaky sounds when shaken...although you have to shake it pretty hard...so my 6 month old can't do it yet. It seems well made, and the colours are beautiful! But I have an issue with the packaging. This toy came with tons of little plastic tag connectors attaching it to the box and the rings to the base. And they left little puncture holes all over the base. This isn't a fault of the toy of course, just a beef I have with manufacturers putting excessive packaging on everything these days!Anyway, the toy is great! One of the rings seems a bit tight on the base (the one with the mirror) but the rest are loose and stack easily. I'm sure my baby won't be using it as a stacking toy for a while...but it is a nice way to store the thing when not in use!
