It totally solves the filthy highchair but lazy mom doesn't want to carry a portable seat dilemma. It fits in most restaurant's high chairs - those traditional ones like shown in the picture.Pros: lightweight, affordable, easy to wash, covers up all the areas baby would touch on the chair, easily folds back in a pocket so i don't need another thing to contain it.Cons: the only thing is the holes for safety buckles are kinda small, hard to fit through. But my son is 9 months old and sits up very well so I just fit through the holes for the feet. No big deal.This one doesn't have any padding. Just down simple and serves its purpose. I cannot go to a restaurant without this so I highly recommend to people.
