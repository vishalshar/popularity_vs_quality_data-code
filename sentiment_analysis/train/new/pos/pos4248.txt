As a mom myself, I cannot believe it took me about 4 years with my own children to find this! I wish I had one myself! We bought this for my cousin's baby shower, and it is awesome. Not only is it gorgeous, it is very nice quality, has a nice cordouroy interior, and tons of room for 'stuff'! It also has the option for 3 different strap lengths - wristlet, short purse strap or shoulder bag, which is so clever. I packed it with travel wipes, desitin, diapers, and a few small items for mom. My cousin's sister is also pregnant, but having her second child. Since she won't be having a 'baby shower' this time, my mom and I are ordering this for her, as well. The only thing I'd say is I wish it came in more colors/patterns. I know there are a couple, but they are more expensive than this one, and I think $45 is a bit much.
