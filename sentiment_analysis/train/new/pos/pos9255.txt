Item shipped quickly and arrived without issue. The seller emailed me afterwards to ensure I had no problems.The item itself works as expected and explained. Like those below, my banister is too large, and I only ended up using one of the three brackets. I fell into this trap because I was unable to properly picture in my mind how the whole setup would work.In the end, I had to drill holes in the top and bottom of my banister and secure the "latch" piece of the baby gate with screws.But there were no problems whatsoever with the seller or delivery of the product!
