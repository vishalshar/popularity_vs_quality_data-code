I have three kids, 8 years, 3 years and six months. I have found that you never know what they will enjoy chewing on. It has been different for each kid. I have gotten my kids teething toys that I thought they would love and they didn't care for it, then again I've had a random family hand-me-down toy, that didn't look that interesting to me, and they have loved it.The Sassy Teething Tail fish is a good teething toy - but your baby may love or hate it. In my experience it is best to get a few different styles of teething toys to figure out what your baby likes. This teething ring is sturdy, has bright colors, is easy for little hands to grab, has several textures to chew on, has squishy and hard parts to gum.My son happens to like it, it isn't his most favorite, but I keep it in the mix so he doesn't get bored. Only he knows what is going to feel good to chew on at any given time to releive the pain of emeging teeth.Also check out the Teething Bling Donut Shaped Pendant Teething Necklace. I wish I had it for my first two kids, my baby LOVES it.Another type of ring that is usually popular for babies is the classic ring shaped water filled one with baby mouth sized bumps they can put in their mouths.
