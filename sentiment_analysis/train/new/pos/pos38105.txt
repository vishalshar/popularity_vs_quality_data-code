I was a little hesitant with buying this item because of the smell that everyone is talking about. Mine had a slight odor but it didn't last more than a couple baths and once it was covered in water you couldn't smell it during the bath.I like to try things out for a while before reviewing them. So, I bought this 9 months ago. It is cute but doesn't fill the entire tub I wish it was 6 to 8 inches longer. For a longer bath mat check out the Disney Frozen Bath Tub Shower Mat Slip Resistant Elsa & Anna which wasn't out when I purchased mine.As for people having trouble not getting this to stick to the bottom of the tub I have this problem as well on occasion. I realize that I can't just push down on the mat with my hands, it isn't good enough. So, this is what I do:I plug the tub and get 2/3 of the bottom just ever so slightly filled with water. Then I take the mat and set it down in the tub (the water should be just past the entire mat on the far side from the drain) and pull the plug to drain the water. As the water is draining i walk from the back of the tub to the front over the mat and all suction cups pushing the water toward the drain, esp paying attention to pressing down on all the sides. Yes, my feet get wet but my 14 month old is not having to deal with the floating mat. I can do that for her.I also take the mat out of the tub and wash it off after each bath, hanging it to dry on the side of the bathtub wall with the suctions. (This suctioning I do with my hands as walking up the side wall would be terribly difficult.) The suctions on the mat have withstood my suctioning and unsuctioning at each bath time.I would recommend this product.
