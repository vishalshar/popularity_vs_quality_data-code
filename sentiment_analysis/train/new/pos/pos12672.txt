The main reason we bought this product was for freezing  baby food for our daughter but eventually we found out that we can freeze food leftovers, chickenstocks , make ice creams and many other food products. I saw these types of products online before but they always seemed too expensive. The advantage of this particular one is that it's cheaper but works well. The material is  easy and safe to use and the frozen food pops right out. Very satisfied customer.  I recommend it to everyone.
