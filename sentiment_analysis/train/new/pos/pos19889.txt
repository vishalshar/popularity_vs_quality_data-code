My son loves, loves, loves this seat. He couldn't wait to jump in (to my shear happiness!) ... Mealtime has become less of struggle now that the high-chair has gone the way of all flesh!  lolHe carries this around, watches his Blues Clues in it (it's his "thinking chair"). It's light and portable enough to bring to restaurants and when visiting! Doesn't damage furniture, and sticks very well to any non-fabric surface. No sliding folks! Just a super-fantastic seat!
