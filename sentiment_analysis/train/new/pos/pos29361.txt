I needed to find a nice warm hat and some nice warm mittens for my 14-month-old daughter, and knew I wanted to find something very soft for her sensitive skin, and something really cute. This set definitely fits the bill! The hat is just adorable on her, and fits perfectly. I can tell it's comfortable, because she didn't try to take it off. The mittens fit well, too, and they're all one piece, (no separation even for the thumb) which is nice, and makes them very easy to put on her little hands. She waved her hands around, and the mittens didn't fall off. This is a great set! Highly recommended!
