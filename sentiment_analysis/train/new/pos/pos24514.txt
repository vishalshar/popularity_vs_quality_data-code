I first bought some Kidco brand door knob covers but they were too small for our door knobs.  It seems our door knobs are a little on the large side.  The Dream Baby brand however works just fine for our door knobs.  I dislike that the description gives no idea how big the covers are so you are blindly assuming they'll fit your door knobs.  But it seems there are smaller and bigger door knobs out there.  If you have smaller door knobs then I'd recommend the Kidco brand since they were too small for us.
