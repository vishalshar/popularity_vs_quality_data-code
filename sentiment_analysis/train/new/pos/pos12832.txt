Absolutely adorable! Paired it with a long sleeve white bodysuit and jeans. Got tons of compliments.  Too cute to use as a food bib I didn't want to get it dirty though - was more like an outfit!  I did only get to use it like once or twice though. Seemed to shrink a little in the wash and my son is bigger (22 1/2 lbs at 10 months old) and it no longer fits him.
