Upon first sight, I was disappointed at how small they are. I was wrong. Proportionally, they are just right for my angrily teething 6 month old. I love how they insert like nipples into the handles. I give extra thanks that the lid actually has feet on it so it can stand upright.One warning. If there's squish inside and it gets pushed back toward the handle, DO NOT try to sling it down toward the end. It WILL come flying out of the holes.
