Great little protector for plugs. I actually got this to prevent myself from kicking out the plug under my desk, as my feet sometimes tough it. So wanted to make sure I did not shut down my computer accidentially!Took off the old wall plate and put the new one on. Simple. Then plugged the cable in, placed the clear lid back on (which was simple - just squeezing the sides to pop it into its slots) and the cable came out the side perfectly.Another great thing about this is that you do not notice it - its clear and does not take away from the clean look you want to keep. And I've bumped it a few times with my feet and its held steady and I could feel the solidity of the plastic not giving way. So I got peace of mind and protection!
