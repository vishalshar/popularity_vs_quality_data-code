I've had many humidifiers in my life and they always ended up smelling musty and moldy after very little time no matter how often or how well I cleaned them.  This is the first humidifier I've ever used that does.not.smell.  I have 3 of them, one in each kids' room, and they are simple to use and they work.  They don't leak, they don't mist, they don't get moldy or smell.  The filters last quite a while (I get 3-4 weeks out of them) and are relatively inexpensive when purchased in bulk.  They are a breeze to clean and very easy to fill.  They could be quieter, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  But honestly I like that they aren't, because I use them in my kids' rooms and they are a wonderful white noise to block out all the other household sounds.  I would absolutely buy this humidifier again.  I'm tempted to stock up on them in case they ever stop making them!
