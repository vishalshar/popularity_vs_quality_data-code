I have tried many, many different combinations of liners and shells and have finally decided that the very best is two gdiaper liners with this kind of shell. My son's diaper never leaks when I use this shell with two of those liners, and they're not particularly bulky either. I gave this four starts because the snaps are a little annoying to do when you have a wiggly baby as opposed to the velcro, though I got these because the velcro stops working after years of use (though I've found a fix for this). Another great thing about these is that they fit my daughter from the time she was about a month and a half old (though she was a big baby) until she was potty trained. Overall I think these and the Bummis diaper covers with velcro are the best covers out there.
