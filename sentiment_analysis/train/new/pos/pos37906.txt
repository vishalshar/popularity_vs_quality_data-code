This sleeper allows us to safely bedshare with our daughter. The height (approximately 11") prevents us from rolling over onto her, the metal legs keep it stable and level, and the mesh sides allow her to breathe even though she likes to sleep with her face pressed against the side of her bassinet. The shape of the legs, with their flared bottom, prevents blankets from bunching up around the sleeper and blocking airflow through the mesh. It's light and it folds and unfolds easily, so it's convenient for travel. It would be nice if it shipped with an extra sheet for the mattress so that we can keep a clean, dry one at the ready.
