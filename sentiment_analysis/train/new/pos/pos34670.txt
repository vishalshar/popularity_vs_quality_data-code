My baby loves her Owly so much that I had to buy a second, and then a third, just in case! I don't even want to think what I might have to do if all three owlies need to go in the wash at the same time... Luckily they wash up fine!Absolutely a fantastic lovey for any kiddo, lots of bright, but not garish, colors, textures, plus super soft on one side, silky on the other. Keeps her busy when she's awake, very snuggly for when she's sleeping, and very soothing and comforting for car rides, doctor's visits, long stroller walks, etc.She has been sleeping with her Owly every nap and nighttime since she was 2 months old, and she just turned 1, and her face just lights up in the biggest grin as soon as she sees her Owly. I can definitely say that Taggies make great lovies and cute, engaging toys, and if your kiddo likes owls or you're doing an owl-themed nursery, this is the lovey to get! Just be sure to get a few spares ;)
