I bought this for my newborn niece along with the First Years Breast Pump and Newborn Bottle Kit. I tested it out in our microwave and it looks like its working! It comes pretty much ready to use. I put in some bottles, pump pieces, etc. with 7oz of water set my microwave to 4 minutes and presto! I am not sure if I am draining the excess water right though. So far I've been removing the whole sterilizer from the microwave and tipping it over the sink to let the excess water fall through the space between the base and the lid. I feel like if I open it to drain the water all the pieces will fall out and the steam will burn someone. The momma and grandma love it because it's so easy to use.
