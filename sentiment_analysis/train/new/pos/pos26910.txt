The first thing I want to point out is the dimensions of this product. See, I was slightly confused since this mattress is the one they advertise to go with the crib that I bought The Dream on Me 3in 1 Aden Convertible Mini Crib. This mattress is advertised as being 38 x 24 x 3 inches. Now when I got the crib it stated not to be used with a mattress exceeding 2 inches in thickness. Soooo.... I measured the mattress TWICE (to be sure) I came up with 37 x 24 x 2 inches. This is good since these measurements meet the crib specifications but it did cause some confusion. Now on to the mattress. Before purchasing this I read a few reviews complaining how hard it is. WEEELLL.......It is advertised as EXTRA FIRM. It is NOT "hard as a rock" as some other reviewers have stated. You also need to keep in mind that firmer mattresses are recommended for infants to prevent SIDS. Also, you can't predict what your baby will and won't like. Just because you don't like the firmness doesn't mean your baby won't. The mattress is firm. But I believe that was the whole point in it being extra firm. I haven't used the mattress yet as my due date is 7 weeks away. However I spent quite some time squeezing it and letting my 18 month old walk on it. So far I am very pleased. I give this a product 4 stars for the confusing product dimensions and because it probably could stand to be just a tiny bit softer but honestly the firmness doesn't bother ME but I can see why it might bother others though I still think some of the reviews I've read are quite an exageration.
