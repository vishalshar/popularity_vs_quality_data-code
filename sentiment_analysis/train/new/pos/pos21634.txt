My daughter is always losing her paci in the middle of the night, and at 3am, I'm hesitant to turn on lights to hunt for it in the crib. Attaching the paci to this makes it 100000 times easier to find. Often, my daughter will find it herself and put herself back to sleep before I am even out of bed.Totally machine washable as well.I would definitely recommend these to other moms. It would make a great baby shower gift, too.
