It's too bad that I was unable to find a valance locally, but this valance looked cute and works very well in my kitchen.  I needed 2 (have 2 windows), but Amazon only had one, so I went to =Overstock and paid more for the 2nd one but it's worth it.  They are a nice valance that is cotton and once ironed looks great!  I only wish Amazon would quit sending me suggestions for a baby's room since this is under a baby company that produced it.Very happy with this valance and would buy it again.  Cute design :0)Disappointed with Amazon's turn around time before it was even shipped.  Once shipped it was as expected.
