We used this to gate-check a carseat when traveling with our twins (works for both infant carriers and convertible carseats).  My only beef is that the material is somewhat stiff.  I'd like it if it folded/collapsed more easily when not in use, but perhaps that will come as it gets used more.  Otherwise, it's great to have a sturdy bag to put the carseat in, for regular checked baggage or gate-checking.  You never know what kind of abuse it will get put through, and who wants to have their child's carseat ripped, stained, or otherwise trashed?  This keeps it safe and clean.
