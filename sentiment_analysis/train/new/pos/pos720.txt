This product helps me greatly with balance.  I feel much more secure getting out of the tub.  I also have a smaller one, but did not feel as steady with it.  I was excited to find this taller one.  I had not seen it anywhere else.  I gave it just four stars only because it will not support weight and is a little wobbly with being top heavy.  But I knew this when I ordered it.  I am pleased with it.  It fastens to the tub well as long as you make sure you have enough space for it.
