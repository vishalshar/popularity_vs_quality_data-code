This chair is versatile enough that both my 5 year old and 1 year old can sit comfortably in it. It is very light weight, easily cleaned and matches our furniture perfectly. My kids love it so much, I am debating buying another one so that both of my smaller ones can have their own! It is too small for my 8 year old though, so if your child is between 10 months and 6 years of age, this will be prefect for them!
