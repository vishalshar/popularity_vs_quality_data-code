I have not tried other types, so this is a lot better than nothing.  It fits well and folds up with the stroller no problem.  The cup holders really only fit bottled water (maybe soda cans I haven't tried that).  The inner pouch is deep and breathes which is great, but with the bag pulled across the handle bars, it is not as accessible as I would like because of the velcro.  That may be because I typically have my hands and arms full with kids and their things.  It's really a great addition to the stroller, I just gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems like it could be designed better.  Also it arrived quickly!
