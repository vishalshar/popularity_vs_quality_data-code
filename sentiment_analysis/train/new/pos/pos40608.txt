We live in a hilly neighborhood and my husband wanted a tether for our stroller in case he ever tripped or otherwise fell while walking our baby.  We use this as a strap that attaches to the stroller and to our wrist when we are out walking in the stroller (not attached to the baby, indicated in the picture.)  The other "jogging tethers" sold on Amazon seem to have mixed reviews (too short, wrist part too small, etc.), so we got this instead.  This works perfectly and gives my husband some peace of mind that our stroller won't go rolling off into traffic.  Good product.
