I'm a graduate student and I do computational work in my research. I bought this duck to help me debug my code and entertain me during the lonely hours I spend in the office. Because let's face it, I will never get a decent job to find a spouse and have children who'd care about a rubber duck.The main function of this duck was to sit on my desk and get talked to, which it did splendidly. Whenever I noticed my code failed to run as I expected, after throwing an assortment of puzzling errors, I sit this duck in front of me and go over every line of code. I feel like it has that sturdy rubber build to brave all logical errors in the code. It is the friendly face I can count on against those dreaded "segfault"s.I was also pleasantly surprised by its effect on people, who on rare occasions, stumble into my office looking for someone else. It is a *great* conversation starter with strangers. It really adds that warm, human touch to my otherwise introverted persona. I believe its bright colors (it's yellow) and friendly smile contribute to this. It is also a level headed companion. I think there's some sort of a metal weight on the bottom interior to keep the duck down to earth and grounded. That should come in handy when the duck is put in the water, if that's your sort of thing.Even though I cannot vouch for its buoyancy or swimming capabilities (not tested), I honestly could not ask for a better rubber duck to share this wonderful experience that is gradschool. Thanks Schylling!
