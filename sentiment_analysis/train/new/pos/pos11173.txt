Perfect for naptime at the babysitter's house!  It's a much better quality and while not as padded as it could be, it's much more so (in both padding and quality) than the standard mats other kids use at the babysitter's house.  It's held up well over the past two years.  We've also had the 'boy' version in green for nearly 3 years now.  Highly recommend!
