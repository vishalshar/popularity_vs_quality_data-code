The Graco Prenatal Listener has worked great for us. You have to be at least 22 weeks to start hearing the heartbeat, but we could hear the baby moving before then. It's not a distinct noise. I had my doctor point out different noises to listen for and then we went from there. It has been fun to listen and play with the baby.
