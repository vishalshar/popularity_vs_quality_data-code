I bought this crib soother after a long search for the PERFECT soother lol. I needed something to keep my sons attention long enough for him to drift off to sleep in his crib...and this really does the trick! I decided to get this because it does not have moving parts (which most reviews on other products say make strange sounds and frequetly break anyway). Also, the price was good. I am really happy with my purchase so far. My son loves to look at the lights with or without music. As for the music, it plays for about 20 minutes then shuts off. There are a few songs on it, but in my opinion, they are EXTREMELY repetative and they drive me nuts since his crib is right next to my bed. But he seems to like it better with just lights anyway, and you can always plug in an mp3 player and play your own soothing music. I tried out this feature and it is great, but my little guy prefers quiet. This was super easy to install too. Just one clip! I definitly recommend giving this a try for your child!***UPDATE****It is now April 2014, and my son still uses this thing! We bought it in 2012! That is a miracle in itself considering I think he has broken everything else in the last 18 months lol. He is in a toddler bed now so we just set it at the foot of his bed, and he can turn it on and off by himself. It still works wonderfully! I didn't expect it to be so well made, but it is super tough! My son likes to bang on the plastic sheet in front with the frog on it and it still looks brand new! If you want a soother that will last, I recommend this one!
