For motorcycle riding: I live in south Florida and it gets brutally hot and humid, which might well be the toughest proving ground for a product like this. Have been using baby powder for some time, which I thought worked pretty well (certainly better than nothing at all). (Harley Ultra Limited and BMW R1200GSA type of riding.) Saw this stuff on a store shelf somewhere but didn't think I needed it (still had a good supply of baby powder, plus I thought it was just a gimmick). Then read some online blogs which to me were inconclusive (kind of a war about who thinks what works best to keep male backside and front package from glowing in the dark). I decided to just try this stuff and see, and I can say that it does work better than baby powder in two ways. First, it prevents chaffing and discomfort noticeably better (must have some sort of soothing additive).  And second, it lasts longer, which for me is important because I occasionally take long trips. FYI - It is a fine powder just like baby powder.
