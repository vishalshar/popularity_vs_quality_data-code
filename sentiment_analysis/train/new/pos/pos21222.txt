First of all, yes, as others have said, the color of this bag is more of a khaki.  Still, I wish I would have bought this bag sooner.  I've had several traditional tote-style diaper bags over the years and they always feel bulky and awkward.  This bag was excellent for our travel needs and would easily suit our everyday needs as well.  We were able to fit all of the baby's diapers, wipes, food, extra clothes, burp clothes, bibs, and other items and it was easy to organize in all of the pockets.  The bag was easy to carry and never got in the way, even when boarding a plane.  It fit nicely under the seat and all items were easily accessible.  The material is a good, durable quality.  I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this diaper bag to all of my friends with children.
