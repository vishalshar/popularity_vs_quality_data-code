I purchased this stroller to replace my larger stroller.  I wanted something smaller, lightweight, but at the same time, wide enough for my son.  My 19 month old son has broad shoulders and weighs about 30 lbs.  This stroller is perfect.  The seat reclines, which is great, however, it doesn't sit up that straight.  My son is constantly trying to sit up more straight.  I finally had to tie up the straps in the back so it will allow him to sit up.  Other than that, it is great for running into the mall or the doctor's office without trying to fit a larger stroller through the door.
