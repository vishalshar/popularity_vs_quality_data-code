I received the Eddie baurer fairview travel system from target for a baby shower gift. I searched for a extra base to purchase for my husbands car and could not find it sold in retail stores. After doing further research I found out that safety 1st actually manufactures the Eddie baurer line of car seats. This bases fits it perfectly and is cheaper than purchasing the base that has Eddie baurer's name on it. I highly recommend it!
