I am very pleased with product and happy to have my counter space back after using a towel for months. Mine holding 3 glass bottles, pumping and bottle parts no prob. Both levels rotate and it has grooves in 2nd tier to hold nipples to add even more room! Cheaper than others and from what I have read, a better product. Im all about function. We have a lawn out front so I dont need one in my kitchen :)
