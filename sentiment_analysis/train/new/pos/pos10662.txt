The photos on the purchasing page were very helpful in helping me find the tubing that fit my pump.  I am using a hand-me-down pump but do not know when it was purchased so the photos were critical.  The fittings and the tubing itself do not look like the original so I thought I had the wrong ones when I opened the package but I tried them on the pump and they work great.  This tubing fits the pump perfectly, works fine, and is easier to handwash than the original tubing.The only caveat is that the Medela steamer bags and Medela instruction manual say that the original tubing can be put in the steamer bags.  The directions on this tubing specifically say NOT to clean them with steam so I assume they should not be put in the steamer bags.  That means handwashing is your only option, which is a pain but, like I said, they are easier to handwash than the original tubes were.  (One of my parts had a hairline crack and some milk got into the tube so I had to wash it and it came perfectly clean.  I hung it to air-dry but it was taking forever so I hooked it up to the pump and it was dry in about 10 minutes.)Fits fine.  Directions say handwash only.
