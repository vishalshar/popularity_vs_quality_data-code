I received these today, and had them installed later that night. Installation was pretty easy and straight forward. I was actually a little bit worried that these would work on my deadbolt, but as you can see from the attached image it fit great. I was afraid that the back plate might move and cause scratches to my door, as reported by other reviews. So I stenciled out of a paper plate of the metal back piece, so now if it does move somehow there is now that paper plate wedge between the door and the metal plate. But it doesn't really look like that will be moving after I had completed my installation. When installing the outer cove piece and attaching it with the provided 3 screws just make sure you don't tighten it down too much, it will make it hard for you turn/spin to unlock the deadbolt once everything is installed. Easy solution though, just loosen the screws a bit and try again.If you find my product review HELPFUL, please click on YES at the bottom.
