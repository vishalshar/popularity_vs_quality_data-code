My son recently started becoming afraid of the dark and every night became this back and forth game of turning on and off the TV in his room, lights, etc. I decided on this night light not only because he loves cars but because of the good reviews and I am happy I did. This little light gives off a good, non bothersome amount of light that keeps my son happy with the visibility in his room but doesn't keep him awake.
