I use these all the time and they are a MUST if you are planning on using a diaper pail.  I am a huge fan of the Diaper Dekor XL and have purchased a couple of them for my family. (Only because the first one was left behind on a move by mistake.)  The ONLY thing I don't like is having someone try to empty the diaper bin that doesn't know what in the hell they are doing. Hahaha!  Seriously.... DO NOT EMPTY IT FROM THE TOP!  You'll end up with a crazy mess...  Just read (or browse the pics) on the directions and make your life 100 times easier.  All it takes is attempting it one time, and you got it.  It's so easy, my kids can help me empty it.Overall, I was also impressed with the quality of the bags and the ability to keep the stink in.  ;D  I have 2 pooping babies and this pail/bags have been our saving grace!
