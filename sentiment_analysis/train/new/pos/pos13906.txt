I was initially hesitant to buy this warmer after reading some reviews reporting mold in the unit that was difficult to clean. After talking with some other mothers, though, I decided to buy it. We've been using it for a couple months now and could not be happier with it. It's a definite improvement over the cheaper Munchkin steam warmer we were using previously.You can tailor warming times down to the second, using the arrow buttons. It goes fast, so it's not like you're standing there adjusting the time for very long. We warm 130ml of refrigerated milk and formula for our baby in 4 minutes 20 seconds. The unit will beep 60 seconds after the timer counts down. The delay is so you don't burn yourself on residual steam.Every week or two, I add white vinegar to the reservoir and run the unit 2 or 3 times through the full 8 minute steam cycle. Then I empty the unit and turn it upside down to dry. Then I run clean water through it a few times on the 8 minute cycle to get rid of the vinegar smell. We haven't had any issues with mold or odor.This has been a very reliable purchase for us, I would recommend and I would buy again.Edit to add: we bought this back in November 2015, it's now almost August 2016. Still no issues! I don't even clean it that often, to be honest, and we've still barely seen any mold. I just do the vinegar cycle whenever I notice any, and that just doesn't happen often enough to complain about. We're still very happy with this product.
