I originally bought this arch because whenever I had to put my son down I would put him in the baby papsan, which is very convenient, but very boring. The moment I snapped it on, his eyes lit up, and he grabbed the toys and shoved them into his mouth, which I took as a good sign! Now that he's almost 6 months old, he seems to be losing interest in it, so I would say it's better for babies 2 to 5 months old.The arch seemed to do a good job of entertaining him - on the one hand, he is able to pull the toys towards him, and on the other, he loves the crinkly sounds they make.I personally liked that we've been able to use it on his carseat and swing as well. It's gotten a lot of use and is a good deal for the money.The other reviewers are right - the clips don't always attach well or stay on. Because my son liked the arch so much, I didn't want to take it away, so I just made sure to supervise him when he played with it. Overall, it really helped in keeping him entertained when he would have otherwise been fussy and upset at being strapped to a chair.
