Purchased for my 7 year old son that has autism. He use to chew on his shirt collars. His occupational therapist recommend a chew . He liked it once he got use to using it instead of reaching for his shirt collars. It took a little adjusting, but it has saved his shirt collars. I like the breakaway feature, but it is a little too easy to breakaway. Sometimes it breaks away when he is touching it to place in his mouth, but other than that, a good investment.  I like that it has two different textures. As picture shows, has the indention pattern on the fronts, on the back it has little bumps.
