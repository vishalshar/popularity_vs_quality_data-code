Love these prefolds they are very trim, since they have less layers than 100% cotton prefolds and because they are made with bamboo which is thinner than cotton. These absorb more than 100% cotton prefolds, my son can go longer in these and not be super soaked like with his cotton prefolds. These shrink and quilt like regular cotton but feel WAY softer (even air dried) and they don't pill up at all! Althouhg theses are a cotton/bamboo blend the drying time is the same as reg. cotton prefolds.  I prepped mine in 5 washes, they quilted up and didn't shrink anymore after that. But to my surprise they got more and more absorbent with each subsequent wash up to about the 10th wash to reached max absorbency (the bamboo in these is what really make them great!)My son is 1 year old almost 19lbs and the size 5 fits well folded in thirds (with growing room) and laid in a Med. sized Bummis cover or in a size 2 Capri cover on the middle snaps or I can use it with a snappi because he is skinny! If you like prefolds but don't like the bulk these are for you. I would say these are about 40% trimmer than 100% cotton prefolds...but be realistic these are still prefolds, just not soo bulky. My son can fit his reg. clothes with these crawl and walk fine also,  unlike with his 100% cotton but again my son is tiny so less bulk is important!
