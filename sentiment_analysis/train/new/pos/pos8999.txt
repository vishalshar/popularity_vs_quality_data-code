These washcloths are awesome! I am using them as wipes during feedings and they are the best! Tried cheap Gerber washcloths at first, zero absorbency. Then used the bamboo rayon washcloths I have as actual washcloths, which worked OK but would smell like sour milk really quickly. These are perfect! They're nice and big so I can tuck them under my little one's chin when he takes a bottle, they're super absorbent, super soft so he doesn't mind when I wipe his face with them. And the $7.99 price was the lowest I found anywhere (though now it says it's reserved for Prime members only ðŸ˜•). I highly recommend this product!
