I absolutely adore this crib. We are a military family and my two children and I have moved into our in-laws house while my husband is deployed. Because my daughter and I are both sharing a bedroom we decided to get a mini crib to save some space. After using this crib I honestly wish that I would've used many cribs for both of my children since they were born. The mini  crib is the same size inside as the pack and play. There is definitely enough room for your child, and in my opinion I prefer that they're not able to move around as much while they're sleeping. When we assembled our crib we didn't have any scratches, and I personally didn't think it was that hard to put together. Some of the other of you stated it took hours but it took me less than 45 minutes to put together and I had my two-year-old tugging on my arm the entire time. I definitely recommend getting at least a 3 inch mattress for the crib.The only thing I will say about ordering a mini crib that maybe negative – although it's not specific to this script – is that many crib bedding is actually more expensive than regular crib bedding so please keep that in mind the order it. I personally make all of my children's bedding so it wasn't really an issue for me but when I was looking at crib sheets I was shocked that they were almost twice the price of regular size crib sheets.
