I think this pacifier is super cute and we got tons of compliments with it!  I bought it 3 times because it became my sons favorite pacifier.  When I had to replace it each time on the inside it appeared to get "stuff" on the inside of the pacifier.  There was no way to rinse it out or get rid of it.  I have no idea how it even got there, but it was gross.  I'm not sure what it was, but it made me nervous that it might have been mold. :(  So sadly after a month or so I would end up having to throw each pacifier away.  I really love this pacifier, but wish the manufacturer would either completely seal the nipple part so nothing can get in or allow for a way for it to be cleaned better.
