Don't waste your precious mommy time on any other cloth diaper. I've been using disposable diapers for quite a while but Im finally able to stay at home with my little ones. My 3 month olds little bum was starting to get rashy so I figured i'd try and make the switch to cloth diapers like I had been wanting to for awhile. I bought a few different kinds of diapers including the thirsties. I wasnt sold on making the switch until I tried the alvas.  All but the alvas I had leaking problems. We've been using them for almost a month and haven't had one leak. The alva diapers are one size so you don't have to buy a bigger size later on. They are also soo much quicker and easier than the other ones because the inserts just slide right in between the inner and outer pocket. Easy and super soft and comfy for her little tush. They are cheaper than the others. Just because they're more expensive doesn't mean they're better. :-)
