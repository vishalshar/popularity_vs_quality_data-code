The stroller arrived at the date estimated and I opened the box and had put it together in fifteen minutes, the instructions were simple and easy to follow.  It is light and very easy to fold using one hand. Once folded the stroller stands on its own and is easy to move. The car seat inside the stroller feels very secure but at the same time it's easy to release it. Once the base of the car seat is secured in the car it's very easy to put the baby inside the car and easy to release it when taking the baby out of the car.the stroller looks great and rides smoothly.
