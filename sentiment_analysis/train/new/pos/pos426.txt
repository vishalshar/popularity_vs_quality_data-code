I purchased this for my daughter to hook onto her crib.  She absolutely loves them.  I purchased this for her when she was about 6 mos. old and she's 8 mos. now and continues to play with them.  I also have the larger Kushies set, I purchased this as an add-on as I have pieces in her daycare crib too.  She loves to shake them and teethe on them as well!  I will be purchasing for my new niece for Christmas.  I highly recommend this product!
