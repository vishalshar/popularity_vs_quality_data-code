I saw this bag on one of the 'Deal" websites, but knew that I would not be able to predict when it would arrive if I ordered it from that site.  We live in a tiny home, so my little one's play areas not only have other purposes (i.e.my died, the living area floor, the hallway/his sisters' area) but I wanted something that he could easily access the toys in. So I did what I normally do and check the price on Amazon.  Amazon's price was identical, surprisingly, so I ordered not quite sure what to expect.  When the bag arrived I was happily surprised by the quality of the outer material.  It is like a heavy oilcloth, and seems like it would easily be completely water proof.  The color is just as I expected, a nice aqua, and the inside has a number of mesh pockets, which we don't use right now but may in the future.Another poster did mention the metal clasps which I am still undecided about, and the bag had a musty smell, as if it has been sitting in a storage location of some type without proper climate control, so I washed it 2 or 3 times before starting to use it.  It washed nicely and dried (air dried) quickly.  I can see this staying popular, perhaps becoming a pool bag in our future after the baby toy phase is sadly over, or a crafting bag.
