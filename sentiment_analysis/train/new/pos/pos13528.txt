These wraps are huge. They make great swaddling blankets. I highly recommend them! They feel soft too, and they get softer with every wash. We use these to wrap our baby in after he wakes up from his naps; it keeps him warm but not too warm like a fleece blanket would. I also have been using them while nursing.
