These "stickers" are fantastic.  They stick to the wall, even our weird, textured walls, and peel right off when you are ready to take them down or move them around... without leaving any sort of residue behind.We have used these "stickers" as potty training bribes, chore rewards and treasure box prizes.  They're great.  My boys (three and five) love them.  They especially like that they get to decorate their own space.  We let them decorate the walls around the head of their beds.Whenever the boys have friends over, one of the first things they show their guests are their "stickers."  They are very proud of them.I bought every set I could find on Amazon.  Star Wars, all the superheroes, the Toy Story series and I'm sure there are a few more in there.  Half the fun is watching the boys pick out the sticker they want.  We're running low on stickers... I hope more characters pop up soon.
