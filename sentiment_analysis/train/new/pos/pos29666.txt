My daughter is 3 month when I brought it. She loves it and trying to make noise very time she sees it. It is very colorful and attractive. The only thing I don't like is that the animal they put in is really hard for mimicking the noise, such as sunk...According to the instruction, you were supposed to make the sound of the animal in picture when reading it to your baby. However, I just don't know how sunk sounds like....  :(
