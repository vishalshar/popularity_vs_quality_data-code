Honestly, on my third kid and thought I lost my other cover.  I received the delivery and then found my original cover....go figure.  I don't use this anymore, just cause I've learned that it's too much of a fuss and just use the two shirt method now.  Anyhow, I would've given five stars, but there is a label right on the front that says "HOOTER HIDER".  Not very discreet.  At least for me.  It does the job though.
