I read the reviews and have to say I am impressed with the quality for the price. I was worried about the negative reviews but I think it is really about your expectations. If you want a perfect piece of furniture then you really should be shopping at a furniture store instead. This furniture took me 2 hours to assemble and that was while I took breaks to rest and eat and I'm pregnant in my second trimester. The instructions were in an envelope with the box. With building anything you have to disassemble all items from the packaging and get a feel for it and the instructions before building. Otherwise it will lead to frustration and errors. The furniture pieces were not all labeled but the pictures in the instructions were sufficient to understand how to assemble. I did have an issue with three screws lining up. With one I looked and there was a piece of wood in the whole that was blocking it. I pushed it down with my Phillips head screwdriver and the issue was solved. For the others I just had to ensure the holes lined up correctly. The finish does look like it can be scratched but It is not to the degree that some of the negative reviews make it out to be. Also this is children furniture, I am not expecting it to last for 5-10 years unscathed. I wrecked furniture as a child and that is what kids do. For the price and quality my husband and I are okay with what we received.
