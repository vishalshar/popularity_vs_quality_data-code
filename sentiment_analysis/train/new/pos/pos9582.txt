Cute bath toys. Not the highest quality but if you work out the math they are about $1 each and I guess it's pretty good if you think about it that way. All the animals are cute except for the penguin. The penguin doesn't even look like it is supposed to be part of the set. It just looks different. All the others have large heads and big cute googley eyes. The penguin has a big body, small head, and little beady eyes. LOL!!! And a couple of the toys, don't float in the orientation it was designed. Like the walrus, penguin, seahorse which were designed to sit on their bottoms, actually lay on their sides when in the water. But all the other ones are upright and look like they are swimming as intended. Of course my baby doesn't care, since she's only 8 months old, but I thought I would point it out.Also, The squirt holes are very small in each toy. It is hard to get the water in so we don't really squirt these. They kind of just float around.One of the toys has a misformed hole so it can't squirt at all.
