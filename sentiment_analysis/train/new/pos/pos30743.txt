My four year old daughter received the changing backpack for Christmas along with the bouncy seat and feeding set.  The backpack is very good quality, although I feel a bit pricey (but grandma bought it).  She uses the changing pad as a doll blanket.  The backpack fits the feeding set inside along with the other accessories.  The best thing about it is she loves to change her doll's diaper and the blanket matches the bouncy seat. The two zippers on the backpack are very easy for her to use.
