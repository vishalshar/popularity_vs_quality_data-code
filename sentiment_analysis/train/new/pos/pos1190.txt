I ignored other reviewers comments about the difficulty of folding it up and figured that my husband and I could do it since we are both educated, intelligent, logical people...we struggled on the beach for about 10-15 minutes before having to pull up and watch the You Tube video of folding instructions...then we got it figured out right away!  Love that it creates shade for my baby and also a little privacy for breastfeeding, love the size, compact fold, ease of set-up, etc.  Just wish it was a little easier to fold-up!
