These mats are perfect for their intended use.  I wish I'd used them from our daughter's very first self-feeding out!  She's 13 months now, could have used these from 6-months on.They are very thin, light and easy to slip in to a bag.  I use them for eating out and for travel.  Just takes a second to get one positioned before putting the highchair in place and then there's no mess to clean up, no guilt for me if I'm not able to clean up a mess myself and happy wait-staff.  In other reviews they are described as thin and disposable.  That's exactly what I wanted and exactly what these provide.  I also wanted something visually pleasant but not covered with images from popular tv characters and the like.  This has the pattern that you see in the product picture, bright dots.  I like it.  Wish they had subscribe and save so I could get these coming regularly.  And, I wish they came in biodegradable material -- that would be ideal.
