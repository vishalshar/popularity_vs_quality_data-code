I bought the "Big Baby" Leggies Woombie for my 3 month old once he had grown too tall for the other newborn and small swaddlers we had original used on him. This was by far my favorite one and I wish I had purchased one sooner in the smaller (0-3 month) size too.My baby boy loved to be swaddled up until he was about 4 months old. In fact, the only way he would nap during the day or sleep at night during the first 4 months was if he was swaddled tightly and bounced/rocked to sleep. What I discovered (on the late side) was that by using this particular Woombie, I could actually allow him to be both swaddled and buckled safely into his baby swing, where he was completely content to sleep during naps. In turn, this helped me greatly because I could have a rest from bouncing/rocking my 15 lb bundle of joy to sleep 4 times/day.On another note, my son seemed to really enjoy having his legs be free (since all the other swaddling products kept them in a pouch and he often kicked his legs wildly in those). It was great to be able to zip him snugly into this swaddler and have his arms safely tucked in so he wouldn't wake himself due to the moro reflex, but at the same time have him be able to kick his legs up in the air and see his feet individually. I highly recommend this product!
