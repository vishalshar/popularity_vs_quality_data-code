This stroller met and exceeded my expectations. That being said the only thing I do not like and think the company should consider is for such a stout price the snack tray and accessory console should be included. Otherwise the performance of the stroller is smooth, had adequate shade and storage underneath and its a visually attractive stroller. It also is easy to assemble, only had to put on the wheels no tools required. It also folds easily but is quite bulky but should fit ok in the trunk of a car. I give 4 stars only due to having to pay a fortune and then have to turn around and buy a tray and console. I mean what kid and parent don't need a drink or accessory holder!!? Hydration while walking or jogging is important and should come included, period.
