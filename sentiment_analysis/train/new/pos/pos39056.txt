I used this second year calendar for my first son and because of this I bought the First Year Nature's Lullabies for my second son.  Recently, I enjoyed reminscing about my first son through the Second Year Nature's Lullabies so I also bought it for my second.  Same concept as first year but for a second year calendar it's manageable and offers just enough to record second year events.  If you're very detailed oriented, there isn't much space to record memories just 2 prompts on each month and room for a picture.  So I ended up writing on the calendar itself and I dictated how much I wanted to record.  Some might want more places to put pictures, but I found it hard enough to put one on each mth.  I ended up printing them all out at once and then going back to paste the pictures in each moth.Features:Colorful, gender neutralBeginning pages to record cost of items during child's second year (ex. gallon of milk, gas etc)Child's favoritesPlace to trace hand and footMonth pages have weight and lengthTwo fills/prompts (ex., "My new skill")Stickers (ex., 4th tooth, climb downstairs, drinks from cup)Pros:Spiral binding for easy display and storageThick cardstock paperColorful stickersColors have not faded in storageSpace for one picture each monthCons:Not many prompts/fill ins (ex. My favorite toy_____________)Limited space to record your own memories, page in the back but not on each mthAfter you've put in so much effort to complete your first year, you might wonder if you'll have the same diligence to record every detail for another year--the Second year Nature's Lullaby makes it easy to accomplish this.
