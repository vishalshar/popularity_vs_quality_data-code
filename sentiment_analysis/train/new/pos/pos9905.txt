Our baby had started crawling when I installed this.  With out last child 10 years ago, I used a similar product by a different company.  This one installed much more securely than my previous bumper, and it has a more uniform appearance between the corners and the long sections.  Our baby has started cruising, and she recently fell and hit her head on the edge of the hearth.  If the bumper had not been present, she would have had a nasty wound.  Instead, she cried a little but had no visible damage.
