My 15 month old doesn't really like these..yet.  I like it because they are easy to clean, and mold free! He's even chewed on a few of these and they have stayed intact. They stick to the walls pretty well as long as the letters or wall is wet.  They even stick on his body! Hubby likes to stick them on his face haha.  Overall a great product!
