I tried so hard to get away with not buying one of these silly baby play mats for my baby boy, but we spent an afternoon at a friend's house, he loved hers, and voil√†, now we own this one! All in all, it really is great, the music isn't even that annoying. The only problem I had with this play mat was that the dangling creatures, an octopus with fish hanging from it, are too close to baby's face! At 2 months this really, really annoyed my son, but a month later he seems to be used to it! The fisher price Luv U Zoo that we tested out at a friend's was much better and the middle creatures were much further away from his little face and seemed to move faster as well! I loved the under-the-sea theme, but if my son hadn't drooled all over the mat, I might have considered returning it for the Zoo!
