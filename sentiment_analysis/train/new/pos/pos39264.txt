I've had the Stacrobats for 12 years and 3 kids, we absolutely LOVE them. They are so much fun. They're magnetic and can be stuck together and to the base. They are a blast to build in all kinds of ways. If you just put two together they'll fall over easily but when you build 3 and stack more they don't. They are cute, weird, colorful, interesting and easy to pack up in the base (zipper them in, there's a clear side too so you can see the characters). Really one of our favorite baby toys all of these years. The older kids still love playing with it with the baby :-) Only thing I don't like, the price. They really are expensive. Awesome toy but they could bring the price down by twenty or thirty dollars.
