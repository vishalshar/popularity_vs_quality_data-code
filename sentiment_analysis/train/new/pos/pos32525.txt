I want my little dog to stayed in the tiled part of the house and out of the carpeted living room.  This has been the perfect solution.  If I choose, I can leave it open all the time, door clicks itself open if you prefer to leave it open.  The gate opens with just a slight lift upward - far easier than some other gates with complex opening mechanisms (my son has a gate so difficult to open, I have to put down whatever I'm carrying and use two hands to open it).  Nice looking, good enough for my pretty living room, well-built, sturdy.  For me, it was not completely easy to install, but I'm not good at things like this.  Did ok with another person helping by holding it in place.  Also it doesn't seem to be easy to move, once in place it was difficult to unscrew.  Have had this a couple of years and it's invaluable, couldn't live without it.
