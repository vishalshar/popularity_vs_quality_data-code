I had a hard time getting my son to give up the bottle when he was 18 months old. I found these by chance at Marahalls. It only took me one try to get my son to use it instead of his bottle. My son is now 20 months old and he only wants to drink his milk out of it. He still likes his milk warmed up and I just fill it up pop it in microwave  for 50 seconds put lid on it and shake it up. I absolutely love this cup. He only likes the Munchkin cups because of the nipple on them. These are the best for kids that have been or were breast fed.
