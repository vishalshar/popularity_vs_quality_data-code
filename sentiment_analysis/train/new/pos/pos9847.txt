Love this wetbag.  Bought to replace another bag that I had purchased because it was encased in pretty fabric and it zipped closed.  Then, after some use of the old bag, I found that I hated the zipper enclosure and the pretty fabric did not hold up well to washing (in occasional bleach) and handling.  After some online research I found out it is better to have an open bag for dirty diapers to reduce smells (I didn't believe it either, but it is true) plus it is just plain easier to put dirty diapers into.  This bag does all of that.  Ordered two, as it appears that this bag is/may be discontinued?  I hang it on a hook on the door so the kids can't get into it and it is easily accessible when I have a dirty diaper in one hand and wild kid in the other.  Then, when it is time to wash the diapers (every 2 - 3 days) I pull the bag off the hook, take it to the washer, unzip the zipper at the bottom and dump all the dirty diapers out of the bag -- all without touching a single dirty diaper.  The bag, so far (7 - 8 washes), appears to wash up nicely (no pilling, staining, or other discoloration) even considering I purchased the white.  I can't recommend this bag enough.EDIT 12/13/2015: Still love these bags. I eventually had to replace the nylon zippers on both of them as they started to split from the weight of the dirty diapers. I easily replaced with plastic zipper and now I consider these bags perfect.
