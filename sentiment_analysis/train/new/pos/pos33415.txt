I bought the The First Years 16 Piece Take & Toss Infant Spoons and loved them! so i thought i would try another "The First Years" product. These are not intended to be heavy duty but more of a take 'n toss product.The lids don't seem very secure but then i don't use them for liquids. currently, i bring along food jars and pour 1/2 jars into the bowels since my son is only 9 months. Then i use the lid once we're finished to make sure nothing spills until i can hand wash them at home. I also use these to mix cereal in at home. i warm the materials in another container (like a food jar or breast milk storage bag) and then pour into the bowel.
