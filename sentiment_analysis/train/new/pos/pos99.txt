When I was on bed rest I found the reviews and photos of baby products priceless. So I though I would try to return the favor. :) This is my third swing from fisher Price in the last 5 years. I loved them all and only gave them up because of storage issues. With each new swing Fisher Price has made improvements and this swing is by far the best! This swing has the great cradle seat of my original baby Papasan Swing, the  plug in option of my Pink Papasan and now I have the added option of choosing a gliding motion! This is my first glider... and I love it! I can set it up to glide in 2 different directions; the action is smooth and the switch over from the swing option is fast and easy. Some of my other favorite features of the swing are the foot controls and the nice color. The soft sage green is simple and neutral, perfect for my brown/green/blue nursery. I highly recommend this swing and anticipate it being a top seller for fisher price. Check out my custom images to see my 9 day old infant in the swing. He is only 5 pounds so quite tiny in the swing! :)
