Perfect size for my four year old!  No, the lunchbox does not fit inside the pack, but my little one does not mind carrying it.  The backpack is the perfect size for preschool.  A bit larger than others but smaller than a full size.  Her notes, snack, small blanket and small sharing items will fit nicely.  It seems to be of high quality.  She already used it for day camp and all her swimming essentials, sunblock, and bug spray fit with extra room for more.  I would recommend for a preschooler.  If you kid is in kindergarten, look for a full size backpack though.
