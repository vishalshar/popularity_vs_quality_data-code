Sturdy, easy-to-use, great size and shape for tiny hands to grip easily, bright colors and an all-around high quality product. I specifically bought these for my special-needs classroom (as a recommendation from our school's OT) as a fine motor activity and I recommend them to anyone looking for an engaging activity for any population working on fine motor strengthening. I have no doubt these will last a very long time and are made from thick, sturdy plastic.
