LOVE this bar above and beyond the snack tray! We bought both and it was immediately apparent that the tray would be useless for our taller-than-average 11 month old. It sits way too high and we won't be able to use it until our baby is 2 or 3. The bar, on the other hand, has adjustable height settings and she loves holding onto it as we stroll the neighborhood. So, the bar is already in use while the tray will remain on the garage shelf until our baby is tall enough for it.
