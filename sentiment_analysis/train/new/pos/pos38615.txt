I took a chance buying this bassinet since there weren't any reviews. I rely heavily on reviews when making purchases on Amazon so hopefully this review provides the information you are looking for and helps you if you are considering this Bassinet.I like the fact that this bassinet is built out of real wood, which gives it nice modern look. The item is well built and sturdy. Assembly is pretty easy--there a a few places where the instructions could have been more helpful, but it is pretty hard to screw up the installation too badly.My biggest question I had before buying this bassinet was the pad size. The included pad is 17"x34"x1" --This is not a standard size and you will have a hard time finding sheets that are designed for this size. I purchased the American Baby Company Value Jersey Knit Cradle Sheet, Ecru which is for 18x36 mattresses and it fits the included pad just fine. That being said, the Included pad is not worth using in my opinion. It is thin, noisy, flimsy, and not durable. My older kids were playing with some toys on the pad while I was putting the bassinet together, and they managed to put several holes in the plastic that covers the foam. I am happy to report that the 18x36x2 mattresses fit flat inside this bassinet. I purchased this one: Cradle Mattress - 18 X 36 X 2" Thick and it is so much nicer than the one that came with the bassinet. The poor quality of the included pad is the reason I knocked a star off of my rating. I almost would have preferred this item come with no pad and advertise the correct size to buy.Now with the thicker pad inside this bassinet, I really like it. I would have given this product 5 stars if it came with a better mattress or if I were only reviewing the bassinet without the included mattress being part of the product
