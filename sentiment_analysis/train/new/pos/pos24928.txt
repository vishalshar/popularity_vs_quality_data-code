I've been buying organic bath sponge for my daughter but this one really sealed the deal for my search. Just like it is described, it's absolutely soft and absorbs water well. I can rub it directly on my 5-yr-old daughter's delicate cheeks without getting her uncomfortable and irritated. It also dries up easily so I don't have to worry about sliminess. I will keep buying this product because while it's not cheap, it serves us well, and we're happy with this purchase. I only wish it could have been a tad bigger in size. Overall, no complaint and happy to recommend to any parents out there.
