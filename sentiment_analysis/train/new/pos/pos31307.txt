When I found this mermaid outfit, I also bought another one because I loved the look of both. So I feel qualified to compare the two. The other was cute but had so many flaws. This one is just so sweet! The color is rich, it's well-proportioned, and the individual pieces are well constructed. One caveat. It's big. Just don't expect newborn photos for an infant less than 10-11 pounds. My granddaughter is a month old, 8 lbs., and is still too tiny. Maybe there should be two sizes.Otherwise, I would recommend this, yes, it's just adorable!!
