Make sure you realize that there is no hook/anchor/holder of any kind coming with this mobile. I had to be really creative to make a holder because I didn't want to spend extra $ to purchase it separately.If I didn't invest half of a day crafting the holder, I would return this item..Hope at least my baby will like it. Although now when I look at it I doubdt that from baby's perspective it looks too interesting.Can work as a nice decoration though.Writing an update. My 2 months old son LOVES it!!! This thing got all his first smiles, and is still getting lots of those when he is hanging out in his crib. I am almost jealous, lol.I am totally giving it 5 star now. Worths every penny and minute I spent to install it.
