I bought this as well as the green bean for the same company. The asparagus try is MUCH to large for my 3 month old son to chew on. However, the toy is well made any very cute. Compared to the asparagus, the green been is tapered at the end, so he can actually chew on it. I think once he gets a little bigger the asparagus will be a hit.
