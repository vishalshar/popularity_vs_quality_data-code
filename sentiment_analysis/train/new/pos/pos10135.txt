Love these so much I bought a second set. I would've preferred this in purple or teal, because it seems like everything for little girls is PINK PINK PINK, but oh well! We use the largest bin for toy storage (which is why we needed a second set... too many toys), the mid-size bins for pants/leggings/tights, and the smallest bins for socks/shoes. My daughter loves to take everything out, and then either get inside the bin or collapse it entirely & throw it down our stairs... and with these, she can't do any harm to the actual functionality of the bins, no matter how hard she tries. Yay!
