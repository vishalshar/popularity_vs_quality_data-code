Awesome, not quite an ergo. However, I do find myself reaching for it more then my ergo. My Daughter is a tall thin child and the ergo is for a wider child. That being said ergo has mor room for growth. This carrier does exactly what an ergo does. It keeps all the weight off of your back. Great quality for your money. I have had this carrier for few months before reviewing it so I have a good idea of how functional it is. Just for reference my daughter is 25 lbs 32inch tall. She is the max weigh for the carrier but, I could realistically use this for a long time to come.
