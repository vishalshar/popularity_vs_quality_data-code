This is a long term review for the Ducka Toilet Seat Reducer. We have used this seat for 5 years, with 2 children. The shape is great, more comfortable than a standard $10 flat seat and both kids, now 8 year old boy and 4 year old girl, still use it and the 4 year old loves the duck face.However, the handle on the back, broke after about 3 years, and in the 4th year, the yellow rubber around the back and the sides (where the little "feet" are) started to separate from the white plastic. It's pretty bad now, the back broken handles peel about 4 inches off on either side. So we carefully put the seat down, so the yellow rubber stays between the white seat and the toilet seat. That yellow rubber actually keeps the hard white plastic from scratching up the toilet seat surface. On our toilet upstairs, we have used a smaller cheap $10 flat seat reducer, and after 5 years, the surface of our toilet seat has been scratched up. not badly, but enough so you can see the surface is scratched.We are going to buy a new one, trying the more expensive Bjorn reducer - our friend, has used hers for one child for the same amount of time and her handle did not break. We'll see how ours does!
