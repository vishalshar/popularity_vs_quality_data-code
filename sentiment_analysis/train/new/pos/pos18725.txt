We were looking for a size 3 silicone pacifier, but the more traditional NUKs only come in latex when you get to size 3.  After using the size 1 and 2 silicone NUKs, we wanted to stick with silicone for two reasons.  1.  We just like the look.  2. More importantly, we wanted to be able differentiate them from our niece's size 3 NUKs when they're at Grandma's everyday.  The new Genius NUKs seem a bit nicer than the traditional NUKs in a couple ways.  Our favorite thing is that they don't seems as prone to getting moisture inside.  They do drop out a little easier than the others, which we attribute to the thinner design of the nipple.  (We actually don't mind this aspect as it does seem to discourage use throughout the day.)  She has no problems with them at night.  In general, the more streamlined design leaves fewer places for 'crud' to accumulate.  Our only complaint, Amazon won't let you choose the colors when ordering.  We ended up with a relatively even number of lavender, green, blue, and orange when ordering 8.
