This brush does not get a lot of heavy use from so you may want to take this into consideration. I also think some reviewers have overstated the quality of this item and other have been overly brutal as well.-HandleThe handle comfortable and feels like it is made of the same soft rubber material we have come to expect from many of OXO's products. It is not so oversized as some of their handles have been in the past (and I've got some decnet sized paws). I have noticed a couple of complaints about the handle loosening in other reviews. I have not had an issue with the handle unscrewing, but do notice some play in the tightening direction. This issue could have been greatly reduced, if not eliminated, by not rounding the corner on the latching mechanism and can clearly be seen in the, currenlty, only customer image(This is more for the designers, should they stumble onto this). This in turn creates play in the handle while rotating it during use.-Nipple BrushThe nipple brush has apparently been redesigned and is well demonstrated in a customer pic. I do not clean nipples so i will not comment on its intended use.-BristlesThe white bristles are quite soft as their description states, so much so that they will slightly deform if there is pressure placed on them for an extended period of time such as laying the brush down on its side. This problem can be eliminated by either purchasing the stand, or just positioning it in such a way that the brush is not laying on the bristles. The bristles will not be permanently deformed. Once the bristles are exposed to warm water they bounce back quickly and may even do so over time without the warmth. The green brisltes seem to be a bit firmer, and if so, not substantially enough to be absolutely certain. The head of the brush is small enough, and the bristles flexible enough, for the head to get into openings that would seem to be much too small for it to enter (leaving that alone.)
