My 9 mo baby still won't take a bottle very well, but there was a period of a few weeks where my babysitter could get him to drink a few ounces out of this one.  It's small, it looks like a baby doll bottle, the nipple is short and small, closer in size to a breast nipple, which might be why he tolerated it.  The bottles fit on my Medela pump, so that's cool.  I got two pink and one green bottles in my package.  They're as easy to clean as any other bottle.  Very light.  Definitely worth a try - he liked these as well as, if not better than, the much more expensive Como Tomo bottle, or Tommee Tippee sippy cup.  Good luck!
