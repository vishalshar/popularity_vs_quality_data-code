This product is great overall and I would recommend it to anyone that needs to upgrade the sippy cup with their toddler. I did my homework before buying this product and I am glad I did.The pros: It is a great transition from sippy (spouted) cup to a kids cup (with no top) because it doesn't have a curve spout that sticks out so it teaches how to drink from a big cup. Has a ridge all the way around the top edge similiar to a open cup. Plus , even though the toddler still needs to suck on the cup to recieve the liquid, it pours more than a previous stage sippy cup. It is easy to clean at the top drawer in the dishwasher. Includes a handy place to store the plug just under the lid for washing so it doesn't get lost in the dishwasher. It is easy to grip for little one. And easy to refill. Plus with the 3 pack of different solid colors I am teaching my little one colors and association....blue for water, orange for apple or orange juice...and so on. I keep the water in the blue at all times, apple juice in the orange at all times and so on. Plus it is BPA free and that was a very important item for me.The cons: Since it is a insulated cup (though I didn't see much of a difference from a non-insulated cup --live in Fla) you can't see the level of liquid in the cup to see if they soon need a refill. And even though my little one isn't a shaker, when she does shake the cup it does leak just a little (drops) but that is the only time. So if you have a toddler who is really rough on cups just keep that in mind. Please also make sure that you have the plug in correctly (with the arrow on tab in the spout) or you will have problems. But those are the only cons I have found with this cup.So overall rating I would HIGHLY recommend this great cup to every parent as a practical choice and as a teaching tool for the world of big cups and colors. THUMBS UP !!!!
