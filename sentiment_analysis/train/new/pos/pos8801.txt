I bought this Skip Hop Tubby  to hold my kids toys in the bathtub but didn't want the ones I had to drill into the wall. I have tried a lot of things to hold their toys in and this one worked out rather well.  It has suction cups and has a strong hold. We put this directly on the side of our tub and it hasn't fell once. This is made from wet suit type of material and does a good job at drying out quickly. The netting in the middle helps my kids to see what they are fishing around for. We put a ton of toys in this organizer and it has never fell off the wall. This Skip Hop Tubby keeps the toys dry and mold free. I love that I do not have to take off the suction cups I can just unscrew the tops and throw the organizer in the wash. The orange color is very bright and looks great against our white tub. My sons room is navy blue, orange, and red so this fits the bill. This is one of the best looking bath organizers I have used and that actually works!
