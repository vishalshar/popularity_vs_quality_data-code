I have bought these little book/noise makers/chew toys for my kiddos since I started having kids. I have 3. My sons book was thick, and small, hard to find when he would stash it somewhere. My first daughters book was similar to this one, with no handle or tags. This little cookbook is so cute, all the pages make the bag crunching sound, which keeps kiddos entertained. The teething chew part is as long as the page on both pages, so it is big enough for her to grip and chew on. The handle is nice, I can play tug of war with her lol. Or she can even use that part as a teether. She loves to pull and knaw on the tags as well. Weird I know, but she loves them. I don't get it, but obviously the toy company does!
