I will never use a shoulder diaper bag ever again.  This bag is perfect.  Tons of room on the inside to hold extra diapers, containers for food, wipes, the changing pad, extra clothes in the different compartments. And the detachable cooler is great!! You can put a frozen ice pack in the front and in the back of the cooler compartment to keep things cooler longer! You can fit about 3 medium/large size bottles in there comfortably! The cooler is great because if you don't need it, you can leave it off and just have the bag, but if you do, its great because you don't need to pack a separate cooler bag inside the bag and take up room! Straps are easily adjustable, and the bag is lightweight and allows for free hands to deal with your baby/toddler instead of fussing with a bag on one shoulder! This is a MUST!
