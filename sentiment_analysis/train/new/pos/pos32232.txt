I give these training pants an EXCELLENT rating.  No training pant is going to be perfect (stick to diapers if you're not ready to deal with some accidents).  That being said, these ones are the best ones we own both for how well they work as well as the price.  We have tried multiple brands of training pants (gerber, blueberry, bambino mio, handmade ones) and these ones are the ones we prefer above others.  They are ideal for several reasons.  1) They're not bulky and they definitely feel like underwear to the child, 2) The waterproof layer is thin and very POWERFUL.  These pants will hold a full pee with only the outer pants/shorts getting slightly damp, 3) The elastic around the legs prevent the leakage from escaping that route (but do so without being uncomfortable or too tight for my child), 4)They hold up for pooping accidents or diarrhea (we had an unfortunate public episode of bad diarrhea with a gastroenteritis and thank goodness my child was in these underwear rather than any of the other brands), 5) They wash well (washer and dryer) and are not showing any signs of wear, 6)The price is exceedingly reasonable, 7) My son loves the animal characters.  I rarely write product reviews, but these really are worth the price and are our go-to training pants.
