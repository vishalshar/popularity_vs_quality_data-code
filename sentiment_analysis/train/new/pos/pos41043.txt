I really like this product, it looks very cute on and baby likes to chew on it. I like to wear statement jewelry, and this makes it possible with my 4  month old. It wont scratch her face as I hold her close or harm her as she mouths it- it's designed to chew! A hard tug will release the clasp which I realize is a safety mechanism.  The silicone beads do grab/ pull hair at the neckline a little, but it's not really bothersome- just kind of happens sometimes when you take it off.I actually want to order a few more in different colors. - I have to justify buying more though when the turquoise is so cute with everything! I do plan on getting some for pregnant friends as baby gifts.I am a seasoned mama and I wish I had this with all my babies!  It is a great concept!
