I purchased these for my daughter's first toddler bed. My daughter loves the pattern, and the sheets/blanket are nice and soft. The blankets and sheets are lightweight. Based on other reviews I purchased the fleece blanket to go with the bedding for extra warmth. I do worry about how they will go through the wash, I will update my review if they don't wash well. I wish the pillow case it comes with fit a toddler pillow instead of a regular sized pillow.
