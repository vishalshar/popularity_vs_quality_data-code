I really did my price comparison homework when it came to purchasing baby accessories because there were so many of them, particularly for the Uppa Baby model stroller, the cup holder, the rain shield, etc.  At the time I purchased this item, Amazon offered the lowest price for the rain cover, compared to BabiesRUs and Buy Buy Baby, even with coupons.This product arrived shipped tightly in a small box, without any harm to the product.  Unfolding it for the first time is a little challenging but not hard, as the plastic is slightly hard to separate.Installing, using and even storing the shield is extremely easy.
