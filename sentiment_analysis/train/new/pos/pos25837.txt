This is a simple concept, but something that you would not normally think you need.  After losing a few toys off the side of the stroller, I felt there had to be a way to keep toys and bottles from falling over the edge.  I found these and took a shot at ordering them.  Overall, I think I might start giving this in a shower gift.PROS:The straps come with snaps at differing lengths to accommodate anything from Sophie the Giraffe all the way to our large Tommee Tippee bottles.I have not lost a toy since getting these nor has a bottle fallen on the ground.They come in tons of colorsThe strap dries out easily when she may have some excess "droolage"CONS:I just wish the straps were a bit longer to allow you more options for attaching them.  For example, I would love to have them attach on the front of her stroller, but the strap is too short to allow her to get the toy to her mouth.  The length is good for most locations though.
