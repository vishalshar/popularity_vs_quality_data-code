I like this thermometer. Because it is non contact and provide result very fast it is very easy to check baby temperature without disturbing. Also i can check baby food temperature, water and any other item which is very sutable.Main cons: - it does not measure baby temperature very accurate. I usually check 3 points - cheek, temple and forehead. Once you remember this number when baby healthy , you can use them each time to compare.
