I bought an eight-pack of these for my firstborn 13 years ago and I'm now using them on my second baby... talk about value!  These are great, especially if you work outside the home like I did the first time around (I just had to wash them every night).  Anyone can put them on your baby since they go on just like disposables.  The fact that I was able to save them and can now reuse them after all these years blows my mind.  I've heard great things about other brands but can't afford to try them out.  So all I can say is that these are practical, useful, durable, and well-worth the initial expense.  I soak them in either white vinegar or baking soda and hot water (vinegar is best for urine and baking soda is best for poop) before laundering for optimal cleanliness.  I've never had either baby experience diaper rash while using these.  With my first, I used one doubler and my son would last 3-4 hours before needing a change; my second son is a super-soaker so I use two doublers and a vinyl cover and check him after a couple of hours.  Keep in mind that even with disposables you'll have more trouble with getting the right fit than with absorbency -- that's what Consumer Reports said in their most recent article and ratings report on disposable diapers.  I've experienced blowouts and massive leakage with every brand of disposable diaper we've tried, and my second baby is quite a chunky boy, so I know CR is right.  Some websites allow you to purchase a sampler package so you can try different brands of cloth diapers out and see what you like best; if I didn't have these already I probably would've tried that.  Also, I would've probably bought the Ultras had they been available 13 years ago.  Overall, the money saved by using these with both babies makes the initial cost seem like nothing.  Plus, when you use cloth there's a higher likelihood of your child wanting to potty-train earlier (EVERY CHILD IS DIFFERENT AND THEIR MILESTONES WILL VARY).
