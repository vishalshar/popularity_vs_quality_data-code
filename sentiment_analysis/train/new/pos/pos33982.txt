I really like this product because it does help keep me covered.  I ordered an XS according to the sizing chart.  It's much tighter than I expected.  I think if I would have ordered one size bigger then it would cover my breast a little more.  I was thinking this would drape like my t-shirts do when I am feeding at home.  The tightness of it does make it feel secure though.  I bought it to take to church so I could nurse, but I felt too exposed and opted to continue to use my traditional nursing cover.  I've used this at home when guests are over and in public Mother's Rooms.  I think I would be able to pull this off in a restaurant too.  Overall, I like it.  I gave it four stars because it's a little smaller than I thought it would be.
