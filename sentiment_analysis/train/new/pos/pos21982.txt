I bought these to wear so I would never be out of teethers for my 4 month old who is teething early. She has been chewing on everything and it's nice to have some you can wear so they don't fall on the ground or get left behind someplace. They are a bit big for her mouth and for her fingers to hold but I am sure she will grown into using them. My daughter doesn't show too much interest in them yet but I hope that will change. The colors are nice and the product seems to be high quality and well made.
