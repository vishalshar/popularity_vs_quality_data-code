Love the product but the description doesn't tell you this sleeve will only work with the dr browns raised emblem/logo all clear glass bottles. I have the 3.5 oz (yes I know the description is for the 4oz bottle but I thought it's the small dr browns bottle, I didn't even know there was a 3.5 oz vs a 4 oz-why make so many variated sizes....drive me crazy, but that's a side bar sorry) with the blue/green dr browns logo on them...won't fit! Sleeve is too loose defeating the purpose. Oh well just passing on the lesson learned :0)
