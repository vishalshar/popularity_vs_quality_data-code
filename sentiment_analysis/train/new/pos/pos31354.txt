I purchased it for my co-worker's daughter's 1st-yr birthday, because I received this as a gift for my daughter's 1st-yr birthday before. The shape of the spoon and fork is well designed so that my daughter can hold them very well. She also can pick up foods by the curvy edge of the plate, which gives her more confidence on eating with utensils. The edge is also removable. The bottom of the plate & bowl are designed with non-slip, so she doesn't have to hold the plate when eats foods. By the time she turned two, she mastered feeding herself with utensils pretty well. She (2.5 yrs old now) doesn't use fingers to eat noodles/spaghetti any more. No more mess! She's confident and mommy is very proud.
