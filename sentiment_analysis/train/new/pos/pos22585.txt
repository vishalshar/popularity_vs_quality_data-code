I love love love this toy, and so does my daughter. It's so lightweight she can ride it any where, indoor or out. She never gets stuck anywhere because if she does she can just pick it up to get un-stuck. She loves it, and I love how its helping her coordination and balance. At first I worried it would be too small for her, but its the perfect size. She is two and a little small for her age, so parents with bigger children might want to get the XL version of this toy. Don't be fooled into thinking this toy is cheap because its all plastic, its well made and it being plastic serves a major purpose and is what makes this toy so great. It is light and amazingly maneuverable! The first step to grooming a future champion dirt biker :D
