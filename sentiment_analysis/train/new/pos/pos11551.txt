We love the WubbaNub pacifiers!  Our twins used Soothies pacifiers before the WubbaNub came out, so we planned to use Soothies for our baby girl also. When I saw these cute little animals attached to Soothies, I registered for one and I'm so glad I did!  They are awesome!!  My baby girl loved the cute caterpillar!  I love how you can lay this on baby's chest and it doesn't get lost or roll away so easily, like a separate pacifier would.  If it gets dropped (or later, tossed) out of the car seat or stroller, it is MUCH easier to find than a lone paci.  Also, when baby's hand-eye coordination is not so good, it is much easier to grab and hold onto a little stuffed animal than to just the pacifier itself.  My baby also loves to chew on the stuffed animal and even on the little tag. Plus, the whole thing can go in the washer and dryer and it comes out just fine. I have already started purchasing these for baby shower gifts. They are great!
