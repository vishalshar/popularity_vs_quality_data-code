Ok, here is the deal! Doesn't fit every car seat, just like everyone said. However, it is really cute and has potential to fit a lot of car seats.***Drawstring: Yes. However, the string used for the drawstring is stretchy. So, you can have a little elasticity to get the cover around the seat and then tighten the drawstring to help it stay in place.*** Material: sort of like a pillowcase or sheet. Very bright and stitched together well. It is perfect for covering ON TOP of the carseat cover that is already on the seat.*** Straps: The cover has a large rectangular flap that can Velcro open and closed. This helps to keep the cover pretty universal when it comes to correctly fitting the straps of various car seats in the cover.*** Size: Yep! I was one of the unlucky ones. Didn't really fit... I mean, it fit around the seat, but where the child sits, it wasn't deep enough to actually touch the seat. So, there was about an inch or two gap between the car seat (where the baby's tailbone would sit) and where the cover laid. To be fair, our car seat is quite big.I am going to post some pictures so people can sort of see what it actually looks like on a big seat.
