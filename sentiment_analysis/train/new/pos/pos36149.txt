These tubes are 100% better than the tubes that came with my medela pump. I ordered a second set of these for my pump for home after using my first set for my pump at work. The condensation dries a lot faster in these and the tube is made from a thicker and more durable material than the medela tubes. These are a great value and are so much better than the name brand
