I'm guessing all the reviews about how soft the sound is on this toy were written by people who don't actually live with children.  The BEST feature of this toy is that it is not another riducuously loud toy.  It does not matter if a parent can hear the toy.  Actually I think it is best that I can't hear it.  All that matters is that when my child is 2-6 inches from the toy, SHE can hear it.  She loves it and has a great time making the soft sounds, as well as seeing the sun and bird light up.The last thing any house with children needs is something that makes a lot of noise.  I would love if ALL toys had such a soft sound.  PLEASE toy makes stop making loud toys.  Don't listen to all these crazy people who want more noise in their life!
