Overall I really like this. My daughter hates car rides so I needed something to distract and amuse her. The toys are all really cute, she likes the rattle the most though, and I'm not really sure what the point of the mirror is, it's tiny and blurry, but my biggest complaint is this thing is suppose to be held togther by magnets, I wouldn't mind if it actually stayed together, but it's suck a pain because everytime I pull the carseat out it comes undone. I actually recently just tied it in a knot, my daughter loves it, I just wish it wasn't so easy to undo.Update: Due to my frustration with the magnets I stopped using this, my mom got me the Bright Starts Hop Along Carrier Toy Bar and both my daughter and I like that one a lot better, she played with it a lot more. So save your money on this one and find something that stays strapped on
