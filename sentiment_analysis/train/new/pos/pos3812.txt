One of the best teethers my son has. We both love the material this is made of. Its very soft and smooth on the gums, something he can sink his gums into. Its a perfect size for his mouth, and he can easily hold it by putting his thumb through the hole. It being a necklace is great too, it looks decent with nearly any outfit, but it can also be used to hang on highchairs and strollers and such.
