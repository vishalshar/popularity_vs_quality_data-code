WubbaNub quickly became a favorite in my house (after years of me saying how unnecessary the attached animal was!). We always have two in the crib, one downstairs, and at least one extra clean on in case something gets the others dirty! Backups while they are being washed is a must. I'm on my third child now and some of these are still going strong- I just tear the pacifier out and sew a new one in when the old one becomes too worn! I wash them in the washing machine, then rinse the pacifier after the wash and air dry (do not put in dryer). When my middle child started biting the tips her pacifier we cut the pacifier out and she still sleeps with/plays with the animal. They aren't as cheap as a pack of plain pacifiers, but they're easier to find in the middle of the night, you can tuck them under straps in strollers to help prevent them from being dropped, and they are just so darn cute!
