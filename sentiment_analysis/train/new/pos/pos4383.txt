Received this yesterday and really like it overall. I bought it for the purpose of having a variety of things my twins can chew on for teething. For a toy it's excellent, but it seems to me to be bit of a stretch to call it a teething toy because only the small hands are made for teething/ chewing. Overall my twins love it. Great sensory beginner toy.They love all the bright colors and especially the rings on the two bottom bear legs.
