It's difficult to purchase toys for a baby since they're frequently only interested in the box in which the toy arrives!  This toy is reasonable and my daughter does enjoy the "bugs".  She's probably a little too young (9 mos) to appreciate putting the bugs into the bucket via the slots in the lid and she really doesn't "catch" the bugs using the included net.  But the bugs are a great size and fun shapes for little hands and mouths.  I like that they all have different textures and sounds (rattles).  The firefly is a nice addition, but it is sometimes difficult to get the light to come on (more strength needed than a baby has to whack it against something to trigger the light).Overall it was a decent purchase, but I think more toys should have just a half-step up in quality so that I wouldn't worry about the seams/rattly bits when washing them for baby.
