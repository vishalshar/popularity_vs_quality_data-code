I purchased the ABC plate a year and a half ago. At first I only hand washed it, afraid that the adorable design would fade if I washed it in the dishwasher. I have a dishwasher that is notorious for eating the designs off of glass and plastics. Over time and out of convenience, I started washing it in the dishwasher, and so far, the design has held and it looks almost brand new! The suction ring works wonderfully, unless your little one figures out where the tab is and pulls it up. Mine didn't. He's now 3 and its still great to use because he still knocks things off of the table by accident. I always remove the suction right before washing it, and have never had a problem getting it back on, or with mildew. This plate is used daily and washed daily in the dishwasher. I also purchased the sippy cup in the garden pattern. It's printed design hasn't held up so well, so I can see that there is a difference in printing quality across the line. The ABC fork and spoon have held up well, but there is a little fading in that printing. Also, this is after 1.5 years of daily use and abuse! I will be purchasing these products again for my daughter. Quality items with no cracks or breaking after 1.5 years, I'm sold!!!
