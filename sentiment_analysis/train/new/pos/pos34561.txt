The boy ones were out of stock and I almost didn't buy these but I'm so glad I did! Put them on my kids on Monday morning when we got to Disney and peeled them off Saturday before we left. Completely legible and perfect from start to finish. They swam in the pool each night and had daily baths too with no issues.
