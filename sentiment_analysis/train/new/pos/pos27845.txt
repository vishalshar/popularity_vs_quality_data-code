My husband and I just received this pack n play as a gift for our first child which is expected in a few months.  This review is based on our experience with it so far in setting it up and playing with it.  Seeing as our little one is not born yet, she has not put it through the full test.Pros:Easy to put together - Out of the box, everything snaps together very easily and as long as you read the instructions on the order to do everything, it all works great.Seems very durable - It passed my husbands aggressive shake test and the changing table attachment feels pretty sturdy.Plays music - even though the volume isn't very loud, its an appropriate volume for baby while sleeping.  It comes with classical and nature sounds.Storage space - love the fact that it has so much storage space when using the higher level attachment.  We are planning to use it for diapers and things for downstairs.Cons:Doesn't all fit in the travel bag - I know that the changing table and the mobile would likely not fit in the travel case but I did expect the higher level attachment to fit.  Literally the only things that fit in the travel case are the pack n play itself and the mattress.  It's really not that big of a deal but I image if you were flying, it would be an issue.Mobile doesn't spin - Not really sure what I was expecting here.  Don't know why I thought it would spin on it's own but you have to flick it with your finger for it to go around a few times and it stops.  Again, not a big deal, just FYI.Overall:We are satisfied with the pack n play and are excited to see how the little one likes it.I'll try to update the review once she has had a chance to put it through its paces.
