I am so glad that I got this to add to my SuperYard.  Being a grandma who takes care of our grandson every day, I was always afraid of falling either in or out of yard.  But now all that fear is gone.  The gate is so easy to open and close with one hand.  Yes as some reviewers stated sometimes it is difficult to close latch.  But that is because the whole yard gets shifted, out of whack, just readjust and it will shut.  My grandson still hasn't figured out the latch himself.  I can even leave the gate open and he crawls in and out.  The little bump from the gate frame he has to crawl over is not an issue.  I however it did take a few minutes to figure out how to configure the gate extension into my 6 panel configuration. I chose to use the 6 panels instead of the recommended replacing 2 panels with the gate and have the whole yard only 6 panels.  I wanted more space for him roam and not feel confined.
