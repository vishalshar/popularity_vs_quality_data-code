Bought this product because the car seat I was buying did not come with strap covers and as noted in many reviews, the straps are tight on the neck, which turns out they are.  Anyway, these are very, very soft.  And cute. I will note that they are actually a darker brown (strap covers) than they appear in the picture on the website.  It's pretty much all a uniform color, the same brown as the dog head.  But that was not a problem.  My son who is nearly 3 really likes them and for now doesn't try to pull them off.  They work as expected to protect his neck from the straps and are soft against his skin.
