Got these set for my daughter and its a nicely made bib and burp cloth. It's pretty thick so normal milk, drool, or spit does not go through onto her shirt. Despite what someone else said about shrinking, I have washed this more than 15 times and have not had a shrinking problem. You just have to be sure to dry it on a delicate cycle. Its also stain resistant I've used stain remover to remove the stains from my daughter's milk or iron vitamin (which is a nasty brown color) and has easily come off you just have to be sure to  treated right away. Would recommend this product!!!!
