I am one those moms who does not purchase anything without checking the reviews. When I saw this walker assistant I was amazed with the price and of course the colours since I have a baby boy and was looking for something colourful. I have checked almost all the similar items and took $5.00 risk - including shipping- and absolutly loved it! My LO is 8 months old and 18 pounds. He has long legs. Since you can adjust the height, I am not concerning about if he will grow in or not. I take him to our short- daily walks with this assistant. Ordering the second one for my neighbour.Higly recommended if you already have back pain to carriying your LO all the time.
