My baby tends to eat her books so I thought a cloth book would be safer to give her. It's cute but very simple, just teaching A, B and C (no other letters) and 1, 2 and 3 (no other numbers). What did impress me was that when I commented on how my number "1" had been sewed on upside-down (very upsetting for an anal gal like me) they sent me a new one right away. That kind of customer service is rare these days!
