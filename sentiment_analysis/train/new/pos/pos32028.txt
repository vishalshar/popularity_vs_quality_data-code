Another great OXO product. We used to keep smaller resealable packs, but the brand we normally use at home doesn't have the smaller packs, so we had to get a different brand for the diaper bag. Why should I spend more on wipes I'd rather not use and have to use the annoying packs they come in? This solved the problem! The pop-up lid makes it much easier to access the wipes than trying to open a bag, especially when you only have one free hand to do this. Has a pretty slim profile so it doesn't take up too much room in the diaper bag, but has enough room to accommodate a fair number of wipes. The design prevents wipes from drying out. I've had wipes in it for weeks and haven't noticed any drying out. I also like the option to wrap it around the stroller bar for easy access. Highly recommend this!
