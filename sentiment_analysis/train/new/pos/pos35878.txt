I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend so much money on what looked like just regular baby wipes. But reading the ingredients and confirming it was in fact not the same and being sick of having to rinse my pump stuff in the bathroom sink at work I went for it. Glad I did. I use these around midday and then wash when I get home, it works great. But you will want to give it some time to dry before using.
