I wanted a nasal aspirator that was clear so I could make sure there was no mold growing inside it. This is it. I also wanted to be able to take it apart so I could thoroughly clean and dry it. You can do that with this nasal aspirator. I would say the suction is very slightly less than that of the bulb style nasal aspirators (like you receive from the hospital). The key to using this aspirator is that you have to place two fingers on the little bumps (finger pads) that are located around the tip. Then you place a thumb on the bottom of the aspirator and push from the bottom of the bulb. Your two fingers on the tip will hold the bulb together as you create suction. You do not push the two sides of the bulb together. If you do that, the tip of the aspirator will fall off and you won't have any suction. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it's totally worth it to have an aspirator that you can clean/dry. I actually find that because the sucking action is more gentle, my baby's nose gets less irritated from this aspirator. Love this thing and have already recommended it to friends with newborns.
