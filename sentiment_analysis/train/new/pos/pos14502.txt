Love this for the Graco Travel Lite Crib with Stages.  I've had it over a year for our daughter, but have been wanting to write a review for the past couple months because I have found THE answer to a "sheet" for this thing.  For over a year I either used a large bath towel or a full size crib sheet tucked around it.  As you can imagine, it d k dnt stay tucked in very well, but served the purpose for the most part.  I had read how some people used king size pillow cases on it, but I couldn't get them to fit over it.  What fits this mattress perfectly is a changing pad cover!!!!!!!! Absolutely perfect fit! I was so excited to have discovered this! Maybe this is old news, but I looked all over when I bought it for comments of what people found to fit it and I never saw it mentioned.  Hope this helps someone!
