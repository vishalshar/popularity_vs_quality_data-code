I love this cup however, I have noticed that when juice sits out and becomes room temperature, it somehow creates pressure inside the cups and it leaks out of the straw and air vent.  Other than that, these cups are great.  They almost don't leak at all when being used.  The size of the straw is a bit wider than a normal straw which made it easier for my son to learn to use it (he was exclusively breastfed and had trouble learning to drink from a straw).  I love that the handles collapse and that the cap cover the straw to keep clean.  I have not put them in the dishwasher so I can't attest to how the hold up in the dishwasher.  I normally wash them with a bottle brush.  The straw is easy to remove and put back together.  The straw cover also comes off and snaps back in place easily.
