Bought this for my 17month old because I was constantly going in his room to put a blanket on him at night. NOT ANYMORE! I love this thing! Keeps him nice and cozy all night no matter how much he moves. Bought size (L) 12-18months and fits great. It is supposed to be baggy, so pay no-attention to those other reviews of it fitting 4 year olds and so on.. That's the way it's supposed to be (like a blanket), my son can still walk/waddle in it and he's only 32" tall. It being baggy is also a plus because I won't need to buy a bigger size for a few seasons! Love love love this sleep sack!!
