LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE COLORS!  It was such a challenge to find a brag book for my daughter that wasn't pink.  I hate the color pink and also just think it is overly used for girl items and it is obnoxious.  So what a breath of fresh air this brag book option was for us.  It would be cute if it would incorporate a few pages between the clear photo pages that could be used for attaching mementos or a space to hold a CD containing more images or even video of the new baby.The item arrived quickly; within 3 days of my order being placed.  The item was as described on the product page.  The product was packaged well with large-sized bubble wrap surrounding the item; to ensure it arrived safely.  The package was intact without any smashed corners, upon arrival.
