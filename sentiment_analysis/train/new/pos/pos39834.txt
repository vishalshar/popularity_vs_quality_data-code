I got this as a gift for my newborn. At first, I used the sheep app as soothing music for my baby to fall asleep when he was in a bassinet in our bedroom. It worked well but so did other sound machines so couldn't say this was the amazing feature. The amazing feature is the black and white app to classical music. I used the tummy time stand and played it for him around 5 months and he was amazed. This toy would entertain him for a long time and the blue spinning wheel adds the needed interaction with the toy. As he got older, all the playtime apps were entertaining him and this is the go to toy when I need to do something and have him be by himself. We still  use it all the time and he is one year old. This is my go-to shower present.Cons: Horrible battery life and requires 2 D batteries.
