I bought these blankets when my second son was born, because none of the blankets that I used for my first son would stay put when I swaddled him. These were the closest I could find to what the hospital used and they worked great. Now that my son has outgrown the swaddling stage, I use them to cover us when I'm nursing and as an extra sun cover for the stroller (just clothes pin it to the stroller shade!). They are very light weight and good for warm weather, and small enough to pack in a small diaper bag or purse.
