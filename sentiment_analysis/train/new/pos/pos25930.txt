This is a cute, convenient set. I like how well the bowls stack together and take up very little room. The colors are exactly as pictured. I have washed all bowls and spoons on the top rack of my dishwasher many times and have had no problems. The spoon is easy for little hands to hold, and soft on baby's gums. This was my baby's first feeding set and at first the bowls were way too big, but she grew into them after only a month! She loves them a bit too much - keeps wanting to play with them rather than eat. Especially the spoons. Makes mealtime fun!
