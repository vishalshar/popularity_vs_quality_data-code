I got this stroller specifically for a trip to Disney World.  It was great in the airport, my husband pushed the twins while I corralled our 4 year old, and we got to gate-check it.  It was great in Disney too!  We went to the park for 12 hours, which meant the twins (9 months) napped in the strollers as well.  It reclined enough for that to be possible.  It was manuverable, easy for one person to push, and we had built in cup holders for our drinks and zippered pockets for snacks and such.  Also, I find that I kick the wheels or cross bar with a standard umbrella stroller, and have hated every one I've used for our older son.  I never once kicked this stroller while pushing it, it was really comfortable to push!  You can't store much in the underneath storage (certainly not a diaper bag), but it's enough for a couple jackets for the babies or some extra diapers.  (We ended up just hanging the diaper bag on the handles - it was fine.)Overall a great buy!
