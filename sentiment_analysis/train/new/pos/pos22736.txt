We have a stove with a knob that turns on the oven with the slightest brush; unfortunately the stove is right next to the sink, so it was way too easy to turn on the oven by accident with a bump of the hip.  The Kid Kushion was perfect for this purpose.  Now the knob can still be turned, but it has to be done with deliberation rather than by accident.The Kid Kushion is a piece of thick, clear plastic or rubber, that can be slipped on either from the top or by pulling off and then replacing the knob.Not sure that this would be ideal for little kids though, since we can still turn the knob.
