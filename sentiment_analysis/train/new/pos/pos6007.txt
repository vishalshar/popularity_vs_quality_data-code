I love these! The colors are beautiful and bright! My son was bumping his head in the night multiple times and I know padded bumpers aren't recommended anymore, but when he gets moving more I can take them out- it's what the instructions say to do anyway- These completely solved our nighttime head bumping problem and this desperate mama got some sleep!!!Bottom line: I would highly recommend these!
