I've tried a bunch of different types of baby nail clippers, and this is my favorite.  My first (a green one) lasted for about a year and half before the LED died, so I've just ordered a second (we were sent the blue one this time).  The top part that flips up is not as flimsy-feeling as some of the other models (even others made by Safety 1st).  The light is extremely bright, enough that I can see to clip my infant's nails while he's sleeping, even if the room is dark.  My only negative is that it can be a little hard to maneuver the clip behind the nail, due to how much the plastic juts around the clippers, so it can take a few attempts to align perfectly (unlike "regular" adult nail clippers), though perhaps this is the intention because it prevents erroneously cutting the skin around the nail.  If the holder was just a little bit shorter to allow for more precision, it would be perfect.
