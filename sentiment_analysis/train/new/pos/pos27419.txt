I tried virtually all of the non-spill sippy cups out there, from cheap to expensive. I ended up buying about 10 more of these (and the bigger ones), and tossing the rest, because:They don't spill. Even when my toddler bangs them on his tray table/shakes them upside down, they generally do not let out the liquid (the ones with softer spouts, that are more like bottles, would spill all over if banged/pushed on).They are easy(er) to clean. I still have to take out the valve from the lid, but it's only one plastic piece, not many.The lids and valves for the 2 sizes are interchangeable, so I don't have to keep track of anything.My son can hold them no problem.I like the bright colors. My son likes to pick which one he wants.My only slight suggestions:Make the measurement (oz) label a bit easier to read.
