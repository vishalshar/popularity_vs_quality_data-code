This is the end of your hunt for diaper bags.  My wife has a closet full of trial and error bags, once we got this it was the end of buying bags.  Plenty of storage with the main pockets for diapers and wipes for our 2 kids different sizes.  The can cooler is awesome for small snacks to extend your stay out of the house.  This will be used after the kids no longer need a diaper bag for whatever trips we go on.
