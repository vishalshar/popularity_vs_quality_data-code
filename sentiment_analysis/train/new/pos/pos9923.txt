Our 7 month old has had these turtle bath toys for almost three months now and he LOVES them. We even take them out of the bath so he can continue to play with them. They are the perfect size for little hands to grab and the bright colors catch their eyes! I love the variety between the turtles - one has a mirror, one has a rotating middle with two colors and one acts like a rattle. Our son has chewed and tossed them but they are still in perfection condition! They do not fill up with water so no worrying about them sinking!
