I live overseas in a house with no central air and no thermostat. My son was born in the summer and I felt our room was too hot to have our new baby sleep in there, nevermind having to be swaddled and be in there. My husband insisted it was fine. At the time, this was the only practical item I could find that would mail to an FPO address, so despite some of the reviews, I bought it. It said our room was 80 degrees, which did not surprise me at all. In the office/extra room, a new room air conditioning unit had been installed, which told you the temperature of the room. I tried several different times with different temperatures and the egg was always within a few degrees (it was hard to be exact because the wall unit was in Celsius). Having this information, we were able to get the unit in our room fixed.Now that he is in his own room (without a wall unit) and it's winter, it's very helpful to see how cold the room is getting and how hot the radiator or space heater is getting.I don't necessarily agree with what they say an ideal temperature is, but that doesn't really matter. I can see the temperature and make my own opinion. I do agree if it's red, it's too hot and if it's blue, it's too cold. I just saw that another brand has developed a thermometer that comes with a monitor. That would be extremely helpful- so I don't get worried in the middle of the night and sneak in his room to look at the temperature in there.As for accuracy and working the way described...I'm sorry it has not worked for some people, but it has worked great and has been a tremendous help to us.
