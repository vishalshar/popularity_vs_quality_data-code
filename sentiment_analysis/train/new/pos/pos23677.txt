This is our second gator purchase. it only worked for about 2 weeks then the motor died. Luckily, the vendor at Sensory Junction was wonderful, and sent us out a new one right away that they tested first. My daughter loves the oral stimulation. The variable speed ring for adjusting gets stuck sometimes, but compared to what else is out there, this is a great value and fun sensory toy.
