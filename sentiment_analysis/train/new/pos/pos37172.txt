Love these! I can't use baby wipes on my little ones face when we are out & about so these work great in a ziplock bag wet for his face. As well as bum wipes...we use cloth diapers, so I just wash them all with the diapers/covers/pail liners/travel wet bag. So far they are holing up well & the terry cloth side adds that little extra scrub power for really dirty diaper changes sometimes necessary! I would recommend getting at least 4 packs if u plan on using these exclusively for bum wipes & don't want to buy disposible.I found various recipes online to add to the wipes & then store in a baby an old wipe container. Enough for 2 days worth only get wet/store...too many and they will get funny smell wet in a container.
