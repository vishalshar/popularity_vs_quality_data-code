I absolutely love these. I just received them, I tested them with water, put the lid on, and it did not leak!Make sure you read the instructions.  The lid and bowl where they make contact must be dry before closing the container to ensure an air right seal.  After u put he lid on, and match the shape,  push the middle button to create suction.  I tested it and water doesn't drip after that! To open, squeeze the middle button and release lid.Do not microwave with lid on.  Dishwasher safe but try to wash or rinse by hand immediately after food is removed from the container so that the smell doesn't linger.  I believe u can boil it if the smell sticks.
