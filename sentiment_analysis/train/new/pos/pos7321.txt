We loved our infant bjorn but as our baby got heavier, we needed more back support. Babybjorn has several carriers with back support and this one happened to be the least expensive. We liked that it was essentially the same way to put on as the infant carrier (so we didn't have to learn something new). The back support definitely works, but there's still a lot of pressure on the shoulder. However, I don't think that's because the carrier isn't supportive, I think it's just because the baby is so much heavier!I took this carrier on an overseas flight recently and I have to say that although it was helpful, it was really inconvenient because it is SO BIG! The two pieces together are really thick and did not fit into my already full backpack. It was really like another piece of luggage when I wasn't using it to carry the baby. So if you're thinking about using this on a flight, I would think again and opt for a simple cloth carrier that can fold small.Otherwise, I think this is a great carrier and worth the price!
