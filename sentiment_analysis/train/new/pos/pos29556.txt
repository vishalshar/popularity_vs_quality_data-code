I LOVE this carseat, we used it for about 7 months then my little dude was too long for the seat. We switched to the Peg-Perego Convertible seat which is awesome too. I really liked that you are able to adjust the strap height without having to rethread the straps. Another really interesting thing that I've noticed about the seat/base is that there are two straps to tighten the latch where other seats (graco) have just one. It makes it a lot easier to tighten into the car.
