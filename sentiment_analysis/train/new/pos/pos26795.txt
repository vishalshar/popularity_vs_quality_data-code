We moved our youngest into our toddler's old car seat and moved our toddler into this one.  He was extremely excited to be getting a new car seat and so far he has really liked it.  I based my car seat choice on a number of factors.  One being the toxicity of the item.  This item was satisfactory and I wanted to stick to this brand since I have had good luck with it in the past.  [...]The push button to loosen the straps on this seat is better than the old "tether" version on our previous Graco car seat (it is just more comfortable, quicker, and less fumbling).  The colors are cute too, if that matters.  I love the fact that this is the last car seat we will ever have to buy for him, since it converts to a booster that will hold up to 100 pounds.  My husband doesn't care for the reclining aspect, but our son finds it much more comfortable and he's the one who has to sit (and sometimes nap) in it.  I would recommend it.
