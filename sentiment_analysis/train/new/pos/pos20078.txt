We have a very large Pri Euro baby bath tub, which we absolutely love, but it has a slippery bottom and my daughter was starting to scoot and would fall over or trying to stand and would fall down in it constantly.  The water would splash her face each time and it would startle her to where she wanted out of the tub immediately. We went from loving bath time to hating it. I was ready to trash the Euro tub until I found these wonderful little whale bath mats.  They are SUPER-CUTE and fit in the bottom of her baby bath tub perfectly.  (You will need to order more sets if you are wanting to fill a regular size tub.)  My daughter likes the whales and tries to lift them off of the bottom of the tub, but she has been unsuccessful so far (she's 9 months).  These little whale bath mats did wonders for our baby bath tub.  Our baby is no longer sliding, slipping and falling around in the tub and we're back to playing and loving bath time again!  LOVE THESE!
