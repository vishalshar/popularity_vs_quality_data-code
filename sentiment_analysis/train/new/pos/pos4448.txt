This tubing is much more flexible than the other tubing I had been using, which leads to fewer kinks.  I like it a lot.  The only thing I couldn't figure out at first is that the tubing comes with connectors on both ends, and you don't need the connectors on both ends for the Pump in Style Advanced.  If that is the pump you're using, just cut off the triangle-shaped set of connectors and attach it directly to your pump.  This is a good product and I'm glad I went with Medela brand as opposed to an off-brand.
