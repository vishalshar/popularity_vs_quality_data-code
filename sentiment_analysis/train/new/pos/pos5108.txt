Great brush set for narrow necked bottles.  (Works perfectly with our Dr Brown's).  Only problem is bigger bottle brush wears down after a few months of use.  We use these a lot though bc I have twins and they are exclusively bottle fed (12 to 14 bottles a day!).  The smaller nipple brush is the best one I've ever tried so far!  Much better to clean with than the ones from Munchkin or plastic nubby ends of other bottle cleaners.  I would buy this set again just for the nipple cleaner.
