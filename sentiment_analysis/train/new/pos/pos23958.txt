Once you use it properly this product is amazing.  Unfortunately the instructions that come with it are pretty awful.Through trial and error I discovered that the following two steps are essential for eliminating the odor problem:1) seal the dirty item very well.  I use this product to dispose of my dog's wee-wee pads, not diapers, but they can smell pretty bad.  I figured out how to fold up the soiled wee-wee pad so smells don't escape and then I put a little tape to keep it sealed.  Diapers probably don't require this extra step since they already have built-in tape you can use.2) when you deposit the diaper/pad make sure to return the handle to its original resting position.  When I first got the Diaper Champ I put the pad in, flipped the handle, and left the handle in that position.  BIG MISTAKE since the side of the piston that usually faces the pads/diapers stinks, thereby defeating the purpose.Once you put the pad in the cavity, flip the handle so the piston pushes the pad down, and then you return the handle/top to its original "resting" position. The smelly side of the piston continues to face the stinky pads/diapers and the clean, non-stinky side remains on top.Before getting this product I had to make many trips to the garbage chute.  Since getting the Diaper Champ I throw out the bag about once a week.  It's great!!
