I was given a few small sizes of this bottle while I was expecting my fifth child. I was happy with it, and it didn't seem to cause nipple confusion ( I breastfeed 99% of the time) Normally when my baby is weaned and ready for a big bottle, I buy the cheap 3 in a pack ones from the store that rhymes Balmart. However after going through about 10 of those having the nipples cracking, I returned to these. I am happy with them. They are sturdy and do not leak easily. There is just one con. These bottles as well as every bottle on the planet are impossible to find in my house when the baby really really needs it!
