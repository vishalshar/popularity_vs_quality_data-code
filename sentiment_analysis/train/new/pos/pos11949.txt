Like a lot of you considering this purchase, we have a nice, sturdy stroller [ours is a bugaboo] that is a real hassle to transport and takes up a lot of space in the car.  So, we bought this stroller for travel.  We didn't expect much for $16 bucks but were impressed.  Here are the pros: it is very lightweight; it is very easy to close; it takes up minimal space once collapsed.  Also, it "handles" surprisingly well.  While it certainly isn't as smooth of a ride as the bugaboo, it is smooth enough for my daughter to fall asleep in when being strolled.  An added plus is that, so far, the stroller has proven quite durable.  We've taken it on a a few long walks/hikes and had no issues (our child is about 24 pounds).  Here are the cons: the handles are a little low so I would imagine that really tall people find it somewhat unconfortable to push for significant distances; it looks like it costs $16 as the fabric is somewhat cheap-looking.  Overall, we are very happy with the purchase. We leave it in the car and it has made outings MUCH easier.
