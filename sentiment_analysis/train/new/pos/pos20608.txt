My seatbelt chokes me.  I have used the plastic clips before and they work well, but the plastic always breaks.  I found this item and love it.  It is very easy to take on and off or adjust, and it keeps the seatbelt off of my neck.  And it won't break either.  I bought one for my mother and she loves hers as well.
