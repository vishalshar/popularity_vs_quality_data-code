I have a love/hate relationship with these blankets.  I have used them since my children were born and they eventually became loveys and are still carried around and snuggled with daily.  The problem is the outer border - it falls apart or off or both.  Some colors are worse than others.  I have replaced these blankets repeatedly, have given my children options to pick a different blanket, ANY other blanket - but they want what they want and it must be the Moby.  Blanket is great otherwise - soft, washes well, cool and warm, and really a perfect size from infant to preschooler.
