We had a bumbo but my little man's chubby legs didn't fit comfortably.  The base on this seems sturdier than the bumbo and my 17# 5 month old loves sitting in the baby snug.  He will be able to use this for a long time to come.  I worried about my sin being able to tip the bumbo but not the baby snug.  Sturdier and much longer life span.
