This is the only bottle my son loved from the very beginning.The shape of the nipple is great and he could drink the entire bottle quite fast. When he grew older we switched nipples to silicone spouts.Both bottle and spouts are outstanding quality. There is no leaking, colors are holding great during initial boiling and once a week dishwasher sanitizing. Also the spouts are last for months, although my son is not a big chewer, maybe that's the case?The shape of the bottle is great for little hand too, easy for babies to feed themselves.Also we were heating up the milk in the bottle in the microwave several times a day and no problems (of course a lot of shaking to avoid hot spots).We went only 2 bottles for about 9 months, and they look almost like new with several everyday washings. But I knew it was a time to replace them.Highly recommended.
