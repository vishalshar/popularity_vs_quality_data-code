This product loses one star because of the initial plastic smell.  The smell wore off in a few days and I thought that was a fair trade-off for the easy clean up this cover provides.  I used to have the cloth ones with the plastic in between, but when I washed it, the water sat inside of it and was a mess coming out of the washer.  I'd have to go outside and literally dump out water before hanging or putting in the dryer.  This plastic one is SO MUCH EASIER!  Remove soiled sheet, wipe down the plastic liner without having to remove it, and put on a clean sheet.  It's a little loose, (not a snug fit), but I prefer it that way because I don't have to fight to get it on the mattress.  I simply tuck the bit of excess material underneath a bit more.  I WOULD buy again.
