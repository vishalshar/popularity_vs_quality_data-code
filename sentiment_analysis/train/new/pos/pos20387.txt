I was looking for an orthodontic Pacifier for my baby girl and this is the one. It is all in one piece so I don't have to worry about the nipple coming off and causing a choking hazard. Also my bottle nipples are not orthodontic and this prevents confusion for me figuring out if she wants to suck or is ready to feed, she just spits it out or makes her "yucky" face. Even if she is hungry she will keep this in her mouth longer when I am making a bottle so there is less crying witch I think is better for her and me. The flat part is a bit big for a 6 week old and it comes close to covering up her nose, it doesn't cover her nose but I would not give it to her right now if she was rolling over. When she does start rolling over I'm sure it will fit her face better but of course I will double check. I compared the flat piece to the Avent pacifier that I have and the Avent is bigger but the Green Sprouts curves in causing it to look like it is closer to the nose. My husband has been unable to find this twice this week when he was with her early in the morning and I usually keep it in her bassinet by her feet while she is sleeping. I know where it is so I have not had this issue but when she gets old enough to grab it there might be a problem trying to keep track. Also the handle part of this will probably be good for using when she starts to teethe. I'm adding another order of these to my cart right now.
