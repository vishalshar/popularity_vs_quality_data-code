So my 10mo old can use a straw cup but doesn't know how to tilt up a regular cup yet.  I think I've bought every one they make, so here's my review:Nuby Flip-N-Sip: Strong valve so no leaks, hard to suck.  She got frustrated very easily with this originally and I even find it hard to suck.  She doesn't seem to get these handles.Munchkin Click Lock Flip Top: Medium valve, no leaks, no handles which we seem to need. Fairly easy suck. One of our go-to's for water.Munchkin Click Lock Straw: Light valve, no leaks, no handles. Easy suck. Likes to chew on the straw. One of our go-to's for water.Munchkin Click Lock Weighted Straw: Light valve, no leaks (unless you don't screw lid on correctly), loves handles, likes to chew on the straw, weight works well. If you squeeze the straw while running water through the weight you can clean it pretty well.  Comes with a straw cleaner.  I like that it's clear.  First cup she'll drink milk out of.  I think this is our favorite. Sometimes I kind of prime it for her with the first drink. Wish it had oz markings.Zo-li Bot Straw: No valve but closed straw so easy suck, leaks only if tossed just right on the floor, dribbles a bit if on side otherwise (similar to nipple), easy to hold handles, comes with a straw cleaner.  She's not keen on milk in it but drinks water well. I like that it's clear and has oz markings.Lollacup: No valve, open straw, easiest suck.  This is just a cup with a straw.  The straw may have a weight on it but it's short and stiff and doesn't move.  She likes it.  I haven't tried milk in it.
