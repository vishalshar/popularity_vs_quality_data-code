These are awesome!  We've been using them 5 days a week for about 3 months now and haven't had any problems.  With a 3 y/o that says a lot about their durability!  When I pull them out of my son's lunch box at the end of the day they are still at least still half frozen through.  They are just the right size for a kid's lunch box too.  I highly recommend.
