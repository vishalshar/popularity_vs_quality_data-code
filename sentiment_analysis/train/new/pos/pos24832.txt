This blanket is warm and fluffy (a good thing as we live in the tiptop of North Dakota -just outside of Canada) and as soft as you could ever want it to be. It's appearance is well represented by the image given, and this has become my favorite blanket to use for our youngest child. I have a mess of more children, and blankets around here get washed A LOT. It has been washed many times now, the colors have not faded and the blanket has retained it's fluffy soft composure. The price *almost deterred me from buying it because so many baby blankets don't stand up to multiple washes, but this one does fine.
