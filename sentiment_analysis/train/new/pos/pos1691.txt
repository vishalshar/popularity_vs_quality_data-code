My 3.5 year old son has the turtle version of this and he absolutely loves it.  It really helps him want to go to sleep at night.So, when I saw the lady bug version on amazon, I decided to buy it for my daughter.  She is now 9 months old, and she loves hers as well.  I think it sooths her to look at all the stars at night.  Plus when I was getting up at night to nurse her, I would click on her lady bug, and it gave me just enough light to see to get around her room, but not too distracting to wake her up.  I love this!  I need one for my room!  lol
