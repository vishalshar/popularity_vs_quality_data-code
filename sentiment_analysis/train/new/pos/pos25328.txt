We just bought this for our little one due in September.  I can't say much about the durability since it's just been in the nursery but the quality of the fabric and stitching is good, the colors are beautiful and the skirt and sheet fit our crib and mattress perfectly.  We have it in a yellowish cream painted room with a dark espresso/cherry crib and it looks lovely.  The colors in the skirt and comforter made it super easy to shop for extra sheets, a breathable bumper and decor since sage, light blue, light or dark pink, yellow, cream and white ALL match this set.
