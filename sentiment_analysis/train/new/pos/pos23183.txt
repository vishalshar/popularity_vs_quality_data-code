Received the carrier in the mail 2 days after I ordered it. I have been using it on my one month old for a couple of weeks now and LOVE it. My baby cries every time he's put down, I was having a hard time tending to my other children and doing chores, etc. so thought I'd give a carrier a try. I didn't want to spend a lot on a carrier not knowing how we would like it, so for the price, I definitely thought we'd give this one a try. So glad we did! Although, when I first opened the bag, a very small strap just fell/broke off right away. Not sure where it goes!? It didn't affect the carrier, so not really sure what's up with that.. I wear this off and on all day, it's not too uncomfortable, but my back will sometimes be sore the next day. Anyway, now that I know my baby likes being put in a carrier and we will be using one quite often, I think I'll invest in an Ergo!
