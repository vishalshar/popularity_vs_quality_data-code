Between myself and my three siblings, there are 7 little ones so I have been around many highchairs, and I must say this is the best of them all.  I thought my last highchair was amazing, but I love this one even more!  It MUST be the easiest highchair to fold up and to open, and the prettiest one too!  It also folds up really flat.  I am able to unfold it with one hand while holding the baby in the other.  As far as cleaning, the fabric seems really easy to keep clean, unlike some that my siblings have where you HAVE to remove the fabric and wash it because the fabric can't really be wiped well.  I see in the reviews that others think it is a problem that you can only spot clean, but I have never removed the covers off of my other highchairs for cleaning.  I have always only spot cleaned.  I mean, if you are feeding your baby spaghetti, then maybe you can lay a towel over the back and bottom of the seat for extra protection from stains.  I find the tray to be super easy too.  It easily slides back and forth giving you as much room as you need to take the baby out without having to remove the tray - also waaaay easier than my last highchair!  I rarely leave reviews on items, but I just had to share how awesome this chair is.  It is amazing quality for an unbeatable price.  Even if the most expensive chair were given to me, I would still buy this one instead.
