We purchased this product for my son's 9 months birthday to give him some freedom & mobility. I was disappointed at first when I realized that the walker was already too small for him. Even though he is a very small child (5th percentile by weight), he happens to be kind of long (21.5 inches). Even on the highest setting, the baby just stood there hovering above the walker. BUT, in a few attempts, he figured out how to move about and has been unstoppable ever since. He just squills in excitement while he runs around the kitchen in it. He is 10 months now and I can see that we can definitely use it for another month or two. The only thing I regret is not purchasing it when he was 7 months or so.
