I gave this item 5 stars because it performs well, is cheap, and was described accurately.  It is basically a specially-sized, handled bag with an attached absorbant pad to soak up wetness.  I really loved these for our recent week-long backpacking trip around Europe.  I liked the convenience of having the bags ready with the pad inside and so neatly packaged.However, for regular use we buy the smallest size of trash bags and toss a disposable nursing pad inside.  Perfect!  I keep an extra ziploc with a roll of bags and a corresponding number of nursing pads in our car at all times, replenishing as needed.  I was skeptical of the need for an absorbant pad at first, but now I prefer it.  If you aren't going to be able to dispose of the potty bag immediately, you definitely don't want to be carrying around a baggie with a cup of pee inside!I would purchase these again for a specific trip, but for everyday use I prefer the trash bag/disposable pad method.
