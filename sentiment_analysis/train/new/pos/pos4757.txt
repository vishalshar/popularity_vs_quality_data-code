It's a bit larger than I thought it would be and it looks a little awkward on the countertop.  The first one I received had pieces missing, but it was resolved immediately by the seller.  There are 4 tubular stays that hold up the hamper, and these have a tendency to fall out because of the design of the pockets.  You wouldn't want your toddler to walk around with one of these stays in hand.  Our 1-year-old doesn't quite understand that he's looking at a frog because the design is a bit abstract.  I'm keeping it because it's adequate, but I wish I had ordered something different.
