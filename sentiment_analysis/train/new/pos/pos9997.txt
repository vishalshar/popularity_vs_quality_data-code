These spoons have been great for my 6 month old. They are soft enough not to bother him but completely sturdy. If I put them down into a bowl neither the bowl or the spoon tip over.The white hot feature is great. I can stir food and if the spoon is white I don't even have to test it, I know it's going to sit for a while and wait to cool. I have run them through the dishwasher after every feeding and haven't had any discoloration or issues with the white, and it's been about a solid 2 months of use.My loved one has tried to grab the spoon and feed himself. It's certainly light and small enough for him to hold, so it's nice to be able to start to let him teach himself. Overall am I very pleased with these spoons!
