Our 6 year old daughter is in a wheel chair and still takes most of her daily nutrition in a bottle.  She can't hold her own bottle, so this product is a lifesaver.  Unfortunately it breaks on us about every 2-3 months with daily use.  There isn't really a better product out there--unfortunately-- so this is the best thing.  I usually keep a couple spares on hand so that when one breaks I'm not stuck without one.  Wish they would make this more durable.
