Love, love, love this monitor. The video quality isn't like the ones you see that cost $200+ But it at least lets me see my baby. This is my second time buying this monitor. I bought it with my first and after about a year and a half, it quit on me. Not sure what happened..... Due to "second child syndrome" I tried to be cheap and just buy a traditional baby monitor with no video. It's so annoying compared to this one. You have constant white noise and there's always something interfering with the signal and hearing baby is difficult with all the extra static mixing in. This monitor stays silent until baby starts to make noises so that way you don't have to constantly listen to any annoying whirring sounds or static. It even displays the temperature in baby's room so you can determine how comfy baby is and if any adjustments are needed. This particular monitor even has the capability of playing music for baby. It also allows two-way communication (which I don't use that often) hubby uses it more to communicate to me from the bedroom sometimes. I feel like this is the best monitor ever and would recommend it to EVERYONE!!! I obviously loved it to have bought it twice!
