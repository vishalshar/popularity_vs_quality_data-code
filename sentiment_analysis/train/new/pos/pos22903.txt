I am a mother of two, and my youngest is almost two.  I felt inclined to write a review because this diaper bag is one of my absolute favorites! I am a bit of a diaper bag hoarder and have purchased a ridiculous amount trying to find "the right one."  I have my trusty Petunia Pickle Bottom Sashay Satchel and more Ju Ju Be's than I care to admit, but I always seem to come back to my Skip Hop bags. In my opinion the Dash is not for infants, but is perfect for toddlers.  The fabric is sturdy, well-made, hides dirt, and the shoulder strap is very comfortable.  It has many pockets and I feel like everything has its place.  The outside has two front pockets, two side bottle pockets, and one back changing pad pocket.  The inside has one large slip pocket on the front side, two slip pockets on the other side, a "hidden" zippered mommy pocket, and two smaller pockets on each side that house the stroller straps but can also fit bottles or slim sippies.  One of my very favorite features is the zippered "mommy pocket" with the key clip. I also LOVE this Adler design. The black and white is stunning in real life.  It is trendy without being too loud or obnoxious.  (The white is more of a cream though) The stroller straps are genius and the bag itself is so lightweight.  Some of my other bags are heavy without anything in them.  I love the size, the multiple magnet levels of closure,  and the fact that it comes with a coordinating laminated zipper bag and change mat.  However, If I was designing this bag and I could make one change, it would be to shorten the change pad by about 1/2 inch.  It seems to be a tad long and takes a little bit of effort to get it to lay flat in the back pocket when the bag is full.  It is a minor inconvience though and not one that truly even bothers me.  As I mentioned before, I don't think this bag would be big enough for bottle fed infants or multiples.  It is perfection though for my stage in life with one toddler in diapers.
