I ordered this napmat for my 20 month old son who uses it for nap time at his daycare.  We have been very pleased with the item and were happy to see that some of the previous reviewers were incorrect about certain product features or simply had not done their research.  First, people have complained that the pillow bunches up with washing.  Since our daycare requires weekly washing I was a little concerned.  What previous reviewers apparently failed to realize is that there is an opening on the side of the mat that you fold back and the pillow insert can be quickly and easily removed prior to washing the rest. The mat itself has has held up wonderfully in the wash so far and the pillow insert does not need to be washed regularly. Second, other's have complained about the length of the mat.  I measured my child before purchasing and compaired him to the dimensions listed in the item description - voila, problem solved. Also, the mat is longer than the cots the daycare provides for the children to sleep on (the napmats go on top) so, a longer mat wouldn't matter in our case. I'm guessing the same is true for the majority of daycare users since cots are pretty standard in size. Also, I'd like to point out that this item is Disney Jr. and thus is designed for young toddlers, hence it's size.  If you have an older/bigger child I recommend choosing an item designed for older toddlers. I realize that my child will eventually grow out of this item, but I think it is perfectly reasonable to get a new nap mat every year or two, especially when it costs $15, not $40+ like most of the others out there. As far as the quality goes, the blanket is very soft and cuddly, the colors are vibrant, and the design is much less tacky than other "Cars" themed items. My only complaint is that the fabric on the mat itself is a little rough, but my son doesn't seem to mind at all. In fact, my son loves it, so who am I to complain? I hope that helps!
