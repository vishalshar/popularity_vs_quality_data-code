My 2 1/2 year old son went nuts for these immediately.  It's his favorite part of bath time.  He loves to stick the letters and numbers on the tile wall (and most of them stay stuck even after the tile dries).  The storage bag they come in is great, it suctions to the wall and keeps everything together.  These are a really good size, not too big and not too small, each piece is about 5 inches high.
