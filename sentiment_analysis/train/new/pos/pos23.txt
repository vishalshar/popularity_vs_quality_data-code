I gave this as gift for my friend's 6 month old boy. Jim's eyes popped out when he saw it. When he showed it to his girlfriend, the boy's mother, she was also amazed by the concept of birth certificate, curl and first tooth holder. At first, he wanted to have it engraved but I was concerned. These items are silver plated. Simply put, you don't know what metal is beneath the surface. I suggested having a small plaque engraved and affixed to the case. I also suggested placing a small piece of paper in the curl and tooth holders indicating the date each item was placed inside.  When I was born in the mid-fifties, I received silver spoons for my birth. I have two and appreciated each one. However they are not very practical and I have no knowledge as to who gave them to me. This gift, on the other hand, has a very practical function. Each holder has something special the recipient will enjoy and cherish forever.
