I started out with one rear-facing seat in my Honda Element. The Element has suicide doors, so they open up wide, the front door opens the normal way and the rear door opens to the back, so the whole opening is quite wide, with the rear seats set a little farther back than normal. Great for loading cargo, terrible for loading a rear-facing infant! When I started shopping for car seats, I found most of the designs available to be horrendously ugly. Not just inoffensively bad, truly awful. This seat was the winning combination of not too high in back, as well as sleek and well-styled, with fabric options that look at home in just about any interior. In fact, when my husband saw the Night Owl seat in my car, he asked if it came in black. Now he has one in Phantom in his Mini-Cooper that he's not embarrassed to drive around with. It's actually the easiest to install in his car, and fits the seat like it was designed for it. So I think it gets two thumbs up for DaddyCars, too.When it was rear-facing, I could reach over the back of it with little trouble, and now that it's facing forward I love the recline feature when my daughter falls asleep. The cup holder comes in handy for all kinds of items that would otherwise end up in the black hole that is the floor of my car, like hair clips and crayons. Now I'm starting to think about boosters, so thought I would check out the Maxi-Cosi options--I've been so happy with the seat, I'd like to stick with it as long as my daughter fits (fortunately, she's on the short side.)
