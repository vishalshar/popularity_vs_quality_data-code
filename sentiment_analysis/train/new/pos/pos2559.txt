I purchased this toy as a stocking stuffer, just a few days before Christmas, for our 8 month baby girl. Honestly, it turned out to be her favorite gift. She can roll it or shake it for a fun rattle noise. It's easy to grab, lightweight, and small enough to fit just right in her tiny little hand. Even now, a few weeks later, she's crawling around and still loves it! She crawls after it when it rolls away. It's a simple design, but well-made and solid wood. Oh, and it doubles as a wood teether! Because everything goes in her mouth, I love that this particar toy is made by Wonderworld, natural and non-toxic.
