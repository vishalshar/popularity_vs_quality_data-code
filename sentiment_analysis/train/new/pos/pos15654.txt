I purchased this set few years ago and it came with snap on lids, drinking lid etc. I did expect it to be the same, but unfortunately snap on lids are sold separately and they cost more than the cups themselves. Other than that we love, love, LOVE these cups, they are compact, portable (provided you have the snap on lid) and do the job well. Both my 4 yr old and my 1.5 yr old are avid users and have no complains. My only beef is with the oh so easy to lose snap on lids that I purchased separately from the Made for Mom website because it was cheaper than through Amazon. I wish they were better priced on Amazon, that's all.
