I got this for my youngest when she was an infant because a Lactation consultant and an occupational therapist recommended it to me as a good teether for babies who have a tongue tie or babies who don't like traditional teethers. My baby had fit under both at the time and since she was a teething four month old I decided to give it a shot. She was absolutely miserable before this arrived and the only thing that helped her a little bit was the Sophie The Giraffe teether.The minute the package arrived, I got it sterilized and ready to use. The first time I offered it to my four month old, she stuck it in her mouth, bit down and immediately stopped crying. I was shocked because it was instantaneous for her. She immediately started gnawing on it and it was very soothing for her. She used it until she was 15 months and by this time she had all of her teeth except for her two year molars.This teether is really bright and attractive to babies. Even though it is bright, it is still very easy to lose. So if you are one to lose your keys or other things that are really helpful in your life definitely buy at least two. This is a smaller teether. It kind of reminds me of a very weird pacifier but because of its design, is easy for an infant to manipulate. My favorite part about this teether is that it is as great for molor teething as it is for any of the other teething. Most teethers only work well for the front teeth but won't fit in the back of the mouth to get to those painful molars cutting through. This teether also will massage the gums which can help with pain relief.
