I love these! my kids love these!  when they see these they know they're getting a snack and its so easy for them to use (ages 1 and 6).  Good size! cute design!  easy clean! I've machine washed and dried em, and also hand washed in the sink!  Turn inside out and wash and dry and then flip to dry outside.  They dry quick! Lots of use and held up great! Ordering more for school lunch boxes!
