This table is so, so perfect. Our child is 21 months old. It is just the right size for her to color at and play on. It cleans up nicely too- I've already wiped off a ton of crayon easily! Not only is it appropriate for her, but it looks nice in our family room as well. It doesn't appear cheap like most other child tables I've looked at. It is timeless and something I look forward to having for our children for many years. It is VERY well made- sturdy! We were very impressed with the quality of the table and are so, so pleased with this purchase!! I would've expected to pay much more for a table of this quality. I would not hesitate for a moment to recommend this table to others. I'd also recommend purchasing the Gift Mark Chairs to go with this table- they are just as wonderful! :) One more thing: we received this and the chairs very quickly (and packaged appropriately)!! Even here in AK.
