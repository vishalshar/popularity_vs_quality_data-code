I purchased this wipe warmer after noticing that our newborn daughter hated the cold wipes we used when we were in the hospital. From the very first time we used wipes from this warmer, she has been a content little girl and rarely fusses when her diaper is changed now. We've been using this warmer for over a month now and have had zero issues with wipes drying out. I have noticed that the wipes aren't quite as warm as when we first started using this, but it definitely keeps them at a mild temperature that our little girl loves.I love the nightlight on this; it's illuminated by a small red light so you can easily locate it at night and it gives off the perfect amount of light so you can change a diaper but not have to turn on the main light and startle your baby (or you!). This warmer fits like a dream on the Dexbaby The Spin Changing Station, White, which fits perfectly atop the Stork Craft Avalon 6 Drawer Universal Dresser, Espresso.UPDATE: This warmer is still going strong over one year later! A tip to ensure that these wipes stay nice and warm is to add about a half-cup of water when you notice the wipes are starting to feel more mild than warm. When I've done this at night, the wipes are back to being warm by the morning.
