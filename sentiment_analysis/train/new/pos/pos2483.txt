I was doubtful when this came. The beads felt like plastic to me. I tried it on our baby though and she has been wearing it for months.When we started using it she was drooling a full bib's size worth of soaked shirt multiple times a day. We saw an immediate reduction in her drooling. The few times I've taken it off (we don't let her wear it in the bath) and forgotten to put it back on we've noticed it's missing when we pick her up and her shirt is soaked with drool.It hasn't hurt her, and it seems to have helped her, and we like the look of it.
