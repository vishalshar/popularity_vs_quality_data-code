I ordered both the regular and the jumbo nets.  The jumbos are really nice.  The hardware that comes with them is worthless.  I hung both of the jumbos and as soon as I filled them, the nails that I hadn't managed to anchor into studs pulled right out.  I anchored them into a wall and refilled them.  Then the hooks gave.  Finally, I went to the home improvement store and bought new hooks.  Much better.
