We love these for our son! We started off with the Munchkin brand snack cups, but after repeated instances of snacks all over the floor and car seat, we found these. He could get the lid off of the Munchkin ones too easily. The tops of these screw on. I'm sure he'll figure that out soon, but for now, these work so great. AND they have a lid. I don't know how many times I dumped snacks out of the old snack cups because they'd gotten stale. The lid on these just pops up so you can rotate it and snaps securely on the bottom of the cup. It stays attached to the perforated screw top so you don't have to keep track of the lid. I will say that my son has figured out how to rip the lid off, but most of the time, it stays attached without him messing with it. I don't know why I don't see more kids with these. They are the best out there!
