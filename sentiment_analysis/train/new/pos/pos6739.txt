Does the job in protecting seats.  Folds up nicely when not using.  I constantly take the seats in and out...I don't leave the seats in my car all the time so I'm very happy with them taking all the abuse I put on them.  My son has the same ones but a "step down".  I don't like his because they flex too much and you can still see creases in his leather seats.  I have not had any problems with mine sticking to the seats or causing any type of problem to my leather seats.  But, I suggest paying a little more and get the one I bought and not the cheaper one.  This time, you get what you pay for.
