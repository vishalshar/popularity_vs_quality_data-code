EVERY new breastfeeding mother needs these! The quality is quite good, and I like that you can use them as a nipple-shield or you can wear them to sort of 'ventilate' your breasts to keep them from getting raw the first few weeks you're home with baby.  I purchased these before the birth of my second child. With my first, I had major problems with nipple chapping & lots of pain, so I researched ways to prevent it or treats it.. and I sooo wish I'd have known about these the first time around b/c they have basically eliminated the problem. LOVE THEM. I plan on purchasing a set for every expecting mom I know :)
