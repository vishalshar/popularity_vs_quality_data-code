These went in a baby shower basket I made for a friend. Since I didn't use these on my baby, the only thing i can comment on is the looks. The towels as such looks nice. It's very thin but should be fine for a new born. We moms do find good use for even the thinnest of towels! The patterns and color looks lovely. I wish they had a more cuter packaging. No big deal though as I did take them off the original package and stuff in a basket with ribbon and all. :)
