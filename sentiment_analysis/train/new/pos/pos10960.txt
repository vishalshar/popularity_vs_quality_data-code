This bouncer is adorable!  I love the tan and sage tones, it kind of melts into any room it's in - not bright, not hard on the eyes, and doesn't stand out and scream BABY!  It's sweet and calming to look at.Came with assembly directions and was simple to put together, took less than 5 min.  You only need a screwdriver for the battery compartment.Bought this for my 3rd baby - thus my 3rd bouncer.  Some things I love about the Zanzibar that I haven't seen on a bouncer before:> 2 seat positions, reclined as shown in the picture or more upright> the toys detach by a velcro loop allowing you to interchange with other little toys of your own> vibration has slower and faster levels (music also has volume levels)> the frame has good bounce to it, my girl is 5wks and her little movements can bounce the seatI didn't give it 5 stars because of where the buttons are positioned.  When my baby gets bigger, she will be able to kick the buttons on and off, which may or may not become upsetting to her.  The buttons really should be at an angle that is out the way.But I am soo vey happy with this seat, and so is baby!  I wish I had this one with my first 2!
