These are by far the best sippy cups we have bought! I know the label says "Take & Toss", but trust me, they hold up really well in the dishwasher (normal setting, top rack). We have washed them well over a dozen times and the lids still fit well! The pictures have not faded at all!! The Belle cup is currently in the sink, or I would have included a picture of it as well. The soda can is there for a size reference.My daughter absolutely loves the Disney Princesses, so she was very excited when we got these cups.  I love that the lid cleans easily in the dishwasher (top rack). We have been using them for a couple months and the lids are still very clean. Unlike most sippy cups with rubber in the lids that inevitably starts to grow that disgusting black mold. So gross! We have tried so many different cups, but these are definitely the best for my family. They clean SO EASILY!! LOVE THEM! What a blessing to have one less thing to worry about!! Also, added bonus - they are so cheap!! I originally bought two packages because I assumed the pictures would fade quickly, but they were so cheap I didn't mind buying two....well, we have not opened the second set of cups at all. We haven't needed to because the pictures are still looking great!!! I highly, highly recommend these cups.
