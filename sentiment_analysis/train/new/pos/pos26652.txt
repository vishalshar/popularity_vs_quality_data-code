I like the fact that the born free bottle brush is all sponge.  While a majority of the bottle brushes out there are sponges on top and "soft" bristles on bottom, I feel that the traditional sponge does a better job of applying dish soap and soaking up any breastmilk residue. I own this brush set as well as the Dr Browns natural flow brush.  I currently use the Dr Browns brush for the narrow mouth glass bottles but wish the born free one could work with narrow mouth bottles.  The nipple sponge is the best...I am OCD about getting milk residue out of the nipples and this along with dapple dish soap fits the bill.  You can buy the sponge nipple brush solo by other manufacturers.
