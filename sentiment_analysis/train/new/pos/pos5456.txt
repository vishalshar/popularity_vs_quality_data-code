These reusable food pouches are great in every way except for one. They hold the applesauce, yogurt or whatever else we might put in there for our son and he is unable to pour it out. That's the good news, the bad news is that both my wife and I can barely open the double zipper as well! In fact, we were able to open only five of the six pouches and that was with quite a bit of work. They are great once you place the product into the pouch but a better design with more lips on either side of the zipper definitely needs to be in the works. I still highly recommend the product but just realize you may have to fight with the zipper.
