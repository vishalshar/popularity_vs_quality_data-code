These towels are perfect for my one-year-old grand babies (see photo of Bear version). These are NOT the infant-size, lightweight hooded towel. Parents, you'll love them. Wrapped up in these towels, your babies/toddlers will be completely dry by the time you get them to the changing table. If you want a great gift for an infant or toddler, this is it! I'm ordering two more!
