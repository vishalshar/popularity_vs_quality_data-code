If you're on the boundary between two sizes like I am, I highly recommend going with the smaller size on this one.  This bra has three columns of clasps, I went larger instead of smaller, and I'm on the tightest clasp setting.  I wouldn't mind being able to cinch a little closer for a tighter fit, especially as the material has some give to it.  That said, this pumping bra really foots the bill.  I pump at work, and I'm the only one with a pumping bra.  While my peers are stuck in their seats while they pump, I can step over to the adjacent sink to get a drink of water or to wash an apple.  I'm more inclined to sit and read, of course, but I have freedom of movement, and both of my hands are free.  One warning: don't get too liberal with your movements in this bra.  I washed a bottle and shook off the excess water and wound up splashing my milk!  Yikes!Only reason I can't give five stars: the binding has stiff, rough edges on both the top and bottom.  It pokes into my upper stomach.  If they had just bothered to finish the edge, this would get full stars.
