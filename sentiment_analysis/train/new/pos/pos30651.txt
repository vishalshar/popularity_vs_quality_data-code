This is a great chair for a child.  I have ages 4-12 and it is very comfortable for all of them.  Sturdy and well made.  The fabric is good and cleans up well.  I ordered 2 and they are almost identical in color.  Just a little shading difference which is really not noticeable.  Fabric was probably cut differently on each chair but you really do not notice it.  I like it does not go back real easy because you do not have to worry about the children tumbling if it goes to fast.  It takes a little effort and I like that.
