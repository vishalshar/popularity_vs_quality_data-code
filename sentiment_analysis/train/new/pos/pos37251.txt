My daughter informed me that I was was restricted to buying one (1) big item at Christmas for my then 3 month old granddaughter.  Since I was having way too much fun shopping prior to the baby's birth and immediately after she arrived.  So I decided to purchase an ExerSaucer for her.  I remembered that when my children were babies, that I always wished that there was an activity toy/center that was available that I could use for them.  Something more than placing them on a blanket with toys.  The ExerSaucer is WAY BETTER!!!!  My granddaughter loves it!!!  My daughter and son in-law removed some of the toys, but she has a great time playing with everything else.  The musical toys on the ExerSaucer are a favorite of hers. When I call my daughter I can hear the baby in the background as she is exercising her little legs by using it as a bouncer.  My granddaughter is now almost 8 months old and is pulling herself up when she's not in the ExerSaucer and trying to stand and cruise around the room.I highly recommend this as a gift for any parent with a child between the ages of 4 months to 1 year.
