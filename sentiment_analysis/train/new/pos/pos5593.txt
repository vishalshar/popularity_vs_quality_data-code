My son LOVES this thing--he's been playing with it from about 3 months and still going at 8 months. And it's one of the few electronic toys that don't annoy the heck out of me, since it features nice little snippets of classical tunes. It's also pretty sturdy--it gets slammed on the floor and will die for a while, and then--lo and behold--a few days later it gets bashed back into working order. It's kind of amusing, actually, to hear the warped Mozart tune slowly fade back into sounding normal again.
