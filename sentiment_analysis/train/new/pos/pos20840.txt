While shopping for our infant seat in BRU a father was in the store and told us how helpful having another base in my husband's car would be...well we received this as a gift and installed it in less than 15 minutes( it took awhile in my husbands car because he does not have latch)and is very secure. No slippage and movement. Placing your knee in the middle helps alot in making sure it is tight, so you may need another person if you are on the petite side. It is so helpful being able to lift her out and change cars if needed without major moving of bases.It took less than 5 minutes putting it in my SUV ( latch) and has not moved in 6 months...now she is outgrowing her Snugride infant seat so we will have to take these out but I would use this system again for our next child! I would give this 4 1/2 stars since putting it in took us a minute but that was nothing once it was in and we knew it was not going anywhere.
