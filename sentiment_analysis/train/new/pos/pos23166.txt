I bought two! I like that they are longer. Very sturdy. The padded mattress fits snuggly in place, there are no gaps like I have had with other similar port-a-cribs. I was able to find cot/crib sheets that fit on Amazon. I do think that the company should offer sheets to go with their product since it is an unusual size.
