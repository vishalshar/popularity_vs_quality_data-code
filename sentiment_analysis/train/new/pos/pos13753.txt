This is a very pretty and nice placemat.  I purchased the entire dinner ware set from Disney and the placemat I ordered was out of stock.  Disney had it on sale and I had to pay a good bit more for this item from Amazon, but was worth it to get what my granddaughter wanted.  This is also a much nicer placemat than the one that I ordered.  I just think the price is a little steep even for this one.
