I bought this for my son when he was 3 months old, but only recently started using it when he was about 6 months (manufacturer recommends 5 months). My son loves this bouncer... if only for a few minutes at a time.  It also didn't take long for him to figure out how to make it go.ProsTray table keeps him from bumping his head against the door frame and protects little fingers.Toys are a good distraction and safe for him to nibble.It's hilarious watching my son jump with all his energy.Sturdy construction.ConsHard to get the baby in and out.Tray table not really good for holding anything because as soon as he goes to jumping everything flies off.My son is 26" long and his feet touch the floor (only the tips are supposed to touch the floor) although I adjusted the trapped as high as it would go.  So if you have low door frames or long a baby be careful before you put your baby in it as bouncing may hurt your baby's legs.My son only likes to be in it for no more than 5-10 minutes, but then again he's spoiled rotten.
