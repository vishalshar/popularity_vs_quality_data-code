This adapter fits the valco stroller as described, but it came with just the adapter and a warranty card - no instructions or anything, so we couldn't figure out if we were installing it correctly.  Luckily there was a video we found that explained it.  Turns out that this adapter isn't a 'click in' kind - it clicks into the stroller, but the car seat doesn't click into it, it just sort of sits in it and then you close a strap around the top of the car seat to hold it in.  It should work for us but doesn't seem as secure as a true adapter made to fit a chicco car seat.  And not coming with any instructions seems really dumb and careless.
