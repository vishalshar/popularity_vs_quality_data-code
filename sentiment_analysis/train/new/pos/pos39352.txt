This has been the best toy I have ever bought.  My two year old grandson has been playing with this since birth - initially, trying to put a coin in the slot, then accomplishing this task and moving on to doing that as fast as he can.  It is the first thing he gets out of the toy box when he comes to my house.  I highly recommend this toy.  (I failed to mention that the little songs are in English or French, whichever you choose.)
