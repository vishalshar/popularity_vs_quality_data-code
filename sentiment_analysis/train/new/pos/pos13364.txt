These diapers are wonderful, soft and easy to clean. I wish I had found these before I spent so much money on bumgenius diapers, the pockets haven't had any issues with inserts slipping out, and the inserts that came with these diapers are awesome! I have had no blow outs, no leaks, no issues of any kind. Easy to get on a wiggly baby because you don't have twenty snaps to worry about, and they are super easy to stash in a diaper bag because the inserts fold up small without losing the absorbency.
