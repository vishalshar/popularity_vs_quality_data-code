With our newborn this is a great (and budget-friendly) pail where we can use  non-special trash bags to pitch dirty diapers. The foot pedal is the best -- hands-free was a critical factor in my research -- thanks again to the Amazon community of parents who gave feedback to help us out. I did want to point out the size is just right in that it holds about a day's worth of business. Who needs to store more? One tiny complaint: On hard-wood floors the pail tends to slide a bit when you try to get at it with just your toes, but I think that it just takes a little practice to hit it from the side of the foot. Otherwise will paste a nonstick rubber something to the bottom to solve.TIP: After a few months of use I noticed the top of the lid had a perforated separate compartment, did a little research and read that coffee or white vinegar were eco-friendly solutions to cutting down on bad smells in garbage. A few cotton balls in white vinegar fit nicely in this "pocket" and I just refresh once a month or so.
