LOVE this teddy bear. My son has the monkey which was unfortunately discontinued. He takes it everywhere and I wish I had purchased another one before it was discontinued. I bought 2 already for my daughter since the bear was also recently discontinued. I am sure she will love it just as much as my son does! They are so soft and cuddly. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a little lovie for their child.
