We have tried to avoid plastics when/where reasonable, and I knew I didn't want my toddler's drink sitting around for hours in plastic containers if I could find a good alternative. A lot of the stainless cups I found were very expensive, but these had a more reasonable price. We've been using them now for about 9 months and they are holding up well. Eventually we'll probably need to buy replacement valves, but so far so good. I do take the silicon sleeve off once a week to wash well underneath and no issues with gunk or mold underneath. They do get easier to remove over time and I find that holding it under running water helps. We've gotten a couple dents and dings from dropped cups, but only when I've not put the silicon sleeve back on.Tip - baby leggings make an excellent sleeve for these if you want to cover the steel without putting the rubber sleeve back on.Update - We've been using these about a year and a half. They are still leak free except some minor dripping if it's slammed or shaken. The sleeves have developed some molding and discoloration from moisture that becomes trapped in between the sleeve and cup. I'll admit, I ran them through the dishwasher with the sleeve on a number of times, but they were just so hard to take on and off! I've washed them as well as possible, but can't get rid of all the discoloration inside. Most of them I've stopped using, and instead I use a fabric sleeve or he just holds it by the handle. Not the company's fault I didn't remove it for washing, just updating so others have a heads up.
