My daughter is 6 months old and she wasn't able to sit completely on her own so I couldn't put her in a height chair to start with solid foods. The dr said to use a bouncy seat or a car seat but she wouldn't eat well there, besides I ended up so bent down that after a few days my back hurt. I baught this product and everything changed. She sits perfectly there. Before and after the meal she plays with the stackable toy, which she loves, and its perfect because she can wait a few minutes until the meal goes down before I put her on the floor.Also, compared to the bumbo seat that is only for the floor, this one you can also attach to a regular chair so now we can have a meal the hole family together at the table.Bottom line, this seat is much better deal (and cheaper) than the bumbo.
