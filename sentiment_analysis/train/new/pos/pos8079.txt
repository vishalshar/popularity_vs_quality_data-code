These clocks are Swiss made and are very well made. I bought the fish and the lady bug. They are super cute and keep time well. My son who is 3 loves to watch the clocks eyes and is trying to figure out the time. What a great way to introduce telling time to him with this clock. The 36.95 is a good price as in Hawaii the clocks go for 42.00 or higher. The only thing I would say was a bummer is that Amazon does not carry the dog clock or the deer clock. It would have been nice to have the chance to buy the dog clock which is really cute too. Highly recommend.
