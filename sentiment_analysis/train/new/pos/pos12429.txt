i didnt use these for my baby as a bottle bc the nipple is way too small for his preference... didnt know what to do with them and I hate wasting things, so one day I had no clean containers to store the milk I was pumping and decided to use this 5 oz bottle...THIS BOTTLE SCREWS ON PERFECTLY TO MY MEDELA PUMP!!OMG, its a dollar!Ive been using them ever since. just popped out the latex nipple and the lid created a perfect seal. very happy to have discovered that!
