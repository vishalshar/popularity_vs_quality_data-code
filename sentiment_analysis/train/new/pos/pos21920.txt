I swear by these scissors for being the best baby/toddler nail scissors out there. As a first time parent I was incredibly nervous to cut little baby nails but found that these were very easy and comfortable to use and allowed me the most control I could have while trying to trim the nails of a moving target! They easily cut through nails like cutting through paper so you don't have to worry about squeezing or cutting too hard and accidentally hurting your child. The blades of the scissors slightly curve upward toward the end which makes it easier for cutting the nail and also less likely that you will cut their skin by accidentally clipping the next finger over. The ends of the scissors are rounded to also prevent accidental cutting or poking. I feel that I have more control while cutting small finger nails while using these scissors rather than trying to line up clippers which are bulky and don't allow as much flexibility in maneuvering while cutting.
