This is our second booster seat after we couldn't find more of the Recaro Vivo seats in stock anywhere; we wanted a booster seat that was relatively narrow at the base since we don't have a mini van.We have had this seat for about two months and so far we like it pretty well.Pros:My kids both like it and seem to find it to be comfortableThe base is narrow which allows for easier buckling and unbuckling, as well as more space.  With the Recaro Vivo the side presses against the seat belt so it can be hard to buckle; this one offers a little more room which makes it easier for me and my daughter to buckle and unbuckle.The base is also molded a bit which seems more comfortable than a flatter seat might beThe shoulder area is slightly wider than the base, offering more arm/shoulder roomThe top belt guide makes it difficult to thread the seat belt through, which I thought was annoying at first, until I realized the belt just stays threaded and in place, and is much easier than our Recaro where it comes out easily and therefore has to be re-threaded frequentlyConsIt is somewhat difficult to adjust the headrest height, especially when the seat is in place (doubly so when a kid is already trying to climb into it).  Why is this a problem?  I have two kids who constantly want to switch seats and I find I'm hurting my wrist trying to adjust the headrest height all the time.  If you don't have to adjust it often, this is probably not an issue for youThe fabric cover over the headrest comes off easily when it presses on the car head rest.  I haven't checked to see if this is a safety issue or if I am doing something wrong; it only seems to be an issue at certain heightsIf your kid tries to grab the side of the car seat to pull themselves up into the car, the seat can tip over (and the instructions say not to do this anyway)With my particular car I had to position the seat bolt upright for it to fit on the seat.  This may be something I just have to spend more time tweaking to see if we can have it slightly reclined, but it didn't seem to fit well into the seat when the seat back was slightly reclined (this is a rear seat option on the Subaru Outback)Overall we are quite pleased with this booster seat and plan to buy another one any day now
