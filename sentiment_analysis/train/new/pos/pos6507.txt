I purchased this mattress cover because I live in New York and we are having a bed bug epidemic in the city. My friends who live in a brand new condo have found these nasty critters in their building. I did some research, compared to other products out there, and this one seemed to be the best. Its made of fabric, not plastic, so no crinkling when you move. On the inside there is a thin plastic-like layer for protection from liquids. The top has a terry cloth cover. Its not very soft, but hey, you put a sheet over it anyway. I have king size mattress and it took my husband and I about five minutes to put in on, just follow the directions. I highly recommend this mattress cover.
