I first bought a diaper pail that can be later used as a garbage can thinking that would be a good idea.  But found that it really didn’t keep the odor contained.  So my husband found this one.  I have to admit, I was a little confused by the whole bag situation.  Since most other diaper pales take a special bag I figured this one did too.  But long story short it doesn’t take any ‘special’ bag other than a plastic garbage bag.  And setting it up is actually pretty easy.  Over all I like the pale, but my little one figured out not only how to put things inside by moving the lever but how to open the pale too!  He’s a year and a half old.  I didn’t have the pale till now so I don’t know how much earlier in age he could have figured this out.  The only tip I’d pass on to whom ever uses this pale is to keep the lever in the back position so that the opening to load diapers is always open.  If you keep the lever in the forward position with the lever always closed that opening will always being filled with stinky air and you'll get to have a whiff of it when you do open to put diapers in.  - Also, I wrote this review so that the next mom looking for the same answers I was in search of can find them.  Since I couldn't find what I was looking for in the very short item description or lack of pictures this pale is provided with. So I hope this review helps you mamma! :)
