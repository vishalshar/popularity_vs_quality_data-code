I absolutely love this bag! It's cheap but very good quality. It comes with a changing pad and small pouch for diapers. I like that the design is unisex, and it's roomy- I put everything my baby needs and there's still a lot of room. I also like that there's only one top zipper (I never liked those diaper bags that have 2 top zippers). Very happy with my purchase.
