We love these gates. We bought two of them to fit our extra wide openings that other gates could not fit. Our small dog could slip through the slates in the more expensive swing gates, and we didnt want a gate that we had to put up and take down, or climb over. We also like that it is easy to fold in and put against the wall to get out of the way when we dont want it up. We use a second one at the top of our stairs that is an akward angle so no other gate fit. This is a great gate for spaces where other gates dont fit. Our 3 year old easily figured out how to open and close the gate making it not so great if you are trying to keep kids out of an area but we loved this because we use the gate for our pets.
