so, in the never ending battle of having a girl and not wanting to totally pink out a room like my wife would like, this was a great compromise on design.  Just enough to know that its for a girl, not so much were i feel like im walking into pretty pretty princess's dungen.  As far as the quality, way better than i expected.  when shopping around for bed sets, i could not believe the price companies charge for just 3 items.  Here, we got everything for a great price.  i cant thank this company enough not only for being competitive, but having great quality!
