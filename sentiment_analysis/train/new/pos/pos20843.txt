Let me say that this pillow has been a god-send to me!  From the very early weeks of my pregnancy, I have been experiencing fairly severe hip pain after I wake up.  I tried putting a traditional body pillow in between my legs at night to relieve the pain, but it didn't help.  I still ended up turning over 4 or 5 times every night because my hips were hurting so badly.  I finally gave in at about 7 months and bought this pillow.  I wish I would have had it all along! Here is what I love about it:1. It contours to my body very well, so my belly is supported at all times.2. If I do turn over to sleep on my other side, I don't have to turn the pillow too because it wraps all the way around me!3. I have not had any hip pain since I started sleeping with this pillow.  I used to ache for at least an hour after waking up and even limped sometimes because the pain was so bad.  Now, I wake up feeling great!4. It is not as big as it looks in the pictures.  I am 5'8" and it fits me fine.  I thought it would be way too big and take up my whole bed, but it doesn't.  My husband and I have a queen size bed and we can both sleep comfortably without the pillow getting in his way.I would recommend this product to any pregnant woman.  I know you will sleep well with it!
