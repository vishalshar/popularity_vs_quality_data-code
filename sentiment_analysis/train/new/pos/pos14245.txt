I suffered extreme morning sickness and nausea throughout 7 months of my first pregnancy, which wasn't a huge surprise to me because I had always had a tendency toward nausea from motion sickness. When I was a child I used to get sick during the 10 minute drive to church! I have tried all sorts of nausea remedies, including my previous favorite meclizine (the generic drug in non-drowsy Bonine), but I didn't discover Preggie Pops until I was pregnant with my daughter. I had tried ginger of all varieties, nausea wrist bands, middle ear patches, and so many oral anti-emetic medications.Now Preggie Pops are ALL that I use, and I haven't been pregnant for 18 months! I keep them stashed in my purses, my glove box, the diaper bag... The flavors are not very strongly sour but the green apple is by far my favorite. You can also buy Queasy Pops by the same manufacturer, in case you don't like the "Preggie" name, but the flavors are not as good in my opinion (such as cola, ginger, banana, green tea...). The sour is not at all overwhelming (and I do not like sour candy!) and there is no medicinal taste at all. They are not overly sweet and don't leave a bad taste in your mouth. Often times I will take one when I first start becoming queasy, and then am often able to finish my meal, even savory, after the pop is gone.They are convenient to keep handy in your pocket, purse or car, and last a long time, though they do get a bit sticky from the natural sweetener if you leave them in the car for a while :) I have offered them to many friends, pregnant or not, and most of them were shocked at how well they work. I also use them for my nausea that accompanies my migraine headaches, and they work great on that and even help the dizziness or light-headedness. The combination of ingredients quickly goes to work and lasts a long time. I wish I had discovered these years ago!
