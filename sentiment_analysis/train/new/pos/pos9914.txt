Bought this for my 3 yr old grandson to sleep on when he came to visit this Christmas.  Worked great, he sleep well.  I did put a little blanket padding on it as I was afraid it was a little to stiff.  As we didn't try it without the padding, don't know if that is necessary.  I love having something this easy to set up and put away for his visits.  Met my expectations.
