My toddler LOVES SpongeBob, so when I saw this I just knew he had to have it. The product came quickly and doesn't feel as cheap as most toddler bedding sets do, once washed the blanket feels quite nice. The colors are nice, they haven't faded or bled at all and I am confident we made a good choice! By the way, this looks great on the spongebob toddler bed :-)
