My son's current toddler backpack that we use as a diaper bag is finally falling apart after the past few years and since he loves Jake and the Neverland Pirates I thought that this is a perfect back pack for him. It is the same size as his old one which fits him perfectly...highly recommend as a diaper bag or just a play bag to hold all their little toys.
