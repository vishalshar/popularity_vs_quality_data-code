Darling little toy for baby buckaroos! Our friend has a Cowboy themed nursery for her youngin' and this was the perfect gift at her shower! It seemed well made with the chew hooves and rattle in the belly. It was bright with no extra strings; quality! We loved it and she loved it when she opened it.
