Lovely, soft and well made.  A lot of reviews complain of the cover developing small holes near the seam after the first wash, and I admit, I thought the same thing after the first time I washed and dried the changing pad cover!  After a little investigating (and realizing the holes were very symmetrical and appeared to have nice straight clean edges), I learned that the holes are actually part of the design: they are there so that changing pad straps can slip through them (genius!)Great pad cover and very cute design.  Purchasing in a few patterns.
