We haven't had a single problem with this monitor yet. It was way more expensive then I wanted to spend on a baby monitor but my wife insisted on having one and after researching various options in our price range ($50-90) it didn't look good. We couldn't find one that was reliable, secure, AND all of the options we wanted. Many came close but the negative reviews dissuaded us.Bought this one on Black Friday. Reviews were great and the sale price sealed the deal. We haven't had a single regret. This monitor is awesome!-Love that it doesn't connect to Wifi-which was a must for us.-Video quality is way better than I expected-Night Vision is stunning!-Range is great. We have a large house and haven't had a single dropped signal.-Alerts are Very Smart. I would say this is the best & most important part about this monitor. We had our little guy in a rocker sleeper with NPR (talk radio) playing in the room and went upstairs and this monitor could tell the difference between the people talking on the radio and our son. I guess it determines that the talk radio is a background noise and learns to ignore it, meanwhile the second our son lets out a "murmur" the handset lit up and turned on.We continue to be impressed with this monitor and we are very happy with this product. We would definitely buy it again. This review is after using the product for 2 months. Hope that helps.
