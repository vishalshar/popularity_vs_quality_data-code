I have now had this swing for over 3 years, and it is now being used by my youngest. We love all the features this swing has, and the easy controls.Pros:* Easy to assemble as long as you read the instructions* Swings and sways like a cradle* Operates on both AC Adapter and Batteries* Has 3 different sound selections depending on babies mood (Lullaby, Playtime, and Ocean Sounds)* Backed by Fisher Price's great customer serviceCons:* Swing is heavy* Swing makes clicking sound (it is hardly noticable)* AC Adapter cord is a tad short, but still usable* Motor in Discontinued Model can go out after being stored for extended period (Fisher Price replaced this part after troubleshooting with me, even though I am out of warranty)I would recommend this product, as well as the several other Swings made by Fisher-Price, I love their products!
