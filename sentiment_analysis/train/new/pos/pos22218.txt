Great set of toys for newborn babies. I am introducing high contrast toys to my baby and wanted a variety of toys that will last awhile. I am extremely happy with this set as they each are designed to stimulate a specific area of development. My 2 month old daughter likes holding the rattles and ring. And the animal discs are a great fun way to interact with her. They are interesting looking and always catch her attention. I also like that the bright colors are not painted on and are part of the toys. Nice set!
