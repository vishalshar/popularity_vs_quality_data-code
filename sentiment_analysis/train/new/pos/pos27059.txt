I ordered the mint green and was a little disappointed when it turned out to be more of an aqua color. I wouldn't call it mint but we can make due with it. The fabric is extremely soft and has held up after a few washes (dryer on low.) I bought a pretty thick changing pad and it fits perfectly, but I could see it being a little large on a changing pad that isn't so big.
