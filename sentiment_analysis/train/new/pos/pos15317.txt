I had order these duckies for my nieces baby shower to put in the punch that i made to look like a bath tub, I was pleased with the quick delivery and the quality. It worked well in punch and in the tub. My niece now uses them in the baby's bath. I would highly recommend these cute duckies  they make a cute gift and they are fun bath toys.
