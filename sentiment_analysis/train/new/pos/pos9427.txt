This activity gym was something that my granddaughter enjoyed playing with once she was able to sit up and hold the toys. She had no interest in laying on the mat(on her stomach or back) to play with this. The color scheme is pink and turquoise and not as bright and cheery as some that I have seen, but the bird that plays songs really caught my granddaughter's attention and she loved it. It still plays to this day--the battery has had a long life, for us anyway. The toys are easily removed from the overhead bars and can be attached to the fabric loops on the mat or played with independently as well. It was east to assemble and take apart to pack up. I would recommend this activity gym for parents who are looking for an activity gym for their little one to grow with. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would have liked the colors to have been brighter.
