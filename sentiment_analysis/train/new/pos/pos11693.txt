I bought this when I moved my daughter into my son's room.  I thought it would be great to give her some darkness and privacy.  So far so good.  I think she started sleeping a LITTLE bit better in this tent, but I honestly can't be sure how it would be without it.  I did try to remove it one day to see if we could get away with not having it and she did seem a bit more restless.  So yes, I recommend it especially for those sharing rooms with other siblings.  Is it a must have?  Probably not, but helpful yes.
