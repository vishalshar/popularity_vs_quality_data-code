It's sturdy and able to withstand being thrown around by my 10-month old.  There have been no problems with the playing of the mp3's after being waved and swung around, and thrown and dropped many times.  (Although, so far, it has fallen fairly short distances and it lands on carpet.)I wish the buttons were a little easier to press.  You really need to press the buttons pretty deep, and the side buttons are particularly hard to press because they are so narrow.The sound quality is not great, sounds similar to laptop speakers.Otherwise, it's cute and I couldn't find any other baby-appropriate mp3 player where I could load my own mp3s.  And my daughter likes it.
