Love this sippy cup and the soft spout one as well. My main use for these to to keep water cold. I add a few ice cubes and it keeps it cold for a long time. I am taking these to Hawaii. Liquid does collect a bit on the spouts but since I only use them for water it doesnt bother me. I shake them off a bit before adding to my diaper bag. I accidentally burned the silicone inserts for both sippy cups. I was boiling them to sanitize and forgot they were on the stove and they burned badly. I just ordered 2 replacement parts by calling the manufacturer. The entire lid replacements were $2 each plus $3 shipping. Not bad.
