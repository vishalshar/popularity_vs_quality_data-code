Just received this in the mail thanks to Amazon Mom.I was hesitant at first because I had seen a muslin a+a fitted sheet in the store, and thought it was a little too thin for my tastes (albeit extreeemely soft).  Even thought the product details said this had 2 layers, I still wasn't sure if that would be thick enough, but it is.Great color, soo soft, inconspicuous holes for changing pad straps.  It's built just like a mini fitted sheet, so even though the pictures show it over a contour changing pad, it fit great over my 32" 4-sided contour changing pad.I've been using this same cover for almost 8 months now and after weekly washes (sometimes more), it still looks great and feels even softer than it was to begin with.
