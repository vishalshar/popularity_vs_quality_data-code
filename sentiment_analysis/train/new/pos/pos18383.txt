Can I say how impressed I am? It is such a compact diaper bag, and it really blew me out of the water. It holds a ton of things, and doesn't weigh a lot. I am an overpacker, and I cloth diaper. I have 2 in diapers as well. I haven't reached the full capacity of what it holds. The fabric is good quality, the zippers run smoothly, and the straps are secure. The strap options are all the kinds I know of (except fanny pack). Messenger, backpack, and tote. This bag can be lightly packed, or full. The water bottle pockets are tall enough for any bottle you use. I can fit 2 side by side in the mesh! There's 2 pockets in the front, and 2 inside. One mesh that is the whole back of the inside, and the small pouch the bag folds into. The back pouch where the backpack straps can hide is padded for comfort, and is an excellent fit for the changing pad. The changing pad is the perfect size. 2 ft long? It works for my toddler. I wish I had bought one a year ago when I first heard of it. So versatile, and the color matches my stroller canopy. This is a diaper bag worth buying! I can chase my toddler and baby wear with this. Oh, and it is wet proof. This will be following me to the water park.
