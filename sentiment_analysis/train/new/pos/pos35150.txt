We bought this stroller for an extended trip to Europe.  We were going to be on lots of planes and traveling a lot over the course of 4 months.  We needed a sturdy stroller that was very compact, light and versatile.  This stroller has it all.  It reclines all the way - so important for my son to actually sleep well and I love that the little foot rest flips up to create a real little bed for him.  With the way the fabric encloses the stroller on both sides, it is very cozy in there and our little boy seemed to really like his little den.  The sun shade rotates all the way to the front (although it is kinda awkward) and was very handy on many occasions. Cleans up well and folds very easily.On the negative side, just small stuff: Storage is pretty minimal and the little foot muff thing is pretty useless. It is true that the wheels are little wobbly and don't roll perfectly smoothly.  Also, the carrying strap broke off the frame.Overall, I love this stroller.  I was given a Bugaboo Bee by my sister-in-law and I gave my Liteway to my mom.  I wish I hadn't.  The Bee is a pain in the neck and I miss my little Liteway.  Given was a great deal it is, I might just buy myself another.  It is that good!
