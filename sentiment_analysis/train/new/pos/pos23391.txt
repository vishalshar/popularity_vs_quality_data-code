I bought three boxes of these pads in two different orders spaced several months apart. I have not washed or used them yet (soon! :D) But I can see a difference between the ones I received today and the ones I got several months ago. The ones I got today are SOFT, so soft, and a bit fuzzy. I could see fuzz stickage being a problem with these pads, but they also seem like they would be very comfortable. The ones I got in the first order are a bit more coarse, not nearly as soft or fuzzy as the new ones, but still seem ok. The fabric is different, the thread is different. We shall see which performs better.Honesty: I'm not all that picky about breast pads. I don't care if they're lumpy, I don't care if they can be seen under my clothes, or if they leave fuzz. I only care that they do their jobs. I'll be updating with my "in-use" review in about a month after this baby comes out.First week update: I love these pads. They're really soft and didn't crinkle up in the wash, at least not yet. I've only used the softer kind so far, and have had no fuzz issues. I'm not leaking or spraying nearly as much as I did with previous kids so I'm not really putting them through their paces, either. I'll update one more time after some more use.
