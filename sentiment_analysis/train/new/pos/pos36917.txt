This wasn't the first choice for me, but money played a part. We've been using it 18 months with no problems. The boy is comfortable and still rear facing (just waiting till he's heavy enough to flip). There has been a bunch of spilled snacks, water, milk spilled in there, and it does clean easy. Adjustment takes a bit of getting used to, but is easy and I don't have any other reference.
