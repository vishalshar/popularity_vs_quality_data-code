This strap is so versatile and useful, stroller manufacturers including Britax should hope that their customers do not discover this product.  I bought it initially to strap my Graco SnugRide to my Britax B-ready stroller.  I did not want to spend $50 to buy the universal car seat adapter for the B-ready so I thought I'd see if this $8 strap, would work.  It works perfectly and saved my a lot of money.  The car seat actually rests perfectly in the seat of the B-ready so you don't really need to strap it in.  Since I like to be safe, I just wrapped these straps around the frame of the B-ready seat, hook the strap around the car seat, and click it closed.  Perfect and no chance of the car seat falling off the stroller!  Because I was so happy with the B-ready+Graco SnugRide combination, I bought another strap for my BOB Duallie.  The BOB car seat adapter is close to $100 and people complain that it is such a pain to install that I really didn't want to get it.  I noticed that I could place the SnugRide right on one of the seats of the BOB and it would rest perfectly on the footplate.  It could not safely stay that way so I wrapped the Britax adapter strap around the frame and around hooked part of the carseat (near where the babies arms' lie) and I got another perfectly secured car seat on a stroller!  $8 sure beats $80!  Anyway, this strap is perfect and saves a ton of money.  Another great product by Britax!
