I bought some of these at my sister-in-law's suggestion. They are the first sippy I've found that really doesn't leak! My toddler was just starting to ask for water at night but I didn't feel comfortable leaving any of his other cups in his bed. The only time water has come out of them is with pressure/temperature change--ie: if left upside down in the carseat with sun streaming in, water will squeeze out. Other than that, they are highly recommended!
