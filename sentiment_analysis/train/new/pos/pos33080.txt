My 4 month son is exclusively breastfed. I recently tried to go out without him, and left him a bottle of expressed milk. He couldn't figure out how to drink from it and ended up having to wait for me to get home. He's never been good at a bottle (not even in the NICU) and the thought of never being able to leave him with someone else was upsetting. Someone recommended giving him a cup. We tried this cup today and he took the entire 1.5 oz that we offered him without getting frustrated at all! This cup is amazing and will let me have a little freedom without my little guy getting frustrated and hungry!
