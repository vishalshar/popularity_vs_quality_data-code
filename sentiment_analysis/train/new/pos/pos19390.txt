I really like this but I don't use it as much as I thought I would. It is perfect for my stroller - I have a Graco jogging stroller and it works great. It is adjustable, so I imagine it will fit most strollers. I carry a big diaper bag with all of the essentials, but it's a pain to bring it in places. I prefer to leave it in the car and just use this bag for a few things. The only thing that I don't like about it is the cup holders on top, I wish they were regular pockets. My stroller had cup holders so I don't need these. Plus I'm not sure how sturdy they are. But I LOVE the easy access to the wipes. I got one of the huggies reusable to-go wipe pack and it fits nicely in there. I don't like huggies wipes, but the zip up pack is perfect on the go. I just put my own wipes in there. There is also a zipper pocket on the back of this bag that fits my iPhone plus - which is nice because it won't fit in my stroller pockets. Overall I really like this organizer.
