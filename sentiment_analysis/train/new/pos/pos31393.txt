Although I have not had the opportunity to use this yet since she is not due till February, the product arrived on time and it is exactly as described. Perfect color and textures. I am sure it will keep my daughter warm from the cold German winds and snow.Update: I tried this on our car seat since our car seat arrived after this and it fits nice and snug on the car seat but unfortunately there are gaps on the sides where the cover should be covering so I am afraid the strong wind will still be able to pass through it. I will still use the cover but she will need to use a blanket as well.
