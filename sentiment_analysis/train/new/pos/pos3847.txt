If you're looking for a bargain while cloth diapering, these covers and prefolds to put inside them is one of the most cost effective ways to diaper. We have five covers and wash diapers every other day. We always have an extra cover. Since these can be reused between washings they cut down the cost of cloth diapering significantly. We've been using Bummis Super Whisper Wraps for about 5 months and they do show some wear but still work well. I anticipate they will last through another child.What I don't like:My child figured out how to remove his diaper the easiest in these. With a prefold in it they are the bulkiest option.What I do like:These fit very well around the legs. When my son was younger he was very chubby and now that he's slimmed down significantly they still fit well around his legs. They are durable and made of a soft cloth.
