Each of these stroller hooks velcros on to a stroller, and provides a sturdy hook to hang shopping bags, purse, etc from.  While "velcros on" does not sound sturdy at all, these actually attach just fine (the strap loops through another closure first and the Velcro is just an extra to prevent any slipping at all).The stroller hook is a really good thing to have.  Strollers are frustrating in not having storage.  I have a jogging stroller, where the pocket under the stroller is tiny and also has a metal bar blocking me from putting anything larger than a clutch purse in.  No way to carry diaper bag, except over my shoulder.  The stroller hook fixes that issue.  Stroller hook is something I missed, even before I knew it existed. Now that I have it, it just blends in and prevents so much frustration.These particular stroller hooks are sturdy and easy to attach to my stroller.  They hold enough weight that I can actually flip the stroller over backwards with the baby in it by putting too many bags on.  So, don't do that.  Anyway, you don't have to worry that the strap will come off.  It won't.So, stroller hook is a good product to have, and the OXO ones are good quality stroller hooks.  This is a good buy that will get the mileage, if you are using a stroller even occasionally.Update:  Four months later, the stroller straps have been useful over and over again.
