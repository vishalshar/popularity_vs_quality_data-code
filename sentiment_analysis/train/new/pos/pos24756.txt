Good for price. Works well. I find the middle connector a little flddly to use. And the center connected flops down so my child always is sitting on it when i put her in the seat. She complains when I lift her up to move it. But 50% of the price of the leading competitor and more adjustable - so still a good deal. Especially for a 2nd car.
