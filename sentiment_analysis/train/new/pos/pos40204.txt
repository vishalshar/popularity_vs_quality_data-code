A word to the wise: check the "Infant Car Seat Adapter Compatibility" page on BOB's website [http://www.bobgear.com/carseatadapter] before buying.  CS1001 (this model) is only compatible with newer Ironman strollers, serial number AV000001 and higher.  Ours is a 2010 model, AC0xxxxx, and needs CS0701 instead.Don't forget to verify the model of car seat, located on the bottom of the seat.  Graco's website lists what series the seat is based on the model number.  The aforementioned page notes that this model isn't compatible with SnugRide Click Connect 35 and 40.
