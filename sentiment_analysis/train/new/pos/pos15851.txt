There are so many diaper covers that are way too expensive! We've been using these for over a year since my son was a newborn, they haven't worn out. We ordered roughly 12 of them and only one diaper has a broken snap. I recommend this brand to my friends because it's a reasonable price and great quality for the price! I think cotton pre-folds + bububibi covers are the cheapest way to go and they don't retain smells like the micro fiber cloth all in one diapers do. I tried those as well.The best way to keep cloth diapers clean in my opinion, buy a 5 gallon bucket with screw top lid (no risk of toddler drowning), fill it to the 5 gallon mark with cold water, add 1/3 to 1/4 cup of each 1. hydrogen peroxide (this is a bleaching agent and the active ingredient in all color safe bleaches) 2. isopropyl alcohol (disinfects and keeps it from smelling like a swamp of poopie death) 3. biodegradable cleaner of some sort, I use simple green (this also helps pre-wash and keep the smell down)Using this method we wash our diapers every day or every other day and they never ever smell or have stains, of course we drop the poo into the toilet not the bucket.
