I was given this as a shower gift for my recently adopted 2 year old girl.  This booster seat is the easiest most convenient seat we have found.  It is easy to install and easy to move from car to car.  The safety belts are easy to adjust, alot of padding for her little behind, and my 2 year old has plenty of room to move her arms and legs. She is approx 26 pounds and there is plenty of room for her to grow and still have use for this same seat.  We have another car seat (brand name to remain annonymous) in my husband's car which is a total nightmare with twisting straps, etc.  Ugh!I would highly recommend this seat!!
