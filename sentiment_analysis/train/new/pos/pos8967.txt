Even though the instructions clearly warn that this device must not be dropped, I managed to drop it three times on a wood floor within one-half hour of opening the box.  Didn't faze it.  I'm a registered nurse, and I've used it now for a month of daily home health visits. It's fast, easy to use, and my patients like it very much, since they don't have to have anything stuck in their mouths, ears, or dragged across their makeup. I tested it's accuracy against an electronic probe thermometer using cups of water heated in the microwave, and the widest difference between the two was around 0.2 degrees in 108 degree water.  I've noticed that it records higher temperatures at the earlobe site than the eyebrow area, sometimes as much as 2 degrees, which is consistent with other measuring devices I've used. I like it very much, and I've experienced zero problems with it.
