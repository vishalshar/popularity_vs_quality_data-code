Brica Seat Belt Adjuster, GrayThis seat belt adjuster works wonderfully well for short people, of which I am one, and I wouldn't be without it! I purchased another one just to have in my husband's car, too. I have had different ones in the past, and have left them in rental cars!!! So I guess I should get a couple spares, too--they really help keep that seatbelt from cutting into your neck. So they are not just for kids!!!
