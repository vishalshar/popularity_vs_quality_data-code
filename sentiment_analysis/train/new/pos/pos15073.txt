I bought this head support for my 7-mo son for Bob jogging stroller. It fit well with the stroller straps and it is adjustable, so I could set up the width to match his head size. The only note is that though I bought the one with bear, I received the package with Monkey. Customer services let me know that they are not produced with bears anymore. I do not like monkeys, so I settled on a partial refund with the seller, bought supplies, took the needle in my hands and transformed the monkey into a bear myself. The item is very cute and super soft but as it is light in color, I expect it to get dirty at some point. I have used it for less than a week and my son does not eat in this stroller, so I do not know yet how fast this item would get dirty and how it withstands the washing machine.
