After seeing many pictures of how a breastshield is supposed to fit, I thought I was supposed to get a larger size. Pictures are very misleading! Ladies, buy the breastshield according to the size of your nipples, not the size of your breasts or areola! I now wear a 38G (after giving birth to twins) and needed the smallest size breastshield available. I noticed my supply took a huge hit when I used breast shields larger than standard.. Then tried the smallest size (one size smaller than standard) and my supply over doubled. I went from 2-4oz a session to 6-8oz per pump session..These are very well made and work great, but will do you no good unless you get the correct size!! Also, for those of you pumping because your baby won't nurse- check out nipple shields!
