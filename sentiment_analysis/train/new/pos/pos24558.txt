These are great sound blockers.  We really need something of quality for our 2 boys prior to us going to the Monster Jam monster truck show in town.  The show was inside an arena so we knew the noise would be loud and it wouldn't be good for little ears.  These things were amazing!  The boys loved them and wore them for the whole show.  They really enjoyed the show without having to worry about plugging their ears and we (as parents) enjoyed the show because the kids enjoyed it.  We've used these many times since then for fireworks shows and other events with loud noises.  They are great quality and we haven't had a single issue with these.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs to limit some loud noises.  Work great for kids but they will fit me as well.  A+++ product here.
