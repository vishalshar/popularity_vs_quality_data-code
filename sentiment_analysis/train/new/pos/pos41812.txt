This is the best all-in-one I've tried.Pros:TrimSoft and comfy-lookingCuteFits like a gloveVelcro much better quality than the velcro on other brandsAnd most Important:The poop doesn't ingrain itself into the material- it practically slides right off into the toilet, making it the easiest to clean up diaper ever! (sorry so gross)Cons:Only one- EXPENSIVE. I wish I could get a lot of these, and I would if they weren't so expensive. $37 is a lot of money for something that's used like a toilet.
