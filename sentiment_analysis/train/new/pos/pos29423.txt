I read a lot of reviews about these decals, and there were several negative comments on how they did not stick to the wall well. I have had them on our sons wall now for 3 months, and they have not even hinted at peeling off. Of course, we do have pretty smooth walls with an eggshell finish. The only negative I have for these is that they are pretty expensive for just stickers, but they do match the bedding we bought!
