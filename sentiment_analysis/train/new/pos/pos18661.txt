The bed literally came in pieces and you had to assemble from scratch. Not a big deal, just give yourself room and begin by laying all your pieces out. Only needed an Allen key (provided) and a Phillips. Instructions were all pictures, no words which was a bit confusing when it came to the Left and Right bottom rails. Accidentally installed backwards, but once we figured that out, it was easy to undo and put together. Very sturdy and beautiful. Used our crib mattress which fit perfectly as expected. Love that the drawers are separate and not one piece. I had the crib with the trundle as 1 piece and it was not convenient for me.
