We ordered these for my baby shower. They were perfect! My mom made pigs in blankets, then pushed these tiny pacifiers into one end making it look like babies in blankets. They turned out adorable and were a big hit at the shower. The only trouble we had was in shipping, and that was our fault for not shipping to the right address, then having to wait for the package to get forwarded.
