This is the second hand's free gate we tried and it's "outstanding" compared to the other one.  I know it's pricy, but well worth it when you compare it to the other at half the price.Thankfully we've raised our child in a working household, so the noise isn't a factor as the other reviewer's spoke about.  It's not silent, but it's not anywhere near the level that would wake our child from sleep.  Imagine you cough in the same room as your sleeping child; if they can handle that they can handle this gate.  If a cough would wake your child, then there probably isn't a hand's free gate made that would work for you.The installation instructions are pretty difficult to follow if you don't have a flair for doing something like this, but after some study I think even the most mechanically challenged will have no trouble getting it installed.  There are no tools required unless you don't have enough hand-strength to tighten it yourself.  If not you may want to use a pair of pliers to make sure things are snug enough.My wife came up with a good idea to insure it's secured in the doorway properly.  She had me buy a couple pairs of those brackets that you would use to install a closet hanger rod.  The rubber spindles fit perfectly into them; so even if you can't tighten them enough for your comfort (or just want the extra assurance), it prevents the gate from slipping out of position.  An extra $4.00 for a ton of extra peace-of-mind.Baby Bargains rates this brand of safety gate as the best; I can see why now that we've got one installed.
