My son is 2 and a half, and has had some of these blankies for almost 2 years. Their small size makes them perfect- he takes them with him everywhere, and they don't take up much space in his car seat, stroller, or suitcase, or my purse, or the shopping cart, etc. Because he likes to have at least 2 usually, we have 7 or 8 of them total, I think, and I'm considering getting 2 more in the green for him (only 1 of his is green, and Heaven help us if the ONE green one gets lost!). Another reviewer mentioned the stitching not working out right on hers- out of the many we have, only one has had that problem, so I would chalk it up to bad luck, not something to expect in the manufacturer's overall quality. Ours have all held up pretty well considering how much "love" they get, and they are still soft. If you are looking for a conveniently-sized, durable, snuggly soft lovey, you won't be disappointed in these!
