Our 3-year-old granddaughter gets very car sick - even on short trips.  With Mommy's Bliss, she traveled from Florida to Virginia via car, over 2 days without one single incident.  Unprecedented!  Her mom and dad can now travel "like normal people."  We are all thrilled, plus she did not mind the taste at all and it is easy to carry with you on a trip.  Very happy with this outcome!
