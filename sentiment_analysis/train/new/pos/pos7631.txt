I love this decal. Its what I was looking for. As it's not a Prime product, it took quite a while. It's very easy to get it wrong if the instructions are not follows. I watched couple of YouTube videos which also helped. I would suggest cut the entire decal sentence into single word and then apply one at a time, this way the chances of mistakes are much lesser. Once you get it successfully on the wall, it looks beautiful. Fills the blank space on your wall.The seller is pretty supportive and responsible.All in all I love and if needed, will purchase again.
