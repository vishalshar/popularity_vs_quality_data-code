Babies grow so fast and their interests change a lot based on their development. This one is a great find that my baby will always find a way to have some fun with.I bought it when my daughter was 4-5 months old, she just started to turn her body and learned to sit, she often played at the entrance of the turnnel, where I put a couple of hanging toys, and basically she used it as a gym.And when she can crawl(5-6mons), she loves to crawl into the living room through her turnnel to have some extra challenging fun.Later when she started to stand up by holding couch and table, which was about 8-9mons, she used those hanging toys to pull herself up. I was afraid she's gonna break the structural stick. But it's totally fine.Now, my baby just turned 1 year old, she walks for the most of the day. I put this turnnel away right before Christmas to spare more space for new toys. But she kept crawling under the table and heat her head. I just realize crawling into small space is how important and interesting for my baby. So I put this turnnel back again. She absolutely loves it. Now she will try to play kind of hide and seek or chasing game with us. She rolls over with it like a chipmunk. Even we sometimes crawl through it to chase her.In the future I am thinking of connecting it with other gym or play house just to add more challenge. I'm sure we can do a lot with it and get more fun.
