Yes, the sticker on the crank says "Plaza Sesamo" instead of "Sesame Street".  Fortunately my baby can read english and spanish... Just kidding.  I think it's actually funny and a good conversation piece since I don't speak spanish.  But if I didn't have a sense of humor about it and it really pissed me off that there was something I can purchase online that also doesn't come in an english version (The audacity!!!!!), I could fairly easily peel the sticker off the crank.  Problem solved.  I hope this actually helps someone decide if they would like to buy it instead of just sounding like an angry, whiny customer who doesn't know how to solve a problem.  Get a life!!!!!  Anyways, superfast shipping, very cute mobile, excellent price!!!!  Cookie monster is a bit heavier so I recommend putting him across from bigbird to balance the mobile.
