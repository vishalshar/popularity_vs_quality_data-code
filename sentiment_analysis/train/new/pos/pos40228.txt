Bought this for my son for our Disneyland trip when he was 1 1/2. He was the age that they want to try to walk all the time so I bought this so I would not loose track of him at such a large place. He loved it. The minute it arrived he put it on his back and would not take it off. I only gave 4 stars because I wish the backpack part was just a little bigger but honestly he did not care he put as many little treasures as he could fit. We used it again the next year when he was 2 1/2 and again it worked great still loved having it on his back. He tried to walk himself most of the time :) Yes people comment or frown at walking your child with a leash but his safety is my priority not their ignorance.  We also had a lot of comments asking were we bought and thought it was supper cute. What I also love is that the leash part is removable and now he had a awesome littl 'packpack' as he calls it.
