cute design, outside is water resistant but inside isn't.... the straps are weird and get in the way so i had to pin it all the way around to keep it flat..... and the material is pretty thin and cheap so be careful don't over stuff or pull at it.. also dividers don't go all the way down so items can slip under and mix.... for the price i love it all in all i wouldn't really recommend if you're super anal about organization, defeats the purpose.. but at this rate my daughter is getting older so there is less to carry
