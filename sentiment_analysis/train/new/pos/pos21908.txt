We're nerds who like to go camping in our travel trailer. What can I say?  We put these out front as a warning to other campers that we are the kind of people who put pink flamingos out.  It's kinda of fun to see their reactions.  A lot of rolling of eyes and shaking of heads and privacy.  They also help our kids to find our campsite.  Somehow they knew it was our campsite even when we hadn't told them about the flamingos.  Go figure.
