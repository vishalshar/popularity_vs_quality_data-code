I like these cups because they are a nice size for a one year old, easy to hold with the handles, the removable handle makes it easier to pack them in the diaper bag, my babies both preferred the soft spouts over the hard spouts, and the spouts are spill proof without having the stopper thing that it difficult to drink out of and clean. The spouts have a slit in them that opens up when baby drinks, but stays closed to prevent spills when not drinking. It's a great design, except that it doesn't last long. The slits tear together or open wider making the cup no longer spill proof. You can buy replacements, but they cost almost as much as a new cup. So, I use these cups when I give thicker drinks, like putting pureed fruit or baby cereal in my baby's milk. The thicker drinks won't spill through the slit, but baby can drink it easily.
