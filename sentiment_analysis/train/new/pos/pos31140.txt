I bought several of these at the start of the school year, figuring that if I got even a few months out of each one, they'd be worth the price.  Well, now at the end of the school year, I'm still using the first one I opened - no leaks, no problems.  It's survived a year of daily lunch box use, as well as use on the weekends.  The 6 cube mat slides in nicely in the Vera Bradley lunch tote, and works just as well in a Pottery Barn lunch box - with plenty of room to spare.
