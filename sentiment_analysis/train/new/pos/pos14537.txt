5 stars for I love it! I am broke but was looking for something to help at work. This is simply some shoelaces, elastic and some clips and clamps. I couldn't be happier! This goes right over my clothes, I just have to pull up my shirt and open my bra. It stays in place and holds the flanges securely. It is completely adjustable so there is no guessing sizes and winding up with something that doesn't fit right. It is small and fits into the tiny extra space that I have in my pump bag that I take to work.This also comes with instructions on how to massage the breast and increase milk production as much as possible. This company actually tried to help you be successful with breastfeeding and pumping as much as possible.This really is the simplest little product and I will recommend/actually go buy for some of my pregnant/breastfeeding friends as gifts. It is super economical and truly works!
