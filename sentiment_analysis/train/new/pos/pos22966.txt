this product is ok i guess. it does its job. but i would definitely just have ordered a nice good blender and that'll have done a better job. If you're buying this your most likely going to remake your baby's food and store it. meaning you'll making a few packs of food. this processor is rather small so i hated the fact that i had to do multiple blending for the same type of food. The blade was not that sharp too and the quality seem like toy material.
