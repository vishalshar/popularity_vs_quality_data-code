We have several Comotomo bottles that are much more expensive but my daughter (who is exclusively breastfed) will not take those bottles.  It's partly my fault because I did not go back to work for 9 months and so she rarely had to take a bottle.  Now that she's with her nanny during the day I've been trying to find something to get her to take her milk.  I didn't want to have to buy more expensive bottles to experiment with.  I happened to have 2 Nuk transition sippy cups and assumed that if I bought these I could pop them in place of the other nipples and voila it worked!  She likes drinking her milk from her Nuk bottles with this medium flow nipple.  I read the reviews and decided to go with medium flow vs. fast flow even though she is 10 months old now and I think she is taking to it well!  Great, cheap alternative to buying more bottles!
