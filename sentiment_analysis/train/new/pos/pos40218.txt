This item came in perfect condition... Only thing is the white it not painted on its a laminate... I laid a baby wipe on it...and the area lumped up... The wood is not real... It's more of a flake board.... If you don't mind that... And you can keep moisture from it...this product would be a good fit for you...Again I love the way it looks...but it is cheap quality...I don't think it was worth $169.09 more like $99.00...but it is very heavy...sturdy...very tall and wide so that was a plus...
