I bought this bib to replace another similar JJCole bib I have been using daily (4 times a day) for more than a year, and it looks even more durable than the first one!!! It has a reliable snap clip that is much better than velcro and my daughter has not been able to open it no matter how much she tugs and pulls. It is really easy to clean,  and the pocket hangs open just enough to catch everything that falls. It even holds nearly 2 ounces of liquids before giving in, which is great for kids learning to use a cup, and a lifesaver in car sickness episodes if your child has that problem. Best bib in the market! I would definitely recomend this one. But be careful since some other jjcole bibs are made of different quality materials (like jjcole large bib, pink blush which is not as durable)
