I've purchased both the P'Kolino Little Reader Chair and the P'Kolino Silly Soft Seating and I'm writing this review to hopefully help anyone who is debating between them. I'll initially review each item and will then compare them. The star rating above is specifically for the  P'Kolino Silly Soft Seating.P'Kolino Silly Soft Seating P'Kolino Silly Soft Seating in Pipa - Blue:I bought the P'Kolino Silly Soft Seating (in orange) for my 1 yr old son hoping he'd use it as a chair but also hoping that he'd enjoy building a tower with it, using it as a table, or whatever else he wanted to do. He very rarely sits on it as a chair but has had a bit of fun pushing the top of it around the house and occasionally throwing some of the pieces. He really enjoys sitting on the base sideways with one leg on each side as if riding a car and scooting around the house (or being pushed on it across the floor). The cover is fleece-like and picks up a lot of dirt easily from our hardwood floors and the foam is softer than I imagined, but it's a cute chair and we like it. While my son did have fun playing with it on occasion, I had hoped he would have shown more interest in it (particularly in sitting on it). This brings me to my 2nd purchase:P'Kolino Little Reader Chair P'Kolino Little Reader Chair in Green:I bought the P'Kolino Little Reader Chair (in orange) for my 17 month old son who loves to read (the same son who was 1 yr old when he got the Silly Soft Seating). He likes to sit in it while reading his books and enjoys putting books in and taking them out of the side pockets. When the product arrived I was surprised to see that the chair is meant for children 2yr+ since I hadn't noticed any mention of this on the Amazon description. I was even more surprised at the size of the Little Reader Chair because it fits my son quite well and he is very petite (~5th percentile). Although it's a small chair, I think it will fit him for a couple of years but I'd be surprised if these chairs were big enough for larger children. The cover is faux-suede and the chair is fairly sturdy (for foam).Little Reader Chair vs. Silly Soft Seating:I like both of these products but for different reasons. If you want a chair for your child that they will sit and read in, I would absolutely get the Little Reader Chair, but if you aren't looking specifically for a chair for your child and would like something more imaginative that they can be creative with, I'd get the Silly Soft Seating. It's much more of a toy than a chair. Also, it's not as sturdy as the little reader but is certainly sturdy enough. I'm glad we have both of these chairs because my son enjoys them but I think in the long run my son will get more use out of the Little Reader Chair.**UPDATE** May 21 2013 **UPDATE**My son is now almost 4 and he still occasionally uses the little reader chair (we keep it next to a bookshelf and he likes to sit in it and read). He also sometimes moves it around to a random place to sit in and read. Definitely a much better investment than the silly soft seating, which I packed away in the basement about two years ago because it was never used and was just taking up space. My son has a sibling now, and I have no intention of even taking out the silly soft seating because it's just more clutter (though cute clutter, I must admit).
