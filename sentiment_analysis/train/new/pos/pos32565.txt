I knew before I bought this that my little guy would love it--nothing like being able to stand up on your own and pick and choose from all these cool toys right within easy reach! It's a hoot to watch him grab the bendy animals and try to get them into his mouth, and he will spend long minutes hitting the spinning toys to watch them go around. I'm looking forward to when he's a little older and better coordinated, because I know from seeing older babies in the saucer that it will just become more fun for him as he's better able to balance himself and use his hands.What I didn't like about this was how long it took to put together--not particularly hard, but it was complicated, and took over an hour of assembling small parts. What was particularly bad was putting the clear plastic spinner (the one with the monkeys) into its proper slot. I think it was designed for someone much stronger than a 5' 2" woman, but I eventually managed it using a screwdriver to lever the plastic sides where the slots are apart enough to let the spinner's metal rod slip in. But if you have a guy around when you're building this, get him to do it--it might be easier.It's also a bitch to get this thing to fold properly, unfortunately, though I'm assuming it will become easier the more often I do it. The first time, however, I gave up in frustration because the legs just would not bend.But overall I would say this was a great toy, and definitely worth the purchase.
