I have twin girls and aside from a handful of stores, twin shopping carts are not available. I purchased this seat by recommendation of another twin mom and I LOVE it. It's fairly easy to set up and take down, though I may go from side to side more than once to make sure it's very taught, but we haven't had any issues. I will say that it does bring in a lot of attention.
