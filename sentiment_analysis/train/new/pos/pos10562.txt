I bought these bumpers for my daughter's nursery and I couldn't be happier with them! I loooove owls but I wanted something feminine and pretty. The paisley print and cutesy owls sold me right away. They are stinkin cute!! I didn't want the whole package as I made a crib skirt, bought softer sheets and hate diaper stackers, so I just didn't need all the other stuff. Good quality fabric, not cheaply made so I'm okay with the price I paid for them seperately. I did buy a few coordinating items to go with the theme of the room and so far have loved them all (hamper, lamp, changing pad cover, wall canvases)...I have yet to wash the bumpers, so I may come back and update depending on how they wash out but....they meet all my expectations so far! Fabric colors are as depicted, bright and cheery!  The ties on the corners are not quite long enough for a bow as some others have mentioned but I didn't expect them to be. The stitching and owl / flower appliques are adorable and sewn precisely. Sometimes things like that are a little wacky when mass produced, these are perfect. Overall, I love them. I think my lil'girl will too!! Lots of fun things to look at from her view...She's not due for another month but these are a great touch to her room!! :)
