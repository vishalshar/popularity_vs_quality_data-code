I bought this as I had had one when my kids were and nappies and loved it as a diaper bag. Then a friend with a 4 yr old and 7 yr old came to visit and was now using hers as an airplane bag and raving about it. So I bought a clean fresh one to use as she does for iPads, colouring (book and crayons pencil case), bottle of water first aid kit, small restaurant toys (figurines), it is fantastic! I keep it at the ready for restaurant outings, airplane trips, keeping little ones occupied during older ones activity classes. It is my total go to bag. It looks great has all the pockets to be organised can be hands free! It has it all! So well worth the investment as a diaper bag ( it is the best one I had - 3 kids and went through 5 diaper bags) and has a wonderful extended life as a travel/ day or night out with the kids bag! Very highly recommend! Stylish and very practical!Would even say Skip Hop could adapt this great model and make a bag to be used with older kids.
