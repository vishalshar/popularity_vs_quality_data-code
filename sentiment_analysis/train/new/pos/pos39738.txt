I selected this because the print was cute and worked whether it was my husband going out with the baby or me.I LOVE the little change pad that comes with it as it's so each to grab and use when out at public restrooms.The smaller loops and clips work perfectly on our stroller.I wish there was one small pocket inside for my cell phone. I throw it in one of the outside pockets, but my regular handbag has a specific interior phone pocket... that's the only complaint
