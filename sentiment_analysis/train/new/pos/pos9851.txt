I am extremely picky when it comes to strollers. This is my thrud child so this isn't my first rodeo when it comes to strollers . I have had peg per egos, graco, Mclaren doubl strollers etc. this stroller is BY FAR THE BEST HANDS DOWN I HAVE EVER USED. The look of it is very expensive with the aluminum modern frame and the fabric is made  very well. It is a tad but heavier then others but definely not a struggle to carry, it is however longer so out have to have a bit more trunk space width wise. It folds and unfolds sooooo easy. The hood is nice because you can order all different colors and just swap them out when you get bored for a different look. I ordered the pink for 9 bucks! I am still shocked at how rich this stroller looks and the quality for the price. I'm proud to wal around with it and my 1 year old looks like she is so comfortable !
