I used this product in 2011 with my first pregnancy and again in 2015 with my second.  Both of my children came out of the womb ready to eat, had a perfect latch, slept 5 hours, and were already in a circadian rhythm.  They are very even tempered and have long attention spans.  Increased Muscle control was visible in both of my children.  Who knows if it was actually Baby Plus but I am 2 for 2 with great babies and I would be a fool to not wear it again if I have a 3rd child.
