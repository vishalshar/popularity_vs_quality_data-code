These are one of my favorite baby items I own!  In fact, I have ordered several sets to have around the house, and have plenty to spare while they are running through the wash.These are cute, and SUPER absorbant!  It it truly amazing how much these can soak up, and they never leak through.  They have infinite uses for a baby.  We have one under baby's bottom on our changing pad at all times, it is easy to toss in the hamper and replace when it gets wet.  We also use them under baby's head to protect our furniture from spit-up while he is laying around with us.  They also withstand repeated machine washings very well, they actually just get softer over time.  These truly can be used anywhere you might have spit-up or urine leakage (or whatever else!).  They are small enough to fit a few in your diaper bag, and big enough to protect as needed.  They are NOT however, big enough to go under your entire baby, so if you want to protect from diaper leaks and spit-up at the same time you will need a larger pad or two of these together.These are most definitely one of the best baby purchases you can make, your home will stay cleaner and fresher!
