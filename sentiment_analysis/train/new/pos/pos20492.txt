This is one of the best purchases I've made for my grandchild.  I can easily take it anywhere in the house, even while holding her.  The various speeds allow me to adjust as she gains weight.Right now she is two months and starting to actually reach for the dangling fish.  Once she is able to pull on them, I'll change the lights & music setting to working only when she pulls a toy which is a feature I really enjoy.The only thing I don't like, which maybe is a defect in mine, is that the lights and music work only for a short while - maybe 5-10 minutes before you have to turn them off and on again.  It gets irritating to notice they have finished their cycle & now I need to go over & turn them on again.Also, the seat is deep enough that, at least at this age, I don't HAVE to always put the seat belt on - especially if I'm just putting her there for a minute or two.  She is clearly very comfortable in the swing and really seems to enjoy it.
