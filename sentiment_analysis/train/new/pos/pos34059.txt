We have several Bumkins reusable bags. They are easy to wash, either by hand or in the dishwasher. And, they dry out quickly when left on the counter for an hour. If you put them in the dishwasher, know that they will come out wet and still need to air dry before use.All in all, they get the job done. To give you an idea of size, these bags are big enough to hold half of a sandwich made with typical, square sandwich bread. Or, tons of carrots, celery sticks, raisins or whatever your kid is into right now.We've been using ours for a few months now 5 days a week (for school) and haven't seen signs of wear and tear on the bags or zipper.
