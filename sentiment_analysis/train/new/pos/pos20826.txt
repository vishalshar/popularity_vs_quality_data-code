I Love Love Love this spoon and wish I would have thought of it.  I purchased this spoon 3 years ago when I had my first child.  It was a life saver when we were out and about and she needed to eat.  Everytime I used it people would ask "what is that" and "where did you find it".  Well now I'm on daughter #2, and must say I use it often.  Two of my friends are new mothers and I had to get them one.  The only problem I have is that I have not been able to find the Boon Spoon in the stores in my area.  There are a few duplicates, but none like Boon.  Which is why I was excited when I found it on your site.  I'd recommend this to any mother/father/caregiver who has a busy life.  No more messing with baby food containers when you are out.  Just fill it before you leave, and it can hold your little eater over until you can feed them more.  EXCELLENT Product!!!!!!
