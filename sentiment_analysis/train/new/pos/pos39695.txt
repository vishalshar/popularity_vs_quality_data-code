I bought this pump for myself as a back up when I am away from my daughter and needed someone else to feed her. I absolutely love this pump. It can be a bit noisy compared to the Medela Lactina pump that I had in the beginning rented from the hospital. But this pump is great for the mom who really wants to just occasionally use a pump. I have used it for 11 months now and it has gotten the job done. It takes some time since it is only a single pump but for those moms who don't pump all the time it is perfect. I was always able to pump out at least 6 ounces of milk for my daughter and never had the worry about giving her anything other than breast milk. The cool thing about this pump to is that you can use other bottles than just the Medela plastic bottles. I used the glass Evenflo bottles and they worked just fine. I was able to pump both breasts in 30 minutes. It's half the price of the Medela Swing and works just as good! Plus its super easy to transport and not very noticeable! The only downfall I had is that the motor gave up after 11 months of using it..but I have been told that this happens with breast pumps. I loved it so much I bought it again!
