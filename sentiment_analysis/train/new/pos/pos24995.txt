We bought the Eddie Bauer High Back Booster Seat to replace the Graco Turbo booster for my three year old. She has never complained of it being uncomfortable. She seems to fit in the seat just fine and she is small for her age. We needed a carseat with a harness that did not take up alot of room for a small car with 2 carseats. We never had any trouble. The strap that allows you to tighten the harness is really easy for us to tighten. (In my sons carseat, we have to take him out of the seat to tighten it). We have no wear on the seat, and we have had it for about 2 years. We have not had to wash it yet so I can't comment on that. And it was easy to install. I'm always looking for the perfect baby/child equipment, and I have been through more than a few carseats. I think this seat is a keeper.
