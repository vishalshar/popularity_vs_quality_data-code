These are perfect for my baby to chew on. He's six months now and has loved them since he first got teeth at 4.5 months. I soak them, wring them out, then freeze them. He chews on them while they're frozen and happily sucks on them as they thaw. They don't make a mess because I don't freeze much water in them, so the terry material holds it in as it melts. We have lots of cold teethers, and these are by far my baby's favorites.I think these would go through the washer fine, but I wash them after use by soaking in hot water and baby soap (usually when I'm washing bottles, pumping equipment, baby toothbrushes, etc.), then rinse them thoroughly in clean water. They usually go right back into the freezer at that point.
