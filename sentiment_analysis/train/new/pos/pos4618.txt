I bought the set and purchased an extra fitted sheet in December '04.  I haven't had any problems with it.  I have a thick, Sealy mattress from Babies-r-US, put a waterproof matress pad on it, put one of the fitted sheets on, put ANOTHER waterproof matress pad on, and put the last fitted sheet on top of that.  It was a little difficult getting the last sheet on, but there weren't any rips or tears.  I've used it this way for 3 months now and haven't had any problems with durability.I did, however, wash the sheets and mattress pads in COLD water and dried them on LOW before putting them on.  I can't say how they would hold up on higher settings.
