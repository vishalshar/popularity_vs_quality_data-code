I bought this while pregnant & knew it would be the favorite sheet.I have 3 kids under 3, and we own way too many A & A blankets, quilts, wash clothes, etc...My son who is now 8 months- will NOT sleep on any other sheet.I had this in the washer the other day, and he wouldn't sleep until it was back on his bed.Needless to say- I went to the store and bought 2 more A & A sheets.Softest sheets you will ever touch. Babies definitely can tell a difference too.They wash so well. I have washed the one probably at least 80-100 times.It still comes out of the dryer like it's brand new coming out of the box.Well worth the spending.
