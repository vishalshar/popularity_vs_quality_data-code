I love this freezer tray, and am about to buy a second one -- but I do have a complaint.  After being stored in the freezer, the tray gives off an incredibly strong freezer burnt smell.  I don't know if this is how all silicone smells after being frozen, but it is extremely pungent. However, I haven't noticed the smell transferring to the food so I'm not incredibly worried by it.That being said, it is very easy to get the food out of these trays.  I just turn the tray over on to the lid, and push the food out from the bottom of the tray.  Voila! Individual cubes of baby food.  I freeze a lot of food so I put the cubes in to little plastic baggies, then wash and reuse the tray immediately.  I was also very surprised to learn that the item is nearly impossible to stain.  I've stored beet, blueberry, and cherry purees in the tray that I was certain would turn at least the lid pink -- but nothing!  Any food leftover on the tray or lid rinsed right off.  It's been 4 months of constant use and the product looks brand new!I do wish Beaba would make a similar product with smaller portion sizes.  The size offered is great for one sit down serving for an infant eating only one food at a time -- but now that we're branching out and introducing mixtures I would love to be able to make smaller portions of individual foods that I could mix right from the freezer. As it stands I have to either premix then freeze, and work with whatever I've mixed; or defrost very large portions and serve my baby the same food for two or three meals. A smaller portion tray would allow for more mixing flexibility.
