These are softer and better sized than Osocozy prefolds. The are also better priced.I liked using the Osocozy size 1 for my baby, but she outgrew them by the time she was 13 lbs. She is skinny, but I could no longer get the Osocozys around her waist. I bought the Osocozy size 2 and they are ridiculously long, yet the width is only 2" wider than size 1.I bought the large size in Imagine and they are great (she is only 14.5 lbs right now). They are 5" wider than the Osocozy size 1.(all measurements were made after several washings).
