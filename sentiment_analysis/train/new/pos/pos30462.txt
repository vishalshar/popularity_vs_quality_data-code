This is the second baby I have used this for. I mostly breast feed but need to have something for the occasional work shift. These really do seem to work well for baby, and I don't have to suffer the discomfort of baby using the wrong eating technique on me later. He won't take a bottle if I am right there though so it obviously isn't quite the same as the breast, but it is easily accepted when Mommy isn't around. There is a learning curve though, make sure anyone that will be feeding baby really understands how these nipples work and how the baby's mouth she fit around it. (just like on the breast!)  My husband used them 7 years ago with our first, but had to be reminded of a few things this time around. If you don't put the inner nipple in you will get leaks and it doesn't work as it should, and if you don't know how to empty the excess milk by pinching in the sides to open 2 holes,you will have a nipple full of milk, which can make eating a little harder for baby at the end of the bottle.
