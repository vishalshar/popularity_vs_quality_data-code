We tried a lot of different (and expensive) bottles before finally buying these based on the Moms on Call book recommendation. We were using Avent bottles before which worked fine but were expensive and bulky. These Gerber bottles are so cheap but our baby loves these, more than the Philips Avent (classic and natural) or the Playtex bottles. The only thing she likes better than these are the Kiinde bags. These haven't leaked at all and we've had at least a 8 or 9 bottles and caps. She went to the medium flow nipple pretty early (2-3 months) and that's been good for her for the last 4 months. The only thing I don't like about these is that it's hard to read the "S", "M", or "F" letter on the nipple so we've accidentally put the "S" on a few times and she hates it. If you're having any trouble getting your baby to drink from a bottle, try these out. They're so cheap that you have nothing to lose really.
