My baby is breastfed so I researched a lot of bottles before settling on these.  I wanted the transition between breast and bottle to be easy for her (and me!) and she has had no problem switching back and forth between the two.I would like to note that even though my baby is 9 months old now I still use the Stage 1 nipples if there is only milk or water in the bottle.  The flow from the Stage 2 nipples is too fast otherwise.  I use the Stage 2 nipples when I've added cereal to her milk and that works out great.I love the design of the bottle.  I like that the lid will snap onto the base of the bottle to help minimize lid loss.  Because they do tend to disappear otherwise!All in all, I've not been disappointed in these Soothie bottles.  They're all I'll use!
