These are awesome.  The problem with regular pacifiers is that infants drop them and they cannot find them.  Also, it is hard for the parents to try to find them as well as they fall into the car seat or other hard to find places.  These are highly visible and they give an infant a good target to grab and hold on too.  Also, these are just comforting for infants to have something to hold on to and play with.  And when they fall asleep and then wake up, they can usually find these on their chest in or in the near vicinity all by themselves.  We got one of these at our baby shower and I have since bought two more.  We have one in the car seat, one in her play area and one in her nursery.  I would like to buy more of these and stage them all over these house, but my wife says we don't need anymore (don't understand that logic).  Also, this is a great gift if you have to attend a miserable baby show (now that guys have to go to these things) - something useful instead of more doily clothes.
