After multiple iPhone dunks in various toilets around our house, as well as cloggings from who knows what (I REALLY don't want to know what was flushed) it was time to go hard core.As always, I read reviews for as many different products as I could find that do the same thing, and settled on buying three of these.The only criticism I saw was addressed by some smart user's suggestion to add some tacky material to the lip of the toilet bowl (like the stuff you line drawers with) if your lock slips (and only one of mine did, due to toilet design).Easily and quickly installed all three locks and waited for the gremlin to appear to see how he would react (and more importantly, if he could open or break it).  As I sat watching from behind the door, I heard the pitter-patter of tiny, cloven feet approach the toilet...him thinking no one was around to see his evil dunking deeds.But lo...as the miniature, but amazingly dextrous hands went to open the toilet seat per usual...something held!  It worked! IT WORKED! GLORY DAY IT HELD!  I observed from the shadows as the expression on the would-be evil doer's face went from devilish grin to complete shock and surprise at this new and unfortunate (for him) development.  He fiddled with it for a few seconds, head turned sideways like a puppy dog, with a puzzled look...then I guess it finally sunk it that once again he was being thwarted, and this was by design, so he gave up!  YES!!Knocked off one star because this is cheeeeeeeeep plastic people.  I'm actually shocked the 15 mo old did not just break it when he pulled on it.  Seems like it would have just snapped, but nope.  The house iPhones can sleep peacefully now.
