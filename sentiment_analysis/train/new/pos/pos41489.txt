Walkers seem hard to find these day, but we keep one at my husband's office for my son to cruise around.  There are no stairs for him to fall down or nasty situations for him to hurt himself.He loves the activity center on the walker and I love that I can take it off.  He can enjoy snacks or other toys on the tray table.  It also wipes clean easily.  He has no problem moving around in it, but we only use it on tile and the sidewalk outside. (No Cars its a gated area).  We haven't had any carpet experience so I can't speak to that.My one product con is that it doesn't easily fold down.  My sister has one that collaples into itself, I wish this did that.
