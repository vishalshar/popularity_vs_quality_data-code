I bought this mobile for my grand daughter when she was first born and was an extra cranky girl. She loves this mobile, which hangs above her changing table. I was disappointed with it when it first arrived, but have come to love it because she has always loved it.  She is 9-months old now and can grab it in her hands which is a delight. You have to wind it up and it plays "How much is that doggy in the window" over and over again. We have always sang along with the music and it is her favorite song and makes her smile. It goes to grandmas house and camping with us. She likes to pull on the bugs and they are secure enough not to come off and they have crinkle sounds when she touches them. When you first get it, you may be disappointed, but you will come to love it because it will make your baby so happy. We have had ours for 9-months, which is how old she is...she still loves it.
