We purchased these door knob covers because my 15 month old is now tall enough to reach the door knob and press in the lock.  He isn't alone for more than 5 seconds where this would really be an issue, however, I prefer to not have to worry about him accidentally locking himself in a room.  They were very easy to put on the door knob.  It is still very easy for an adult to use the door knob.  It is not at all cumbersome and prevents my son from pushing in the lock on the door.  At this time, I only have the covers on the knobs with locks.  Once he is older and can actually turn the knobs, I will buy more.
