I was on a look out to buy plug covers to keep my baby away from the hazard.She is a very curious baby! So, when I saw the reviews, a lot of them said its difficult for us(parents) to get the cover off the socket. Yes. This is true but, doesn't it defeat the purpose if you could open it easily?? Children are good observers mind you!!! They can do the same by just seeing you do it once!!There are little slots in the edge of the cover where you can slide a flat screw driver or the back of the spoon and get it out of the socket with ease! Just make sure you don't teach this trick to your little one!! :-)Happy parenting!!! :-)
