I would give this product five stars if not for the fact that it is advertised as a bed rail that can be used without a box spring. In truth, it should probably just be said to work with platform beds, though I was able to line it up well enough with the slats on our frame (we had some extras) for it to work pretty well. But I wouldn't say it's going to be an automatic for every bed frame. Assembly was very simple -- I appreciated the fact that no tools were necessary, yet the rail itself seems to be quite sturdy.I do not need for it to fold down at this point, so I can't comment to its effectiveness there. We suddenly had to move our 18-month old daughter to a "big-girl bed" and this was what I ultimately decided to get to keep her from rolling off the mattress -- the railing comes up to a nice height even with our relatively thick twin mattress, so I am very pleased by that because it has the advantage of making it less likely for my daughter to hurt herself on the middle support bar that is unfortunately squared off and not round.Overall we have not had any issues for the first couple of weeks. I will update this review down the road if anything needs to be added or changed. We plan to eventually use this with a box spring under the mattress when my daughter is a little taller, so that may warrant an update of the review. :-)
