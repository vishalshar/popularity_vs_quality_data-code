I love this product! We bought this a couple years ago when my first daughter became actively crawling and moving around getting into everything. We decided to mount our TV on the wall. We were able to put a power strip inside of this case and on that power strip we have the TV plug, our router plug, our cable box plug and our DVD player plugged into it. The cover also is able to fit all the extra cords as well so it looks very neat and the children can't pull on the extra cords hanging out of it. We also mounted it on the wall underneath a mounted shelf below that sits below our TV. I really like that it is adjustable and you can make the case smaller or larger depending on how many cords and plugs you need to fit inside. The power strip cover is pretty easy for adults to open and close but a child would never be able to open it since it does need a little force to push in the lock buttons as you slide it open. I worry so much about my children playing with outlets, cords and plugs, this is a really amazing product that truly takes that worry away!
