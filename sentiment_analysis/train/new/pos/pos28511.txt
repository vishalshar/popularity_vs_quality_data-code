We had this play yard shipped to my mother-in-law's home as we were traveling there for Christmas.  It was our one year old son's first plane trip and a long one at that.  I wanted to have a safe, secure spot for him to sleep and brought one of his blankets and stuffed animals from home.  It arrived on time and wasn't in any way flimsy --- very solid.  It was easy to get ready and our boy slept just as good away from home in his play yard as he did at home.  This was a lifesaver!
