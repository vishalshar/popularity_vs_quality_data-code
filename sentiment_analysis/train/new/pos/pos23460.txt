This booster was a little bit more expensive then the plastic ones we've looked at and had two of....but, this one is the most simple to use, it stays in place and is extremely easy to clean since it's one solid piece. It seems cushy for my 26 month old, we've had this one for over a month and he seems to like that it's easy for him to move to the train table or living room for cartons also. I would only use this with toddlers who are ready for a booster without the safety strap though. Overall, perfect, additionally, because it comes in colors that will compliment your dining set, ours is cherry and black. so the black was perfect AND you can actually push the chair its on all the way under the table, unlike many of them out there.
