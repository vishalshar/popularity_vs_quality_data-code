I researched ALL of the pillows available from Amazon, and found this one to be the best choice. Innovative design (with zippered insert that can be used with a baby), quality thick cover, long length. I originally bought a Snoogle from a baby store, opened it, saw that it did not come with a cover (it is just a bare pillow; a cover would have to be purchased separately), and put it back in its packaging and returned it.This pillow is not like others that take up half of your bed, and it is long enough (I'm 5'10") for me to have part of it under my regular pillow for elevation, the majority at my back, some between my knees, and the tail supporting my stomach. If I lie on it properly (and don't move around too much), I do not wake up with sharp backaches that had plagued me.The cover is soft and thick, so some people may find it a little warm. I put two pillowcases on each end, just to protect it a bit and provide some cooling. Once you give birth, you can zip the insert into the pillow and get more uses out of it, which is not possible with the other pillows. Plus this pillow coils up pretty compactly, and storing it in the plastic zip bag it came in does not take up as much room as other pillows.Shipping: I ordered this with regular shipping Feb. 11 (free Super Saver Shipping was not available at the time), it shipped the next day, and arrived Feb. 15. An extremely fast turn-around, considering it shipped half-way across the country and the estimated arrival date was Feb. 25.
