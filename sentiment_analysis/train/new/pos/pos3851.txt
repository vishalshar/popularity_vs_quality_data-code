Bought these for my daughter for a surprise.  She has been searching for these tops everywhere and can't find them.  The daycare keeps losing them and she was getting so frustrated because she did not want to have to buy the whole bottle again just to get the tops.  My daughter was ecstatic when she got these and was amazed that MOM (me) found them for her.  This daughter of mine is so appreciative that I really try to help her wherever I can and I was really happy that I found these for her.
