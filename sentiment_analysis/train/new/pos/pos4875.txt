We used cloth diapers for our first child but didn't have a laundry room sink or this sprayer.  Therefore almost every diaper ended up being rinsed in the bathroom sink and then the sink was disinfected.  Needless to say it was a process.  We looked into having a laundry room sink installed, but this sprayer was a little bit less money...I ended up installing the sprayer while my wife changed a diaper.  It took me less than five minutes to install the sprayer.  It would have taken a little longer if I installed the hanger on the wall, but it works great just hanging on the side of the toilet with the included bracket.  We turn the valve off when it's not being used just in case our three year old gets curious.  After reading several reviews about sprayers we also purchased a "Spray Pal - Cloth Diaper Sprayer Splatter Shield".  It definitely helps contain any extra spray but you could use the sprayer without the spray shield, you'd just need to be a little more careful.We've probably earned our money back on the sprayer in the money we've saved in disinfectant for the sink.Bottom line, we think it's worth the money.
