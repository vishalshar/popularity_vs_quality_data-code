My daughter has acid reflux so she has to have cereal in her bottle to keep her food down. Me and husband have been searching for "cereal nipples" for a while because cutting them with a knife just isn't working for us. We destory nipples like crazy. So ordered a few sets of these to try out.Pros: Great cereal nipple. Big enough opening for my daughter to use. She is 6 months right now. Easy to clean. She bites and chews on it and its still in tact, so they are durable.Cons: The nipple is kind of thin. But if you wash it with care it should last you a good while!These are one of the best cereal nipples I have found!!  I highly recomend them for any parent that is looking for a cereal nipple.
