First, let me say that I'm not using this in a traditional manner, but my usage certainly challenges the integrity of the product.I am a full time working mom who is breastfeed and pumping 3X a day at work.  I have an excessive amount of the lipase enzyme which cause my freshly pumped milk to develop a soapy taste within about 4 hours.  BUT, there is a solution!  Scalding the milk neutralizes the enzyme and prevents the milk from tasting bad.  To scald at work, I use this!  I pump, place in glass bottle, and heat to 150 degrees F.  To have the ability to do this in less than 5 minutes in a safe manner at work was a life saver for me.  In fact, I wouldn't be breastfeeding if not for this product.  I say that this is not traditional use, because I imagine that most users are NOT heating their baby's milk/formula to 150 deg... and honestly, I'm surprised that the fact that this can "over heat" a baby bottle is not a safety concern, but it is necessary for me.I'm actually buying another one for home because it's so much simpler than scalding over the stove!I did have one slight issue with the plastic knob fracturing (it was still functional, but moving the dial took a little extra care), however, I call the Munchkin customer service and they replaced with without question.I definitely recommend for any mom with the same lipase issue!  I also recommend in general, but be careful of the temperature as there is no automatic shutoff!Please vote on whether this review was helpful!
