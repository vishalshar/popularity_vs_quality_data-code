I purchased the blue version of this doll for my grandson when he was a baby.  When he was recently at my house and was inspecting his new little sister's stash of toys, he wanted to know why she didn't have a pink baby like his Blue Baby (his name for his doll.)  I was thrilled to find that Taggies made a pink version of the doll and I immediately bought it so they could both have their own dolls.The baby doll is small and light enough for a seven month old to easily hold and play with (i.e., stick it in her mouth to chew on.)  While she is too young to have it in the crib with her, from my experience with my grandson's version, it is a nice cuddly doll to have at nap time once a child is old enough to safely have a toy to sleep with.The tags are of great interest to our little one.  She picks the doll up by the tags and turns it this way and that using the various tags.  While with other toys, the tag is there for information purposes (and yet still becomes one of the most interesting parts of the toy), in this case, the tags are there to capture the interest and are an integral part of the toy.To top all of that off, I have easily been able to wash the doll for sanitation purposes.  I am very pleased with both this doll and the first one I purchased as well.  Considering that my grandson has had his for almost three years and still snuggles with it says a lot for the longevity of the toy purchase.
