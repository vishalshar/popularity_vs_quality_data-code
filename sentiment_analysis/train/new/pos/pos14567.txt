My babies only took this type of pacifier. It's so cute and everyone always asked me where I got it from.  The only downside is that you have to replace them often because they are natural and get sticky so if you plan on using this type of pacifier, I would suggest you buy multiples when ordering not only to replace but incase if you lose one you have one on hand and don't have to pay for rush order like I did when we couldn't find my  sons lol!
