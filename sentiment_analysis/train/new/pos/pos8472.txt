Delivery was around a week faster than expected. It arrived in good shape and seems flawless and tough to break, too. Good length for a baby (ours at the moment 8months). We expected a little bit bigger stones, but these are fine, too. Not sure about the effect of relieving the toothing pains, though. But we have other methods, too. Looks nice on our daughter anyways. Good purchase.
