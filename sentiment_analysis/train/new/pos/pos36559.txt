I received these as a baby shower gift in 2010 and they were used by my daughters until 2014 when they decided they didn't like them anymore. We thought we were done with babies and then came our youngest in 2015. These were on sale and I couldn't resist buying them again. This little toy was exactly how I remembered it 5 years ago which I was fine with because I never really had any complaints. I actually had regretted getting rid of them because my oldest was diagnosed with autism and one of the most calming things for her was water play.I decided to purchase these again so that all of my kiddos could play with it. Just like I remember, they are easy to clean and brought so much joy to my older two girls. Just like I had hoped my youngest absolutely adores them and this is all she plays with during her bath time.The only negative is the caterpillar is very difficult to actually link together. My six year old cannot even get the caterpillar to snap and then stay together so I know that may be a problem for many other consumers out there. However, it wasn't a big deal to me because my kids never liked it as a caterpillar. The only reason I even mention it is because the toy is advertised in its catepillar shape instead of just showing how you can stack them up, store all the pieces into one cup (they all fit well in the caterpillar face) or the water or sand play that these cups provide kids with a lot of hours of play. If someone based their purchase off of the caterpillar picture, they would be in for a huge disappointment. Again, we love our product and have bought it twice because of that! Everyone just needs to be aware of what they are purchasing.
