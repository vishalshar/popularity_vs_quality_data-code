We love this car seat cover. It is very well made and fits nicely on our Graco infant car seat. Our primary reason for purchasing this was to shield our baby from the blazing Florida sun while going in/out of places to the car. It also keeps her covered and away from little old ladies who like to touch babies without asking while we are in the store. It has a nice textured microfiber material on the underside. Some people have asked if it is too warm for the baby, but we use it in the Florida summer heat and I would definitely say it's not too warm. Very simple to attach and remove.
