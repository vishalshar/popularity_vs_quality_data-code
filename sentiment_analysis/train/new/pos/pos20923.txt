I absolutely LOVE the colors of this toy. The wood is nice and the quality is perfect. This is one of my baby's first Christmas presents. He will be almost 11 months old at Christmas (crazy!!). I thought it would be such a fun toy for him now that he's so busy using his hands for everything. The animals are adorable and the toy will be great for bringing with us on the go to play in the car or when out and about. Skip hop never disappoints with their products. There are so many toys out there that make noise and have flashing lights and all the bells and whistles, but it's really nice to have a toy like this in the mix for just calm, quiet play where he can just enjoy his new abilities and practice his motor skills without all of the distractions. Definitely recommend!
