My son was only five months old when we bought these blocks. We have to supervise him when he plays with them because they are meant for 1+. I knew this when I bought them and was hesitant but they were so adorable that I had to put them on my Christmas list. I am so happy that I did because even at 5 months he is able to play with them. He especially likes the block with the bell and once he picks it up likes to hit it into the other blocks. I build the blocks into a pyramid and he likes to knock them down, we do this for about ten minutes and he really enjoys himself. So happy I bought these blocks because they will be a great toy for years to come. They are high quality with a non-toxic finish, so when my baby puts one in his mouth and starts chewing on it I can feel at ease. Great product I can't wait to buy the other blocks that Haba has to offer.
