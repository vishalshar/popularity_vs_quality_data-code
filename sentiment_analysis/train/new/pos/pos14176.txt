These curtains are really cute! They look very nice in my daughter's room. I was unsure about ordering them because of the negative reviews, but decided to see for myself. I am pleased with them and think they are of good quality. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is that they are too long, but that might be my mistake in ordering the wrong length. Also I washed them to get the wrinkles of shipment out and was disappointed in seeing they badly needed pressed after removing them promptly from the dryer. I did not leave them in there long. Other than that, I'm happy with them.
