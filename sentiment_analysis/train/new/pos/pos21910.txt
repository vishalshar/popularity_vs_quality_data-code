Beads are nice and big. Very colorful also. Seems sturdy enough although the "string" feels kind of stiff and not as flexible. I have no idea if it will be more flexible with use as I gave it as a gift. Also, the box it came with had a hole in it. Almost as if someone's thumb poked right through it.
