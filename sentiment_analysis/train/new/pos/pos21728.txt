We were not sure what to expect with this order, and were pleasantly surprised to find a high quality, very classy looking piece. It works perfectly with the rocker/glider we use it with. The fabric cover is durable and the wood finish is beautiful. I looked long and hard to find a gliding ottoman, and I couldn't be more pleased with the Dutailier model.
