I use these inserts with my 4 y/o daughter who occasionally tends to have a slight tinkle at night.  I put these inserts inside her panties at night only and if she does have a minor accident, this holds the pee well and prevents her from wetting her night clothes and bedding.  They are soft and a good length (even my daughter said how soft they were!).  I have used gDiapers disposable inserts as well and the difference between the two is that the gDiapers are slightly wider than the Charlie Banana Disposable inserts.  I like both brands, but may favor the gDiaper brand slightly more just due to the width of their inserts.  Other than that though, the Charlie Banana's are great and would recommend them.
