You can't beat $14 for 2 changing pad covers (plus free shipping, although this isn't always an option).  The center part is terry cloth material, so it's nice and soft.  The outer part (the ivory dot part) is just basic cotton fabric, nothing special, but is on the side anyway so baby doesn't have to lie on it.  I also got a few of the full terry cloth covers (which are about $15-20 each!) and they're not worth the price.  I definitely recommend this but get a few since you'll need to change them often.
