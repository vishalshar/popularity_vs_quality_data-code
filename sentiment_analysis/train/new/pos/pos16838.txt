After reading many reviews and doing a lot of research I chose to purchase the Arm's Reach Natural Original Co-Sleeper. I have not used it with my baby as she is due in one month, but so far this is what I can say about it:In regards to the basinet itself, it is comfortable looking, although I must say that the mattress is as hard as flooring, which I do not believe it has to be this hard to keep a baby a little comfortable and safe at the same time. I will be taking care of that myself.The sheet it comes with is as scratchy as you can imagine, I totally agree with those who said they would be replacing it. I already have ordered the Plush sheet to avoid the noise when baby moves and to make it warmer. We live in very cold weather and this sheet is not what I would like for myself to sleep in. I liked the feel of the padding around the sleeping area, it's not as good as the one I have for the standard crib, but not bad. However, I do think it should have been more padded on the head end. Since it's designed for very young babies, who would not be moving too much in this bassinet, I believe it will be ok, but again, a bit more padding to protect the head would not hurt.The co-sleeper was quite straight forward to put together. I am 8 months pregnant, with the backaches and discomforts typical of that stage. I was able to put together this co-sleeper by myself in 30 minutes or less. Not complicated at all. I liked to see that the sleeper feels sturdy, not flimsy, and it has no factory smells releasing from the new materials, as some other customers metnioned. Perhaps it depends on the place they are stored... I got mine from Amazon, and again, no bad factory smells releasing.Overall, I am happy with the co-sleeper so far. I will see how my baby likes it, once I make a few changes to the mattress, of course.
