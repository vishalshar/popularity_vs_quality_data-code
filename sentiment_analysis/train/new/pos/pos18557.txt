This fits well on my Chicco KeyFit 30.  It took me a minute to figure out the best way to put it on the seat, but that's mostly because I'm stupid.  This thing works well.Edit:I'm taking off one star because of durability reasons.  I've used this shade maybe twenty times over the past few months, and both of the elastic straps that wrap around the car seat to secure the shade have worn out quite a bit, from friction against the car seat.  I'm uploading some pictures.  I was going to rate it three stars, but it was quite inexpensive and I like the design so I guess I could just buy another one when this one breaks, which I expect will happen fairly soon.
