These bottles are great.  My son was never fussy with which bottles he took so the cheaper the better.  They screw right onto the Madela pump which is a plus (no adapter necessary). You can fit a standard nipple on these bottles. They are compact and easy to clean.  The one thing I did not like was the nipple that came with the bottle.  It is really small and short.  When he eat with it is sounds as if tons of air is going into his mouth so I use Dr. Browns standard nipple.  If you choose to use a standard nipple the  bottle covers are a little short since they are built for the evenflo short nipple.  But if you don't mind that the nipple is a little jammed into the cap then they work fine.
