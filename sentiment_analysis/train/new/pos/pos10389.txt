I bought this product because we have Decora outlets, and it will accommodate both Decora or Standard outlets (2 screws top and bottom vs. one central screw).  It did that just fine.  Do make sure that your outlet is screwed tight before you install the cover.  Several of ours were loose and sat out from the wall, which made me panic for a minute that it would not fit flush to the wall, a problem others have commented on.  Tighten the outlet first!  Aside from that, this serves the purpose, and I only have two small complaints:  1) the white paint on the screws scratches easily, leaving a not so perfect finished look; 2) the cover is about half an inch narrower and shorter than the Decora outlet covers in our house, so if your house was repainted with the outlet covers on (as some of our rooms were), a frame of the old paint color will show around the outlet.
