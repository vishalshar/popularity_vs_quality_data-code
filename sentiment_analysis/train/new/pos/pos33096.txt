I purchased this gate because it's metal and I don't have to worry about my puppy chewing on it.  It looks great and operates as promised.  I would have given it five stars, but was frustrated by the installation directions.  My opening is exactly 32 inches, and the instructions said to use one of the side extensions.  It was impossible to do, as there wasn't enough room to put the mounting cups on the sides of the top of the gate, or enough room to insert the wrench to turn the tension nobs (again, just at the top--the bottom had almost an inch on each side, but that was pretty tight, too).  I removed the extension and prayed that the bolts would be long enough.  They were, and it seems very secure. I would recommend this gate to anyone who needs a small and attractive barrier.  The opening is narrow, as another reviewer pointed out, but it works for me.  I plan to use it again next year when my grandchild becomes mobile.
