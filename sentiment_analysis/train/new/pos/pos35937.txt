We have had this stroller for about six months and is has been a life saver.  My husband is currently away on a military assignment and I have to manage the kids by myself.  The eight month old loves to be able to sit and have a tray for toys.  There are two cup holders on his tray so one can be used for him and one for his brother.  My three year old loves all the options this stroller gives him.  He can sit, stand or hold on to the bar and walk beside it.  In fact all I have to do to get him back in the stroller is to say he will be strapped in if he doesn't come.  It is very important when they stand on the back to have them hold on to the handles and have the support strap up.  The basket is hard to get to but I use my son to get things in and out of it.  He feels very important doing that.  I appreciate the independence my son is learning and at the same time the control I have to keep him safe.  The zoo has never been so easy and fun... not to mention shopping.
