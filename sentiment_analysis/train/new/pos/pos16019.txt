I'm a frequent Baby Bjorn user turned Mei Tai convert.  Love this carrier as I was specifically looking for something with a back carry option. Much more comfy to wear without shoulder or back discomfort.  I tried all the popular carriers in the stores - ErgoBaby, etc, but I didn't feel the baby was as secure, evenly distributed, and comfortable as in this Mei tai.I'm petite, 5'4", 100 lbs, and my baby is petite, 7months, 13lbs. A member of our local Babywearing chapter recommend the Babyhawk for smaller parents & babies. I could never get my Bjorn snug enough. But with a Mei Tai, you can make it as tight or loose as you want. It takes a bit of practice to tie your baby up properly, but we're talking just a few trials. Front & back carry are both comfy and baby seems to love it.The pattern is beautiful and it even smells nice!
