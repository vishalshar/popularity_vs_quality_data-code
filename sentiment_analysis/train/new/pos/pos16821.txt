This is the BEST baby bag I have ever purchased. I bought 3 bags before this one and they did not fit my needs. I have 2 infants so I have to carry around a lot of things for both kids. Most baby bags get bulky and heavy when you carry too much but this one is easy to carry and does not get bulky. I love the 3 different zippered compartments because I can organize my things easier for each child and have a place to put my personal things. I also love the small purse it comes with for me to use. I can carry this around like a purse too because it looks like a big purse and not a baby bag. I am very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this to anyone who is not happy with their current baby bag or to buy it as a gift because it is worth it!
