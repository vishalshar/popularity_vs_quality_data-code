Awwww, I adore these bibs.  Honestly, I bought them for much less at WalMart. $5.44 for two.  I have about 12 now and every time my son eats, I use a regular bib, waterproof and then I put this bib over it.  These bibs are really large and catch everything that might fall down a baby's lap.  They are just terrycloth and have no other lining but they are great for eating.  My son has dropped everything on them known to man and they don't stain, they wash wonderfully and so far, after about 30 washings, they are holding up great!  No piling, no strings coming out, I'm really impressed!  The neckline is stretchy but does not sag when it's put on, it sits in just the right place.  I love these bibs!
