My twins and I loved these bowl and spoon sets.  When my twins first started self-feeding, these were the easiest for them to use.  The triangular shape and slope of the bowl paired with the small size and shape of the spoon allowed them to successfully get food to their mouths more often than with other bowls and utensils. Spoons of the same curved shape made by other manufacturers worked okay with the bowl, but not as well.My twins are almost two now and in booster seats, and we still use the bowls.  They are low profile, which makes accessing food easier for my babies who sit a little too low at our table.  They also stay put but don't suction, which is good for babies who like to force suctioned bowls off the table, with food ending up on them as a result.My little girl did chew the end of the spoon when she was teething, resulting in the yellow part deteriorating.
