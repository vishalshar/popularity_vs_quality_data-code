As a grandparent with two grandsons just now a year old and two weeks apart in birthdays, I have purchased 2 of these types of strollers and my daughter has one also.  While a little pricey, they have been the answer to many a peaceful moment when the boys are not feeling well, get too tired to hold, but don't want to lay down in bed.  Whether ill, or teething, these strollers are the answer to a happy, sleeping child.  They are easy to store, easy to set up, light weight, more maneuverable than any stroller around, and turn on a dime.  The handles are extremely comfortable from my height to my sons (5'8" to 6'3").  Both sets of parents feel the same as I do.  If you can afford only one stroller, this is the one to have.  With moveable extensions at the foot area, this stroller will take you from 4 months to 4 years.  The adjustable back lets the child sit upright, or lay back to sleep. The boys think it is a great investigative toy as well, with all the wheels (8 in total).
