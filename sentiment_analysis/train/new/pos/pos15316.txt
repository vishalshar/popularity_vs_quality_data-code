The color is neutral which works well in most vehicles. It holds both my toddler's carseat and my son's booster seat. It keeps the carseat from digging into my leather seats and has saved my seats from spills and crumbs. The back seems high enough for me and the front comes just to the edge of the seat, which I like because I don't want it to hang over or stick out. For the price, you really can't beat it.
