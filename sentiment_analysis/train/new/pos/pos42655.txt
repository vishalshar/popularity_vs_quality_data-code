First of all, I have a 5 year old, a 2 and a half year old, and 4 month old twins.  They have had this for about a month now, and I used it everday when I have to dash to get something in another room.  The babies are soothed by the sounds and love to watch the mobile go round.Here are some amazing things about this:1.  It has 2 sound options a soft sound, and then a louder one.  Although I don't consider the loud sound to be THAT loud, I prefer a more quiet house so I've never played it on it's loudest.2.  It has an option for no sound, I use this a lot!  They like to just watch sometimes, and now they like to reach for the toys, and sometimes I just want a silent time with them.3.  It's not jerky, I've had a couple mobile before, and they always jerked.  This has a very smooth, consistent motion which doesn't scare baby.4.  The music is not annoying or obnoxious.  It's Mozart and Bach - how nice!  On several occasions the babies have fallen asleep while lisetning and/or watching.5.  It really engages them!  They love being put down in the crib while I catch up on folding, or tidying up.What I'd like to see changed:1.  Batteries!!  Ugh, I hate them, a plug would be nice.  We are currently out of batteries and the poor things love it so much they are screaming at it to start up so they can have fun watching again.  And the batteries are C, those are a size we don't usually have lying around the house.  So when you're out (at least for us) we usually have to go and get it.  Oh well.  I still gave it 5 stars figuring I was being a bit picky.Love Love Love this toy, and so do the kids ;-)
