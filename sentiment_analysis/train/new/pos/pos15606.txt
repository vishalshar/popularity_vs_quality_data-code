These nipples are great! They fit any standard neck baby bottle (e.g. Medela, Life Factory glass, etc.) I have been using them since my baby was born and he likes them better than any other nipples because they have a rubber-like texture that os similar to the breast. We used them from day one to give expressed breastmilk. Baby did have some nipple confusion at times with the breast but not much. We started with the SLOW flow version of these nipples and then transitioned to the STANDARD flow version around 3-1/2 months. See the photo I posted for the two nipples compared side by side - on the left is the slow flow and on the right is the standard flow. They are the same material and both have a small hole in the tip, while the standard flow has an extra cross cut in addition to the small hole. See below for the flow rates of these nipples in comparison to some other brands (determined by simply holding them upside down with water inside):Similac slow flow - 1 drop every 5 secondsSimilac standard flow - 10 drops every 5 secondsMedela slow flow - 10 drops every 5 secondsMedela medium flow - 25 drops every 5 secondsLife factory level 1 slow flow - 2 drops every 5 secondsSo as you can see these standard Similac nipples are comparable in flow rate to the Medela slow flow nipples.Another note: as other reviewers have said, although these nipples are suppose to be single use, they can definitely be used multiple times if you hand wash them gently in warm water (they definitely will NOT withstand super hot water, boiling or steam sterilizing). I use them about a a dozen times before throwing away, or until they start to discolor.
