We purchased the Fisher-Price Open Top Take-Along Swing a few months ago for our daughter, and have been very pleased with its quality and performance. We haven't had any problems with the operation of the swing, even as our little one has grown to her present weight of 18+ lbs. It runs on C batteries, which for us seem to last almost a month with moderate use.This swing has several great features. It folds up very easily and really is as portable as claimed. It pops right in the trunk for trips to Grandma's house, and I've also used it quite a bit in the backyard when I want to do yard work. Having a 5 year-old in the house, I also appreciate being able to quickly carry it from room to room. Being only a flat 5 foot tall with short (and admittedly weak) arms, I have a lot of difficulty carrying the swing with the baby in it, but the swing is lightweight enough to carry one-handed while the baby's in the other arm.Though I'm pleased with this swing, I'd really recommend it in *addition* to a traditional baby swing rather than instead of one. The compact nature of this swing means that the rocking motion is very fast-moving, unlike the slow, soothing motion of taller swings. My daughter seems to like the Take-Along Swing just fine when she's in an alert, awake mood. When she's tired, however, it just goes too quickly, even on the lowest setting, and seems to overstimulate her rather than calm her down. I'd originally purchased this with the idea of replacing our full-sized Graco swing, but we've ended up keeping both around as they seem to fill different needs. Overall, I'd certainly recommend this swing - but if you're only going to have one swing in your house, you might consider whether you'd be more grateful for a big swing that rocks your baby to sleep, or this little one that entertains during those fussy, bouncy times.
