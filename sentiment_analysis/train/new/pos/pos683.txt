These spoons are life-savers when you have to feed your baby on-the-go. And I don't mean "on-the-go" as in sitting at a restaurant with a table to lean on and an upright dining chair for yourself. I mean "on-the-go" as in, in the back seat of a moving car while the baby is strapped into a rear-facing car seat, at a crowded birthday party where the only spot to sit is the sunken-in couch. These situations are ever trickier when you don't have another adult to offer a second set of hands to help orchestrate the delicate ballet that is feeding a baby without a high chair (hold the squirmy baby, hold the cup of food out of the squirmy baby's reach, hold the traditional spoon, coordinate getting the food into the spoon while staying out of squirmy baby's reach, aim spoonful of food into squirmy bay's mouth without making a mess). These screw-on spoons make feeding on-the-go or solo feeding a one-hand job, which is CLUTCH! Yes, they don't make much sense for a child who can hold and squeeze a pouch of food on his/her own. However, for younger babies who cannot do that, and for busy parents who try to get out of the house, a few dollars is a small price to pay for the convenience and mess avoidance that these spoons afford!
