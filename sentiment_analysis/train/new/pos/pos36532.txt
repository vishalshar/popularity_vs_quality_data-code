This item is perfect to beat the summer heat! the air blow is not too strong but not too weak so it's really great for babies. :) my only complaint is the battery compartment, you have to use a screwdriver to open it because they use this little screw to lock it (that can easily be lost, if you are not careful). now, we have to bring our leatherman whenever we are out in about so we can use it to unscrew the battery compartment if we need to replace the battery.
