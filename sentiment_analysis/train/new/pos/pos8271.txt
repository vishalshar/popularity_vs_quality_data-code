I love this bag. It is stylish and very useful. I use it as a diaper bag and purse but it could really be used for other purposes (college student, casual business person, teacher, etc.) There are so many different compartments and zips and buttons that it makes it easy to stay organized. I will definitely continue to use this beyond my diaper bag years. This may not be for you if you want to carry around a lot of bulky stuff because the material is somewhat lightweight and thin. It's perfect for my minimalist style but if you want to have a diaper bag that is big enough to pack for a weekend trip you may want something bigger. Another added bonus is that it is unisex.
