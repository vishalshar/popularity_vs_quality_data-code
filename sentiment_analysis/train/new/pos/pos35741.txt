Love this gate system. It looks so nice when it is up and helps keep the baby from getting into places he isn't suppose to go. I love the gate feature that doesn't allow him to smash his fingers when closing it. It closes on its on when you pass through it and these extensions are nice to make a perfect fit in-between large openings. Highly recommend, but just remember, you can only have one gate and two extensions of any size for the gate to work right, not three or four extensions as it will not work as designed this way.
