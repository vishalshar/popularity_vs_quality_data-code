after having bought every sippy cup out there, these are our favorites.  they don't leak and my daughter loves them, they really are spill proof (every cup says that, but these actually deliver on that promise)they are cute and easy for my daughter to hold, we have almost all the sip and smile cups and love all of them.  these are really nice, because her drinks will stay colder longer.just an FYI - the cups do vary in design, we have some of the older cups (the alphabet, number ones) and i just ordered another set and the new designs (none of which are pictured) came. one is blue with light blue mama and baby elephant and the other is yellow with an orange mama and baby giraffe - so cute!  much better than the number, alphabet ones.
