I expected to hate this chair after reviewing a handful of negative reviews.  But I bought it anyway because of the Consumer Reports rating.  We love it for one main reason - the chair and tray easily lower nearly all the way down to the floor.  Very useful if you are a floor-sitter or want to sit on the couch and hand your kid stuff or whatever.We haven't really had issues with the cover not being machine washable.  We do wipe it down after every use though, so that we don't end up having a science experiment.Update: now that my son can walk and climb, he has decided that the cloth thing under the chair makes a GREAT hammock.  He dives in there every day with a book or a toy and just hangs out.
