We live in an older home with radiant heat that just doesn't always seem to keep baby's room especially warm. I bought this for the crazy cold winter we had. It was much too big to be safe in the beginning, so I had to wait a month or so for it to fit right. My baby is in the bigger percentiles, too, so if you have a smaller baby, be wary of sizing. Also, and something that really irritates me, is that the zipper doesn't always "start" easily. And if you're a mom at 3am trying to change a diaper, you know how annoying this is. But I think it is probably just the one I got. It seems like a fluke, as I've owned other Halo Sacks and they all work great. This particular dog design is comfy cotton and thick enough to keep baby warm but not overheated.
