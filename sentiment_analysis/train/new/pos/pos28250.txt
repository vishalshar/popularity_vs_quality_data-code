I am very pleased with the visor, I use it on my 9 month old during bath time to keep the water out of her eyes, we got the duck and penguin and I use the duck the majority of the time, if you make it tight enough it keeps the water out of the child's eyes and ears.  It cost about as much to ship it as it did to buy it but I believe it was worth it!
