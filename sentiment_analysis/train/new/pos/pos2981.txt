I don't think some of those other reviews are fair at all. Of course some kids probably won't like some of the toys but that is not the fault of the manufacturer! Every child is individual. I got this for my daughter and, no, she couldn't reach the floor right at first so if that matters to you then you will be dissatisfied with this product. I, however am thrilled that it was like that at first because she could sit up and play and I didn't have to worry about her going too far so I had a little freedom to do stuff. Now that she is a year old and very tall for her height I am glad for how high this seat is so she can still use it.She has always loved the toys and at first we had to push the dinosaur for her but she caught on pretty quickly and loves to push it. I am personally grateful that they didn't make the dino louder because I am sure it would get on my nerves and she loves it.The trays come apart or completely off so that you can put other toys or food on the tray. Of course you have to be careful not to pinch your baby's fingers in the trays when closing them but once again, it is not the manufacturer's fault if YOU aren't paying attention and pinch your baby's fingers. Now that my daughter feeds herself I am jumping for joy as I can put her in there and put some food on her tray and she is perfectly content. I also have a friend with a 1 year old who uses it for feeding her son. Neither of us knows how we could ever get by without it.This walker is very easy to wipe clean and the seat detaches for cleaning, too. It folds very flat and would be great for storage if I ever stopped using it for long enough to want to store it. All in all it is an excellent product that I am so grateful to own!
