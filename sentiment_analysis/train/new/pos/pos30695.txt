I purchased this after finding out how much Toys "R" Us, Petco, and Petsmart were charging for the same thing.  The construction is perfect, however I have noticed the longer in length the section was made, the more prone the fence was to bow outward or inward.  The only other complaint is they are somewhat difficult to connect/disconnect from each other, as they are spring loaded on one end, and snap together on the other.  They are somewhat difficult to clean if they get dirty as there are a lot of  nooks and crannies that require time to clean if spills/dirt accumulates.  I suggest that you purchase at least three sections, as this will allow for the right amount of space for a puppy (or child) to move around.  These sections allow for easy set up, you don't need to buy any other sections to start the fence, as they work on each other.  The fence folds up, but requires at least 2 - 4 feet depending on the number of sections you have.  The gate is relatively light to move, but are a pain when taking in or out of the house or up/down stairs due to their bulkiness/floppiness when not collapsed - I find it easier to not take them apart and instead use two people to move them.  I did purchase more sections from another dog owner, his complaint was that his puppy learned to climb up the fence, fortunately mine has not, which makes it nice, as I now have two play areas - one inside my home and one outside.
