I  really like this playmat because it was a great value for the price.  The size is perfect and the colors are a little different than what you usually see for boys play gyms.  My son is 4 months old and loves it. My only complaints are: That it doesn't come with a  more durable travel carrier (the cardboard box has a handle so you can reuse it),  like one made of clear plastic,  like done of the other bright starts mats (we  also own the girl version and love it which is why we decided to try this one for our boy). I also wish it had a way to change the battery in the little bug that makes music. My  son used out so much the battery has run out already. Otherwise  it's s great product. I  would buy it again.
