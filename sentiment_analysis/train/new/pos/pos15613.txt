For convertible car seat without sunshade this is probably one of a kind solution.Not fit perfectly but definitely better than nothing.Better used for forward facing than rear facing. We tried both ways.The meshed sides are good for air circulation but doesn't block sun raysso to make it fully work in summer sun it has to be pulled down very low.Luckily my two year old likes to be covered and invisible to us sometimes so it works out fine.I expect it to work next summer when we head out to the beach.It blocks street lights at night time so it doesn't hit the child's face directly when she'srear facing. Forward facing it blocks street lights from the side.Anyway, it's worthwhile to have one of this and its price is right.I don't think more expensive ones would do much better though,because the convertible car seat is usually quite wide and tall.Any sunshade would need to be adjusted manually.Add a heavy duty paper clip on the back stripe helps.
