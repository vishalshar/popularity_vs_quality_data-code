Great manual pump.  Was worth every penny and more.  Very easy to use.  Instructions were very clear on the method to pump to get good flow from this manual pump. Never had any problems with it.  I could screw on a medela bottle to the bottle attachment, I did not always need to have the evenflo bottle that it came with. Three all plastic parts in the dishwasher, expect for the 2 smaller blue pieces that I washed by hand b/c I didn't want to lose them in dishwasher.  I would recommend this to any mom as an alternate use when you don't have ability to use your electric pump.  It was also much quicker to use this in the car or while traveling instead of setting up battery pack to large pump with hoses, etc.
