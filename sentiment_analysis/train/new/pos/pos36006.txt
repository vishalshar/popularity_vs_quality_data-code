I definitely recommend these bowls. So useful, great for little hands learning to carry their own dishes as they won't break if dropped, can be microwaved, and are dishwasher-friendly. The silicone needs to be wiped again after the dishwasher to remove the waterspots that are really apparent on the bowls and look ugly, but I gave 5 stars as unsure if it is a matter of my dishwasher or the silicone. We use these these every day.
