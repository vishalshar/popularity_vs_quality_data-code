I have been using these for about a month now. As another reviewer stated, they have some minor pilling from the wash but it does seem to be diminishing with each wash. I'm not worried about it though. They quilted up nicely after about 3-5 washes and are very soft. We used a different kind of prefold prior to these and they feel rough compared to the swaddlebees! I purchased the large for my 9 month old who is about 14.5 pounds. After washing, they are still about 3 inches too long so I just fold it down in the back before I fold them and snappi them to her. I had purchased the mediums for her and they fit absolutely perfectly on her but I didn't want to have to buy more when she outgrew them (which I guessed would have been within a few months). So I sold the mediums to a friend and then purchased the large instead. With the extra inches, we should now be able to make it all the way to potty training with these. I would definitely recommend these to any prefold fan, or for anyone looking into cloth diapering (NOTE: for those new to cloth diapering, they do shrink after washing but they are designed for that so don't rely on the measurements, instead look at the suggested weight ranges). They are very easy to use and they wash up pretty easily. The unbleached color is great because if you do happen to get any stains, they wont show as much. I purchased three packs (18 total) but really I probably only needed about 14 diapers (wish they came in 7 packs!) so I probably could have gotten by with only 2 packs of 6. Oh well. All in all, a great product and would buy again. And you can't beat Amazon's price - about $4 cheaper per pack than most places!
