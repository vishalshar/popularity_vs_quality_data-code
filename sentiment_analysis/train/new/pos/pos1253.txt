This is my son's favorite blanket! I currently have about 6 of them as he is obsessed. They go everywhere with him so I need extras to keep him happy while I wash them. These blankets are small but small enough for him to hold and cuddle with (He's 2). They are extremely soft. They also are very durable since I wash them frequently and they get dragged through mud and in the sand box! The older ones have lost some of the fluffy softness but are still holding up. They are not the cheapest blankets but they are hard for me to find so I buy them here on Amazon. I'm just hoping they don't go out of stock or my son will be so upset!
