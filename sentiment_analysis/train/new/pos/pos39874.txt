This is my short review of the Graco Snugride Platinum. For people considering the 22lb Graco snugride I cover some of the features of this model:GracoPedic foam, a weather boot, an infant head support, harness covers, and front adjusting harness straps.My wife and I chose the 22lb over the 30/35lb because we were told that babies tend to outgrow an infant carseat because of their length rather than their weight. So although the 30lb seat allows for 8 more lbs of baby it only allows 1 extra inch of length.The base was very easy to install with the LATCH system and we had no problem adjusting the straps for our tiny 5lb baby on our trip from the hospital. So far our baby has loved the carseat and I would highly recommend it.
