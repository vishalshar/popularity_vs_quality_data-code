This travel system is great. We love it, however the wheels started wearing out after using the stroller just a few times. We have contacted the seller who was very concerned and sent us new wheels to replace them. We received the rear one just about couple weeks after contacting them, we still waiting the front wheels to arrive, (are on back order). The seller provided excellent service and we highly recommend this stroller, you're going to love it as well.
