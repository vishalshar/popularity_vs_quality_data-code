I initially thought my baby wouldn't be attached to lovies or pacis until I found these!! She stopped using pacis once we started sleep training, so I needed something to help soothe her. Before she was 9 months, I was afraid to leave anything in her crib due to SIDs. However, once she turned 9 months I purchased a few expensive lovies on Etsy and she never grew attached to any of them. So I figured she just didn't prefer them.Since these got such great reviews, I decided to try them out and after a week or so she loves them!! It's great to have 2, and I actually leave both of them in the crib because she usually holds one of them when I pick her up and takes it to another room. Being absent minded and sleep deprived, there have been times where I forget that she brought her lovey out to the living room and as soon as I put her down in her crib for a nap I have that silent "oh shoot!!!" moment where there's no lovey in sight. And as soon as I find it and drop it in her crib, she is refusing to nap and cries extra hard to take her out of her crib! But now that I have the spare already in the crib, I no longer have those silent panic attacks or screaming baby.I also heard her wake up in the middle of the night, and checked the baby monitor. She was crawling around in circles trying to find her lovie in the dark. Once she found it, she cuddled it and was sound asleep! She's also not super attached to it where she carries it around everywhere but she loves having it to sleep. These are well worth the price, and are great quality for less than 10 a piece. My baby also loves biting on the bunny head and it doesn't shed stuffing or pill like some of her other stuffed animals do.  I'm debating whether or not to buy another pack just to have around when we travel!
