I couldn't have lived without this in the early days of my child's first months.  This handy bracelet allows you to mark the time of your last feeding.  Alternatingly, you can use it to count the # of feedings in a day.  You simply reverse it (flip it inside out) to indicate right or left.  It is up to you to decide when you are going to do this - at the beginning or the end of a feeding.  The bracelet provides the recording system; you provide the brains! Unfortunately, with so much sleep deprivation, brains are in short supply. That's why this bracelet is invaluable or you would simply forget the last time you fed.  It is helpful for knowing if you need to wake up your newborn if it's been more than three hours - and it's helpful to know when the last feeding was - in case you are about to leave the house.  I would recommend this to all.  It's also much nicer than the replacement I bought at Babies R Us when I lost this one.  My only complaint was that the shipping cost on this item was almost as much as the item itself.
