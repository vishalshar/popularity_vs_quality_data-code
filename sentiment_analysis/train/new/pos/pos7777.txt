People are lazy. This is an old school gate; there are no magic buttons or levers that make setting it up and taking it down a .0001 second process. If you didn't like how these gates held up in 1990, then don't buy this one. I; however, have no issue with finding the right slot to lock the gate into nor do I have an issue with lining it up, hopping over it, or RE-setting it up when I take it down. If you don't want to deal with a few extra seconds to set it up or hop over it, then go pay too much for a magical gate that sings you to sleep. We use this for our dog, but I know it would stop a baby b/c it locks FIRMLY in place.
