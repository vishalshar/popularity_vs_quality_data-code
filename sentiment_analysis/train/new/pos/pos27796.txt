I love this set.  I've only washed it a couple of times so far and it has fared well.  Time will tell.  The only complaint I have about it is minor:  When packaged, they used tape to keep the spoon and fork held to the plate, etc.  When trying to VERY carefully and slowly remove the tape, it came off of the plate fine, but it "chipped" the design on the very edge of the handles of the spoon and the fork.  If I had the time (or the energy) to return the product and get a new one, I would have...but honestly I simply don't have that.  The set is truly adorable and the little boy who got the dinner set absolutely loves it.  It makes him smile looking at the tractor on the plate.
