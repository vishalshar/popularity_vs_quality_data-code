I bought this because I needed a simple tub to help me bathe my 2 month old. We had a fancy inflatable one and it would not hold water. The price was perfect on this little bath and it fits my needs in every way. I know he will out grow it, but that holds true for most infant baths. I put it in the tub and fill it until the Hippo is about half submerged. That way baby gets to splash and feel the water without it getting in his ears. The Hippo can move a bit in the tub, but it's not like I plan on walking away and leaving baby in it. Also, once done, I shake off the Hippo and hang dry from a towel rack in the shower. Some other posters complained about mold smell, but I have not had this problem. If I do, I will simply spray it down with a water/bleach solution and rinse. If you are looking for a basic little tub to keep your baby safe while bathing, I highly recommend this product.
