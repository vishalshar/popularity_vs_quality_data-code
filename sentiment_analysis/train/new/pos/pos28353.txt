These fit perfectly on my Lab's large orthopedic bed.  I buy them to help keep the washable quilted cover cleaner longer.  The sheets wash up nicely and I have some that I've been using for about 5 or 6 years and they have been in the wash every weekly wash day.  Only now are a couple of the sheets beginning to wear thin enough to be replaced.  No problem with the elastic either.  Still holds a fit snug on his bed.  If the quality of these newly ordered pair is still as good as what I've been using, I'll be a happy camper.  Beat the heck out of Carters and some other brands I used when youngest child was still in her crib and/or small youth bed.
