I bought this because my toddler started biting her nails and sucking her fingers, hair, shirt sleeves, blankets, and toys. I tried painting her nails with the yucky tasting polish, but she didn't seem to mind the taste at all and just kept biting her nails and sucking on her fingers. This pendant is perfect for her. I shortened the strings (just open the clasp, slide each clasp down the string, tie a new knot on each side, and cut off excess string) so that it would be the correct length around her neck. We've only had it for two days, but it has been great! I've had to remind her about her necklace a few times, but for the most part she remembers to suck and chew on her necklace rather than everything else. Lint doesn't stick to it and it withstands constant chewing from my 3 year old's teeth. It has safety clasps too that will come apart if there is too much pressure. So if it snags on anything, I know my daughter is safe because the necklace will just come off. This was so worth the money. I just ordered another one so I can wear it for my 6 month old. He loves to pull on my jewelry, so this will be great when he is nursing or when we are out and about. He can play with it to keep himself entertained. Hopefully it will prevent him from sucking on my shirt and pulling my hair too!
