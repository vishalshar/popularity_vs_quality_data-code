I bought this to keep my Granddaughters toys in.  My daughter has 2 of them for toys at her house.  She keeps 1 in the family room and the other in the nursery.  I just love it, it's big enough for grandmas house toys, and it is sturdy too, even though it is collapsable when not in use. My older grandson came for a visit and really leaned in to find his toys and the toy box held up to his abuse.  The top, when closed has a velcro tab to hold it closed, but it will fold over to stay open too.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  Great price here too.  My daughter bought hers a target, same price, but had to pay shipping. Oh yes the brown colors very nice and keeps it looking clean.  Check out the size, I think it's perfect, but it is not a huge huge box, so if you are thinking it will hold Every toy a child owns, look for an actual big toy box.
