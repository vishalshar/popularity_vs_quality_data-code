I've been looking for something like this.This is perfect. Before getting this I was using those rubber bib with the little compartment to catch all the dropped foods. But ever since my baby started finger foods, the sleeves and pants she wear during food times as gone R.I.P. So I would have to change her either before or after.Now I just put this on her with or without the extra rubber bib and it prevents most  food from getting on her clothes! "Most" because she still manages to get food on the side of her thighs. Just so you know it's not 100% but pretty considering how messy they can be.. it's pretty good.Very easy to wash-- I just rinse any food off after each meal, hang dry and it's ready to use by the next meal.Will need to buy a few more to put it at the in-law's house!
