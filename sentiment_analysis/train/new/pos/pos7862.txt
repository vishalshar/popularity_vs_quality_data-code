We were given this pink/brown set for a gift a few years ago, but with the whole house being nice plush carpet, we didn't use it much as it would come apart when they would sit on it.  We installed new vinyl plank flooring in the kids playroom and decided to break it out again.  They liked it but wanted a bigger one. So we bought the blue one to mix up the colors and match the kids stuff in the room.  This is the configuration my 5 year old daughter came up with minus 2 squares.  I figured $20 was cheaper than an area rug!
