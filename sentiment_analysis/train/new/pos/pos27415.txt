Every two year old to whom I have given this as a bday gift has LOVED it. It has remained in the families as a classic toy to be passed down to the next siblings in line. Yes, it takes a bit of coordination for new walkers or impatient little ones to keep Spotty from tipping over. But he is big enough to feel like a real dog and the toddlers love the leash and that clever swag and wag as he rolls along. Highly recommend!!!!
