I had purchased a medela swing last summer before I had my son. After having several problems with thrush, we realized it may have been something to do with the pump so I went to order new tubing online and decided to get all new accessories. Since I stopped using my pump, the thrush has been long gone. I was thrilled to re-order all brand new parts and be able to have a reserve pumped again. All items were brand new and exactly like my old ones which I was excited to replace anyway as they'd been sterilized so many times, it was probably ready for new parts anyway.
