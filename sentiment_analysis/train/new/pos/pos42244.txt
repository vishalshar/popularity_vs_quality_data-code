I got this for my 3 month old and I LOVE it! I wanted to get something so my son could take naps if we were downstairs without having to keep the pack n play permanently set up. This works wonders! We keep it on the couch and use the wedge piece in the pillow for his naps. The wedge also works well if you flip it around for a support to sitting up. I tried to use the pillow for tummy time, but I'd personally rather lay a blanket on the floor. This pillow is also great for traveling if you don't want to bring a lot of stuff. For me it's a bed and a chair that doesnt take up a lot of room and that's awesome!The pillow itself is very well made and durable, not to mention adorable fabric. The two removable pieces have covers that can come off and be washed, but the actual pillow does not have a removable cover (too bad). The two pieces velco in, so there are no worries of them moving around. The price is very reasonable and the shipping was decent (time of purchase to arrival was 7 days). I think we will be getting a lot of use out of this pillow for the next several months! Highly recommended!
