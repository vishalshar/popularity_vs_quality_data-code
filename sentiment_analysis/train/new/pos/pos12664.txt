I got this to teach my child how to brush his teeth with an actual tooth brush. So far so good, he LOVES brushing his teeth with this.*This has a thick handle with small bumps on it for little hands to grab onto it easier.*The bristles are soft, and not hard for babies gums.*Fun colors to make it the first thing my child grabs for.*The "tooth paste" tastes good. (yes, i tried it lol)The only cons about this toothbrush I found are that it can't fit in our toothbrush holder, the handle is way too thick. Also, if your child doesn't quite grasp the whole brushing thing, and chews on the brush, it tends to make the bristles go all crazy. We're probably going to have to buy a new one soon because of this. But, I can't really blame that on the brush, more so its the fault of my child for chewing it like a piece of bubble gum.
