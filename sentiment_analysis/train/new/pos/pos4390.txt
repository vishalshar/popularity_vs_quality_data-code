I bought this when my 1 year old was going into daycare and needed something to sleep under when the weather turned. We have another of this type of blanket at home, and how cute is Pooh on there? I've been very happy with this blanket. It's light enough and small enough that I don't worry about him getting tangled under it, yet big enough and thick enough to cover him and keep him warm. It's very soft, and has held up well in weekly washings - the edges aren't fraying at all and the stitching has stayed put. A word of warning: you should probably wash it separately from the rest of your child's clothes. I washed them all together the first time, and the darker items came out of the dryer covered in fuzzle. (Update: February 2012: After a few washings, the blanket stopped shedding fuzz and I now wash it with the rest of the laundry. Woohoo!)
