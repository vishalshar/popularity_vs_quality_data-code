We purchased this rug to match some of our other Kids Line components in the nursery.  The rug is on the smaller side which fits well in our nursery.  The design is very nice and the quality above average.  We have it on an dark wood floor which creates a nice contrast.  The rug would slide around very easily, however, so I purchased a rubber liner at home depot and sewed it to the back.  That did the trick.
