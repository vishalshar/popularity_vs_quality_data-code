I know many experts say these don't work...but I think they do.  My sis-in-law recommended I get one because she had very little to no problems with teething with her 3 children.  I bought one, but didn't put it on when the baby was first born.  The first day that "teething stuck" his little mouth was HORRIBLE.  I thought, "I can't put up with this, it's too much."  My baby was cranky, fussy, wouldn't nurse, wouldn't sleep, you name it.  Then I remembered the necklace.  I put it on him and it worked.  I'm not saying the results are instant.  It was a couple of days later when I thought to put the necklace on him...it's not like they have teething symptoms every day (I would have died).  But from the time we put it on him, he hasn't gone a day without and it has helped.  I can still tell when he's teething, but it's not nearly as bad.  He just wakes up in the night and wants a pacifier to help sooth his gums (way better than screaming his head off for hours) and he chews on everything.  He just had his first 2 teeth push through 3 days ago, and it really wasn't that bad...NOTHING like that first day without the necklace.All in all...it works!  It makes teething better for you and baby!
