The first time I used this product, I found it to be a bit confusing, but I quickly got the hang of it. The center of the cover plainly reads "THIS SIDE UP," and the front and rear of the cover is quite obvious to figure out. This is what makes the assembly of it very easy.  When I get to a restaurant, I am able to quickly cover the high chair in less than a minute, and get my son seated with piece of mind that he's not being exposed to the germs of other little kids.  The best thing about it is that it's disposable, so I don't have to worry about folding up a disgusting dirty high chair cover and taking it home with me.  Whenever I'm at a restaurant, I always encounter at least a couple moms asking me where I got the cover.I'm docking it for one star because I think the packaging of the covers isn't well thought out.  When you receive the package, all the covers come folded together, instead of individually.  This can make it frustrating at restaurants when you just need one cover.  So what I do when I receive the package is I take them all out, separate them, fold them up individually and then pack them in my diaper bag.Other than this one suggestion, I think it's a great product and a definite must-have for your diaper bag.
