I needed a dozen roman shade cords to be taken out of the reach of my 2 and 4 year olds. The Mommy's Helper cord wind up was inexpensive and simple to install. Other reviewers cite problems with the product falling apart if the cord is pulled to open the blinds, but I have had no such problems. Our cords were very long and it was faster for me to manually wind them around the spindle inside the bottom half of the housing instead of spinning the closed housing to wrap the cord. Also, when closing the unit, a significant amount of force was necessary to get them to snap securely (this may be where the other reviewers are having problems with the Wind Up falling apart when touched). I've had them up for two weeks, opening and closing them daily, and have had no issues at all. They unobtrusively blend into the decor and require no special hardware to install. I'd recommend them to anyone.
