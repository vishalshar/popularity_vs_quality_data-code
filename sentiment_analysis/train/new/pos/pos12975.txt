Like another reviewer, I too suffer from dyshidrotic eczema on my hands. I have been using a prescription steroid cream for days, and it was getting worse...just terrible. I paid for next day shipping and received this on 7/30/14 at 5 p.m. I put on a light layer. The dry feeling began to abate. A few hours later, I put on another, this time with cotton gloves. It's 10 p.m., and I am shocked. The cracking and splitting has improved by probably 70%, and the peeling has stopped. I sent a picture to my mom...worth every penny. Thank God.
