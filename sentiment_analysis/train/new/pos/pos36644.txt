We bought Roan Rocco in 2012. Always had wanted a pram for our baby so she could stretch and be really comfortable. My husband and I spent many hours "test driving" different carriages sold by baby stores. Unfortunately, here in the US, as strange as it sounds, the choices are very limited. The stores either sell carseat-type carriages or trendy European carriages that are also built for the convenience of the parents and do not seem to have enough room for the baby.Roan Rocco pram had everything we'd been looking for, and a very reasonable price. I was somewhat skeptical about buying online though. To my pleasant surprise, the pram arrived the same week we ordered it. It looked AWESOME, much better than it did in the picture. The bassinets (both of'em) were HUGE and the built quality was top notch. We now have the 2nd bassinet on and it's just as roomy as the first one. Really really HAPPY with our stroller. We've had it for over a year now and it gets complemented almost every day. It's extremely comfortable for the baby, safe, great looking and unique. What's not to like?!!A special note about the Dasalika. Two weeks ago I needed an extra part for the stroller. I located my amazon order from 2012 and sent a message to the seller. Oleg called me in three hours after I hit the "send" button!!!! A week after, the extra part arrived. Superb Product + Superb Service = Very Happy Customers!!!!
