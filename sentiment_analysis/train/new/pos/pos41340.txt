Not all blankets are created equal, but this is the closest to the aiden and Anias blankets. So beautiful, I bought the mini floral and get so many compliments on it. They are huge! Big enough to cover the entire front of my Phil and teds sport double stroller. (About the same size as the bob revolution single stroller- for reference-jogging stroller) I appreciate the fact that when my baby was younger in the infant carrier and stroller I could use the loose ends to tie onto the car seat or stroller handle for added control when needing shade. I didn't really use this one for swaddling but if I had it would have wound around my baby several times. I could see how you would be able to use this blanket for swaddling even when your child is two years old. Folds up super small or rolls and fits into my diaper bag or backpack well. I've used it for spit up, blowouts, to protect from the sun, light drizzle, and as a seat protector. These are the best! My baby is almost two and soon will outgrow, but of all the other baby items and blankets I've donated or passed on to others, this is one that I would keep for myself just to have on hand. Try one, or give as a gift! Why spend almost $40 or over on the other brand when you just want to try it out, or give a nice blanket for a baby gift? This is the way to go. Trust me the parents will thank you later. Also washes well, and cuter patterns than the other brand!
