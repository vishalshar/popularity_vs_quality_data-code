I read some of the reviews only after I bought this. I feel sort of silly because I didn't realize you had to count the movements yourself either, like some of the other people. With that said I still really like this product. At first I was slightly disappointed, I thought you just pressed it to your belly and it counted for you lol Actually you push the button every time you feel a movement. I can see other people's point that you could just keep count on a piece of paper but if you are a busy mom like me and you get a minute to lay down and watch tv or whatever for a few minutes after a long day before you have to get up and make dinner or do baths or whatever this is a great way to be able to just lay there and when you feel something you just press the button, the thing is already in your hand. I thought my baby wasn't moving a lot before I bought this,to the point that my doctor wanted to do another ultrasound to check on the baby, now I know that she is moving much more than I realized before and I've only used it once. I would recommend this product as long as you know what to expect. After all it is only $4.99. :)
