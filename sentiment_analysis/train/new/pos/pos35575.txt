We live in an old house with a TON of outlets and are foster parents which means that EVERY single outlet in our house has to have something plugged in or be covered. These arrived quickly and were enough and then some for all of the outlets throughout my house. The only downside is that even as an adult they can be difficult to remove, but I also think that is a good thing as it means these crafty kids can't get them out either.
