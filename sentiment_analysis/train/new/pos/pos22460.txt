I feel like some of the negative comments about the product should be addressed, as sometimes the problem is more to do with the person using it, than it does the product itself.1.  yes the seat slides.  In my opinion it slides quite well.  When you first buy it, it will be a little harder to move but your baby will get the hang of it and the more he/she plays in it the easier it will be.2.  The height of it does adjust.  My son was completely normal height and started using at 9 months.  My second son is currently 7.5 months and has been using it comfortably since about 4 months and is not abnormally tall.3.  Sometimes toys break off...BUT my oldest son is two and used it, my niece is 1 and used it and now my youngest is using it, and on top of that my oldest niece (3) and 2 year old still climb in and out of it sometimes and they all bash the toys around and all the toys are still intact and all lights and sounds still work... It's even had orange juice and water dumped on it twice and everything works perfectly.4.  I've never seen any excersaucer, jumper etc with a massively padded seat.. EVER..they are all about the same (imo)5.  The seat is removable and the kids still love to play with it when the seat is out because they can run through the middle.
