We waited for awhile to purchase the changing table, cause we couldn't justify spending the cash on "just a changing table"  We bought something at Ikea, which was shoddy and way to small for our son.  We saved up and finally ponied up for the changing table and I would say it was the best purchase we have made with concern to all the baby stuff we bought.  No bending over, perfect height to change diapers, no need to find more space to put a changing table, our son loves laying in it, its just been a huge help.  So, buy the dang thing.  You will be happy you did.
