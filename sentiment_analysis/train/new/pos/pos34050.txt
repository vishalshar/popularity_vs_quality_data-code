I purchased this bags because they were cheap. I have been using the first years bags which were ok.I freeze them flat saving lots of space! Just make sure they are correctly sealed and freeze them lying on top of a napking so they don't stick to the freezer.Pros:- great value- can freeze them flat and they don't leak (just make sure they are closed correctly)Cons:-the plastic of the gerber bags is a little thinner than the ones i used before.-they are not very stable when you stand them up.
