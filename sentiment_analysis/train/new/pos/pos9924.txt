When our baby girl was born, we found ourselves looking  at a number of double strollers, none of which fit into our 2nd Gen Prius! We found that we can throw the buggy board into the trunk of both our cars with ease alongside the MacLaren Quest folding stroller, and they work equally well on semi-crowded trains and in Airports where you wouldn't dare to take a double stroller.We marketed the buggy board as a "skateboard" to our 3-yr old son, and he hasn't wanted to sit down in the "baby stroller" since the first week we got the buggyboard. He loves it, and it seems well balanced with the MacLaren, provided that you put a baby or diaper bag in the stroller. It's pretty squirrely to maneuver when he wants to ride without any ballast up front, but we manage. So far as I can tell, this is the largest tradeoff when you compare the MacLaren+ Buggyboard solution to the Caboose or other in-line tandem strollers. It doesn't give him an opportunity to sit down, but he's so active that we're never going to get him to sit for long anyway.It's great to be able to extend the utility of our serviceable and much-beloved MacLaren stroller to meet our current needs for about 1/3 the price of a nice double stroller.Parents with one or more children come up to us at the zoo and ask us about the buggyboard, including many parents with double strollers in tow.
