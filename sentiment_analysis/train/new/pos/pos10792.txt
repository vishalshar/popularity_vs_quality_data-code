I was the kind of mom-in-training before my 1st was born that hadn't even considered cloth diapers until hearing how friends of ours had done research about the cost difference. Yes, cloth is an investment, but SO WORTH it!! I wish I had come across these bags when I first started using the diapers since they are so much better about holding the smell in than using plastic grocery bags in a foot pedal trash can...not to mention so much more eco friendly. I toss this bag in with the diapers to wash it and dry it and it works great. The smell isn't completely unnoticeable (especially since my son's diapers are some of the worst I've ever smelled - working in childcare for 17 years, I've smelled quite a few), but the smell is A LOT less than it was. Thanks goodness! The size is great too since they hold everything we use up in a day, including the cloth wipes.
