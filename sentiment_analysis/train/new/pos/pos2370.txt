I really love this entire collection.  I purchased the bunny picture, the shelf, and this clock to use in my toddler daughter's bedroom.  The three pieces really coordinate very nicely together.  My only disappointment with this clock is that it doesn't come with a battery.  I think it should definitely come with the battery since it takes a special clock battery and not just a regular AA battery.  I have yet to locate the battery to this clock, so it sits on the shelf for looks.  I really love this line and highly recommend it.
