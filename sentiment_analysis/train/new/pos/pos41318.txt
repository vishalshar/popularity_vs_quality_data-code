My daughter has Down Syndrome and was on a feeding tube for the first 6 monts of her life.  As you can imagine the feeding tube created a huge food & liquid aversion.  We finally got her to eat and drink from a bottle but she refused to drink from any of the 15 sippy cups we had purchased prior to the Baeba.  We first tried the cup with the nipple attachment but the nipple collapes because it is not vented, which was expected.  But the minute we attached the spout she got the hang of it and has been drinking just fine out of it.  The water flows freely from the spout so water will leak if it's not standing up properly, but that's ok for now until she can move on to a regular sippy cup.
