My baby is small (18 pounds at 1 year) and I had ordered the larger BabyBjorn Potty Chair and it just seemed too big.  This one seems like a much better size for him.  Both potty chairs are sleek, easy to clean, simple design.  The bowls seem to be interchangeable.  However, the Smart Potty is about an inch lower than the Potty Chair so it is a better fit for my little one.  I thought the higher back/sides on the Potty Chair would make it seem more stable, but my child seems very stable and comfortable on this one.  I will post a photo of the two chairs side-by-side for comparison... if I had been able to see them side by side I probably would have purchased the Smart Potty to start with!
