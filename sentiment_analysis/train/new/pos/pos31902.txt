I love it and it's O.K. all at once, so I went with the middle ground of 'I like it' for my star choice.  I love it because it works perfectly -- we have it on the front of our stainless steel refrigerator (it bends only a little around the sides of our LG french door, otherwise is the perfect size) to keep a grocery list on.  I can imagine it wouldn't be so great on a wall or anything textured.  We have used chalk and a chalk pen -- the chalk wipes off dry, but leaves residue just like any chalk board, so needs to be cleaned with a damp cloth on occasion; the chalk pen always needs to be wiped off with a damp cloth, but either way it comes completely clean.  It's only O.K. in that it isn't really removable -- it sticks so well that it stretches no matter how carefully it is removed (and some of the more delicate cut outs even tore) and so when re-positioned, though it's still sticky enough to re-stick, it has bubbles and waves that can't be made to go away.  I was a bit disgruntled at that when I tried to re-position it on the fridge, but not so much so that I didn't buy another one to replace it with (I am a bit OCD and couldn't deal with the ripples, even mild though they were).
