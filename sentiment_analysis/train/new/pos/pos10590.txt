I read a lot of reviews for the Ergo and Beco carriers and finally decided on this one because I love the zippered pocket and it was on sale for $90.00!I like it well enough and managed to get my baby into it in the backseat of the car to go to the grocery store. I had to use the infant insert when he was 3 months, but he's starting to get bigger and have more head control, so now we can just put the pillow under his bum and he's more comfortable.I do think the infant insert was an inconvenience and I found it difficult to get my baby comfortably positioned in it.But the carrier itself is great and I hope to get a lot of use out of it. The straps are also quite easy to adjust if you want to share the carrier with your partner.
