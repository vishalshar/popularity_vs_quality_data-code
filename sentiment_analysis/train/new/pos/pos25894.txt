I purchased this item when my daughter was about 5 months old. She enjoys playing with the bee and ladybug spinner as well as banging on the rattle, even now at nearly 10 months. The mirror also is a popular feature with her.We think this toy improved her disposition in the carseat, because it gave her something to engage with. Due to the position of the carrier in the back seat, she could not see much other than the seatback and seemingly became bored. The toy seemed to help that quite a bit.It seems to stay in place well and can be slid out of the way when you need to access the baby. The only thing I'd say is a negative is that when you rotate the carseat handle up, unless you remove the toy, it blocks full retraction behind the hood of our Chicco Keyfit 30. This position makes it more likely that you'll bump the baby's head on the toy as you take her out of the carseat. It's a fairly minor inconvenience compared to the enjoyment she gets from the toy.
