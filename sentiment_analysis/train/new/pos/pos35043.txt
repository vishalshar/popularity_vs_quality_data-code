This review is mainly for how awesome the manufacturer is! I purchased this chair last April for a baby shower in June. The baby just turned 6 mos old and they just attempted to use it for the first time on Sunday. When putting the chair up, she noticed a plastic screw had broke through the plastic where the leg connects to the seat. This caused the safety latch on the side of the chair to not latch properly. Now it's been almost a year since I purchased this chair and she didn't not fill out the warranty information, so I thought we wouldn't get a replacement. (Which really upset me because this was a brand new chair still!) But, I contacted the manufacturer on Sunday afternoon and they replied that night! They shipped me a new chair on Monday and I had it at my house by Wednesday (and it was in perfect condition)! I could not believe it, by far the best customer service ever! I'm so glad I chose to buy the highchair from them!
