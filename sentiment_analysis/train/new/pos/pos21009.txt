Yes, it does get moldy.  I didn't realize this with my first purchase until a few months of use (never took it off the faucet.. why would you?) and one day I did remove it and noticed the thick BLACK MOLD on the inside of the cover!!! Really disgusting.So why did I purchase it again?  Ok, this is by far the BEST water deflector out there.  I've looked high and low but nothing compares to this.That said, there are a few things you MUST do to keep it safe and mold free:1. You MUST rinse off and let it COMPLETELY dry every day.  I know this sounds like a hassle but finally it only takes an extra 10 seconds.2. Do NOT keep it attached to the faucet daily especially if you also use the shower.  After rinsing off, I usually put it on the towel wrack to dry off until next use.4 months and no mold so far.I also let it soak in vinegar water every month of so to clean it.So, great deflector but minus one star for the inconvenience.
