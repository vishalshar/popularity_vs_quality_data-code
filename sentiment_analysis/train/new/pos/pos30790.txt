We have researched crib mattresses thoroughly and we decided to go with Colgate Classica I - I decided not to go with the dual firmness mattress, I think it's fine for baby to sleep on a firmer surface even when he is a toddler. I also heard there is not much of a difference between the two sides in terms of firmness but I can't attest to that.This is a great mattress, it fits our IKEA Sunvik crib perfectly. It is very firm and sturdy, I feel good about my baby sleeping on it.
