I was struggling to help my then-2-month-old sleep as all the large swaddle cloths I'd invested in seemed to fail in stopping her from wiggling out. Somehow, she was the Great Swaddle Escapist and once her arms were out, she would cry, seemingly calling for help to sleep. I must have about 12 different types of swaddle cloths with me at the moment. More than that, I think I also tried different methods of wrapping the little wriggly worm up...all to no avail.A good friend then suggested I got the Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe. Velcro tabs, right? Why didn't I think of it? Anyway, I immediately went online and bought on through Amazon. It arrived 18 days later (I live in Singapore).What I like about this swaddle is that (1) It's lightweight and not hot (2) It's stretchy so baby's movements aren't restricted (3) the VELCRO tabs which help secure her snugly. I might add that it's versatile enough for me to leave one of baby's arms out as she can then soothe herself by gnawing her hand if she needed to in the middle of the night. So far, she sleeps like a dream at nighttime. I put her down at 9 pm when she's drowsy and she just dozes off 6 hours at a stretch.I must admit though that she still can't get beyond the 30 or 45-minute mark for daytime naps. There may be a few reasons why. But there were two occasions where I found her with both arms flailing about when she cried during her nap. I guess she IS the Great Swaddle Escapist. Hoping that with time, she'll be better able to nap in this swaddle.
