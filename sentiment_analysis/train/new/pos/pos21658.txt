I've been looking high and low for something to replace a plastic folding table we've been using as a hallway gate for our dogs and toddler grand kids. I looked at the metal systems but they are SO unattractive or weren't wide enough or something else. This was the only attractive wide-fit gate for a reasonable cost that was wall mounted and would swing either direction. It's an unique design and mounting system. One side mounts with simple hinges and the other mounts with a piece of wood with a plastic cover. It's supposed to accommodate up to a 48" opening and ours is 47.5". You need to be careful when installing, make sure the templates are flat on the wall or you may have trouble lining up the gate with the latch. Make sure to use a level as well as the tolerances are minimal.I really don't have any complaints since it's brand new and we need to use it awhile to see how it holds up. If I had my preferences the latch would be easier to pull open but I understand why it's not, the kids could do it themselves. I like the dark color which matches our decor best.Big Red1/18/11  UPDATE!It's been almost 6 months using the gate. We ended up buying another for the bottom of the stairs to essentially provide a closed-off playroom for our 2 toddlers. I ended up using some industrial automotive double sided tape to hold in on the railing so I didn't have to use screws and it works great! Bottom line? We love these gates. One complaint is that the screws holding the plastic cover on do not reach properly but I can replace them easily. I like that the stair is easily mountable and can swing either direction. Proof these work is that both toddlers hang on these things relentlessly and they keep on doing their job. We use them for pet access control as well. We recently had to move a large item up the stairs and removing and replacing the gate was a quick few minutes with an electric screwdriver. BRAVO!
