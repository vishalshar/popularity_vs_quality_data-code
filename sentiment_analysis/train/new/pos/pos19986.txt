These are great water bottle covers for kids.  The fit perfectly with the Klean Kanteen sport bottle and 12 oz wide mouth.  They also work with the Crocodile Creek kids stainless drinking bottles.  An Im sure it works well with most other kids drinking cups...the material is a bit stretchy so it fits and conforms to many shapes it seems.  They seem to be of good construction...well worth the price!Works with:1.  Crocodile Creek kids drinking bottles2.  Klean Kanteen stainless steel water bottles - sport top, Sippy cup version and 12-ounce wide mouth
