So far, so good.  After much debate and gnashing of teeth, I made an executive decision and went with this Tadpoles set of mats.  I liked the fact that they are 2'x2' tiles, which makes assembly and disassembly a little less tedious, and that they are available in non-rainbow colors.  I bought three sets of 4 pieces each, along with a 192" baby gate/playpen thing.  They work great together.  With three sets, I have enough for a 12'x16' area that covers a lot of the living room, so our daughter can roam freely.  Or I can break it down into smaller pieces.  For example, I broke it in half today and brought the baby and the gate out to the back yard.  She was happy, and I didn't worry about her eating grass and rocks.Quality seems to be pretty solid.  I've mixed and matched the tiles and borders several times, and everything fits together perfectly.  No loose tiles or lifted seams or bad connections at all.  The tiles are a good thickness, they're easy to clean, and there was no odor or problems at all right out of the box.  I think we made the right choice, and I recommend this mat and would buy it again.
