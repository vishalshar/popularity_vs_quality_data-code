Tried: Born free, Avent, Dr. Brown, Prince Lionheart, Tommee Tippee.This is probably the best in my opinion. No leaks from the nipple because of the cross cut design, minimum parts, ergo bottle.This kit is awesome, you get all the nipples, my son is 7 /12 months, and still use the level 2.  I use the level 3 when mixing the rice cereal in the milk for a more hearty meal.  Skip the level 1 nipple after 1 month or 2.Fun fact, the nipples for Avent, Born Free, and Thinkbaby are interchangeable.
