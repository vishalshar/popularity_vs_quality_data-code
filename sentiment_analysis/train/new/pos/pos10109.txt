I first noticed the plush cushioning that you don't find with most car seats, it feels soft and good against the skin. The handle is easy to adjust, sleek and comfortable to carry. It's light weight, smaller and narrower than the last car seat I purchased. Then we placed it into the base and began really seeing the featured we were looking for. Recline, oh yeah! Easy to remove and reconnect. Latch glides come with the seat to place in your car, talk about easy, plus the newer latch system is much easier to use the older style. Straps are simple to adjust. I love this car seat! Worth every penny!
