Since my daughter it's almost 2.5 years old she is to that awkward weight and age that she wants to walk more and I can't carry her and items purchased. I started teaching her to touch the car with little success. then remembered seeing a Parking Pal Magnet and I knew that would be something she would be able to focus on. It's definitely a work in progress on our end but so far she seems to be doing well with the suggestions offered through Parking Pal Magnet. I'm glad i decided to purchase our magnet because i know she will grow into this safe habit of staying near the car!
