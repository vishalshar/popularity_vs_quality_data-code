Our problem was that our monitor setup lived on the charger for 1 1/2 to 2 years before having our problem.  One morning we woke up to hear the monitor beeping and flashing battery.  I don't hear about chargers going bad before the several replacements of batteries so I ordered another battery.  While waiting for it in the mail I pulled out my tester and found no power coming out of the charger. (Yes it was plugged into the wall)  I checked the power at the outlet and had 113v.  I checked the original battery and was getting 3.6V so this made me believe there might be something wrong with the monitor.The battery arrived yesterday.  I let it warm up in the house for a bit and installed it.  No more beeping.  I plugged in the charger and nothing happened.  It pretty much hit me right then and there that my thought the charger had finally went before the life of the first battery was gone was correct.  Very surprised by this but now I question the quality of the chargers.To verify I needed to purchase a charger (wanted to make sure there wasn't something wrong with the monitor itself) I went around the house and found a 5v 550 charger for something I no longer had. (The original charger is 6v 800)  I cut the wires and hook it up.  The battery showed charging.  I left it on the charger but the battery would not go above 80%.  I am sure this is because the system was 6v and once it got so high the battery just fought down the charger.  I unplugged it and ordered the proper charger today but I stayed away from the OEM version because I feel it should have lasted longer.I guess I have never even heard of a simple wall charger going bad unless there were electrical problems in the house.
