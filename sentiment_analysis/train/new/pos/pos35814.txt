Bought this for our Grandson's birthday. He's just turned 8 and we got a call with an excited little boy on the other end of the phone. "I love my mouse!". He is an avid chess player and loves Minecraft, but I knew he also is so fond of little animals and this mouse just captures your heart. He had lost a tooth over the summer while visiting us in Florida and as soon as I saw this guy and I knew he was perfect.
