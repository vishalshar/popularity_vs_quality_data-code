This bag is wonderful. Plenty of space/pockets inside/outside of the bag plus the additional compartment on the bottom for anything you want! I use it for its intended use and always pack a snack/meal for the baby when were going out. It's so nice when you're out shopping etc..and you can give your child a snack of blueberries or yogurt vs just goldfish or puffs! I love the side insulated pockets which easily fit sippy cups. I bought additional freezer packs and put them in the side pockets for milk or even additional food if I need it. The bag comfortably hangs off shoulder and is less bulkier than most diaper bags believe it or not. It's more tall than wide which I like. I currently have diapers, wipes, bottle of puffs, baby books, sunscreen, spare clothes, and diaper rash ointment and arm and hammer bags in the main compartment. I use the 2nd big zipper compartment for baby's toiletries/ meds, the small zipper pocket up top for pacifiers, and the small outside front pocket for travel size Clorox wipes, hand sanitizer, and any other small, odd end objects. PLENTY of space for anything you could need without the oversized/bulkiness. My husband doesn't even mind carrying around this bag. I've never had issues with zippers, getting bag to sit upright, etc... As other reviewers have mentioned. I recommend this bag to everyone and wish I would've had it when I first had my baby 14 months ago!!
