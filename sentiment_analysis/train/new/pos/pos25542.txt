I bought the Manito Magic Shade to fit my 2006 Quinny Zapp (3-wheel model) and, while the mosquito net was a little big, it was easy enough to get it adjusted and the shade overall worked like a charm. While I have many good things to say about my Zapp, the sun visor is pretty worthless (it won't stay pulled forward). The netting on the Manito shade worked extremely well both for keeping out bugs/sun, but also for keeping the top sun shade that it attaches to extended forward. (Personally, I don't think the Manito sun shade would have worked very well alone without the netting, since the Zapp shade won't stay put). I have also had a number of comments on the street on how cool the stroller looks with the shade (a bit like a space pod!). My Zapp is pretty old and faded, but with the Manito shade it looks new again. My only complaint is that the shade did not arrive with the travel bag that is said to be included. I received a very quick response from customer service saying they would send the bag... two weeks later I'm still waiting for it. (I haven't tried contacting them again, perhaps it's on it's way).
