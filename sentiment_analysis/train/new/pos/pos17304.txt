I purchased this spoons for my 5month old baby. He loves them!! and He loves to bite on them too :P it is true that they can stain (that's why i gave it 4 stars)... when i started feeding carrots to my LO they did stain! and i was a bit disappointed because they are so pricey but then i read an article that said that for CARROT STAINS what works wonders is to clean the spoons very well and then put them under the sun for a few hours! it sounded too easy to work but by that time i had tried everything to remove the orange stains (water and vinegar mixture left overnight, lemon oil, etc) and nothing had worked so i did it, i washed them and put them under direct sun light for a few hrs and waalaa!! the stain disappeared!!! Beta carotene is the pigment (phytochemical) that gives many vegetables and fruits their orange-yellow color. This pigment is not water soluble but photo dissipating. My spoons were brand new again!! anybody that has had that problem they should try it! heres the link of the posting:[...] this spoons rock!! they do stain but thanks to the sun i can maintain them as good as new!! :P*extra tip: don't use this spoons on staining foods when they are still hot, wait for it to cool off a little, use a different spoon to mix.
