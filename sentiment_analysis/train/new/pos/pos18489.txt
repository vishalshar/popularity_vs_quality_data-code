I own an UppaBaby Vista and was worried that I wouldn't be able to find a console or cup holder for it and I had read that the cup holder made by UppaBaby is awful.  The Stroll-Air console is great, it attaches quickly and easily to the handle and is able to hold drinks with no problem.  I will admit that I have only placed water bottles and covered drinks in it, so I don't know how it would do with an open cup of coffee.  To be honest, you shouldn't have an open cup of hot coffee that close to your baby anyway.The best parts of this console are the thermal cup holders that keep cold drinks cold even on a long walk.  I also like that it attaches with a hook and loop closure so I'm not attaching anything permanently to the stroller.  Also, with the UppaBaby you don't need to take it off in order to fold the stroller which is great.  There are two cup holders, one that is open, and one with a drawstring to tighten around the cup.  I use the drawstring side for my taller metal water bottle.  The center has a large pocket with a netted area for your phone.  It also has a little clip for your keys or wallet.  There is a very small outside pocket, too small even for a pen. I don't know what that's for.  The center pocket is covered by a nice little magnetic closure that keeps everything inside dry and secure.I think this is an excellent product, completely worth the money.
