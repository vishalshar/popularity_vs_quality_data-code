I bought this product because it allows me to hold my baby while I position her for her therapy with both of my hands and the little music plays and plays and she watches it while she works her little limbs. I am not a fan of using iPads and Iphones for such a young age. This looked like a toy that would keep her entertained for a certain length of time, enough for me to help her work her muscles and stay in a position, but not turn her into a TV addict by the age of 6 months...The vendor is very responsible and helped me as fast as he could when I had some trouble with the shipment and delivery.
