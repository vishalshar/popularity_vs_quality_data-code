I was so pleased to finally find a hello kitty night light and finally found one! This one has an on/off switch which is really nice vs another night light I got that needs to be taken out of the outlet to turn it off.  I also thought it came quickly in the mail and was in perfect condition.  The seller emailed me to make sure I got it safely and was eager to send me another if I didn't get it in the mail yet and in good condition.  I was pleased to have the seller to send me an email to make sure I got the item and would go thru this seller in the future.  I didn't think it was too expensive since most hello kitty items are more expensive and also most other night lights I looked into were about the same in price if not more.
