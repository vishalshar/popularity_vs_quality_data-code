This is very compatible with our cloth diapers.  I would call it a rash preventer more than a rash treater but it seems to do the job well unless we have a particularly poopy day.  I originally got this when it was a lower price so was really bummed when I saw that they were more expensive now.  Fortunately I found one here that was still at the lower price point so I snatched it up!  The listing is gone now so I'm glad I got it when I did!  They do last a long long time so I'm hoping that will take me through until I'm done with diapers for this little one!  I had not tried the Oatmeal smell before but it smells glorious.
