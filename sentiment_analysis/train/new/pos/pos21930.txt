This is a nice assortment of toys for baby, but some are better than others.  My son absolutely LOVES the circle rattle -- it is one of his favorites.  We take it with us everywhere.  He likes the fish too.  It has both rubbery and fabric textures, is easy for him to hold, and has a rattle.  He loves to chew on it.  He doesn't like the butterfly as much -- the open wing is a little too small and angled for him to grab easily.  The phone is okay, but he doesn't find it as interesting and it is too hard for him to enjoy as a teether.  The clown face mirror thing is nice for interactive play with the mirror side, but he doesn't usually pick it up to play with on his own, and the squeaker is hard to manipulate.
