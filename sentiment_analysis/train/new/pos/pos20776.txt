Typical collapsable hamper. Not much to say!  It matches the rest of the Daniella set by Cocalo which is absoultely beautiful. The wood frame comes unfinished - I guess so you can paint or stain it to match your baby's furniture which is exactly what I did.  The only thing I didn't like is the mesh laundry bag that comes with it to hang inside.  It's a very coarse rough type of netting.  The one I got with the last hamper I got from them with my son's bedding set was much better.  It was more like a softer mesh bag. But other than that, it's a nice finishing touch to complete the Daniella set.
