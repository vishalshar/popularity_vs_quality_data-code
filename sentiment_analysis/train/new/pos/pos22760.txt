I bought this in size lg for my almost 9 month old 25ish lb son. He is a chubby boy and fairly heavy wetter. I pair this with the thirsties duo cover and it fits wonderully underneath. It's somewhat bulky but not terrible. Very soft and comfy. I wear this on him for sleeping, naps, long trips. It works great. Holds in everything and haven't had any leaks yet not even with his massive poops. I could probably wear a size down on him on the largest setting but this size works wonderfully on the smallest. Working on saving money to add more to my stash. Hands down wins over all the other (many many many) brands I've tried. Mother-ease sandys and kissaluvs contours are the BEST diapers I've ever tried. Would definitely recommend. Definitely worth the price.
