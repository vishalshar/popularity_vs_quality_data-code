-Super soft-Elastic goes all the way around (instead of just on corners)-Fits deaper mattresses (We are currently potty-training so I have 2 sets of mattress pads and sheets on, with this sheet on the very top. It fits over everything easily).-Color is a somewhat muted pink, not overpowering.-Washes and dries easily. No fuss. Has few wrinkles.
