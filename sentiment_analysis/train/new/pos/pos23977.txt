Got this for my son when he was about a month old. I was worried he wouldn't be totally interested in it because they say the black/white/red contrast is best suited for newborns. However he is now a little over 6 months old and still loves it! Wether laying down and staring up at it or me holding him and letting him watch and grab and bat at it. As far as quality goes.. It's kinda crappy. The plastics part you slide the cards into are terribly cheap. Kinda had to crack and split all of them to fit the card inside. But it's nothing terribly noticeable unless you're really examining. However I have never changed the cards since. I'd imagine if you plan on swapping them out, they will take a major beating after a few times. The winding aspect of it also really blows. Even if you crank it all the way the music will only play for maybe three or four minutes. Now, my son doesn't sleep in his crib, so this isn't a huge deal for us... But if you want a mobile that will play and lull babe to sleep for however long that may take... Find another option. We just use ours for fun and play.
