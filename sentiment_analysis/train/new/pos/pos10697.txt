I bought these 3 years ago for my son and loved them. Yes, it's multiple pieces, but I didn't/don't care because I enjoy them so much. You do have to make sure they are twisted tightly, but I've never had an issue with leaking. I don't remember the rate of flow at different ages, but I do remember using all 3 stages (slow, med & fast). I now have a 3 month old daughter and am so bummed I can't find these anywhere but here. At 3 months, she is still on the "slow flow" and just now seems to be needing the med flow soon. Which it's a bummer that those nipples aren't included.I tried the wide nipples of the Playtex ventaire, Tommy Tippee & Advent and was dis-satisfied with all. She makes such a mess with all those bottles. We did have a Dr. Brown's bottle and I liked it except how hard it was to travel because they make a mess. Also, we accidentally left the bottle in the car for a day (of Dr Browns) and the blue straw insert thing got super moldy and I couldn't get it cleaned out enough to feel comfortable giving it to her again so I threw it out. :(** Keep in mind, neither of my babies were breast fed after 1 month of age**
