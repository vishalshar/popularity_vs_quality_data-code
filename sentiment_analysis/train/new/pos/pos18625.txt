Thank you for the first review that said this fit their Fisher Price high chair well. It really is a great fit. I am so glad we didn't just decide to buy a new high chair. This product saved us at least $70! The design is cute and the pad feels comfortable. I'll be washing it for the first time tonight. It says to line dry it so that's why I'm waiting until this evening to throw it in the washer. It looks pretty well made and I would highly recommend this product.I followed the instructions on the label and washed it. The spaghetti stains came off easily (I didn't have to treat it at all). I hung it up to dry overnight and it was ready to use by the morning. I am definitely happy with this product.
