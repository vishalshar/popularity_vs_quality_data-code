We live in a bright and sunny country where sunglasses are worn everyday - I thought I'd try these out on my baby to protect his eyes (he's nearly 4 months old) and he quite likes them and hasn't tried to yank them off yet - probably because he thinks he's a cool dude!!  The adjustable headband is great as it means you can either have the band round the baby's head or if he's wearing a sun hat you can extend to accommodate.  I wanted to upload a photo but can't figure out how to...
