All the reviews about how great this pillow is are legitimate.  I basically exclusively pump and only attempt to nurse my twin girls a few times a week, so I can't comment on how well this pillow is for tandem nursing.  However, it is an absolute necessity for bottle feeding the twins at the same time.  My girls also had reflux and needed to sleep at an incline.  We let the girls rest on these pillows while supervised and they are almost always content.  (Note that the pillow comes with a large warning to not let babies sleep on the pillow.)  I also have taken adorable photos using this pillow.I am docking one star b/c I have only had this pillow for two weeks, but the pillow is already very noticeably losing its shape from where the girls' heads rest.  One indentation is bigger than the other, which doesn't make sense, so I think the stuffing is uneven and might not hold up its shape well in the long term.
