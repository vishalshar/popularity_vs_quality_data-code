This product was easy to place on the car seat, very durable, and the zipper in front made taking my son in and out a breeze. The only thing was I still had to put a winter jacket and put blanket on him in the cold.I thought it would be thick enough for me to just place a hat on him and his winter clothes.Its definitely not warm enough for Alaska. I say its good for the cold autumn, not in the middle of freezing winter.I have to go buy another one that is a little thicker for the winter.
