We bought both Dr Brown's and Playtex Ventaire bottles for our baby and he definitely likes the first one because of the softness of the nipples. These are slightly hard which at times he keeps biting on them. Never had any slits on the nipples though they yellowed a bit maybe with boiling.We use both kinds of bottle because of the structure of the bottles themselves. It is easier to get the milk out of the Playtex one not need to bend backwards a lot. He is kind of late in switch from bottle to sippy cup which is why I wish there was a faster flow nipple than this one available.
