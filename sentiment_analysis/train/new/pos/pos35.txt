I didnt exactly know what i was getting when i purchase this product but i am glad i did these are not stickers you just follow the directions and they go on great, I read all the directions and I didnt have any problems, you will get compliments i sure did it is flush with the wall like you painted in on and you can put it on almost anything we put in on the walls and on her tv stand and dresser just to tie everthing together GOOD BUY!!! I would purchase again
