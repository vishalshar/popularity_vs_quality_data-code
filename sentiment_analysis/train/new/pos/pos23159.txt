I've been buying the Sozo Swaddling blankets because they are big enough to work on my babies (I have very long babies) and light enough that they work during the summer months. But at close to $25 a pop I couldn't afford many of them. I stumbled across this blanket and it's perfect. Bigger than most swaddling blankets so you can wrap up a kid who isn't newborn sized anymore and light enough that the poor thing won't sweat to death during summer sleep times.I washed my blanket and while it did shrink a little bit it still works great and looks good. I'm buying three more now.I will warn you though, don't try to rip the tag off, it will tear the blanket. Cut the tag off.
