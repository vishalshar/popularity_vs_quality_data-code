fits on my bob- need i say more?!  you must unscrew the fabric strap on the rear axil (the one that has the clip so you can lock the stroller folded- sorry!) so that the board clips can connect but no biggie.  board fits VERY tight, no wobbles whatsoever.  i like this board much better than the Lascal one i sent back as it clips on in once second (like the bugaboo board) and the lascal was a pain- must be attached on sides of stroller and just very very big (wide).  The mutsy one is small and has no plastic parts.  Also has suspension to make for a smooth ride.  Small con (if any) is that you cannot clip it up to the back of stroller when not in use- but it is so darn easy to unclip and store in my bob's basket.  Love it!  Best kept secret accessory for the bob revolution :)
