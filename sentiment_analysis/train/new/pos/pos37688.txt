This stroller is wonderful! I have 22 month old twins and a 3 month old. My twins like this stroller. Even though the second seat is a bit tight, my son doesn't seem to mind. It pushes very nicely over bumps. In fact, my Twin side by side stroller is harder to push than this one. Once you figure out this stroller it's very easy to open and close. It's very heavy to lift by oneself but that's to be expected. It fits very nicely in the back of my Honda mini-van even with the bench seat up. My Graco car seat carrier fits nicely in the rear of this stroller. The only problem I had was one of the canopies had two right inserts so I couldn't attach it. I called the company and they are sending me a left insert no questions asked and free of charge. This stroller is so worth the money! You have to be patient at first but when you get it, it's great! My husband had no problem putting it together and it arrived quickly and in good condition. I suggest you buy it new and not used. I saw on a website that people were paying almost as much used as it goes for brand new! Besides, if you don't like it, you can return it to your local BabiesRUs. Storage is limited with the kids feet hanging in the basket but the cup holder for mom or dad is really nice. If it wasn't for this stroller I would have had to pay out a lot of money for a more expensive one with a matching carset OR I'd be stuck inside the house all day! Highly recommended!
