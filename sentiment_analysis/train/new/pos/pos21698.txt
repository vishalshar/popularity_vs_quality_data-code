This is fantastic; I am no longer a slave to mixing formula bottles. I would definitely recommend getting two of these. I just stick the dirty one in the dishwasher and then I have another to use while that is getting washed.I couldn't find a clear recommendation for making a large amount of formula at once (I saw a wide variety of suggestions), but I've been using 28 ounces of water with one cup of formula. That's what we came up with when we measured out a bunch of little scoops of formula into a measuring cup (that is, there were 14 scoops of formula in one cup). We use Enfamil Infant. My baby seems to be doing just fine with this proportion of water to formula, but I would still recommend measuring it out for yourself (who knows, maybe our measuring cup is weird).As for quality, I've had these for three months and the parts are getting slightly warped, but the pitchers are still definitely usable. I might replace them in a few months. But for the cost of these compared with how often we use them and how convenient they are, I think this product is a great deal.The pitcher also definitely eliminated bubbles and clumps in the mixed formula.The only issue with premixing formula like this is that you have to refrigerate it, but we just have a bowl of water sitting out that we stick in the microwave (then we put the bottle with the cold formula in the bowl to warm up), so heating up the bottles isn't a big deal.
