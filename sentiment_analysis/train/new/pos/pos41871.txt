My son had medical problems at birth, which resulted in me having to pump rather than breastfeed directly. As I pumped and pumped, I said to my husband, "It'd be great if there was one of the fridge can organizer thingies for breast milk." Low and behold, there was! This was great. It kept everything organized, took up less space, and made sure the "oldest" milk was being used before the newer stuff, I love that I could measure out his feedings precisely and that it was already prepared when it was time for his feedings. It was a real life saver and allowed me to be 10 feedings ahead for my son, making sure we had enough milk for all his feedings in a day and then some. The bottles hold about 4oz and never leaked. You can write on the bottle directly with a dry erase marker for the date and time, and it'll wash right off. Would definitely buy again.
