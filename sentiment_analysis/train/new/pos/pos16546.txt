We bought these monitors after a lot of reading reviews, and we've been so happy.  Our son is 3 years old and these baby monitors work very well.  The sound quality is very good.  We can hear the smallest sniffle or rustle of sheets when the volume is up.  They've been on pretty much constantly for 3 solid years and we've never had to replace a battery.  We do keep them plugged in almost all the time so I can't really vouch for the battery life of them when unplugged for long periods, but they certainly do warn you when the battery gets low by buzzing.  They beep when they are out of range.  Sometimes they are a bit flaky when we travel.  If both units have been unplugged for some time, even turned off while we're in the car, when plugged back in they get a bit weird.  They don't work immediately on being plugged back in so plan accordingly when you arrived at your destination.  Plug them in first and wait a while.  It'll beep at first but then start working.  I wish more electronics worked this well and this long.  I would definitely buy them again, but at the rate we're going they're going to last forever and we won't have to replace.
