Awesome snack bag for kids and adults. I would say the "large" size is great for holding bigger items like a sandwich or snack bar. The smaller half size would be good for loose items such as pretzels, nuts, etc.It can easily fit a juice pouch and fruit cup with room to spare, and I'm also including a photo next to a lunchables for a size comparison.
