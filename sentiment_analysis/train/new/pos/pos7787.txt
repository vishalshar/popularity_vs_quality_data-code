These are the best bottles ever!!! I purchased every bottle out there with my first daughter and the MAM bottles were the only bottles she would take.  When I had my second daughter at 29 weeks, I decided to stick with what the NICU started her with. Well, she was having a hard time during feedings and therapist came to show me how to hold her bottle and chin to help guide her jaw.  I had been told she would not be able to come home until her feedings improved.  I told them I was planning to use the same brand bottles I was using for my first child when she came home.  They told me to bring the MAM bottles in to make sure she was comfortable before she was release from the hospital.  When they first saw the bottles, they responded “I have never seen these before, but if this is what you want, we can definitely try to use them”.  Well, the next day when I arrived at the hospital the head nurse told me “She loves these bottles! She drank her whole bottle with no problems or episodes!”  Another nurse told me “I have never seen these bottle but these are really good bottles. I love them.”  Thanks to the MAM bottles (5 piece) my little girl was episode free during feedings and wasn’t held in the hospital longer than expected.  Now that she is older, I have switched to these because they have less parts and I still LOVE THEM just as much!!!!
