I bought this crib toy for my son when he was about 2 months old, now he's 7 months. I noticed he liked the cause and effect aspect of kicking a mobile arm as I held it, while watching the toys on the mobile jiggle and shake. I then searched for a toy that would relieve and  encourage his kicking urges. He took to this toy right away. He used to have severe gas and kicking this piano along with belly massages and leg pumps really helped ease his pain. It makes sense that moving your legs can help you pass gas along. Now that my son is starting to crawl, it is great to place on the floor in front of him as a tummy time/kneeling toy. It may help encourage your baby if they take to it. The only draw back is that the bottom tie used to attach to the crib has fallen off, but the piano has 2 other other ties and it holds on the crib sufficiently. In my opinion, a great buy!
