The first gate we tried was a plastic one that had a spring loaded sort of mechanism that seemed tight as first, but would instantly fall over if thumped at just the right impact point. After that failure I set about to research better products, especially those which included a walk through feature. Some can be very expensive I soon learned, then I came across this product, which combines smart design, easy installation, and value for money, affordability folks. The latch is clever because a child's fingers are not long enough to wrap around the top of the catch and squeeze, not only that the child isn't tall enough to look down on the unit to see out the catch works and once they are, you won't need to protect them with it any more. You really can open this with one hand while carrying your child and it will swing away from you gently so you may pass through and quickly latch again. It is nice that the wood is super sanded and smooth, you could paint or stain to match any woods in your home, or leave them plain as we did.We purchased four of these gates and are well satisfied with the experience.
