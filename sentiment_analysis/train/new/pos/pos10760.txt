We were iffy on buying this but are at our wit's end with our media console. As previous reviewers described you CAN still push the buttons through the plastic. We simply set it up so that the plastic overhung our console (XBOX) by ¼ to ½ inch. The buttons can no longer be pushed without removing it and our son has quickly lost interest in trying to get to the "bright lights" on the other side of it.
