I ordered these as a baby shower gift for a friend because I had received them as a shower gift for my last pregnancy.The stickers are wonderful!  I love the prints.  The colors on each sticker are vivid and each month is a different pattern.  The stickers are individual stickers, each attached to a waxy paper (like any other regular sticker).  The stickers adhere well to clothing, but can also be reused if need be by simply reattaching the peeled off wax paper to the sticker.Each month, on my daughter's milestone day, I dress her in a white onesie and apply the applicable month's sticker onto the chest portion of her onesie, then take her photograph.  Every 3 months, I combine the previous 3 months of photos onto a 3-photo collage and order prints of the photo.  Adorable!
