Fun, practical and very stylish.  Very important details to purchasing baby stuff.  I enjoyed picking from an array of colors that BabyBjorn has put out there.  As far as functionality, I find it more usable for both mom and dad than the hot slings, which if the couple is about or over 1 ft difference in height and slight variances in body frame, you'd need 2 slings!  This carrier would then be not only very practical but economically, a very smart buy.  We've also used it's previous versions, w/ our now older children of 9 and 7 years, and have only 5 of 5 star ratings for this product.Enjoy it!
