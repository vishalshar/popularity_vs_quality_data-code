I loved this gate so much that I stained it to match our front decks and installed it to keep our free-range sheep and Livestock Guardian Dogs out. It worked like a dream, much better than the “Human’s Only / No Animal Access” sign that they habitually ignored. With this gate in place we could finally hang laundry out to dry on the front decks and have our morning coffee in peace. It was so enjoyable that we built a breakfast bar on the lower deck as well as a matching an outdoor dining table on the middle deck (took several weeks to complete these projects), then invested in complementary patio chairs. The sheep and dogs respected our new outdoor living room for four marvelous months since they clearly understood “Gate = Stay Out.” I then ordered lovely outdoor furniture fabric at great expense and have been sewing custom table clothes and matching shade sails as finishing touches, “House Beautiful” style.Unfortunately we found the gate smashed to piece this morning with young Loki looking very proud of himself. We don’t know why he chose this particular day to kill our beloved accordion gate. One thing is for sure: those of you who have large working dogs are advised to go the distance by building a custom gate with 2x4s and steel cattle panel inserts (this is what we’re spending the rest of the day doing). Even after leaving it alone for months, in the end it takes only a moment of boredom for a big dog to destroy a very pretty gate designed for controlling toddlers, young children, and house pets.
