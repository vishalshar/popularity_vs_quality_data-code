I have 2 units. The first is almost 3 years old for my first child. We started using it when she was an infant. We travel with it and use it for naps. She can fall asleep anywhere as long as her sound is on. And she stays asleep!!! As soon as you turn it off, she rolls over and wakes up. I bought a second one for baby number 2! And we have a third at the sitters house. Have never had any problems with it. We don't use the projector much. However we have used it when we have been out of town as a night light. We tilted the projector towards a wall a d placed it close to the wall. It would light up a very small area, just like a night light at home. So we could check on the baby in an unfamiliar room but it wasn't bright enough to keep me awake.
