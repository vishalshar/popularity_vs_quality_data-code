We purchased this for our granddaughter's confirmation. When she was presented with it she accepted it with a big smile. It's very soft and a good size. She will probably not be able to push the right spot for the prayer but in time she will learn where it is exactly. The voice for the prayer is a child's voice, clear and loud enough to hear well.I have attached a photo right after she received the bear.
