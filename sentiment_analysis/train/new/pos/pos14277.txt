This set it is so cute. I haven't used the comforter yet, my daughter is still to young for that thick of a blanket. I did end up getting a softer sheet for the crib. I do wish the hamper would have been included. The diaper holder can hold two rows of size 1 or 2 pampers . I have fit two rows of size 3 diapers and it looks it might pop.
