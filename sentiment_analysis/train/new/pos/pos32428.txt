Hi, as there are many confusing reviews, I want to help clarify the difference between this booster and the Cooshie, as I own both. Compared to the Cooshie, the Lionheart booster:- Ships in an inoffensive but not-exactly-attractive lime green. Fortunately the photo has been updated from the blue.- Is made of a more rigid, but still pliable, foam rubber. It is not likely to tear the way the Cooshies do.- Is not a flat surface on the bottom like the Cooshie. It rests on molded, structural spines and has four small rubber feet to aid grip lost to the reduced surface area. Grip seems comparable.- Elevates the sitter to a similar height.- Has some kind of matte coating over the main, shinier material. The coating has started to peel a bit where it has been scratched, though the underlying color is identical so it isn't very noticeable. (If you happen to own a Volkswagen you'll know exactly what I mean.)- Includes a carry bag.- Is manufactured in Canada.Based on my priorities, as well as the not inconsiderable fact that it's cheaper, I prefer it to the Cooshie and plan to replace our torn Cooshie with another one of these. You can make your own decision but I hope I have helped.
