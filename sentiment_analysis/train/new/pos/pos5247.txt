I like it, I feel like it IS a necessity if you are spraying poo off of cloth, BUT I have to flip it backwards because it doesn't fit properly in the toilet! If I leave it the way it was intended it leans back and the water I spray gets all over the back of the toilet making a huge mess!! BUT if I flip it backwards it does just fine, fits perfect, just can't use the clip, which is no biggy!I do recommend though!I keep it left open in a wash bucket I found in the kitchen aisle at Walmart! When I spray my diapers I do it individually, like diaper shell, inserts, fleece liner, so when I am done spraying one item I can just throw it in that bucket soaking wet and move the the next thing that needs to be sprayed, then when I'm done I can ring it all out into the toilet, then done!
