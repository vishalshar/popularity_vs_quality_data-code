Pros:* Able to block off odd spaces* Can accommodate very large or smaller spaces* Easy to set upCons:* A little difficult to close/lock* Mesh covering cannot be removedThis gate is probably one of the most useful safety items we've gotten for our little one. We don't have a very large house but I wanted to give him as much play room as I could in the family area. Unfortunately it's kind of an odd space to separate the dining and living room, so for a while we just used large Rubbermaid containers, but that was extremely annoying; having to move things back and forth every day. Because this gate can expand very wide and panels can be used to fit any type of space it was perfect for us.I also like the mesh feature. Normal gates with the bars kind of look like I've got my baby in prison, not to mention just big metal things for him to bang his head against, and more slots for him to get limbs stuck. However, the mesh is not removable, so if he makes a mess on it the only way to clean is wiping it by hand. I would have liked to be able to launder this once in a while. He's constantly "french kissing" it so it just would have been nice to be able to wash it properly.Lastly, while getting the gate open isn't too difficult, putting it back properly to get it locked in place is kind of annoying. You have to make sure you align it just right and jiggle it around a bit so it locks.
