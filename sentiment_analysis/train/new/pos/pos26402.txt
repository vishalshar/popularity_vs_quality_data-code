I have a Bob Revolution CE and couldn't find ANY information on a weather cover that would fit. So I write this review to let others know that this cover for great over my CE. Granted it is not an exact fit, but it worked perfectly. We bought this to take to Disney and we used it multiple times. Great buy since it's impossible to find the Bob brand. Who wants to spend that much on a weather shield anyway?
