This thing is the best! I use all three devices--it is much more useful than a simple straw-type cleaner. I feel confident putting things like milk and yogurt drinks in sippys now that I know I can get them perfectly clean after use. And it even cleans my Camelbak really well!The little stick part cleans the holes in the sippy spouts, including the holes in the no-spill Nuby sippys.The straw cleaner is sturdy and cleans the straws for my daughter's Playtex sippys as well as for my own Camelbak bottle.The oval-shaped piece is my favorite part. It fits nicely inside the spout/bite valve of a Camelbak and in all the crevices of the sippy lids.**I wanted to add that after using this for maybe a month, the straw cleaner detached from the orange handle. It is only embedded in the handle a short distance. I would change my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars because of how quickly this happened after purchase.**
