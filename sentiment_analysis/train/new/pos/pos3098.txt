Good pocket diaper. Currently I use three types of pocket diapers - bumgenius 4.0 (microfiber inserts), fuzzibunz pockets (microfiber inserts), and these.Pros:Very trim, sleek fit. Adjustable. Even when I double the inserts, it is still pretty trim.The hemp inserts are extremely absorbent and become more absorbent over time (as opposed tomicrofiber, which lose absorbency over time).They throw in a reusable fleece liner - which is a nice touch.Lovely vibrant colors.  Soft exterior. My favorite diapers to look at.Will eventually become a training pant (my favorite things about pockets).Cons:After several washings, the interior lining is a bit rough. I imagine it won't be too comfortable for baby - but the included liner mitigates the situation. Need to call Babykicks to see if this is a laundry issue - which it should not be, since I use liquid detergent).Rise seems a little on the low size for my baby - who started using these diapers at 18 months.  They seem a little tight on his chunky thighs. I am not sure how much use I will get out of them for this baby ... but it will get used for the next one.If you use diaper cream, liner needs to be washed separately. Bit of a pain to manage. But you kind of have to use cloth liners if the interior gets a little rough.
