I love these spoons.  The curve is subtle so kids are able to easily use them the first try.  They are molded in one piece so they are smooth throughout.  The shorter, wider handle makes it so very easy for children to grasp and hold.  I am a pediatric occupational therapist and I absolutely love this product.
