Some details about this design-It unzips at the bottom which is fantastic- you don't have to touch any stinky diapers! Remember to zip it back after washing it (no dryer!) and you'll be fine!In our small apartment I loved hanging this bag from a hook on our changing table. With those breastfed poos you couldn't smell a thing, even though the top is still mostly open! However that open top design wasn't the best when my son started eating solids and became a heavy wetter. There is a little tab inside to dab some essential oils but I wasn't sure how much I would need to combat the smell! Plus lavender poop wasn't appealing. Because we were in a house at this point I solved this slight problem by buying a trash can with a lid. The bag still fit inside and no smells! I can now grab the handles, pull it out, carry it to my machine and unzip the load into the washer. Just as easy as before and a fresh smelling nursery! I have two of these for an easy rotation and have used them in my cloth diapering routine for a year.
