Absolutely LOVE this. When my son was born 5 years ago this was something that we never heard of and never used, and had a hard time alays getting him to sleep. We would swaddle over and over and over and he would always get out of it and there was little to no sleep some nights.Our daughter was born this last year and WOW, I bought this on a whim and based on a lot of the reviews that were good. I was happy to have been a proud owner of 4 of these the last few months and don't think my daughter would sleep any better without this. She does find her way out of it sometimes, but she doesn't seem to mind. I have tried the cotton flannel and microfiber and love the flexability of the microfiber material and it is SOFT!! I literally used every one of these up to the point of no more velcro was left to swaddle anymore!If you are thinking of buying...DO IT! This is a life saver!
