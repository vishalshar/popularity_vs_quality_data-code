I purchased these to avoid chemicals in plastic bottles.  I've had them for well over a year, using on a daily basis.  I have experienced some fading of the markings, and I attribute that to minimal dishwasher use - prob worse if put in dishwasher often.  As the child gets older, those markings are less important.Washing: not terrible, especially compared to all the components in Dr. Brown's bottles!  I have noticed from time to time that the hard plastic vent piece will get some growth in the holes.  I make a point to use the bottle brush and get in those holes or wash or soak the pieces quickly (not leave sitting overnight).Nipples: I had Avent and used those nipples, which do fit.  But, the Born Free nipples work better!  It leaked often with the Avent and now with the proper nipples, it almost never leaks.Overall quite satisfied with these bottles.
