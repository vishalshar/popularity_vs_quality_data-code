I have this set in my little one's nursery. I noticed a couple of loose threads with initial packaging, but they came off with ease and weren't a problem again. The fabric is cotton, so it is nice to the touch for little hands, but does look a little wrinkly if you don't get it out of the dryer right away! For the folks who complained about bleeding - it is well-dyed, bright red with black and white fabric. This WILL bleed in your washer. HOWEVER, I used the color catcher sheets by Shout (about 4 for this load to be safe), and it caught all the red and the whites still look pristine. Any time you wash brights the first time, just use some of these sheets and you can relax.One thing that does bother me about the product listing on Amazon is the picture. The top pic on the listing shows the entire collection - this set only includes the sheet/bumpers/crib skirt/comforter/pillow for bedding, and the diaper bag/toy bag/valence for accessories. If you are looking for the hamper/changing cover, drapes, etc, you will have to buy those separately!
