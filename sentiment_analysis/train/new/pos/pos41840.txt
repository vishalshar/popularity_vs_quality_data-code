I bought this in 2014 and it lasted me a year plus of daily use.  I wanted something more stylish than the boring diaper bag, but I did not want to spend a ton of money on something I put dirty diapers and milk and water cups in.  This was perfect.  It is built really well and fit a change of clothes for 2, diapers and/or underwear for 2, wipes, cream, water cups, and my stuff.  It only feel apart after I threw it in the wash machine.  Oops!  But if anyone wants a stylish, durable, less expensive bag, this one is great!
