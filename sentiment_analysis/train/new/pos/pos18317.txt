I used the Nuk brand feeders with my first son, because there were not any Made in the USA alternatives at the time. I was very excited to find these Baby Safe Feeders on Amazon when I was pregnant this time around. These are SO much easier to deal with than the Nuk brand feeders. Those are a pain to screw on and off (you have to squeeze them and fit them on just right), the Baby Safe feeders screw right on and off...SO MUCH BETTER. Seriously. I like that they come with 2 extra mesh bags, it's nice to have replacements on hand. The other difference between Nuk and these feeders are the handles. The Baby Safe Feeder has a ring like handle, whereas the Nuk has a regular solid handle. My son just turned 6 months and we used these for the first time and he loved it! Anytime I can find USA alternatives to made in China baby products, it's a win in my book.
