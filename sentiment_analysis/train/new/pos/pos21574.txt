This is a review from a father who purchased many monitors and was completely frustrated until we found this one. The first 3 monitors we purchased all had a low static sound which you could not turn off. Basically, the other monitors were picking up every little sound in the room but you constantly heard the white noise also. We spent $250 on the initial monitor and yes, the frequency was good, but how are you supposed to sleep through constant static - I don't find that soothing. Other 2 monitors were the same. Then we purchased this Levana as my wife said it was recommended by one of her friends. I couldnt believe it - a monitor that didnt make a sound or alert us unless the baby was making a sound, aka crying. It actually turned off until the baby made a sound - YES! Also, the picture was clear in the day and night. In my mind - perfect monitor. Sorry for not using technical terms - but hopefully I got my point across. Im not a huge fan of the overall look of the monitor as it looks like an 80's zack morris (Saved by the bell) phone but who cares - it works really well!  We are now on our 2nd baby and its still working! A well rested father (and mother) make for an even HAPPIER family :)
