After buying products online for years, this is the first review I have ever written because this is the first product that has deserved it. My 4 month old son has torticollis from reflux and tummytime has been an absolute nightmare. No matter what we used-pillows, boppys, mirrors, -nothing worked. Within seconds of being placed on his tummy, he would scream and refuse to move his head, even when he was at PT. It was awful. We were so discouraged and figured nothing would ever work, until I found this and ordered it out of desperation. The very first time we placed him on it (right after a nap, which we figured out is the best time), he picked his head up and looked around for a few minutes with no crying-including turning to his bad side! We can see his confidence and neck muscles building every time he uses it. We love this so much we donated one to his daycare so all the kids can use it. If your child hates tummy time, I highly recommend trying this out. The change for us was huge.
