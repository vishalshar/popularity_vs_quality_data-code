Perfect size for my son he will be 2 in october. Enough room to fit a pack of wipes. 6 diapers and a change of clothes and i love the pouches one to put a sippy cup or juice box w/e you want and then another one that i put a binky in. I couldnt be happier. My son loves to wear it and it makes him feel important. I like it better then carrying around a huge diaper bag
