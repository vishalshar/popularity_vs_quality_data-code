Solved my problem of getting pulled through the holes on other shields. Ouch!I have flat/inverted and my kid has a posterior tongue-tie and strong suck. Feeding was a huge challenge. The lactation consultant(s) we visited recommended a shield. I tried medela first, but kept getting skin sucked through the holes at the tip blocking milk rubbing my skin raw. This model has smaller holes, and solved that problem.Thinner than medela and much thinner than Philips avent. A little thicker than dr. brown and nurtria. I tried a lot, and this one was my favorite.
