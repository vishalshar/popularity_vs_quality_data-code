We purchased this mobile along with another Flensted mobile for our twins' bedroom.  Other reviewers of these mobiles made comments about them being just paper and not worth the money.  Yes they are very thin, but the sheep are made out of a coated paper or some type of thin plastic, and no one should be touching them anyway so they should hold up just fine.  Being so thin allows them to move beautifully in the air--they also are really well balanced.  They are so much nicer than the clunky, standard crib-mounted mobiles we had at first; those not only scratched up our crib, but they didn't spin well, had to be turned on to move, and once our children could reach them were worthless.  The design of the mobile is nice, each sheep is hanging from their own string, balanced across the bar from another.  When the fan is on and the sheep are moving it's neat to watch and imagine them out in a meadow someplace doing sheepy things.  Being ceiling mounted they can be hung and enjoyed indefinately.  Regarding the price, we had a gift card that we used, otherwise we never would have spent this much on mobiles, but after hanging them I can say that they are worth it and I enjoy watching them as I sit in their room.
