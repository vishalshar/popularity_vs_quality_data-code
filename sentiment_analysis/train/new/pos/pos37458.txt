I don't know why I need this, but my wife claimed she couldn't survive one more baby bath without a purpose-built knee pad.  I've always done fine with towels or yoga mats or whatever is handy.  But, there's no arguing that this is a nice and easy solution to that problem.  It's nicely padded, keeps its shape and position, and it's just big enough to work while still small enough to push out of the way when it's not needed.  We just leave it by the bath all the time, and that's fine, too.
