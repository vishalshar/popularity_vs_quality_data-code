This mat protector provides protection for our leather seats, gives a little bit of storage space, and-- my primary concern, and more important than protection of leather-- allows for a very, very tight carseat install above it. I use one with my rear-facing Diono Radian (and another, full-length one with my forward-facing R100) and it was simple to install the carseats on it. They do not slip back and forth on it, and it is snug against the leather.It does not provide absolute protection-- a snugly installed carseat with a kid riding in it over a period of time will create an indentation in your seats even with this mat. If you want greater protection and are installing a rear-facing carseat, Diono makes a foam angle adjuster that I've used, which-- because of it's greater thickness-- does provide more seat protection, although that's not it's stated purpose.We have actually never used the organizer feature-- a rear-facing child wouldn't be able to reach it while riding, and it's maybe the right size for a pair of sunglasses, packet of tissues, rattle or pacifiers (so they can be flung onto the floor of the car at the most inopportune moment) or crayon box-- which, if you're worried about your interiors, you probably don't allow your child to have on the road anyway. (For a forward-facing harnessed child properly restrained, it would also be very challenging to reach down and retrieve any items from the organizer.)
