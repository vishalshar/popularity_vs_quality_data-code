I did a lot of research on crib mattresses because (along with the car seat) I feel it is THE most important decision you will make in baby items. This crib mattress is one of the top five recommended crib mattresses on many lists, and I love that it is organic. I was concerned about whether or not the mattress would fit after all the reviews stating it was too small - but I am so pleased because it does fit perfectly! We have the Graco Byson 4-in-1 convertible crib, and it's as if this mattress was made for it. Perhaps Naturepedic has listened to customers and corrected the sizing? Either way, it's perfect for us and although baby hasn't arrived yet, I so far feel very happy with our choice.
