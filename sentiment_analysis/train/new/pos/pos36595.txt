We just had baby #4 in August and I was given a gift card for Amazon. I've always wanted a Taggie blanket for one of my kids, but when I saw this, I fell in love! Its much bigger than what I expected. I thought it would be a little toy for baby to shake in their hands. This guy is probably 8" high, give or take. When you shake him, he has a bell so he makes a jingle noise. You can pull the bone and it gives a little vibrating shake. His ears crinkle, and he's super soft. This is my baby's first real toy, and she loves it. She's not big enough to hold it yet but we hold it for her and she smiles and follows it with her eyes. She loves the jingle noise too. I can't wait to get her another Taggie toy for Christmas.
