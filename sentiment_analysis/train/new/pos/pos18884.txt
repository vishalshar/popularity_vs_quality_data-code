Oh my gosh, I love this thing. I got so many compliments from everyone on this. And I got to bring an entire extra piece of luggage instead of having to be worried about having enough hands. It's easy to attach to any piece of luggage. It's easy to fold for storage on the plane and the X-ray machine. Just make sure you know how to use the safety beforehand so you aren't struggling with it and your child and everyone looking at you while you hold them up. Mine came in green, which is a fine color. My kid liked the chair, I liked it, it was an all around win.
