We like everything about this car seat.  Our 10 month old also likes it :)  The only thing that I would have liked to of gotten when we order it would have been instructions for assembly and installation.  It was basically assembled, but we didn't understand all of the loosening and tightening straps and where they went until we messed with it for at least 45 min.  Other then that it seems safe (which is the first priority), and comfy (second priority).
