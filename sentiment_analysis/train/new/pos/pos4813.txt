We have owned many strollers through the years. We bought this for our Disney trip and it was perfect for us. We used it for our 4 month and 2 1/2 year old. It steers great, folds compactly just like an umbrella stroller! The shade must have been upgraded because it's perfect and covered the front seat. Even the cup holder stayed on!! Some complain of the small basket but I thought it was just right but less is more in Disney when you have to fold your stroller every bus ride! I gave it 4 stars just because my only complaint is, it says it's for 3 months + but the straps went too height above my 4 month olds shoulders which made her slide side to side and made her irritated because the straps were at her ear/cheek level but other than that I have no complains! It's a great stroller!!
