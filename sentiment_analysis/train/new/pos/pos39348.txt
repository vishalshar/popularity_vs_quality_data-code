I received the green temperature turtle by this same company as a shower gift--three years ago.  It has worked for my daughter's daily bath without fail--again--for three years!  I like the digital readout.  Red light flashes if the water is too hot or too cold--very simple.  I am actually going to purchase another one, since you can't change the battery.  I hope it will last as long.  I know--why do I need this for a three year old?  My child must have very temperature-specific skin, because she prefers EXACTLY 95 degree water--and I think my elbow is defective--I never get the temp right.  One reason ours may have lasted so long is that I leave it in the tub only long enough to get the right temp and then I remove it--not used as a tub toy.  My only question--why can't I buy this in green again?Update: two months later and this second turtle (pink) works like a charm every night.  I love this inexpensive thermometer!
