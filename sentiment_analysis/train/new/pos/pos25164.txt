Why I purchased this product - I had been searching for a changing table to match my PBK Kendall crib in Tuscan at an affordable price and found it! The mocha color and lines compliments and matches the simple/clean design of the crib nicely. It is well made and easy to assemble. It took me a couple of hours taking breaks in between to watch my 2 month old! It is also great for small spaces. The open compartments provides additional storage space and easy access for wipes and/or baby creams.I would recommend this product to parents looking for a changing table to match their PBK Kendall crib in tuscan at a reasonable price. I am very happy with my purchase and overall product quality for the price!The only CON I foundâ€¦ As I previously mentioned the open compartment is great to keep wipes; however, if you use a wiper warmer it would be nice for the rear panel to have an opening to hide the cord.
