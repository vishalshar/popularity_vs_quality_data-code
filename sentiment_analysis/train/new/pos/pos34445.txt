I bought the gender neutral bears when I was pregnant and LOVE them!! So, I didn't hesitate to buy these pink bunnies for my sister in law when she was expecting her baby girl! They are sooo cute for starters! WAY better than anything you'll find in the store. AND they are functional :) What more can you ask for? They prevent the straps of car seats/strollers (I bought 2 pair - Car Seat & Stroller) from digging in to your baby's shoulders and neck but they ALSO work as a sort of head support or neck pillow, which I wasn't really expecting. A bonus feature in my book!! My son is 19 months old, we still use them and he still loves them! Going to have to buy more for this next baby due in April!
