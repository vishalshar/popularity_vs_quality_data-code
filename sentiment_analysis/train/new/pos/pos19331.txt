My son loves these sippy cups. They have a soft spout which is easy for him to drink from. He's been drinking from sippy cups since he was 11 months but each one we'd buy would always leak when he drank from it, turned it over or if any parts of the lid didn't line up perfectly. The one piece lid is so easy to use and seems to prevent the leaking and also makes for easy cleaning. The design of the cup also makes it easy to hold. We also like that the first years lids are interchangeable with other first years cups of different styles. Again we have tried several cups and I couldn't recommend this one more highly!!
