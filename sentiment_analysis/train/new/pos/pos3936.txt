The chair was sent shipped in plastic in the box but there were fingerprints all over it.  I was able to wipe them off with soap and water but was dissappointed it was dirty, especially since it was wrapped in plastic.  I was very satisfied with the color, it is true to that in the picture.  It also is big enough to last my grandson for a while for he is only 8 months old but I am sure he will be using it often watching the races with his dad!!  Very happy with it!!
