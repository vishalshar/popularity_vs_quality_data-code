Bought these for a friend's baby shower. They are cute, well made, and look good once they are finished. They come with:1. A bag of boxes (flat) -- you need to fold them and pop them together2. Cut ribbon -- you need to tie them around the boxes (they are the perfect length for this)3. Little "For You" tags -- I looped these around the ribbon once they were tied.They take a bit of putting together, but they look good when they're done (i.e. they are not cheap looking like a lot of the stuff you get from Oriental Trading Company, etc.)
