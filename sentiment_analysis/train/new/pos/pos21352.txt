This is a great gift for parents that are worried about their children getting germs from the shopping carts (like me). It's cute and adds a little extra padding for our little love ones. You can also use this product laying it flat on the ground for tummy time but I don't think it's wide enough for tummy play. It's not wide enough for a child to roll around.The downside about this product is that it only covers the front and back but not the sides of the shopping cart seat. The velcro straps that needs to be strapped around the back an front are too difficult to manage while holding your child. It does not fit every shopping cart as well.Overall the Shop & Play is a cute product that does ok when you finally manage to get the straps secured.
