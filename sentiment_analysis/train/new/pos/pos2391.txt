This is my very first review - and I am only doing it because I AM COMPLETELY AMAZED. I exclusively breastfed all three of my children. The first I HAD to bottle train because I had to go back to work (the worst experience of my life). My second never took a bottle because it was to hard to make her take it.With my third (who is only now 4 months old) I tried to give her a bottle at least once a day. This worked until about 6 weeks when she just randomly stopped taking the bottle.After much research I decided to try this bottle. It just WORKED. no fuss - goes back and forth between this nipple and breast no problem.I would recommend this to anyone.
