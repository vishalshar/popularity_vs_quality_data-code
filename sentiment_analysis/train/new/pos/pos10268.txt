PROS:• durable, high-quality & safe materials• stackable• high sides make it easy for toddler to scoop up food• fun colorsCONS:• not microwaveableThey stack beautifully, which cuts down on the space the kid plates take up in our cupboard. The sides are nice and high, so my toddler has an easy time eating foods that can be a bit challenging to get onto a spoon (like peas, rice, etc.). The compartments work for most of our meals, in fact, my toddler insist that we put something in each area :) The colors are fun as well and these plates go through the dishwasher almost daily and have held up perfectly.I wish they could go in the microwave, but it's not a huge deal to us, so we still love these.
