I have used these bottles for both my children. I just bought 2 of these sets for my daughter who starts day care next week. She is currently 10 weeks old.They added an extra ring under the nipples which prevents leaks. A nice feature that is new since I used these for my son. I also prefer the disposable liner aspect, now I sterilize nipples and don't have to scrub bottles constantly.Excellent product, the best for breast fed babies!
