We love this car seat. This was the first car seat we bought that we weren't able to inspect in person, but we're so glad we got it. We were looking for a car seat that allowed for rear-facing until 40 lbs, and were choosing between this seat and the Radian. It was a toss-up, but we have other convertible car seats from Safety First and were happy with them, so we chose this one.We have not had any of the problems that previous reviewers mentioned. The buckles and clasps work fine and are not hard to undo. We used pool noodles under the bottom of this seat in order to get it to tilt at the right angle for our 9 month old, but this is standard procedure for many convertible car seats. We have put it rear-facing behind the passenger seat in our Toyota Matrix, and though we have to move the passenger seat up a little farther than we'd like, it's worth it to keep our baby safe.I really like the peace of mind I get that we are providing our daughter with the safest possible equipment in the car. As our pediatrician notes, "It's not a throne, it's a safety device."We also appreciated that Amazon had free shipping on an item this large. Count us as satisfied customers, and thank you to all the other reviewers whose reviews helped us make up our minds.
