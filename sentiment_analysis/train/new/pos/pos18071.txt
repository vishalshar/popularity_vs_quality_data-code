These are just as pictured.  My kid loves to chew through the drinking straw (even though he's told constantly not to! -  part dog, I guess), so once we cut the rubber part so far down, they have to go in the garbage!  I'm glad these are available.  I did keep my old hard straws to use with the rubber part.
