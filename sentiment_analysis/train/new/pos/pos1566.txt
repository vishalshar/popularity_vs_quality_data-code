I have a Moby, which I adore, but when the baby started getting stronger and more wiggly (not until around 9 months did it start being any sort of issue) I wanted something more structured so I wouldn't be so worried about him flipping himself out.  I really had a hard time deciding between the Ergo, Beco, and Boba, and spent hours trying to decide.  I ended up choosing the Ergo because it is the only one that I have actually tried on before, so I know it is comfortable.  Plus I love the "Night Sky" pattern.It is high quality and very comfortable.  There are a couple drawbacks: One is that it is really, really hard for me to buckle the strap that goes behind me when I am wearing the baby on the front.  The other is that its hard to get babies on your back.  It is however quite easy to get toddlers and preschoolers on your back.  The other day I put a 3.5 year old in the carrier and it was surprisingly comfortable for both of us.  She tried to get me to wear her to the park, which I could have done no problem, but since half the reason we go to the park is for exercise I told her no.  I did wear her around the house for a while though, and it was super easy!  I highly recommend this carrier, and have actually stopped people in Babies R Us to tell them about it when I heard them talking about getting a Bjorn.  Which if you knew me, you would know is a huge deal because I tend to be quite an introvert.  If you have any questions about this carrier, leave a comment and I will answer.*When buying an Ergo online, make sure you buy it from an authorized retailer.  A lot of them that you find online are counterfeit and at best are of a sub par quality and at worst dangerous.  I bought mine on Amazon through La Stella Blu which was listed on Ergo's website as an authorized retailer.  If the product is "fulfilled by Amazon" be wary as I have heard that Amazon takes the products from all the sellers and keeps them together so you don't know who's product you are getting.*
