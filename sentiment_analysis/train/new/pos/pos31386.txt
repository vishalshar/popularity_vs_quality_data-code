We have three of these handy little things.  We take them on and off the doors as needed, as sometimes we don't want our little explorer in and out of all the rooms at one time.  They can be a bit tough initially to get on and off the door,  but loosen a bit over time. Still, they are holding up well. I know they are marketed as pinch guards, and they certainly work for that. They also work perfectly for keeping our little one from locking herself in or out of a room.  I don't think I have to detail for other parents the problem of your toddler on one side of a closed door and the parents on the other.  She did that a few times before we got a couple more of these to prevent that.  These aren't all that expensive, so I won't be upset if they only last a few years, but they seem sturdy enough to hold up for a while, and so far, so good.
