This review is hard to write. Two weeks ago today, we had what I thought was our first false alarm with this monitor. Only it wasn't a false alarm at all. I went to pick up my son and realized he was lifeless and not breathing. We called 911 immediately, and got him to the hospital. All tests were normal. The doctor thought his GERD paired with a deep sleep caused this. Had it not been for this monitor, I wouldn't have known he had stopped breathing.THANK YOU Levana.We bring our monitor with us everywhere, it's on him for naps, in the car seat, and at night.I know these monitors are expensive, but they are so very worth every penny, and much much more.
