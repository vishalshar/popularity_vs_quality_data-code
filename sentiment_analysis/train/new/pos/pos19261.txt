This thing is the best. I'm not going to get into all of the things I like about it but I'll focus on 2 aspects which have made it a perfect fit for my family. When it was time to graduate from the bumbo, this is the one I chose. The reason I mention the bumbo is because we used to seat the little feller on the kitchen counter (obviously way back from the edge). It was convenient because he could watch me as I cooked and cleaned and he was close to eye level. The seat part of this chair is removed with just one quick motion and sits right on the counter where the bumbo sat. It has a rubberized bottom on the seat so it won't slide so that makes it a safe choice as well. He can sit up straight and interact with me as I feed him whatever falls on the floor. So yeah, I'm totally not serious about that. But I am serious about the fact that he can still sit on the counter instead of off to the side or in another areas.The second aspect that I like is how quickly this thing cleans up. It only takes a minute to detach the straps and pads and toss them into the wash. Or, you can just sit the seat in the sink and wipe and spray it clean. The straps clean up with just a wet sponge. The padding is easier to clean than the straps. Kids are messy eaters and if cleaning this thing were a pain I'd be very disappointed. The only disappointment I have is that the little guy is growing up so fast.
