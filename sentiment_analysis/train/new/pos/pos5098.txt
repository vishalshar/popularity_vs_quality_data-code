I had bought an Ergobaby (Performance) with newborn insert before because I was told that it's the best. While the Ergo worked for my now 10 week old baby boy, we didn't feel comfortable using it with the newborn insert. It gets pretty hot in summer, I felt like I had to hold the head all the time since it was very far down and I was worried the baby would suffocate, the two worst things were that first, the baby didn't feel completely comfortable because the legs were in a weird angle and his feet were still inside the carrier, my baby doesn't like if something is pressing against his feet, he wanted to push back and stand up and then cried many times. Second, it didn't feel safe to put the carrier on alone with the baby in the newborn insert since I could only hold him in the insert against my body with one hand while putting on the carrier and one time he actually almost fell out.For these reasons, I ordered the Babybjoern original and we love it. He feels comfortable in there, his head sticks out the right length (hight of the carrier can be adjusted) so he doesn't suffocate, his legs hang down as he likes it, he is in a better upright position, because the Babybjorn is less wide on the sides. It is super easy and fast to put on and there is no risk of him falling out. Another advantage which I have not tried out yet is that the baby can face forward.There are a few downsides with the Babybjorn: it doesn't have a hip belt so the weight is on the shoulders/ back and it might hurt once the baby is older and when walking longer distances, it works "only" for babies up to 25lb/11kg (Ergo Performance up to 45lb/20kg), no sun cover (which I like in Ergo).CONCLUSION: The Babybjoern is much better for me and my 10 week old baby boy. I am sure that once the baby gets older and can stick out his head on the top and his legs can hang out on the sides at the bottom and once he is heavier (hip belt will be needed), we will prefer the Ergo so I am glad that I have those two!SummaryPros Babybjoern Original:- easy, safe and fast to put on- forward facing option- can be adjusted to the length of the baby, so the head sticks out the right way- more comfortable foot/ leg position for a newborn- nice straight upright position for a newbornPros Ergobaby Performance with newborn insert- very nice hip belt, so the weight is on the hips not on the shoulders- higher weight limit, so it works for older children (up to 45lb/20kg for Ergo, 25lb/11kg for Babybjorn)- nice sun cover- equally easy to put on once the newborn insert is not needed anymore
