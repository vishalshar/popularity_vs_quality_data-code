This pump is great!  I have been breastfeeding for 20 months and I use it CONSTANTLY.  I've even gone on a week long trip and had no trouble pumping enough to leave with my son for the entire length of the trip, but also took it with me and pumped the whole time I was gone to keep up my milk supply. Yes, every now and then the valve gets stuck and you have to tap the bottle to get it to release the milk- but it is usually because I just washed it and it dried shut, so if you remember to pull it open before you start you'll have no problems.  It's compact enough to take anywhere, you can use it as a single or double pump, it hooks up to power or can be used on batteries.  I'm not sure exactly what people are expecting for a dual breast pump that only costs $50, but for me it is worth a little hassel every now and then, it's not a $300 Medela! I could see if you had problems like low supply that it might not be the greatest, but I would suggest that if you have trouble using this pump you probably would with any pump, also just like any pump or breastfeeding in general it does take a little getting used to, and is a little painful at first. Nevertheless, I would HIGHLY recommend this pump, infact I'm buying another one for a friend who is expecting!
