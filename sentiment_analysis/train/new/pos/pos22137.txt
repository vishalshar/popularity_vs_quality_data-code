This mobile (as mentioned in another review) has one design flaw that can be pretty annoying if you don't correct it yourself. Some of the stuffed animals that hang down from the mobile canopy get caught on the mobile arm, which causes the mobile to stop turning. Sometimes you might get lucky, and the animal makes it past the mobile arm on the first try, only to get stuck on the second time around. Luckily, my wife and I found a quick fix to this problem. We just used a bobby pin to pin the string that the animal hangs from to the top of the mobile, closer to the middle of the canopy. This shortens the length that the animal hangs down, but it also gives the animal enough clearance to pass by the mobile arm without getting caught. You have to pin all 4 animals though, to keep the mobile from wobbling.One of these days, we are planning on taking the bobby pins out, and sewing the strings to the canopy, for a cleaner looking solution.
