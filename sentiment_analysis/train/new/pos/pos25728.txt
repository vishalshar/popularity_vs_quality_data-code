I bought this for my 11 month old.  It's been two months and he still loves it.  It comes with a hammer (we immediately lost this), but my son isn't coordinated enough to use it anyway.Most of the negative reviews I read about this product mentioned that the balls are difficult to push through the holes.  This is true.  There are small plastic "tabs" in the holes that provide resistance so that the balls don't just drop in.  I simply took a fingernail file and filed them down a bit.  The balls still sit on top, but with little effort they push though.  My son manages the process without difficulty.  I can see how the original design is frustrating, but it's easily fixed.  Also, I bought toy-balls for cats from the pet section at Dollar General (3 for $1).  These work great also.  I have not had trouble w/ any choking hazards.  The balls are not small enough to fit in my son's mouth.I bought this with Playskool Explore and Grow Busy Ball Popper which has also been a great purchase for us.
