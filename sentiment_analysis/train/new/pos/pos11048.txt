I like this for a sleep sack but the swaddle part doesn't keep my little mover/wiggler in.  He always got his hands underneath and would move the swaddle part...so if you need a good swaddle...this isnt the greatest, but it is a good lightweight sleep sack. I wanted a swaddle for 14-22lbs that was cotton.  I ended up getting the organic summers infant cotton swaddle and it stretches to fit my 18lb little boy.
