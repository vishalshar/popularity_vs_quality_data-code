What a silly concept LOL. I got these on sale and I paid about half the recommended retail price so can't complain too much. At 16 months my daughter still doesn't get the whole idea of bowling but she likes the penguins, and the cute jingly ball has been very useful for learning basic catch and fetch games. I did try setting the game up to play for her to entertain her but she just picks the penguins up and runs off with them. She seems to especially like the purple one with the mirror in its tummy. Each penguin has different textures, colors and noises so they are quite appealing to younger children but I wouldn't expect much in the bowling department until the child is at least 2 or so.They can a bit hard to stand up but if you feel around the base of the penguin you can feel a rigid disc inside the toy which is supposed to lay flat in the bottom of the toy. They do get out of place but they are easy to manipulate back into position. That should help the not standing up problem.
