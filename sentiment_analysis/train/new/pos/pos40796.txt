In celebration of purchasing a nice new mattress, I purchased a small variety of cute little plush sheep for my wife to count. Of the different sheep I had purchased, this one was her definite favorite. She really adores this little sheep, and it often ends up on the bed when she makes it up, along with a couple of decorative pillows and one or two others of her favorite plush animals. We just recently had a good laugh when we discovered, after having this little sheep for more than a couple of years, that it makes baaaing sounds, which was not known from the time I bought it. For as much as my wife has adored it, and as many smiles it's given me to see her cheerful child-like side giving it a place in our bed, and giving it a name, and cuddling it, I've considered it money very well spent, even before we discovered, by accident, that it also makes sheep noises in addition to just looking cute.  :-)
