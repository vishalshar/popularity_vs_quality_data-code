I love the diapers (when I can actually use them), but the ad said they would fit a 10 to 40 lb baby.  My little man is 9 lbs and so I was thinking he could wear these soon.  I got the package and it clearly states ON the Kissa's packaging that it's for 15lbs and up.  They are ENORMOUS.  So, that really annoys me that I'm receiving incorrect information.  I could've ordered a different diaper in the CORRECT size if I had known.
