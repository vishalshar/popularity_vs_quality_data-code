Depending on which Graco Pack 'n Play you have - look at the folding pad that comes with it.  If it has square corners, then get this mattress with square corners.  IT WILL FIT PERFECTLY SNUG!!!  If the folding pad has rounded corners, then get this mattress with rounded corners.  Different PnP models have different corner shapes - and that makes a difference.  Use this 3" mattress ON TOP of the thin folded one that came with your PnP.  This mattress arrived timely, perfect condition, no smells.  I use with ReliaMed Reusable Underpad (23"x36") sold on Amazon.  This waterproof pad serves as the mattress pad - it will keep the baby from sweating on the vinyl mattress and give extra cushioning.  For sheets, I bought TL Care "Fitted Pack-n-Play Sheet" also sold on Amazon - comes in different colors.  This mattress was the perfect solution for babies sleeping more than the occasional nap - my grand babies sleep several nights and naps when they visit.  PERFECT.
