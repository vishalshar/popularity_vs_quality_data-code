I read a review that someone had posted complaining how "cheap" this product was and "low quality".  I was skeptical to order it, but ordered it anyway for my son's nursery, as it matched the theme and was not going to cost an arm and a leg.  I was pleasantly surprised when I recieved the hamper; it is not low quality as another review states.  It is better than what you would expect from a pop up hamper for 9.99.  The monkey is adorable.  It comes with supports to insert in the top and bottom to make it sturdy (the supports cannot be seen when inserted) -- and that takes care of any worry I had that it would be low quality like other hampers I had.Very, very cute... sturdy... nice size!  Great for a child's nursery as a hamper or to hold stuffed animals!  It fits in great with any jungle theme or monkey theme.  Do not be alarmed if you read other people's reviews stating it is low quality or cheap.  It is affordable at 9.99 -- but you will be pleased with the quality!I would definately buy this again! :)
