I bought this booster seat for my little girl after a lot of research. This seat seemed to meet all safety standards and was affordable. Those were my first two requirements and after seeing the seat in person, I am very happy with my purchase. The seat is sturdy and the belt is positioned correctly. I did buy a seat belt cover that will double as a pillow for her on longer car rides (also sold on amazon, I believe Sunshine was the name brand) As an added bonus she finds the seat comfortable and can't wait to be in the car at night to use the reading lights. I also found this very easy to put together. The story goes a little something like this: I tracked my package and found that the seat was out for delivery. I wanted to surprise my little girl by picking her up from school with the seat in the car already. So I stopped home really quick, with only 20 minutes before pick-up time, to see if the seat arrived.  It was sitting on my front porch. I grabbed the box, opened it with my keys, quickly glanced at the directions (which were easy to follow)and put the seat together outside with time to spare. Needless to say this story had a very happy little girl in it. :)
