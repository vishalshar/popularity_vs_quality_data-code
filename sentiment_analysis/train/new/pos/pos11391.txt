Baby gets in and out ok. Comfy enough to hear zero fussing from the back. Belts are easily adjusted with pads. Just the right size...middle row of odyssey minivan still seats three with plenty of room even with car seat. Car seat is a hair too wide to fit in the center of middle row on odyssey. With both outboard seats in the middle row slid to farthest point outward, car seat in center seat will still rub when folding an outboard seat to gain access to 3rd row. If you don't mind the rubbing, baby can sit in center spot of middle row. My boy sits behind the driver seat and center seat on middle row has the seat back folded down as a cup holder so he can easily reach for his bottle or toy or snack.......fold seat back if you need another adults sized seat
