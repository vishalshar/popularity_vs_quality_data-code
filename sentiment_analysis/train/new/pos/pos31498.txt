I wanted a video monitor so I could view my baby sleeping, but didn't want to spend alot of money, so I read reviews of every video monitor on the market and chose the Day and Night Digital Monitor.  Some reviews said you could not see anything in a dark room, but I can see him perfectly, there is not difference with a bright room or a pitch dark room, the quality is great and you can see your baby perfectly.  I have had this for 3 months now and so far, no interference, just a strange clicking sound every now and then, but it's not bothersome.  The monitor itself is a bit larger then I would have wanted, but it's light weight and easy to move around.  Overall, I am very happy with it and would highly recommend it to anyone that wants a black & white video monitor for a great price.
