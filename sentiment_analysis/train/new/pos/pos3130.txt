I have been using this wet bag next to my changing table to put my dirty, wet wipes until laundry time (because of using a service that only washed the diapers, not the wipes), and it has worked great!  I was using a Planet Wise bag before, as that had come highly recommended to me, but the bag seemed to get damp having the wipes in it and the moisture seemed to leach through the double layer of plastic and fabric.  So, I wanted to try something new, and this worked great! The handle made it easy to hang off the side of my table, and I have had no issues with leaking whatsoever.  It washes well in the hot cycle with the wipes and dries without much difficulty in the dryer with them, making it easy to keep clean and smelling good after the gross stuff I put it in it.I have also tried the Kanga Care wet bags, which work equally well, but they are much bigger than what I wanted for this specific purpose.  This medium size is a perfect size for wipes or to throw in your diaper bag to put a soiled outfit in or probably 3 wet prefold diapers.This design is very cute, as well.I would definitely get Swaddlebee bags again and would recommend them to any one debating between Planet Wise and these.
