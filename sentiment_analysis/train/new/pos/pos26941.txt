Before I bought this, I was hoping to buy something that's pretty (there are many out there with cute designs), but I am so glad I got this changing pad instead. The price was unbeatable, and when it comes to changing diapers outside of home, functionality is everything!This changing pad is quite cushiony, so I can use this on a hard or uneven surface. It opens and folds very easily (closes with velcro). The size and shape is perfect for changing in the backseat of a car or in the stroller bassinet. And it's easy to clean (just wipe with the diaper wipe).
