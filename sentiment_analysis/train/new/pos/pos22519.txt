My son is 4 months and started flipping on his stomach To give me peace of mind and sleep. My husband and I decided to purchase a video monitor to control my late night strolls into to his room. After reading review after review and consumer reports. I still could not make up my mind. I was close to buying the summer video monitor but read reviews of a continous red light shining on the baby. So reading Parent magazine this monitor was one of their favorite new baby gadgets. So, why not. For the price... cheaper then the summer... I thought lets try this. The monitor is great. The screeen is big enough to see him breathing and mobile enough to take it from room to room (bedroom to kitchen). I did read about the temp not being acurate. The instructions does say with continous use the temperature in the monitor may be distorted by some degrees in the future. Regardless I am very happy. For a mom that is not so into gadgets this monitor has music and a speaker that is loud.. Just whisper.Night time video is so clear. I was surprised there was no light or flash. I live in a subpenthouse on the 26 floor and have no problems with WiFi or static because of glass walls.  My only con is no zoom. I Hope this helps you.
