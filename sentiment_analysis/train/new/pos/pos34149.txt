We love Tommee Tippee our baby boy loves Tommee Tippee as well. We have gone through countless bottles, gentle start, gerber, Dr brown's"I love, baby loves, husband hates," and a few other brands. So far Tommee Tippee is the only bottle we all agree on. We have had trouble with bottle nipples from the time we brought our baby home. All of the "slow flow" medium and fast flow nipples are never true to word ( surprisingly gentle start is) They are so nature, durable, and it does let you have a closer feeding with your baby for us none breast feeding mommies. The sleeker design is a plus. I love how the black print that displays oz's does not rub off or fade no matter the amount of washes it goes through. The nippes are lovely in all the stages. My baby boy uses similac none spitup formula and so it has rice starch in it which makes the formula thicker than regular. There for we use stage 2 nipples which do fit onto these added cereal bottles. All around Tommee Tippee our way to go. And though these bottles are fatter than others baby can still hold on his or her own.
