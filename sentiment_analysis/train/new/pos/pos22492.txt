I bought 2 of these for my boys, one 4yo and one 5yo both at about 75th percentile for height...Shipping... I received mats 2 days earlier than tracking estimated so VERY pleasantly surprised (but unsure why tracking w/ fedex was so off).Overall, great product!Things I love about the mats...- seems to be very good quality and made in the USA!!!- boys love them!- thick (much thicker than all others I looked at)- soft material- easy to roll up and carry- easy to wash/dry in washing machine and dryerwish list for improvements...- make them a tad longer (they do stretch out some though)- make the blanket go all the way (or at least close) to the end of the mat... both boys feet hang out if laying on their backs (however, this was the longest one on the market and if the boys lay on their sides with their legs bent a little the blanket completely covers them).  Right now the blanket stops about 4 inches short of the end of the mat.- add an identification tag/label... I bought a couple luggage tags to attach to the strap which work fine though- Velcro eventually wears out so some other kind of latching would be good (however Velcro may be less easily torn off as opposed to rivets or loop)Today is the first day of use in pre-k and kindergarten... going by other reviews I expect we will be using these at least throughout the school year plus some... will update review if I can add any helpful info.So far VERY pleased with Ozark Mountain Kids and would be very willing to make future purchases! :-)
