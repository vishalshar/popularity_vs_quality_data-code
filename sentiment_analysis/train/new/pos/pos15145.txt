I got this product for free by earning gift cards from this site http://www.instagc.com/mystina83 If you have any questions you can ask me on my facebook page "Earning cash and gift cards online" This is a cute litte mobile for our upcoming little one. Very easy to assemble. You can wind it up and it will play music and spin the plush cars around. Very easy to wind up, my three year old has been practicing for when her brother arrives.  Has plastic bumpers so it will not scratch up the wood of the crib which is nice.
