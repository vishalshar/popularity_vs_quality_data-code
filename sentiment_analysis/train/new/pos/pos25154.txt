I purchased this seat for my 11 month old. I wanted a convertible seat because she's short, so she'll probably remain rear facing for a while. My husband affirmed that this seat was easy to install, you just need to know where your anchors are. I like the cushions (daughter fell asleep in her first ride) and I also like that the shoulder straps do not have to be re-looped in the front as she grows, they slide up. I like the recline feature, the separate cup holder (we don't use it yet) and the material. I like the material of the head rest because it does not pull out her hair like cotton. My only issue is that it is a large seat, very wide. I would recommend it to others, but would let them know it is kind of large. That makes me feel secure, however, it takes up a lot of space. We have it installed rear-facing in a Jeep Commander. Oh, I think a few others mentioned that it is hard to release when getting the child out. It took me some time to learn to slide the center latch instead of pressing down. I like that fact that it isn't "easy" to open, that means her little hips are secure. However, after one month of owning it, I can release the center latch with one hand. Very pleased with this purchase.
