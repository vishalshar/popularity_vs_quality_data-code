We used this for our first daughter and son from birth until they was about 2 years old and it worked very well. When we had our third child, we bought another set.  We haven't used it yet since our new car seat came with much better head support, but she has about outgrown that.  I anticipate that we'll be using this Cradler soon.  Anyway, the review is based on the first cradler we bought almost 6 years ago, because this appears to be the exact same model.  The cradler worked very well at stabilizing the head, especially useful for long car rides when the infants fall asleep.  Its very adjustable so you can use on tiny babies up to toddlers.
