I was a little nervous to try these. They are made in China and are remarkably affordable, which made me think they would not be of good quality. On the contrary, they have quickly become my favorite cloth diapers, and I have ordered six more. The suede cloth interior really does wick the moisture away from my son's skin so that his skin stays dry even when the inserts are drenched. I use two inserts in each diaper, and they have never leaked like the Kushies, Little Monsters, or flats with Thirsties Duo Wrap Snaps have. The hip snaps keep the sides from sliding out of alignment like the Trend Lab diapers do. It's a lot easier to get the poop off of these (and other pocket diapers) with the diaper sprayer than to get the poop off of folded flats, prefolds, and Kushies with their annoying "Patented built in flap." Since the inserts are relatively thin, the get clean and fresh-smelling more easily than the thicker inserts. The diapers themselves don't even need to be put in the dryer. They dry in less than half an hour when draped over a towel rod under a fan, and, after a couple of weeks of being washed between once and twice per day with Earth Friendly Ecover Free & Clear detergent and rinsed with a cup of vinegar in the second rinse, these diapers have held up perfectly without any pilling in the lining like thew Little Monsters and other fleece-lined diapers have. In short, the only complaints I have about these diapers are that they are not made in America, and they are not made by a small, local operation. Then again, the diapers that are made in America tend to be made with fabrics made in China, and the diapers made by small businesses tend to cost $20 or more each. When you are broke and want to save the environment (and prevent diaper rash) one diaper at a time, these diapers don't seem like such a bad idea.
