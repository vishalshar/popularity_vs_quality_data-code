This purse is what America looks like under Republican control. They are the leaders of denying man made climate change and waging war on a living wage for the people of America to say a few, republicans are't for making the country a better place there for making the rich richer and destroying a government that is helping the less fortunate, or in other words the middle class. IF U DON"T WANT PEOPLE VIEWING AMERICA LIKE THIS,,,,,,,, then VOTE DEMOCRAT!!!!!!!
