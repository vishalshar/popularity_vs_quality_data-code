These are not the easiest things to install. I did it by myself, without too much trouble but it took some time to get it right. If you are renting, these are maybe not something to bother with unless you'll be there for a while. If you own, these are amazing and so much better than the stupid clips. First of all, no finger pinching with these things. Second, any clever toddler figures out those clip locks after a while and then what good are they? We don't lock all of our cabinets, but the ones that hold chemicals and knives are obviously locked. You can disable these too, so if you no longer need it locked you don't have to uninstall them.Just try not to lose the key inside one of the locked drawers, like I've done. As a sidenote, disc magnets will work, but you have to stack like 5 of them together to be strong enough. But we have them as a backup and they're much cheaper than a replacement key.
