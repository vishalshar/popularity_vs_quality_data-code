This was one of the main child proofing things we had to do at our house. We got "lucky" to have a electrical socket obsessed baby. She's 10 months now and grown out of it, but she was an early crawler at 6 months and went straight for the plugs then. As she started to pull herself up, she would pull up on the plugs! She never got hurt luckily, largely because we ordered these immediately after the first time she showed any interest in a plug. These covers are so easy and quick to put all over the house. The slide right in. We love that they are clear. We didn't want having a baby to turn our house into a house full of bright baby stuff everywhere. Of course she has her toys, high chair, etc. But at least we don't have ugly electrical outlet covers. They are easy for an adult to pull out when we need to vacuum and use the outlet. Our baby isn't as interested anymore, but she never pulled them out when she was. Overall we've been very please with these!
