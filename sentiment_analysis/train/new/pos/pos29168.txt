My kid loves this thing!It came assembled, which is great.  Yeah, it is "small" but I have a smaller kid.  So it works well for me and my baby.  The product is durable and pretty solid.  The wheels are durable - a plus considering I bought a plastic one just in case I did not like this one.  I LOVE this little cart!!!  I wish I bought two of these.Oh, this little cart is the perfect height for my child (26" tall).  Any kid with this cart won't topple the thing over - the back portion is extended a little bit so it won't fall over a kid.  My kid also likes to chew on the shapes that came with the cart.  Much fun!!!
