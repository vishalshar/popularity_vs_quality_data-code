The containers are great, and all total, I have eight of these containers.  I also have four Lansinoh containers which also work with the medela pump that I have.  I prefer the Medela 2.5 oz. containers for freezing because they have an area where you can write the date with a dry-erase marker.  I have twenty-four of the 2.5 oz, and that is what I use for freezing.  When using the bottle part of these, the nipple seems to have a much faster flow than the Nuk Orthodontic Slow Flow bottles as my son gets a lot of milk dribbling down his mouth and shirt when we use these.  My son does very well on the Nuk Slow Flow bottles -- So I don't use the nipple part very often, but the containers are nice and convenient and a great size for pumping and storing at work.
