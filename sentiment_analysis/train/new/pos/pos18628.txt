This bottle warmer works great. Make sure you select on and the bottle size. It's great for when I'm on the go I use it with Mixie bottles (the formula stays separate from the water you until your ready to mix, another great product!). It does take longer to heat up than your typical in home bottle warmer but that's expected. Give yourself 10 minutes of lead time. I did order an adapter to try this in a plug for when I'm at someone home and I don't want to sit in the car for 10 minutes. I got a female adapter that plugs into wall. It didn't work. The warmer had power but when I tried to warm it kept blinking. Would've been perfect if I could use indoors too.
