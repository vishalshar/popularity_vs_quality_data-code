I am in love with this pillow. I have had mine over 2 years (bought Apr 2013) and can't imagine sleeping without it. I am not, nor have I ever been, pregnant so don't let the "maternity" description make you think it is only for the pregnant. If you like to throw one leg over a pillow and/or cuddle a pillow as you lay your head on another one, this pillow is for you.CONS:1. Expensive, but you already knew that.2. Scarcity of replacement covers, which are equally expensive. Judging from the price ($57.20 09/07/2015,) you should be able to purchase the pillow without a cover for about $40. But that doesn't seem to be an option anywhere.3. Replacement cover colors: white, gray, navy, & natural are the only colors I can find.4. Interior filling separates after a while, making it less comfy unless you rearrange it and poof it before you sleep.5. Takes up a lot of room. If you sleep with a partner, you probably need a king sized bed.6. I am flummoxed as to what to do with it when I make the bed. I camouflage it with two giant European pillows but it's still awkward. See photos: the pretzel, the plank, and the harlot.
