This is an absolute life saver! I can't rave about this enough. Honestly, I'd be going absolutely crazy had I not purchased this. Our daughter is one month old today and we've been using this with her for at least the last two weeks. She loves it. Nothing else works. At first we purchased a bouncy seat, but she just screams. This swing was a last ditch effort to get some relief...and it's PERFECT! The swing has three different motions. Her favorite is front to back. It mimics daddy's rocking well enough that we can get her to fall asleep in daddy's arms and then quickly put her in the swing and...she stays asleep for an extra three hours! Hooray!!! Best. Invention. Ever. I can't rave about this enough. The cat cover (in the seat) is easily removed and is washable in case of any accidents. It also plays music and/or nature sounds (she likes the crickets) and has a mobile that moves...now that she can see a bit bette,r this is quickly becoming a favorite. This swing is TOTALLY worth every last cent I spent on it! Do not hesitate to buy this. Also, the fact that it's electric is great (no blowing through batteries!) and super easy assembly.
