These are of really good quality, if only they had used their brain to design the underside of the clip to not have square edges, as both my twins pull them off and place the clip in their mouths, all they had to do was round it so no corner was present.  This wouldnâ€™t stop me from buying it again, but hey guys, think about what you are designing for babies; EVERYTHING goes in their mouth.
