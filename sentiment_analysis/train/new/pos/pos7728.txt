I will admit that I was sorely tempted to buy the original Fisher Price stacker, the one we all had as kids.  It's absolutely a classic and I may still obtain one of them.But I was drawn to this one for my 5-month old because I remember reading somewhere that it is slightly smaller than the classic version with the large plastic hollow donuts.  I thought smaller might work better for the little guy.  Well.  Since this toy has come into the house, not a day has gone by without at least one play session where he selects this toy to play with from among a lot of others.Now 8 months old, he still loves this one.  He tips over the base to let the rings fall free, takes one in each hand, and shakes them like tambourines.  He smacks them together and has a grand old time.  He is not at all interested in re-stacking them on the base, but that's fine with me because it just means the toy will last a while longer while he grows into that phase.The topper on this stacker is the red ring with the little chick.  This part does not rattle, which is a little bit of a shame.  It also wedges kind of tightly onto the top of the base, so baby can't remove it himself, but that's OK.I am very very pleased with this purchase.  I have subsequently looked at some of the other stackers on the market and I am convinced this one is the cream of the crop.UPDATE:  Eddie is now 17 months old and a month or two ago, he started stacking the rings on the stump.  He still needs help deciding the order they should be placed on the stump but he's had a lot of fun trying to get this thing figured out.  Still a hit in our household.UPDATE:  Eddie is turning 4 next week and only today did I pull this one out of the toy basket  :-( .
