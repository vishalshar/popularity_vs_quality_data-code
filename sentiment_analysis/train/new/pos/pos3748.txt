I used to work in dentistry and was a strong advocate for brushing infants' teeth.  However, infants don't take to toothbrushes the way they do to an adult finger and one of these toothbrushes.  It's excellent for the parent, because you can be sure you're maximizing your brushing time.  However, I find that the brush head is very snug on my slightly larger than normal female finger - desirable so that you don't lose it in your child's mouth, but difficult for a male hand.I just purchased this for use on my now 1-year-old granddaughter. Her parents have been using one on her since the eruption of her first tooth.  So far, so good!
