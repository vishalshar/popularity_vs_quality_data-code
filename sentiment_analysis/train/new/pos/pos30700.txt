My son was about 6 months old when he started pulling at and untucking his sheets from his crib.  I discovered that he was grasping onto them as he was sleeping, and held the end of the sheet up to his face as he sucked his thumb.  I worried about him getting tangled up in the sheets and not being able to free himself, so I started looking for a safe blanket for him to use as an alternative, and found these.  I am so glad that I bought them!  The material is nice and thin and I never worried about it covering his face as it was extremely breathable (and yes, when I received it, I held it tightly against my face to see if I could breathe through it).These have become his everything!  He takes it everywhere we go, and uses it at every nap and bedtime.  A few times I have forgotten it at home, put him down for a nap, and he had a meltdown because he didn't have his blankie.  We've had them for almost a year now, and they are still completely intact, albeit quite dirty.  Having two is nice because it means he can always have one while I'm washing the other, but they do get dirty easily, especially when he always has it with him, drags it across the floor, gets food on it, etc.  We are actually ordering another set for him today because our current ones just won't get 100% clean anymore.They are a little more expensive than I wanted to pay for security blankets, but I have found the quality to really be exceptional, and I don't mind paying again for another set.  Highly recommend!
