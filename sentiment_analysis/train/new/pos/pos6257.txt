These knobs are about 1" by 1" although they aren't perfectly round. They are heavy and well made. I just got them today so I can't say how they'll hold up but I'm happy as first sight. When I came back on to review these after I ordered them I must have searched them differently because this exact product came up under a different seller for $39.99 and not prime. So beware if you recommend to anyone. If you search for "children drawer pulls" the other one comes up but if you search for "drawer pulls" under the baby category this one comes up.
