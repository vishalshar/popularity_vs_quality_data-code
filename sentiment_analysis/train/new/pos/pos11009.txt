I was a little hesitant to purchase this because of all of the negative reviews, but, I love it!!!  My son is 2.5yrs old and we have one that has the built in splash guard and it gets in the way, it doesn't leave a big enough "hole" for him to "do his thing," so I got this one and did away with the removable splash guard and it is fabulous!!  I will probably be purchasing another, not to mention, he loves the marvel heroes!!  BTW, I don't even see the purpose of the splash guard unless you just have them sit there and not hold "it" down, my son pushes down when he goes making the splash guard pointless, it actually just gets in the way, so not having one is much better for us, like I said, it makes for more room for him.
