It's put together and so far I'm pleased. Just holding onto the box waiting for our car seat to come in, to make sure it fits snugly. This seems like I perfect alternative to car seats that only fit to their own brand stroller. Just clip over seatbelt area the  same as you would in a car if you didn't have a base. Simple super save.Update: car seat came in. The Nuna pippa fits perfect! Idk what the bad reviews were over. Do you people not know how to tighten a strap for goodness sake?! Ive shaken it and the seat did not budge. I was not about to spend money on a single matching Nuna stroller knowing I plan for another ASAP and will need a double. chances are I'll go with this brand for the double as well. It's light and will do well for flight travels. In my pic there is a stroller organizer that is not included.
