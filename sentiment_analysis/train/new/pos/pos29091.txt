Liked the concept and my 6-month-old does great getting the food into his mouth on his own with these. It was a little disturbing though to see that after one or two uses the blue spoon completely discolored and turned light green.Edited - adding a month later that the orange spoon is now unusable because the material has torn at the end. I'm not sure whether I want to repurchase these knowing the new ones will most likely fall apart too.
