Perfect bucket swing and perfect price. If you have a Rainbow playset do not spend all of the extra $ to get a bucket swing when this one is amazing quality at a fraction of the cost and same quality!  I am very please with this purchase.  My baby has been using this since she was 7 months with gentle pushes.  She has loved it since day one and would kick her feet in happiness as I was putting her in.  Now she is 15 months and still gets excited to swing! And now she gets the big pushes!  This seat has lots of grow room and we will use it until she is around 3 year old!
