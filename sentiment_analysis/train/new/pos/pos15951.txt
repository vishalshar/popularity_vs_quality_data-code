Short version: Buy this now!  Seriously, you will thank yourself later.  It's a great investment and the company has amazing customer service.  I definitely recommend the bean bag and plan on using it in the future as a go-to gift for any expecting moms.  FYI: The bean bag is intended for the first year, it's not sized for a toddler. (I just wish they had full adult size versions too.  Seriously look how cozy that baby in the pic looks!!)Long version: After a few weeks of being outside the womb, my little one decided she wasn't too happy about it and proceeded to let me know.  We had weeks of non-stop fuss/crying which required holding her while standing and moving (my ears and back were crying along with the baby).  My desperation must have been heard from afar because then one day the gods smiled down on me, and I came across this product (cue light and angelic singing).  After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this comfy-looking item.  My husband was oh-so-the-naysayer but really couldn't object since our little one only wanted me to hold her.. Two days later the bean bag arrived just in time for a weekend family get-a-way.  Our baby hangs out and takes naps in this sanity saver.  You can shape the bean bag so the baby sits more upright, which is very helpful if your baby suffers from reflux.I did have an issue with a seam fraying but I emailed the seller and Matt responded the same day and shipped a brand new bean bag out to me.  EXCELLENT customer service.
