I have bought Gust Busters for myself and for others as gifts for years. It will make back its higher price many times over since a Gust Buster will NEVER blow inside out and fall apart. Ingenious design releases wind through openings inside the umbrella before it can wreak havoc with the umbrella spokes. Going online to buy one as a present, I had the pleasant surprise of discovering that they were now offering a Gust Buster in this attractive paisley design. I'd get that one for myself next, except that mine will never need replacing!
