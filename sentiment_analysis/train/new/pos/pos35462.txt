Put simply, this is a convenient way to carry around a roll of small single-use diaper bags to bag up your childs diapers while on the go. Great for use when a guest at other peoples homes so that your diapers don't stink up their trash. Obviously if you do the math, the cost per bag for this is high, but it keeps the bags organized into a neat, attractive package, and lets you clip it anywhere onto any diaper bag or other carrying bag and keep it at arms reach at all times. It's also refillable, so that helps reduce the cost slightly after the original purchase.The reason I deducted one single star is because the plastic case for the bags itself has a slightly cheap clasp on it. On rare occasion, I find that if I bump in into something while walking around, the plastic case will open itself up, allowing the bags to slightly unravel. It's a minor inconvenience, but I feel that the design of the clasp could be easily improved to prevent this from happening in the future since you don't actually need to open the case up all that often.
