I don't see what all the complaints are for, its a lot less messy than ink and sure if you're not super careful you can get smudges or unwanted prints but that's going to happen with any print kit, especially one with ink! I thought this was pretty easy to use, my baby certainly wouldn't have cooperated for ink printing. True it is kind of a one time deal, but I'd buy another set. Prints show up and set right away too, you don't have to press hard with baby's delicate hands and feet. I would recommend it.
