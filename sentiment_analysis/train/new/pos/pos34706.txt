We bought the crib due to its robust and smaller footprint.  We wanted to have a crib to be moving around in different rooms and also to keep it in our bedroom.  This was perfect fit and looked quite robust too, so went for this design.  The installation as compared to our fears was not difficult, but it did take both of us to help to assemble it correctly.  It does take some patience to piece together the parts.  However once it is assembled, it seems to be quite solid and build well for the baby .  Would try to add more experiences as we use it further for the baby in the future.  Would surely recommend this purchase
