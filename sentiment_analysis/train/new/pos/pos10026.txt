I bought this gift set for a few reasons. One of them being, it was a great way to get more bottles than what the pump came with. It also let me rest out the 3 oz feeding tubes and the milk storage bags. While I love the bottles for pumping and storing, my personal preference led me away from the tubes. They just took up too much space in the freezer, and if I was going to leave the milk in the bottle I would rather just throw a normal bottle in the fridge for later.While I liked the idea of being able to pump directly into storage bags, I did not like the medela bags.  The plastic felt very brittle. They do not freeze flat at all, and they barely hold the 5 oz they are marked to hold. I ended up sticking with Lanisoh brand bags just because of the ability to freeze flat.However, while I didn't like 2/3 of the gift set, I would still highly recommend it for any mom who wants to try it out different storage methods for pumping, or to anyone going to a baby shower where the mom plans to breast feed. The bottles were very useful in the starting months, and I was able to figure out what I liked and didn't like for my storage through trial and error.
