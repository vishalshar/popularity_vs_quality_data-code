These are just what I wanted for our bathroom. They are fresh and airy.  I shortened them to fit a smaller window, as I was unable to find this type of curtain in a shorter size.  The only thing keeping them from being a 5-star is that the sewing is only adequate.  I suppose, for the price, this is to be expected. The lengths of the two panels I purchased are not the same, the corners aren't even close to square, nor the hems straight.  But with the tulle ruffles, this isn't overly noticeable.  What I notice when I walk into the bathroom is that they are like a splash of summer! I really love the way they brightened the room!
