These baskets are great. I first had bought a more expensive set but ended up taking them back when i seen these. The white matches my daughters furniture. I ended up ordering 2 sets in pink and then for my son i ordered 1 set in blue. I keep things like extra diapers and wipes. Onesies, blankets, towels, wash clothes, dirty cloth. They each have their own baskets in their bathroom for bathtime with their towels, cloths, lotions, soaps and toys. They will come in VERY handy for when we can use them to store their toys in when they become more active. They store GREAT in the bathroom closet and also a perfect fit on the changing table. They would also fit perfect under the crib.
