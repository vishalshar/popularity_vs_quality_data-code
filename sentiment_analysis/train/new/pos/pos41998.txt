When I nursed my oldest, I fell in love with the Gerber Nursing Pads. I found them comfortable & even the heavy absorbancy, which can hold A LOT, is thin, but did not leak. I was disappointed that I couldn't find this product in stores while I was pregnant with my youngest. Then I found them on Amazon.com! The light, medium, and heavy flow pads are all absorbent, thin, and comfortable. The ultra thin, however, are horrible! They leak, are uncomfortable, and are not as thin as the other nursing pads. Unless I wear an overly baggy shirt, they show through everything I wear. Since the variety pack contains 60 of the horrible nursing pads & only 40 of the GREAT ones, I would recommend purchasing the light, medium, or heavy flow seperately.
