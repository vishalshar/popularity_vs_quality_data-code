Great product, just a little pricy compared to the thinner mats.  Bought it b/c it was the thickest.  Spills seem to wipe off easily, as we do so immediately.  A dried spill would probably be a different story.Child doesn't crwal yet, but this mat will be more comfortable to crawl on vs the hard floors.  Don't know about the separate available borders another reviewer mentioned that is available.UPDATE Oct 2012) Had this product for one year. Got a second thick mat set to completely cover the hard wood floor between our sectional couch and wall mounted tv in the living room (coffee table removed for more unobstructed cushioned floor).  Mat has saved our child from many injuries as she began to walk and fall.  She once fell backwards from the couch, landing flat on her back, only with a surprised puzzled look of "what happend?"  (Yes, bad parents, but it happend so fast.)  After the fall from the couch, I can appreciate the this mat and reading an article that recommentds play mats to have a minimum thickness of 1/2 inch.Only slight complaint is that the mat leaves a slippery residue/film where it contacts our hard wood floor.  This is a nuasance, and will just require some thorough cleaning of the floor when the mat is no longer needed, and permanently removed in another year or two. I guess this film is a by product of the foam and the frequent pressures of our feet walking on the mat.  Even with this issue, I still give it 5 stars; a thinner mat would likely not have prevented injury from our child's backward fall from the couch.  A little Simple Green (or comparable safe degreaser), cotton cloth, and some gently "scrubbing," should take care of this slippery film.Thankful our child doesn't chew any section of the mat as another person experienced.  However, our child does like to remove squares, letters, and numbers; I guess the joys of parenting/toddlerhood.
