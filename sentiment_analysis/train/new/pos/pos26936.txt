If you're using Dr Brown's bottles, you already know it is a 5 part bottle, 6 if you count the bottle cap, which I use on every bottle, to keep the nipple clean after I assemble them for use.Not to mention part # 7 the bottle cap which I also use!So you can imagine cleaning one bottle after use means I'm drying 7 parts!  The rack itself is great, but definitely does not accommodate all of the parts I have to wash and dry! Still I don't think any other rack would have come close to what I need with the dr. brown's bottles.  Because there are so many parts, I honestly don't know what would be better!  (That's not my job!)  But I do wish there was a better organizational way of drying all the parts.  Because it serves its purpose I rate it 4 stars... because it does not take into account all the parts I have to dry. I take one star away.
