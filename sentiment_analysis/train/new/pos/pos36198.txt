Perhaps the newer versions have changed, but the outside trim is in dark blue now. In any case, I didn't have any issues with fabric bleeding. I did wash it in cold water, however (the label says to wash in 85 F water, which isn't cold, but I washed in cold water anyway to be safe)....An update - so I originally looked at the trim under dim lighting, and in brighter lighting it does indeed appear to be a deep, dark brownish color, not blue! However, two washes and it hasn't bled for me at all - I washed in cold water however, contrary to what the label says, which is to wash in warm water.
