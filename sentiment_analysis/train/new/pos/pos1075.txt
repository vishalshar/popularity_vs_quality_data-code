This camera is much cheaper than Summer Infant's price ($120). We bought the monitor and camera package for our newborn and decided we needed another camera for our toddler since the monitor can be connected to 4 cameras at one time. The camera is wonderful! I love the fact that I can follow my toddler around in her room when she gets out of bed (and is supposed to be asleep) and that you can zoom in. The night vision is great and you can clearly see everything. We're thinking of getting a third camera for the play room. The only caveat is that the monitor needs to be recharged regularly but other than that it's the best monitor/camera I've seen.
