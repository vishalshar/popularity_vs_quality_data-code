The beginning of February I was in my 6th month of pregnancy and started experiencing severe mid/low back pain (this is my 2nd pregnancy).  I tried chiropractic treatments, massage and even bought a new memory foam mattress topper in hopes of alleviating the pain with very little relief.  I then researched pregnancy pillows. With the first pregnancy I slept with a pillow between my knees for hip pain which I was also doing with my 2nd pregancy and tried sleeping with a pillow tucked under my belly for support with the one but it was so awkward and inconvenient when I had to switch sides while sleeping.  I bought the Boppy Cuddle Pillow from Amazon around mid to end of February and have been completely satisfied with the product!  My back pain has basically gone away! It's an all-in-one as far as having one end tucked between my knees while I sleep and the larger end tucked underneath my ever growing belly. It's very light weight so easy to maneuver in the middle of the night when I have to flip sides.  I love that it has a removable cover for washing and I even use it either in my lap or behind my head when I'm sitting upright reading in my bed.  I'm actually thinking of using it to replace the standard "horeshoe-shaped" Boppy pillow for breast feeding.  I would recommend this product to anyone with pregnancy related back pain!!
