Great little basket for either the upper or lower racks of the dishwasher!  It is marketed toward being used for baby battle nipples and sippy cup lids and the like, but it is also very useful for washing measuring spoons, small measuring utensils, metal turkey ties, reusable straws, etc.  It is a big capacity for multiple items.  Very glad I bought one!
