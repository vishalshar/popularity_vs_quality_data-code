I bought this when my little girl was about 6 months old. She began her love affair with it by first shaking it to make all of the shapes fall out of their designated places. As the courtship continued, she began carefully excising each shape with her fingers, rather than shaking them loose. (The orange circle emerged as the runaway favorite shape at this point.) Fast-forward another few months: little girl and Shape Barn are daily playmates. It's one of the first three go-to toys every morning for my now 16-month-old. She carries it around. She removes each shape one-by-one. She puts the shapes back where they belong. Then she turns them over upside down. Two of the barn doors have come off due to unauthorized standing, but that's no fault of the manufacturer, in my view.This was a fantastic purchase that has stood the test of time by amusing my little one through several developmental stages.
