I was waiting and waiting on purchase,.. reading the reviews on what wipes warmer is the best. Our baby was born in September, and I felt bad using cold wipes, so I held them in my hands for a while to warm up. I decided on cloth diapers and then it only made sense to get on with cloth wipes as well, so I had to find out if cloth wipes will fit through the opening, and if it will warm then all up. I can not speak of performance with the disposable wipes, never tried them, but I put 15 cloth wipes in there with water and solution and they stay nice and warm, just make sure you always push most of the wipe back in, to stay warm. I rinse the sponge with the vinegar everytime, don't want any mold in there. Con. is the opening tore, and we have only been using it for 2 months.I am a busy mom of 4 kiddos and homeschooling, so if you find my review helpful, please give it a thumbs up, so I am not wasting my time writing these :-)
