Happy that the kids say a prayer at night before going to bed.The main thing is that they were happy, 3 yr-old and 5 yr-old, 9 yr-old girl were estactic on Christmas Day, that grandma thought about them!The prayer was not the traditional "Lord's Prayer" that the bears recited.It was "Now, I lay me down to sleep...." type prayer that they could relate to.  I wanted them to learn the traditional prayer, however, any prayers coming from the bears mouth made it that much special. Yes I would recommend these items to friends and family.  Yes I would order one for myself.
