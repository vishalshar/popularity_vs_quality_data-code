After my first 2 children wore out my FP Aquarium Bouncer, I was in the market for a new seat for my 3rd child.  I looked at everything on the market, and decided on this bouncer.  The price is great and the chair is perfect for our needs.  No, it doesn't really bounce like our previous chair, but my other children never really bounced, so the rocking motion is fine.  I love the tool bar and the ease of being able to get the baby in and out.  The fabric is soft, and maybe not the greatest pattern, but again for the money I really don't care and neither does baby!  At such a great price, I highly recommend this item.
