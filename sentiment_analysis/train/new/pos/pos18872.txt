I used this potty for my 8 year-old and it worked for him so I took my chances to see if it would work for my 2 year-old. He loves it!! The ability to hear my voice congratulate him each time he potties makes him very encouraged and excited. For some reason there was confusion at some point during delivery, which caused me to wait longer than expected but Amazon was very kind and contacted the sender on my regard. The sender sent me the potty within a week and Amazon refunded my money for the inconvenience so it was all worth the wait. I would recommend the potty as well as the company. Professional and useful.! Good Luck Potty Training!
