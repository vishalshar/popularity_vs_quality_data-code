My daughter was done potty training a while back, so this review is long overdue. We actually tried several different toilet trainers and the Babybjorn worked out the best. We have two bathrooms with different size toilets! And this can be adjusted to fit each one perfectly. Also, the pee guard in front is much higher than the other trainers (sometimes my daughter's pee would leak out of the other ones). She was still able to sit on it by herself just fine, even with the higher pee guard on this model. We were so impressed with this toilet trainer, that we ended up purchasing two of them! This is one of those products that justifies the price - you get what you pay for. I highly recommend!!
