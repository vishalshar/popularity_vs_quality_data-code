I absolutely adore this little set. It is a lot smaller than I expected but once you put the food in it you realize it's just right. The two dipping bowls are only resting on the bowl so they come off very easily which is nice when you want to clean it but it's annoying when you pick it up or move it around. It's also quite the cleaning hazard as kids are drawn to it by it's adorable size and they can pick it right up and away flew anything that was in it. The spoon and the fork are a lot wider than other brands but turns out it perfectly avoids spills when going from plate to mouth. They also make it surprisingly easy to anything up. The bottom has a rubbery ring all the way around to supposedly stop it from sliding but it does NOT work. Overall, it's very inconvenient. You still have to hover if you don't want the plate to fly across the room, don't expect to use the dipping bowls much, and it is not microwave safe. It's cute and my daughter loves it so we use it every day but aside form the cuteness there's not much there.
