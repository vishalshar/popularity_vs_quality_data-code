I bought this crib two months ago for my nine month old. Thus far I like it very much. The color is true to the coffee feel and assembly was pretty easy (I could put together the frame, but needed my husband's help to get the bottom in). I always appreciate when folks do the pro/con list so here is mine:ProsBeautiful colorBeautiful shapeAll rounded edges*Sturdy and low to the groundConsDifficult to adjust mattress height (but maybe all cribs are like that?)Slats are far enough apart for baby to stick his legs through, for the first few nights getting used to it he would get his legs caught and scream bloody murder, but did not actually injure himself (just got scared), and no longer does it.*Low to the ground*I have a 29lb child so having the crib low is both a blessing and not great. I have to bend over to get him in and out, but when he starts trying to climb out/does climb out it is not far for him to fall, and if I choose to convert the crib to a toddler bed if he rolls out, again, it will not be that big of a deal. I am also not sure how annoying the lowness would be if you had this crib for your infant ...Overall I am a fan of this crib and so is my son.
