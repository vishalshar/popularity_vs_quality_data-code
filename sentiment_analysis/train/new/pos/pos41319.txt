This little elephant is really cute and sweet. Nice and soft. The colors are really nice and subdued. I thought the inside of the ears would be more pink, but I was pleasantly surprised..they are more of a taupe color, which I like! It is a nice size and will make a nice subtle addition to my daughter's nursery for her son. I was happy to get this. The first time it was sent out it didn't make it. I think part of my shipment box opened up along the way. Amazon was great about getting me a replacement quickly, no questions asked! Very efficient! Almost forgot to add..the size is prefect. Not too big, not too small. It is about 8 inches in length, so will sit up a bit smaller.
