love, love, love it!  and so does my 2 year old daughter :-)  It is completely organic and so it meets all my standards on what I would allow (when I can with in reason) my children to come in contact with.  It's organic AND adorable!  This does not happen very often.  I shopped for a while before I found something that was sweet and charming that was organic.  There are so many things out there that are organic but (in my opinion) was designed by someone with no taste or imagination.  So this was a real treat and hope more companys will get with it and make organic that is also desirable in the way the product looks and relates to children and mommys as well.
