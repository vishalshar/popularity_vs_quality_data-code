I really love this stroller and after having my child get sick in it at the airport, I love it even more for the fact that it can be washed fairly easily. Taking the cover off was a struggle, but at least it can be done! I kinda cringed at the price, but it is very well made. I bought the Maclaren drink holder separately that attaches on the side. Well worth it.
