I love the texture and color of my multi fold case.  It has held up well thus far and the color was true to the image I saw on Amazon.  I gave it 4 stars because it truly protects my galaxy tab 3 10.1 tablet and looks nice.  My only dilemma was the inside of the case being a lighter shade of gray. Maybe it should have been charcoal gray,  black or the same color as the outside to prevent the show of dirt or stains.  Other than that I love it.  Also,  it would have been nice to have a matching stylus with the cover as a complimentary gift.  Just a thought.
