We LOVE this LOVEY!!! We actually have two, we got our first one as a gift and our daughter LOVED it so much that we had to scour the internet to find a back up. One of the reason we love this particular lovey so much is because of the placement of the head. The head is placed in the corner so you can cover your child with the lovey as a (very tiny) blanket and the child can nuzzle the lamb head while they fall asleep. We started using this with our daughter at 2 months and no joke she has slept through the night every since. When she wakes up in the middle of the night we see her in the monitor nuzzle the the lamb and fall back asleep. She is now 17  months and still LOVES her "Lamby" we tried several other loveys with her but this is the one that we swear by! Writing this review reminded me how much we love this thing and I am going to go ahead and order several of them for some girlfriends that are pregnant!
