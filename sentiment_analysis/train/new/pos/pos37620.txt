This spoon is great because it's silicone, the tip is soft, it has the right length handle and it comes with a case.When you're starting out with solids, you'll likely only put a dab of purée on the spoon.  To that end it is great, the soft tip is great and the angled curve of the spoon "cup" is great to help scoop the food into the mouth of a baby that still has a bit of the tongue thrust reflex going on.  The soft edges help clean up a bit around the mouth.However, as soon as your baby gets better at eating and wants fuller spoonfuls, the spoon becomes less functional.  It won't hold a decent amount of purée, and if it's runny at all it'll fall off...not much makes it into baby's mouth at that point and so it's time to move on to another spoon fairly quickly.  If the edges were more cupped and not so flat, this would last longer (see picture).  Still a good spoon for starting out.
