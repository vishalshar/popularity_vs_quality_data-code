The Raiders teddy beard have eyepatches on them! The only thing I didn't like was the part that attaches the the crib was built too narrow to fit on my sons crib, but we just hung the mobile up to a plant hook into the ceiling and some fishing line to tether the mobile. This rig in my opinion works better because now my son is 2 1/2 and it is still above his crib, it it was attached to the crib it would have surely been ripped off by now.
