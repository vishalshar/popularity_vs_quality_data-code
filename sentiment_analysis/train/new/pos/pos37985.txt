With our new baby, and limited space for all the baby paraphernalia we need, I preferred to get a microwave sterilizer versus one of the steam appliances that would need counter space. I'm really happy with my choice. We have a standard size microwave, and this fits exactly (as in, it fits, but it is unable to spin freely inside on the turntable). It's very easy to use: easy to load items into it, easy to see how high to fill the water basin. I have not used this dishwasher insert because I have a separate bigger one I prefer to use, but the insert is very convenient for removing dry items to store in the cabinet before bagging them and taking them where I need them. The main reason I prefer this to a sterilizer bag (of which I do have a package of the Medela bags) is that if you stack the items properly, they can dry while in the sterilizer, but if you use a sterilizer bag, there's obviously no dry spot in the bag so you must unload it to allow items to dry. The way I use this box sterilizer is to wash items and load them, put it in the microwave, come back when it's done and pop the box on the counter and pop open the lid, leave the items to dry for awhile, and return to finish drying and packaging them for leaving the house. Very helpful!
