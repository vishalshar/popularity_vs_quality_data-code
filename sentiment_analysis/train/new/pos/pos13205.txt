I only buy CB cloth diapers. I love them. This set is my 6th set...i have a lot, haha! What was weird is, the box was untouched, unaltered, but the pads inside seemed to be just a tad different than others....not as plush or thick or something. I always wash them 5 or 6 times prior to use to get the absorbency corrected. It isnt a big deal, just weird as the box was not touched, everything inside had the ribbons on still. I would buy from the seller again if they had a different print :)
