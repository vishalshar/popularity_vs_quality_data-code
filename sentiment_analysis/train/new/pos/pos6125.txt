We've had a dekor plus since 2012 & have been very happy with it.  We went to order more of the plastic refill bags & spotted these.  We use disposable diapers & have been using these for a few months now.  Awesome that it comes with two!  We just dump the diapers into the trash & wash the bag when it's full.  It does just as good as the plastic for keeping the smell down.  We don't use the drawstring at all as the top of the bag fits onto the dekor tightly & stays on without it.  I actually didn't notice these aren't supposed to go in the dryer so ours have been many times now & I haven't noticed a side effect.  Oops.  Probably will just keep running them through the dryer, will update if it that becomes an issue.
