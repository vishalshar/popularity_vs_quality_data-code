I loved these towels for my first born, especially during his first year. They are super soft and also thin, almost like a swaddling blanket. Easier to wrap their little bodies in than a thicker, bulkier towel.I bought a few different types and brands of towels and these products are by far the best. They are more expensive but it is so worth it because they are much thicker and softer than the other brands. I would recommend this product and definitely buy again. This product illustrates the "get what you pay for" principle.Now, my daughter is 14 months and 31 inches, so these towels are pretty small, so I need to find a new and bigger one.
