Bought this to serve as a visual reminder for my kids not to run into the street. Also helps block balls from rolling away. We had someone install, they drilled holes & put concrete around the PVC pipes. If you have grass it would be easy to install, I imagine. I have a lot more peace of mind playing out front now.
