I've had three babies, and all of them are/were exclusively breastfed. When Baby #1 was six weeks old, we tried introducing a bottle so I could go back to school full-time. I didn't realize at the time what an ordeal it was going to turn into. We wasted so much money trying various brands of bottles before discovering the Adiri Natural Nurser at Target (this was in 2009), which yielded the best success by far compared to the others we tried. It was the only one he would latch to and eat from. Skipping Baby #2, who never took a bottle, to Baby #3 who is currently 3 months old, back in the same situation. This time, we tried giving him his first bottle at 3 weeks, thinking the key to success was younger age. Still, no luck. Since so many bottles had been put on the market since we struggled to get Baby #1 to accept one, we started going through some new brands and models, as well as some old standbys: Mimijumi. Avent. Comotomo. Tommee Tippee. Playtex. Dr Brown's. NOTHING WORKED. We put off buying more Adiri bottles because they weren't highly reviewed on Amazon (and were also $30/pair), and I was convinced one of the new types we tried would be the one. Silly, since when we finally did order Adiris again, our son happily latched to the bottle and killed 5 ounces of pumped breast milk in minutes. If we ever have another baby, I won't waste my time or money buying anything else.
