This is such a cute, gender neutral baby calendar to record all of your baby's important milestones during his first year.  I love how the pictures look embroidered on and each page has a cute animal on it. Every page picture size is a bit different, about 3 in or a bit smaller.  The questions on each page are exactly the same. What I did like about this calendar was that there was a picture spot for each month. That was really important to me so that you could watch your baby grow each month.  There is one page of stickers in the back that you can use, and then I just write down my own milestones that there are no stickers for.  I really like the genealogy chart at the beginning. The first birth month has a box for you to fill in all of the important baby info as well.  Overall, I really like this calendar.
