I can not post enough about how amazing Charlie Banana is.  I researched for MONTHS prior to cloth diapering, and after months found CB to be the best choice. I started with only CB, after a few months I wanted to try a couple other brands and add morre to my collection. Huge mistake. There is a reason I pay $20 a diaper instead of $6. You get what you pay for. Yes, the fleece does pill after time, but Im unaware of anything that doesnt pill or "wear" when its washed 5 times a week. The quality is outstanding. I probably have 35 or 40 diapers, all in different stages, as I purchase more over time...because Im addicted and doing 2 loads a day was wearing this new mom out. I did try bumgenius(the WORST) and the Alva(super cheap from china). I still have them only in case all 40 pairs of diapers are dirty. I literally hve NEVER had a leak or explosion. The worst that has happened is a super wet diaper that the fabric touched the onsie and absorbed a little pittle, no big deal, change the baby, change the onesie.
