When my son was little, my wife bought the orange creamsicle duck because he was supposed to be PVC free.  One day my little dude started calling him 'ballducky' and throwing him around the house, since he really is like a ball with a head.  As always, my little boy is a baby genius.Alas, there is a little bottom panel on the orange duck, and it started coming loose, and, yes, it was moldy in there.  But Ballducky had become part of our family, as had my little dude's baby sister, who came online before he turned three.  So we bought the four duck set to be shared by the two of them, who think group baths are about the best thing ever.They ducks are still a hit.  My boy has names for them:  The creamsicle replacement is called Ballducky, the yellow one is Duderick, and the blue one is Tom.  The red on has a name that doesn't translate into written language.
