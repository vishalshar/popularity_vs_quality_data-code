We like this cover very much, as opposed to the bag-type that you slip the baby into.  There's no material between the baby and the car seat, ensuring that you can fasten the straps exactly as the manufacturer intended.  (We call it the showercap or raincap style.)  One thing I wished was different is that the face hole is a little small/low for our child.  He's a taller boy (97th percentile,) and as a result, the hole doesn't line up as well with his face, and half the time he's peeking at the lid.  To get him in, we have to put his head in, and then slid him up the back of the seat and then make sure his legs are placed in.  If the opening were bigger, I would give this 5 stars.  We especially like the fact that we're not clutching blankets and can close the flap from the house to the car.*EDIT*We've used this for the winter, and I have to say how much I appreciate not wrestling an infant with a winter jacket.  We would reach in to pick our son out of the car seat, and it was noticeably warmer inside the cocoon this made.  I have washed it twice, regular cycle, and it has come out clean and in perfect shape afterward.  I am very happy with this purchase after using it for the season.
