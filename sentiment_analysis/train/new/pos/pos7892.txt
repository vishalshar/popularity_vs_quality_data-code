I read all the reviews and then still bought this stroller. I dont understand why people are having problems. It took about 60 seconds to put together out of the box. When I first tried to move it. The wheels stuck and it wouldnt turn - Then I noticed each wheel has a wheel lock, once I unlocked the wheels (flick of a switch). The stroller was extremely easy to push and maneuver - even with one hand. The basket is able to hold my similac diaper bag, purse and a small shopping bag. The recline is easy to move up and down to whatever level you like. The table and cup holder are an added bonus. The best part of course is that it is so light weight. We got the Rose which is beautiful and the Rubino was also very attractive at the store. Great for the  price - we paid $119.
