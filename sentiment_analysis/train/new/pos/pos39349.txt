I love the Aden and Anais and Anais swaddles, but I was bored with the limited colors and patterns available, so I took a shot with these and love them just as much, if not more (they're both pretty comparable in every way-- these aren't like the silky "boutique" Aden and Anais swaddles-- but I think the Little Linen Company has cuter patterns).I use them everyday for a car seat blanket, burp cloth, etc. My daughter, 4 months, seems to be attracted to the colors and patterns more than the other swaddles I have (may just be coincidence) and I like to make little "tents" with them that filter light through (don't freak out- I supervise the entire time)...she loves it.I'm buying more for myself and would definitely give these as a shower gift.
