My son has very sensitive skin.  I was using Parents Choice wipes (because they were cheap) and realized they were making his skin issues worse.  I use Huggies diapers because they work great, and decided to spend a bit more on wipes and buy the Huggies Natural Care Hypoallergenic wipes.  I LOVE them.  The wipes are pretty thick, ( I didn't realize how thin the Parents Choice wipes were, until I only had to use one Huggies wipe where I would have needed to use two Parents Choice wipes) the Huggies wipes worked incredibly well with my sons sensitive skin.  The box of wipes came with 4 refill packets, a wipe dispenser, and an AMAZING on the go wipe dispenser.  The on the go wipe dispenser is my favorite, it's small and flexible, super easy to refill, and keeps wipes nice and wet.  I highly recommend these wipes.
