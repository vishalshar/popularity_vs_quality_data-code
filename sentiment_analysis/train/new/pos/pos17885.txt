I'll start with saying a ring sling doesn't suit every mom (or dad) & baby duo. Many fabric carriers take some time getting used to, which makes it easy to give up on. We've had this sling about 3 days and I've put my son in it at least once a day. Each day we both get better at it!I love this sling because it is simple. A ring sling in its most raw form - one simple piece of fabric. No extra padding, elastic, or specific shaping. The fabric is very thin and breathable, which was a necessity for us in Hawaii. Taking it on and off is quick and adjusting it is easy, but just takes some practice. The price is higher, but you definitely pay for the quality fabric of this sling. I had been using a Moby wrap for the first 6 weeks of my son's life, but it became too hot for us. Also, as much as I tried, I couldn't get the hang of nursing in the Moby and that is something I really wanted in a carrier. I nursed in this sling - easily - the first day we had it!I gave this sling 4 stars because I like it, BUT I think I would like their double layered slings better. Overall I'm super satisfied with this purchase though! The few days it has taken to get good at using this sling has been worth the effort. Having my son close is great for both of us!UPDATE - 11/19/13My son turned 8 months today and I will say since I bought this sling I have become an addict. I have purchased two more! One used double layer silk and one new double layer linen. The double layer definitely works better for us since my son has grown so fast and the single layer seems a bit unsupportive for his weight now (he is 24 lbs). But we love them all. I love carrying my son around and it's so easy to drop him into the sling. I'm lucky enough to not have it hurt my back either, making it easier to love!
