I like these okay. This is one of those items that you just have to understand what you're getting. They are plastic, which I don't like. They are poorly engineered, in that the inner pieces do not fit properly inside the outer pieces; when the inner pieces are placed inside the outer pieces, there is literally a space of several millimeters all the way around. Because of these issues, I would have preferred a metal set. However, this set is much more affordable. Had I not known what to expect from the product, I would have rated these much lower, but for many of us, this set is a nice alternative to the pricey metal ones.I bought these for my 3 year old daughter, and they suit our purpose of preparing her for handwriting. She enjoys them, and she's building up those handwriting muscles while she uses them. She has also gained more control over the pencil since we got them. The first couple of times, her tracing was so erratic that I could barely tell which shape she'd traced, but her tracing has improved very quickly through using these. I highly recommend these if you have a toddler and a limited budget.
