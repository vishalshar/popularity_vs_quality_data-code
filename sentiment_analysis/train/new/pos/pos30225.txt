I LOVE this.  We have been using it since before our daughter could sit unassisted but it works great with the belt buckled to help her sit up.  When she was really little (12-14 pounds) we'd use a baby blanket behind and around her to fill up some of the extra space in the chair.  She loves sitting at the table like a part of the family.  We have taken it to restaurants and it has worked great every time and we've gotten lots of compliments on it.  We originally got a Chicco which didn't fit on our table because of the really long arms.  Also the Chicco is quite a bit bigger and she was just lost in it.  Also looked at the Phil and Ted's version but it is a lot more expensive and won't fit on any table or counter with any sort of "lip" or skirting.  This one fits on every table we've ever tried it on.  Also we love the machine washable feature!  Almost didn't get it because I saw a lot of negative reviews about how hard and time-consuming to mount it on the table it is and this just isn't true.  Simple, quick and easy to put on any table and very easily portable.  Perfect for our small house and great because there's nothing keeping her away from being right at the table with us.  I would buy this again and consider it to be one of the few "must-have's".  Totally recommend this to everybody!!
