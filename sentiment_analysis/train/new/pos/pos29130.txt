My son uses this as a blankie to suck his thumb.  The first one was purchased as a gift but as he grew more attached, I purchased another for daycare & another for when the first needed to be washed.  He doesn't used it to chew on but to rub on his face when he sucks his thumb.  He's been using them for about 6 months & after repeated washings, they are all holding up great!
