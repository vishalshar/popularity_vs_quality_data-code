Overall, great purchase. Just wish I would've bought one that didn't go to the floor. Hit my toes all the time. Only plus side to that is that there won't be junk piling under the crib (shares room with 5y old).Was worried my large baby wouldn't fit in it for long. I think she will! Here's a pic of her in the crib (she's wearing 12mo clothes here). Also, I purchased the Davinci 50 coil mattress that people purchased with this crib. Babyletto sheets fit great!
