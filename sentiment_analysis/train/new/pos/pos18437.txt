I saw a previous reviewer say this was pretty thin, which was what I was looking for. It's made of fleece but a thinner fleece (kind of like the thinner fleece blankets). We live in California so the other fleece sleepsacks made our LO wake up in the middle of the night sweating. This is perfect for the cooler months (spring and fall) but still too warm for the hotter summer months. If you're looking for a thinner fleece that is a bit thinner than the Carter fleece sleepsacks, this will work.
