Buy it! You won't regret it! At first I was a little concerned about purchasing this bottle because of the lack of reviews on it. (I always read the reviews on products, and usually they're right on... but what about the products with only a few reviews?) Well, this is my 6 month old son's new most favorite sippy!! the nipple moves around easily so that no matter how he holds it, her can find the right spot to drink. Also, the handles connect on the bottom, which makes filling/re-filling it up a lot easier ( no handles to get in the way of screwing on the cap). In addition, the smaller size of the cup make it lighter and easier for him to learn how to hold it himself, and allows him to more easily put the nipple in his mouth. I will be buying more!
