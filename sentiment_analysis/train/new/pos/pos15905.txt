Great product to take on the go with a baby. Definitely plan ahead because it does take time (a good 25-45 minutes) to properly warm the milk depending on how cold it is to start with.  Love the freedom it gives us to go out and about...and love that it is a 2 pack. Easy to "reset" the warmer back to its normal state by boiling in water. Very happy with this product!
