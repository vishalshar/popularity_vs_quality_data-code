We have at least 5 different potty seats to train our 2 year old boy, including Mommy's Helper Cushie Step Up which is found in many big box stores.  This product is fantastic and better than all of those others for in-home use.  Obviously, this is not something you would be able to carry around town in a bag.1. It's stable as a ladder, and not as easy as the Mommy Helper version for the kid to force the ladder legs to swing up when sitting on it2. It has a nice "catcher rim" to help make sure the boy's business stays in the potty3. There is a downward facing rim inside the toilet seat that makes it so that all dribble goes straight from this product into the bowl.  We have a problem with the Mommy's Helper where our son will pee right between the toilet and the toilet seat sometimes making a mess.  That can't happen with this product4. The size of the hole for his tush is about right5. It's easy to move out of the way if I need to use the toilet6. Our son can get up and down by himselfI only wished I had purchased this before buying some other brands.
