First of all it's so easy to clean, even if you don't get to it right after meal time. We pretty much just wash it with the rest of the dishes and hang it to dry. It dries in about an hour, so fast! We have other bibs but they've just sat in the drawer since we bought this one.This bib is awesome because it looks good and is the only one you'll ever need for the first year at least.One note that may put some people off is that it's on the smaller side. It comes down to where our baby's tray is, no further.
