Why didn't I get one of these when my first kid was little? I am a certified germaphobe. The thought of putting my little guy in a shopping cart seat that other kids and leaky meat packages had been in grossed me out completely. Even with wiping it down with a disinfectant wipe. Plus, I didn't have the time or ability to wipe the cart properly when I went shopping alone with my son. He was a ticking time bomb when he was that young. Never knew which end would need attention with a moment's notice. I felt like Jack Bauer every time we left the house. This cart cover fit every shopping cart I put it into. Very simple and fast to get on and off the cart. Folds up to keep in the trunk organizer of the car or diaper bag. I washed it in the machine and hung it to dry. It never ripped, faded, shrank, or puckered. The material stayed soft. The brown and blue colors are exactly as pictured.
