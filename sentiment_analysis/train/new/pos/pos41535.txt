I saw this toy before I was pregnant and though it was so cute!So after I had my daughter, I had the best excuse to buy it!!!She loves it.  I bought it for her when she was about 3 months old.  She'd chew on the little clam.  Now she uses it to learn that they make noise, and she can put them in and take them out of the bowl.It's worth the money.  Cute, educational, (quiet.. heh), and durable.
