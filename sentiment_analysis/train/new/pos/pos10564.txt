Love this carseat. It has great safety ratings and is made by a great company. Britax is a little bit pricey but worth every penny. SO easy to install with the LATCH system or the seatbelt.  Very comfortable for my child who uses it. Very easy to buckle children in. Also, love that you do not have to re-thread the harness straps when you want to adjust the height. It has a lever you push on and can just adjust the height of the straps. Cupholders are great for cups, bottles, or small toys. Overall, I am so pleased with the purchase that we bought another for a different car. Love that this can grow with our child.
