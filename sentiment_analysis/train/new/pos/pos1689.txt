This was great and we can now use our monitor again. We went through a bout where it seemed it was the battery but when we replaced it, we noticed that when you moved the cord it would lose charging. We started wiggling it to get it to work but it just stopped completely. We ordered this as a last ditch to save the monitor and it worked like a charm. It charges the new battery and we can now watch our son on the monitor. We had the monitor for just under a year before all this chaos happened with it. Now he is a year and we can keep an eye on him in the crib. Crucial at this age since he can get into more trouble!
