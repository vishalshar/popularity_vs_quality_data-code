It's always great to have a spare set of parts. Also, if you ever lend your pump out, you can just have your lendee purchase this set as well as an extra set of bottles. The parts do need replacing eventually. I pumped 6-8 times a day for 6 months and gradually tapered down as my son got better at nursing, and if I had pumped that frequently for longer, I would have needed another set. This lasts a good 6-8 months, I'd say.
