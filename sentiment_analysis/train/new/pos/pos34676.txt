I know "love" is a strong word, but I really love our Maclaren Easy Traveller. We purchased the Graco travel system for our baby, and it really is awesome with the full size stroller and the great car seat. However, we travel quite a bit (once a month through the airport) and the Graco stroller is not travel-friendly. The Maclaren Easy Traveller is a breeze to take through security checks. It wraps up like an umbrella stroller, and opens up easily. The car seat locks in without problems.If your baby is not at the point of sitting up on his/her own, and you know you'll be using the carseat for quite some time, it just makes sense to have an Easy Traveller.Several other notes: We didn't connect the cup holder, so it's easier for us to use, plus I like the benefit of not having anything in between me and the baby. He feels "closer". Also, the basket was able to hold quite a bit of stuff on a recent shopping trip. It has easy access from the front, but a little tougher to get big things in from the back. I was concerned that the wheels didn't look sturdy enough, but Maclaren knows what they're doing. This thing has held up through gravel.We strongly recommend the Maclaren easy traveller.
