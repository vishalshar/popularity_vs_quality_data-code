What a great idea this is and how handy it's come in many times at home and on the road! We had some problems with this at first with my 2-year-old daughter being strong enough to tear off whatever it was we were using for a bib.  Paper napkins were especially vulnerable but she was able to rip off cloth ones too.  However, once she figured out that messing around with it was only delaying mealtime she stopped.  We purchased this 2 months ago and have gotten so much use out of it already.  It's really nice not having to wash bibs all the time or chance her spilling food on her clothes.  I am glad I bought 2 because my son is due any day now and I'll be using it with him too!
