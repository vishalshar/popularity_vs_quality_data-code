I bought this bag after my second son was born. Our last diaper bag was to worn and some of the zippers weren't staying closed. This bag has snaps which I like better. Plus I like that I can wear this more than one way, across the front or over the shoulder. I cloth diaper and find that I can fit all of my sons diapers (about 4), extra clothes, burp cloths, and toys for my younger son and still fit extra clothes, a couple diapers, plus snacks and a water bottle for my older son. It is much more spacious than I first thought and I love all the little pockets it has to fit small items like my keys, wallet, lip gloss, and phone. I love how cute it is and that I don't have to carry a purse along with the diaper bag. It was great for travel when we took a vacation recently and It doesn't take up a lot of space in the car. Very handy diaper bag.
