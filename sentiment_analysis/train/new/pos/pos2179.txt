Great product for the price! I was pleasantly surprised to find out the 3 smaller bins fit perfectly into the hanging organizer, should be great for all the tiny items that go along with having a baby. Although the clothing dividers are blank, you could easily writ eon them with permanent marker or add decals to customize them. I think the hangers will come in very handy for all the delicate dresses and sleeveless summer items our little lady will have. The large bins are a great size and stack well, should be great to store outgrown items until they are ready to be stored long-term. I'm a sucker for organizing items and I think these are going to be amazing in our nursery.
