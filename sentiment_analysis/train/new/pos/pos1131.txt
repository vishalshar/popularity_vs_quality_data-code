I will start out by being straight forward with this review. I don't have a baby. I am incontinent and it was purchased for my personal use. I haven't had a single diaper rash since I started using this cream. Why did I buy a product targeted at babies? Well, if you compare the adult diaper rash creams and baby diaper rash creams, they have the same exact ingredients. Also, I have issues with dry skin on my elbows and this even helps that. It hydrates and protects skin no matter where it is. Also, baby diaper rash creams tend to smell better than the adult ones.
