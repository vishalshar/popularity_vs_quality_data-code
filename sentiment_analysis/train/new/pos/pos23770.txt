I'm a huge fan of Playtex anything. Tampons, Sippy Cups, Nursing Supplies, Bras...Playtex is a great brand that has been around since my mom fed me the original nursers with the flat cylindrical nipples that were latex. Anyways because they are such a known brand I wanted to try these bottles for the new baby on the way. I love how they also sell variety pack nipples to try with these bottles so if baby doesn't like one they don't have to change the whole bottle system and can try different shapes and flow rates. These ones are especially great because they are one of the only bottles I have seen that fit up to 6 ounces. I know you can just buy the 8 or 9 ounce bottles, but when your little one is only taking 2-6 ounces at a time why add more air into their little tummies than you already have. These bottles are very sturdy and seem to work great for venting the air bubble without leaking. Haven't tried them yet but my only negative is that they are kind of bulky and take up a little more space than I would have like. They are probably on the lower priced end for bottles but not too cheap I would be concerned they aren't quality. Excited to see how the little one likes these!Edit: Our little ones favorite bottles! Baby loves these and Dr Browns and they seem to be the only two brands she doesn't choke on. The slow flow is truly slow flow. The pieces, although more than a standard bottle, are super easy to clean. You can hear the venting system working. The price is right. Easy to find at the local Walmart or Target. These are our favorite!
