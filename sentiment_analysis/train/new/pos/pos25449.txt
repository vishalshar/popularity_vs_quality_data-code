I LOVE this bag!  Lots of pockets and storage space.  I carry A LOT with five kiddos and feel like this really does the job.  It doesn't feel too heavy even when loaded down.  I love the outside pockets, I use them for hand sanitizers, my phone, lipstick, tissues, keys.  They really hold a lot.  I used them once for a sippy cup but prefer to keep that inside the bag now.  The changing pad is lightweight but large enough baby at 8 months still stays completely on the pad.  The only thing is when this bag is loaded at all,the top strap that hangs over the top with the circle does not go over the bag so it just hangs there, unable to close.  I'm not sure why they designed it this way, its odd and unusable.  But I love the hobo style and I love the stroller straps.  It's a big bag without being HUGE.  I can tend to overpack so this helps me keep it more reasonable.  I really love the pewter because I feel like it matches all my clothing whether I'm wearing black, white, brown, summer, winter, whatever! :)
