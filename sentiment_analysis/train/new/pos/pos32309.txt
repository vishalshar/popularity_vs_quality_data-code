These are cute (we like to mix and match the cup and lid colors), handy for transporting all sorts of snacks and meals, with tight, screw-on lids. And very inexpensive for a "green" product. We have been using them every day to send food to day care for my daughter or take snacks in the car. They last longer if not put in the dishwasher, so we wash them by hand. After a few months, the blue ones seem to get a little discolored on the inside, but the others still seem fine. The plastic gets a bit brittle after many uses and washings, and so a couple of the older ones have cracked when dropped and had to be replaced. In all, we bought 3 packs of these when we started solid foods, and we still have 8 or 9 left in good shape that we continue to use regularly after 7-8 months.
