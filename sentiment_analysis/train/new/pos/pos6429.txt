These were a great hit at my friend's baby shower! The guests loved filling them out and my friend loved reading all the responses! The consistency is sort of like cardstock, so they are sturdy. I bought a box of thin-tipped Sharpies for people to use in filling them out, but some people also used ballpoint pens and those seemed to work just fine. The back of the card is a solid white and could be used for writing an additional personal message. Such a lovely item!
