I bought this waist extension so that my husband could also wear the Ergo and carry our daughter. He is very tall and broad and it practically crushed out little girl to be worn on him without this extension. It works very well for that and he can now wear the Ergo and both him and our daughter are more comfortable! YAY! But there was also an unexpected result which *I* found to be wonderful!  I have been searching and searching for a way to make the belt strap more comfortable for a long time with no luck. I can wear the Ergo just fine (meaning without the extension it fits) but the belt strap would curl and become a pressure point in either my back if front carrying or my stomach if backpack carrying. I was getting very frustrated about that and almost stopped using it altogether. When you put this extension on the belt strap however, because of the way it buckles right onto the preexisting buckle, there is now an extra buckle almost right in the middle of the strap when I wear it. This buckle stops the strap from curling and it feels sooo much better! I would recommend getting this, even if you don't *need* it but are having comfort issues with the original strap!
