I bought these at Target one day and am back on Amazon to get more. My 14 month old loves these cups. She always has one available to her with water in it and will drink a great deal during the day because of these cups. They're really easy for her to use and I don't have any problem taking them apart to clean them. We've never had any problem with them leaking, either. We also have the Nuby straw cups and my little one hates those. Many thanks to Tommee Tippee for making such a great straw cup for my daughter!
