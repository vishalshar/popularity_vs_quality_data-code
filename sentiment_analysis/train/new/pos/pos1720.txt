I think with all crib skirts, it depends on the crib as to whether or not it will fit. This skirt fit our babyletto hudson crib well. It's true that the slits probably shouldn't be at the corners because that's not how mattresses are mounted in cribs, but most crib skirts seem to be designed that way. Even so, we were able to make this one fit. We are much happier with this one than a previous skirt we tried that was way too long.
