I had the original cup holder and hated it.  It popped off the stroller and I didn't even know it until my older daughter asked me where it was.  Well that was the easy way of getting rid of it.  I knew I needed a new one and did not want to buy the original so I held out because I heard that UB was designing a new version.  When the new version came out I bought it right away.  I have to say that the quality is 1000 times better then the original.  The problem I have is that placing it on the outside of the stroller is not comfortable when trying to get through spaces.  I thought that by installing it on the inside of the bar I wouldn't have these problems so that is what I did.  Now it does not get in the way and I have no worries.  The only issue is that it isn't 100% sturdy but since I know it wasn't designed that way I can't fault UB for that.  I made it work for me so hopefully this will help others and make it work for them.  I hope UB takes this into account when designing their next cupholder and design it for inside bar use.
