I really like the size of these forks and spoons. They're best suited for bare-beginner eaters, under a year, but I fully admit that I'm holding onto them because when my 18 month old uses them, she makes a slightly smaller mess than usual. ;) The bowl fits in her mouth very well and holds just enough to be a satisfying without making a huge mess. The fork is more spoon- or spork-like, no pointy bits, but it also works well in little hands.The utensils are proportioned small. The handles are the right size for a small hand so they aren't long enough for feeding from a distance (i.e. spoon-feeding by an adult).Plus, they're made in the USA out of recycled milk jugs!
