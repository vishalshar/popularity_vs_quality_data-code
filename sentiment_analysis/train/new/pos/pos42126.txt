This has been the most wonderful piece of equipment for our 12 month-old daughter!  We got it for her at 9 months old, when she outgrew her beloved Jumperoo (another fantastic piece of equipment), but she was still needing something that could keep her upright.  She, like her two brothers before her, will probably be a "late" walker.  Even at 12 months, she is not showing much interest in walking on her own, so this little walker is perfect for her.  Our daughter is 31 inches tall, and the tallest height setting is just right for her, with room to spare.  She can really zip around in this thing, going on wood/tile floors as well as carpet (we did not install the stair stops on the bottom of the walker so that it would be easier for her to get over the doorway thresholds).  She can easily move this walker in all directions and navigate through tight spaces.  The fun activities on the play tray are an added bonus, and they keep our daughter, as well as her two older brothers, entertained.  This walker easily folds flat, so we take it everywhere with us.  As an example, here is a video of our 12 month-old cruising around the halls of a hotel we recently stayed in.By the way, we started out with the Combi GT car walker, instead of this one, and it was a big mistake!  That thing was twice the price, and bigger and heavier than the Chicco walker.  Our daughter could not make it go forward...it was so heavy and bulky that she could only make it go backward.  It was very frustrating for her.  I'm so glad we sold that one and got the Chicco instead!
