We were having a terrible time keeping our toddler out of the fridge. He would go in, open drawers, and then leave the door open. It was a perfect game for our little boy.Man, was he mad when he discovered we added one of these locks. It seems to be holding up well so far to the tantrums and angry pulling, as he rages against the machine...door.
