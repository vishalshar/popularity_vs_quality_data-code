We purchased this bike for our 18 month old but he didn't initially like it.  He's now two and LOVES IT.  It does seem small, and that probably comes from what we as adults are told (that our knees must be at a 90 degree angle when pedaling a bike), but don't let the stance your toddler takes when riding it deter you.  This bike really works.  My son has learned how to tuck his feet under when pushing himself along and he even holds his feet up when he's coasting.  He takes turns like a pro.  He gets to rolling very fast and I almost think I need to get him a helmet!  It's pretty hard for him to tip over but I have seen it happen.  For size comparisons, our son is a big boy at 24 months, about 34" tall and 31 lbs.  Our four year old neighbor always tries to ride it too.  It's a huge hit with every kid who comes over, no matter the age.  Very easy to fold and slide under our Britax B-Agile stroller for trips to the park or into a shoulder tote bag!
