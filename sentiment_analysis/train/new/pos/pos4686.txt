I didnt realize this was not all one piece.  The inside stainless cup comes out--I guess for easy washing--which is fine, I suppose.  I was hoping for a painted stainless mug, or maybe something coated with latex or rubber or something.  I guess I just didn't read the description fully.  The orange part is actually just plastic.
