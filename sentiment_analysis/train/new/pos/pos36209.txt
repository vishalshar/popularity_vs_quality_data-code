The chevron striped side is a bit see through. We inherited a pink pattered boppy and you can still see the pattern a little bit. It's not a huge deal, because the baby doesn't care and it isn't a decorative item meant to "pull a room together," but I just wanted to make a note of it. Otherwise, it's fine and I have no complaints. (Disclaimer: baby has not arrived so I don't know how it is operationally!)
