This is the cutest little lovey. I first received it from an aunt when my son was 3 months old. I started putting it next to him in bed when he was around 5 months old. After a week or so it became his security object. This is now his most treasured lovey. He fingers the ears and carries it everywhere and often times suckles the hooves. All you have to do is show him the Lamby and he starts sucking his thumb. I didn't even know it was called "wee Lamby" until he threw it out of the buggy at the doctors office and I got home to realize it was gone. In a panic I searched Google until I found a picture of this one and blessedly it was available on prime!!  I ordered this new one and it was the same Lamby so now we have two in case the worst happens and one is lost. A baby can never be without Wee Lamby!! As I'm writing this he just toddled over to me sucking his thumb and holding the Lamby indicating he wants to nap.
