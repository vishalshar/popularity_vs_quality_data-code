We've used all the Evenflo nipples from slow to fast and my daughter did great with all of them.  This one is no exception.  If you are using the medium and your baby is collapsing the nipple, it is time to switch and they will do great with this.  We switched too early at first and my baby wouldn't use it, either.  We waited a month or two and when she was having difficulty using the medium, we switched.No complaints.I've ordered two packs at a time and I've gotten ones with Xs and ones with larger holes.  Both are great.  She uses them both without issue.
