Yes, this is mesh, yes, they don't make light weight cotton sleepsacks at this stage which is too bad. But for what it is, it's perfect.Things to Know:The other reviewers aren't kidding when they say this thing is BIG. Unlike all the other night time clothing you're used to getting, this runs true to size if not a little bit larger. If your child is not both in the correct weight and height category for this item, order a size down.Happily, if you do what I did and not listen to this good advice, the Amazon return policy is wonderful and incredibly easy.Also, here's a tip if it's borderline too big for your child - use socks on the outside of the sleepsack to hold the little leg openings in place. If there's a bunch of loose fabric hanging between the legs you're kind of out of luck but if your main issue is the feet slipping back into the sleepsack - use socks.
