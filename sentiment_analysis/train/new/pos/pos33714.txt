This product is comfortable to use. Not to mention,  I believe that it feels more like my baby than any other pump I've used including medela,  therefore making pumping easier and more enjoyable.  Also since it mimics babu so well I think it helps with production.  The only thing I could suggest to make this product better would be to make it in a double electronic pump.
