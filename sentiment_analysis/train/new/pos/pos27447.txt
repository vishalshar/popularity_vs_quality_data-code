I ordered both, Zippy and MatiMati Matimati Baby Bandana Drool Bibs with Snaps for Boys | 4-Pack Absorbent Cotton | Unique Baby Gift SetAt first sight, they look quite similar but upon closer look you notice that- Zippy is smaller (when one lays on top of another, MatiMati is about an inch bigger in every dimension)- Matimati is softer- prints on Zippy can be felt as rough, somewhat scratchy, paint (particularly on the one with stars), while on the prints on Matimati are soft- when washed and dried (normal setting), the lower corner on Zippy rolls upward a bit, probably because the fabric shrinks. Matimati does not have that problem.So if I order another set of bandana bibs, I will go with a more expensive Matimati.But if you are on a budget, zippy is still quite nice, just not the best on the market.UPDATE: Zippy turned out more durable. After about 1.5 months, mati mati bibs started to get yellow in the middle, while zippies still look like new and with time got nice and soft. So go for the zippies! Will try to attach a picture too.
