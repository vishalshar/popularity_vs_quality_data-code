I looked at a lot of video monitors online and after much comparison, I went for this one.  I couldn't justify paying 200-300 for a baby monitor with all of the other stuff that you need with a new baby on the way.  So far, it works well but only about a week old for me. The features are easy to use.Has:Night Vision seems to work well (actual night vision with infrared - not just shining LED's on the baby)Color ScreenGood range with 2.4GHz (although I haven't pushed it yet in a smaller house)Rechargeable battery (although I was up in the air about this because they eventually go out and cost much more to replace)Ability to turn LCD off but maintain audionightlight (but i don't see ever using it - especially because I will have to use the wall mount to see over the crib and the on/off is under the camera base of the camera)Doesn't have:Batteries for the Camera (I thought it did but I looked at a lot of them before going with this one so surely my oversight but I thought that would be nice for freedom of movement)Screen saver - I was hoping the monitor screen would have auto shutoff but it is on or off only.So far I like it for the value but my little one isn't even hear yet so I am really hoping for longevity!  We'll see...but so far it seems like a good buy for features vs. cost.
