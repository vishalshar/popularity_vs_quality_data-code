I LOVE IT! To be honest, I haven't even used it yet (or baby hasn't used it yet) but this is the only mattress that had everything I was looking for. With my first child on the way, I'm researching everything (probably too much) but this is the only mattress that had the materials, amount of coils, etc... I was looking for.
