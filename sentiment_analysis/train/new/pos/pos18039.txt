These outlet plugs work very well. After our baby started crawling around the inevitable scramble to start baby proofing everything began. As I was searching for plug covers I read a lot of reviews of various brands and types. For all of my research and reading, it turns out that everyone has a different experience with these things even with the same brands being compared. It seems like there are a few factors that will determine how well these work for a given home. The main factor seems to be the age of the home and thus the age of the outlets in the home. Most people may not realize but outlets can wear out over time. This leads to loose plug connections and apparently a lot of complaints about plug covers not fitting well. If your outlets aren’t too old, say under ten years, you really shouldn’t have any issues with these being loose or not fitting well. If your outlets are pretty old or really heavily used and worn, then you might have some issues with loose connections and loose plug covers.My experience with these covers has been great. Our house is about 8 years old and our outlets are in pretty good shape. We are currently using these all over the house in the outlets that are within our sons reach and we’re very satisfied with them. They fit very snugly into the outlets and our son has not been able to pull any of them out. This is great because as he learns that he can’t get them out he moves onto something more fun and entertaining for him. For us, the parents, we’re able to remove them pretty easily when we need to and have had no issues with them getting stuck or jammed. I would recommend these to anyone. But, if you find them to be loose I would examine your outlets. If your outlets are worn, consider replacing them or returning these and try a different brand/style before leaving a negative review. It may be your outlets.Thanks for reading. I hope this was helpful. If so, please consider clicking the "yes" button below. Thank You!
