My kids bounce around under the kitchen counter. After a few bumped heads... I started looking for something to cover the corners and found this. I also got the long pieces for the front.I installed mine upside down. I don't need cushion on the top portion of the counter. I needed it on the bottom. Two months later and they're still holding! I'm constantly reminding my kids not to pull them off-- so yes... I'd say it's sticking on pretty well! They're held on with 3M tape... so if it does fall off, we do have backup.They look pretty ugly! But they're keeping my kids heads safe! (... from the counter anyway).
