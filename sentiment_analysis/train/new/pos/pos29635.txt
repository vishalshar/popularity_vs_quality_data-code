I have 4 children and right now a total of 5 teeth brushers in my house. That means there are 5 toothbrushes to get mixed up and confused.  We usually buy our toothbrushes in bulk. They come in 10-12 per pack and a random smattering of colors. Usually there are not enough unique colors for every brusher to have a different color. There are few things that gross me out more than using someone else's toothbrush!This simple genius product solves that problem! It is dishwasher safe, super strong and stretchy. It fits over our regular adult toothbrushes as well as over a baby toothbrush.On the back, there is a space to write your name. The site suggests using ball point pens. I tried with a pen and a permanent marker and both rubbed off in seconds. However, I think that having a name on it is just an extra thing. The point is being able to quickly and easily spot your toothbrush out of a bunch of them! And this product definitely takes care of that! It is a very well made product that is dishwasher safe and should be the only one you have to buy! One thing I do wish is that they came in more colors. I like the colors offered but it would be fun if they had stripes or hearts or even glittery ones! This sort of limits it to families of 6.
