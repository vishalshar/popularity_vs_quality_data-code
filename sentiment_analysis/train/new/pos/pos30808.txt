I had bought 3 teethers off of Amazon to try with my little one.  This was my favorite!  Great toy and teether all in one.  This was the first of the 3 teethers I gave my 6 month old.  He got excited at the sight of it, really excited when I twisted it and it made a mechanical type of noise.  He was just so excited he started breathing really fast through his mouth, smiled and started laughing.  He just stared at it when I tried to hand it to him because he was just overwhelmed with excitement like he couldn't believe it was all his.  He finally grabbed it and stuck it in his mouth.  He gets so excited everytime I hand it to him and twist it.  There was one other teether that he actually likes better.  It's the Philips AVENT Range BPA-Free Front Teeth Teether, Animal.  I guess there's something about the way it's designed that the little ones like.  This Munchkin Twisty Teether Ball is my favorite, but I'm not a teether connoisseur either though.  The only complaint I have about this teether is you are not given the choice on which of the 2 color combinations you would like.  You have to just order and hope for the best.  I was hoping to get the green/blue combo since I have a boy.  Unfortunately I got the pink/yellow one and that's the only reason it got 4 instead of 5 stars.
