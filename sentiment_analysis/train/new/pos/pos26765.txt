I first bought this two years ago. It fit my Graco Pack and Play fine, and I was very impressed with the quality. It's nice and soft, no plasticky feel, and no bad smell. Used it for about a year and still looks brand new. Now we have a second Graco Pack N Play and I needed another pad. I was very surprised to see all the reviews about it not fitting, and wondered if something had changed with quality control over the years. I decided to get it and see for myself.When I first took the pad out of the package, it did appear to be about 3 inches short widthwise. But then I tried to put it on the mattress pad (the standard one included with the Pack and Play) and it fit fine. It stretches without being too tight and making the mattress pad buckle. So for the real test I washed it and dried it on regular medium heat. No shrinkage and it went back on the mattress pad with no issues. So I'm really confused where all the reviews for not fitting are coming from.For reference, these are the Pack and Plays that I am using this cover on:Graco Pack 'n Play On The Go Travel Play Yard - Zoofarihttp://www.amazon.com/Graco-Pack-Play-Travel-Yard/dp/B00I57DCDM/Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Go Greenhttp://www.amazon.com/Graco-Playard-Reversible-Napper-Changer/dp/B00GY8J8H8/
