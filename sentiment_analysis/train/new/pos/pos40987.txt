I love, love, LOVE these diapers. I have used pre-folds, expensive AIO and eco-friendly sposies and this is my favorite product. I recommend these to anyone CD'ing or even thinking of trying cloth. So soft, absorbent, easy to wash and fit well under clothing. This company is amazing also. The customer service is directly from the owner and there are lots of giveaways and discount codes if you join the facebook page. I can't say enough great things about these diapers and this company. I wish I had known about Smart Snugs when my daughter was born but at least she's still young enough, 7 months, that I will get a lot of use out of these diapers.
