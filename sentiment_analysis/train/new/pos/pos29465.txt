I have a crib with a decorative curve at the top of the sides (IKEA Hensvik) so, while the narrow covers fit on the long sides, I had to buy the wider ones for the sides. It looks kind of messy because of the curve but that's no fault of the covers. Also, with so much excess on the ends (since the crib rail is wider in the middle and narrow on the ends), I had to wrap the ties around the corner to keep it taut otherwise it was easy for the kiddo to push it out of the way and gnaw on the rail. Again, not a flaw of the cover itself, but probably helpful to know if you're in the same boat.I did take off one star though because the gray covers for the long sides (front/back) do not match the gray covers for the short sides. They're slightly different colors. It's not a huge difference but it is noticeable in good light.
