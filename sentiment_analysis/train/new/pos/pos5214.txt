Before purchasing, I had so many questions about breastfeeding pillows and so I created this video to answer everything I wished I had known before, such as how does this compare to a Boppy?  how does the Original My Brest Friend compare to the Deluxe?  is the material comfortable?  what are the features?  I actually have all of these products now so, in my video, I compare them side by side, answer all of the questions above and more.  Hope this helps someone else too.  If this video review is helpful, please click on 'yes' below and happy shopping!
