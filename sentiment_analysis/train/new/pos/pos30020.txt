I originally choose this chair because it matched my dinning room set so nicely. It seems thus far very durable and my 30 lb 14 month old son is ROUGH on everything. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because the removable/washable tray has a major flaw....the baby could pop it out of place super easily! Therefore any food goes flying off with it. My son learned this little trick early on....like at five months. My easy solution was to simply not use the pop off tray. Other than that, I love this highchair.
