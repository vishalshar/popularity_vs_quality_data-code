I bought these after reading multiple reviews on various battery brands. These seemed to have the highest rating across the board on multiple sites so I invested in 8 C batteries and some AA batteries for my trashcan, remotes, etc.The batteries hold a charge for a really long time after charging even with daily use.  In addition, you can charge up a set of batteries and put them on a shelf or in a drawer and they still have an excellent charge in them several months later even after sitting unused.  I will definitely purchase more of these in the future if I need other-sized batteries.
