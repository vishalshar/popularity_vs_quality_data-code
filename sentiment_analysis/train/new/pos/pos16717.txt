My son loves this little blanket, I use the word blanket loosely, as some of the other comments say it is very small but the dimensions are listed so you just have to pay attention to what you're ordering. After all I paid $4, so I wasn't expecting a quilt! It's great, so soft and my little one can grab this and hold it without any problem. He loves it, rubs all over his face and chews on the owl. I don't know why there is velcro on the corner of this blanket but there is, however there's a little piece of fabric you can fold over and attach to the velcro to hide it. For the price, it's wonderful.
