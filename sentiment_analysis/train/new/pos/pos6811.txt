The only thing I wish were different about this is that I wish the diaper cream was just diaper cream and not cream to powder. Other than that I love this. I got it to test on my daughter, instead of buying a regular sized version of the product in case she didn't react well to it. She was fine with it all (except we haven't used the var soap, yet). I love the scent of Burt's Bees Baby Bee products, too. It's nice, calm, and light. Not too strong or perfumey like some other baby products. It smells natural, not chemically. I do believe we will be a Burt's Bees family.
