I bought this for my son's stroller. We go walking at the park in the evenings and the bugs are normally out and flying all over us. With the mosquito net, my son is protected and the bugs cannot get on him or his stroller/carseat. It's light and breathable and he can still see us which gives him a sense of security. For this price, I couldn't pass it up and I am so glad I bought it because it is just what we needed!
