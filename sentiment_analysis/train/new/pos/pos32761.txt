I have 3 kids -13yrs, 6yrs & 18 months ... so have a long experience with sippy cup trials ... this is the best period- it does not leak !! There is 1 very simple silicone piece that pushes into the inside of the cap to stop leaks and it works very well !!- it is easy to clean !!There are only a few parts unlike some other sippy cups that nearly need instructions to assembleThere is the cup ... the optional handle ..the twist off spout/cap and the silicone leak stopper .. that is it !! Simple as that !!It is easy for toddler / baby to use !!I love that it does not have a straw on the inside like some other cups ..because baby/toddlers instinct is to tip the cup back like a bottle ... and if they do that with a straw - they are just sucking air ! With this cup ..is almost acts like a perfect jump from bottle to cup... it's a great size at 11oz and with the way the spout is designed and the way the baby/ toddler can tilt it back .... my little guy also loves to use the handles .. although they are an option to take off if your child does not care for themI have also noticed that my guy has zero problem sucking and there was no bad taste or smell issues (I saw that in a previous review)- I love that this sippy can take a beatingMy guy tosses this thing across the room like it's his job ... but this cup is tough !!!! And with the soft silicone sleeve that it's in ..it's a tough but soft cup as well !After buying this first cup I bought the blue for my guy as a back up and I bought more for presents fir every baby/toddler I know !!! I am that excited about this find !!!!You really need to buy this cup !!!!
