Our bathtub is an older model and too narrow for the well reviewed PRIMO pearl tub, so I was really excited to see this product available as a smaller option. It's a great first tub for our newborn and works well -- she loves bathtime and I think this tub has a lot to do with it. The incline is helpful for her to sit upright (even though she can't do so herself). I never bothered with the duck toy bag/cushion as I figured it would take forever to dry, and our girl is too little for toys still. But it's a nice-to-have, I guess. What's best about this tub: lightweight, fits our bath, is molded with "hooks" so it can dry on the shower bar into the tub, and not take up floor or tub-floor space, and it has a drain in the bottom so we can empty the tub without having to tilt it over. There are two wells at the foot of the tub (for shampoo or soap bottles as a caddy?) which I use for clean water for rinsing at the end of the bath. Totally recommend this for little babies.UPDATE: Still loving it at 8 months, although now that our little one can sit herself up and has much longer legs, we're just starting to outgrow it and think about moving to the big tub like a big girl. Still a great buy, though, and totally recommend.UPDATE: Now past a year and we still use this tub each time. Mostly though because I can't figure out what to buy next -- rings seem suspicious, big tub too big. But I figure until her legs drape over completely (and she's 30in, 24lbs) we've still got more mileage.
