I bought the whole Re-Play set (plates, bowls, utensils) when my son was about six months old and entering the world of solid foods (we skipped purees and took the baby-led weaning route, which means we started him on regular old table food). Now, two years later, he's a super eater and these utensils are still in great shape!I was first intrigued when I read that these are made from recycled milk jugs -- I'll choose any recycled product over something brand new. The utensils are super sturdy -- very thick and well made. They're dropped on a regular basis but have never broken or cracked or chipped. They stand up to regular dishwasher use, and have never retained scents or stains (despite plenty of red pasta sauces!).These utensils are the perfect size for beginning eaters. The spoon is fairly shallow, so it doesn't hold much if your child is older and eating something especially runny, like soup. But for my 2.5 year old, this hasn't really been an issue. The fork tongs are short and not very sharp, but they are perfectly able to spear food.
