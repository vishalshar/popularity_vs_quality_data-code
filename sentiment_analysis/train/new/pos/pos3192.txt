This is much better than Infantino Squeeze Station which is currently $17.45 before tax. First, I tried using Infantino Squeeze Station since it was cheaper than this pouch fill station and wanted to like it but I had to return it because it made a huge mess of fresh squeezed smoothie and didn't go into the pouches no matter I tried. It just didn't work for me. Maybe the smoothie is too thick to go into the pouches since I use a hand mixer, not a standard juicer or food processor.I hesitated to buy this since I had a horrible experience with Infantino Squeeze Station but buying fruits pouches costs a lot since my 2-year old drinks two pouches a day on a normal day. I'm glad I bought this!! This doesn't look like it costs $25 to make since all parts are made out of plastic but its mechanic is excellent and works perfectly. I used this today for the first time and made about 20 pouches in a hour including the time to make smoothie. When I used Infantino Squeeze Station, I could only make 4 pouches in two hours... So I am really happy about this product and I hope this product would save me money on baby fruits pouches.
