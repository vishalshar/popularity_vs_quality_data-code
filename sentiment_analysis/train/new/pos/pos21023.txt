These trays work well, but they are hand wash only. I also do the trick of storing milk in a plastic bag after it is frozen since the trays don't provide freezer protection. You do have to be careful with the delicate dance to the freezer - they must be placed in a very level surface otherwise the milk will spill everywhere. I have a fridge with a pullout freezer at the bottom, which means that opening the freezer door sloshes the trays around, so be wary of this if you have the same type of fridge. I would probably have given this product 5 stars if it was dishwasher safe and a little less prone to spilling. I typically under-fill each ounce container to reduce the amount of spills from closing the freezer drawer.
