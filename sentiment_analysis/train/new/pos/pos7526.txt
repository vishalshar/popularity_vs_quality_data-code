I've recently started cloth diapering my 4 month old and decided to try a few different wraps. I use regular Chinese prefolds with a wrap. Here are my reviews.Kushies Taffeta Diaper Wrap Infant : This is an amazing price. The design is cute, it's very lightweight and it has the velcro and double leg gussets I like. But, it's very baggy. This works great over a fitted diaper and not very well over a prefold. My baby is pretty long and skinny, so that may be part of the problem. I have a few fitted diapers and like to use this wrap when she wears them. The material is much more vinyl-like than a regular pul wrap. I don't really mind it, but it might get uncomfortable in warm weather.Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Hoot, One : There's a reason this is the number on listing under cloth diapers. It's awesome. The design is great, the fit is great, the fabric is great! I do prefer velcro since my baby likes to wiggle, but that's a personal preference. ( Thirsties makes these too ) The snap system is very sturdy. I like the fact you can change the size of this cover to fit different babies. With only 2 sizes, they are worth the initial price since they last so long. I haven't had any leaks and that includes a major mess my daughter made last night. It cleans wonderfully. I will be buying all Thirsties from now on.Bummis Super Whisper Wrap, Celery Dot, 15-30 Pounds : ( I actually bought the small size ) This wrap is super cute. The velcro is nice since my baby is a wiggler. The fabric is slightly thicker than any other wrap I've used. I think this might be the problem. My daughter wet through the prefold and it got on the wrap. I had to wash it 3x to get the smell out of the cover. I haven't had that problem with any of the other wraps I've used. I also would prefer a double leg gusset and this is a single.
