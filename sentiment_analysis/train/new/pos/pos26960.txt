This monitor is great. Not only does it work very well, it's very inexpensive.  I ordered this monitor to replace our Summer video monitor.  My twins are 2 and a half now, and I just don't need the video any further.  Man, I wish I had made this change earlier!The best features of this monitor:1.  You can adjust the volume. GREAT feature.  I have had other monitors (this is our third) in which you can hear EVERY sound made by your child. It's disturbing to your sleep, and nice to be able to turn down.2.  2 parent monitors, that operate with batteries. Great concept.  I leave one downstairs, and one upstairs at all times.  With my old monitor I had to tote it around everywhere.3.  Night light on the base. Nice feature--currently we are not using this, but it's nice to have since you are tying up one outlet with the base (thus losing a night-light outlet).4.  NO INTERFERENCE. We have had a LOT of trouble with our monitors interfering with each other, and with our wireless internet, TV, etc.  This one is great.In short, if you are looking for a sound-only monitor, I'd highly recommend this one.  It's a great value, and works far better than the $200 plus video monitors I've used in the past.
