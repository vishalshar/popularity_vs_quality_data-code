Easy to put together, light and compact.My 4 year old who is actually big for his age said it is very comfortable. And most of the umbrella strollers are to narrow and small for even 3 year olds a lot of times.We bought it for our new baby since we will be using the maxi cosi mico car seat, but it seems like we will use it a lot even before the baby is born! Very happy with the purchase and would recommend!
