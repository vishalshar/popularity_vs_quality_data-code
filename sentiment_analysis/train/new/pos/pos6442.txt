I love my Snoogle. Pregnancy sleep got uncomfortable for me around 19 weeks, and since you're not supposed to sleep on your back, I needed something to help the pain in my hips and side. I tried pillows (I normally sleep with one between my knees anyway), they didn't really help. The first night sleeping with my pillow I slept like a dream.. The deepest, most sound sleep I had had in weeks! Ladies, buy it and buy it early. It is worth every penny. I promise.
