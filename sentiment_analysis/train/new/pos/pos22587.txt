I absolutely love this stroller. I looked and looked and read all kinds of reviews for several strollers and ended up giving this one a try. It is perfect for my family. If folds up so easily and small for a 2 seat stroller. Fits in my trunk with room to spare which is great! It easily fits through doorways which is great when taking the kids into stores etc... I use it for fast walks for exercise and for daily mall trips etc... And it has worked great for both.  The seats recline enough for the kids to take a nap if desired. One child is 11 months and the other is almost 3 years old. They both have plenty of room and they love riding in this stroller! More than others I have purchased. I'm not very strong and it is easy for me to lift it to get it in the trunk. The only negative is a small space on the bottom for person items because it is separated into two separate bins but other than that I love this stroller and would highly recommend it!!
