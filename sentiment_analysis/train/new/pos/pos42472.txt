I purchased this set when my son was just begining solids at 6 months.  He is now almost 9 months and I just ordered 3 more sets to insure we always have one on hand.  My son has always insisted on holding the spoon himself, and with other plastic and metal spoons I worried he would hurt himself.  The spoon in this set it a soft flexible rubber so I just let my son hold it and play with it while I feed him with a more traditional baby spoon, this way I avoid the tug of war tantrums.  The bowl suctions well to his highchair tray and is easily removed by gently pulling at the bottom of the suction cup to allow air to get in there.  This may not be the set for everyone, but for us it has been wonderful!
