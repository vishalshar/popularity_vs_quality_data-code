My daughter was three and half weeks old at her Christening, which was the first time we had taken her out in public for any length of time.  When she started to scream in the middle of the service, I was glad we had her pacifier.  However, she dropped it from her mouth several times and I realized that I would need to find something to keep it sanitary in the event that it ever dropped on the floor.  I love this clip.  I usually keep it clipped to her pack -n- play just outside the pacifier sanitary pocket so that it is readily available when I need it at home.  But it also clips to her clothes, car seat, or my diaper bag if I am out somewhere.  Thank you for a practical solution :)
