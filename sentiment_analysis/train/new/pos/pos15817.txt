I love these discs! They are great for diaper pails, especially when you use cloth diapers. I always try to flush any solids to keep the odor under control first, and these take care of the rest. The only issue I've ever had is that one fell onto my hardwood floor without my realizing it, after sitting there for who knows how long, it left a stain.
