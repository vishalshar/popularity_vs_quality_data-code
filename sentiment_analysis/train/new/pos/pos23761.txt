Im a Ju Ju Be addict and I LOVE this wallet. There are so many places to put things its almost overwhelming. I love that its washable so if my little guy spits up on it or something gets spilled on it, all I have to do is wipe it off. Its amazing.There is one thing that I do not like about it. While I love the pattern and the colors are so pretty and vibrant, I wish the inside was a solid color. There is such a thing as too much and the patterned fabric on the outside as well as the inside is in fact too much. I gave this wallet 5 stars because of how great it is but I would give the overall appearance a 4 because of the overuse of the patterned fabric.A word of caution- I have a BeTween as well as a BeFabulous and the wallet does not fit into the mommy pocket if you have your phone, keys and glasses in it. The only way I can carry it in the mommy pocket is if I only put the wallet and my phone in there which kind of makes the mommy pocket pointless if thats all that can go in it.
