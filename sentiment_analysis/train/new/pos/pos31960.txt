Great replacement pack.  Works with my Pump In Style Advanced pump by Medela.I did not originally order replacement parts for my breast pump because I figured I am very gentle and would wash my items after every use.  While I read the pump manual, I somehow missed the part about maintenance of these membranes.  I was so gentle with them at the beginning when cleaning, that I made sure the water didn't push the membrane out too far, so it would maintain a tight seal.  Somehow, I didn't realize you were supposed to remove them when cleaning, so imagine my surprise when I *accidentally* pulled the membrane out during a cleaning and saw bits of mold in the bottom!!  I had to use a q-tip to get in the grooves and multiple hot water and soap washes, as well as a few trips through the sanitizer before I felt comfortable to use the pump again!  I can only imagine how many bottles my poor daughter had with bits of mold in them!So....I highly recommend buying a pack or two of these membranes and replacing them on your pump regularly.
