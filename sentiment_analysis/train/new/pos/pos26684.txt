First off, I love the design. I wish it came in other colors. The mat is so easy to clean. We've had blowouts and leaks with my daughter and all have been so simple to take care of - I'm so intensely glad we didn't use a cloth covered pad. It's a great size for her size (she's quite long) and as she's developed the hook for the toy keeps her more and more entertained. It's very sturdy and I appreciate that it doesn't give when she is squirming around.It does seem a little stiff but I'm not exactly letting her take naps on here. I certainly recommend this and am very glad we purchased it.
