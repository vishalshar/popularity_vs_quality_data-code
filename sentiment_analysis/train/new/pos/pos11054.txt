These bibs are fantastic. I ordered them for a vacation - the first we've taken with our 11 month old. We've always used reusable, cloth bibs, and I didn't want to deal with rinsing and washing those while we were away.Here's what I love about these bibs:- They're bigger than you think. They're actually bigger than several of my daughter's cloth bibs, and as a result, she almost never gets food on her shirt while wearing one of these (a common occurrence with the cloth).- They fold up and take up virtually no space. Perfect for throwing in a diaper bag when you're out or travelling.- The little pouch. They're packed flat, so you pop the little pouch out when you put it on. The pouch works surprisingly well. I've always been leery of the hard bibs with the pouch (like the Bjorn bibs), so I can't compare, but these catch a lot of food.- They stay on. The adhesive they use is pretty strong, and my daughter can't pull her bib off on her own (unlike the cloth bibs that use velcro).- They're cheap. $5 for 24 is an awesome deal for something that works as good as these do.- They're disposable. Obvious, I know, but babies are messy, and bibs are gross after a meal. This shortens clean up time, which is great when you're trying to get the tired baby into a bath and ready for bed before a meltdown.My only regret is that I didn't try these sooner.
