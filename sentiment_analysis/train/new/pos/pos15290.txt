We love our backpack, and so does our 11 month old(24 lbs) son. I did a lot of research before choosing the Cross Country and I am very pleased with the results. We originally wanted a Kelty one, but we are on a budget so I started looking into used ones. I found some good deals on Ebay, but still could not afford the top of the line ones, even being used.I agree with the other post that there is not enough padding on the carrier for long hikings, but we went hiking for 2 hours he other day and my husband did not complained. He is 6'4'', a little taller than the recommended max of 6'2'' fot he carrier. I love that it comes with a sun shade(just the sun shade for the Kelty is almost 30 bucks), but by far my favorite feature is the HUGE compartment for diapers, sippy cups, bottles, etc. It's really a good size, comparable to a medium diaper bag! I managed to even put the sun shade in there half way through our hiking trip. There is also a mesh pocket on the back, not to mention a little pouch on the left side, great for cell phone, wallet, keys and chap stick!I do recommend this carrier, is a great value for the money. I have not yet seen the upgraded one(Cross Terrain), but it might have some more padding, so it's worth looking into.
