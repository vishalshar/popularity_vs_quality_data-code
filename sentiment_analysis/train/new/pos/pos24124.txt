This is a GREAT gift for young children. I got this for my nephew for Christmas. He was about 2 months old at the time. We keep this toy in his crib and he's learning to kick to make it play the music and to turn the lights on. He'll probably enjoy it more as he gets older and developes further. It has light and sounds. My favorite feature is it's tactile properties. Almost every part of the toy is made of different material so when you touch you feel lots of different materials. I particularly like this feature because I'm visually impaired, and children that are visually imaired or blind, won't notice the lights, but they will notice the different fabrics and such used in the construction. Before Christmas, we were looking at a number of soothers, and stumbled upon this and decided to get it instead. I'm SO glad I did. It's interactive unlike soothers. As the ultimate recommendation, I'm going to buy this for a friend's son who is expected in March.
