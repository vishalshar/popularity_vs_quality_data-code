I'm so glad I found these. I live in a town that's all hills, and every time I walked down an incline I kept a death grip on my stroller. I was nervous that my stroller--and baby--would get away from me if I stumbled or tripped, and then rush down into cars, houses, or trees. I don't have a jogging stroller than comes with a wrist strap, just a couple regular walking strollers, so I started searching for an after-market product to keep my stroller attached to me. These are great. They are comfortable, stretchy, easy to use, and unobtrusive. I haven't used the Teddy Tug yet, but I have used both the Buggy Tug and the Toddle Tug to keep my stroller attached to my wrist. I have fairly small hands and narrow wrists; both the Buggy and Toddle slip on easily. I'd like them even more if I could tighten them around my wrists once on. However, I think they are tight enough and strong enough to do their job in an emergency.
