I loved every inch of this product. My son is four now, but when he was a baby, I used this thing so often, I was lost without it. The wipes container was slender enough that it didn't add bulk, but it could hold enough wipes to last through your trips and errands. There's enough space to put a handful of diapers before it starts to bulge too much. The velcro (sp?) straps worked wonderfully, and the wrist strap meant I could carry it on my arm, loop it on my purse, or loop it onto anything else I happened to be carrying. The fold-up-and-go design is fantastic, and it's subtle enough that it doesn't scream "diaper bag!!" every time you go out with it. I travel through airports a lot, so plopping this thing down on bathroom changing stations was a great way to change my son in a sanitary scene, as well. This was probably one of my favorite 'handy' tools I used when my son was a baby, I definitely suggest it!
