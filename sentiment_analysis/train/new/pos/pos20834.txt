Love the added peace of mind this product provides. Since our LO has been able to roll over, she prefers sleeping on her side or face down, no matter how many times we turn her to her back, so this helps minimize her chance of suffocation. I tested it out myself so I know it works. Two minor drawbacks: (1) it doesn't fit on the standard crib mattress perfectly. Product came folded, and even after washing, air drying and letting LO sleep on it for several weeks, the creases haven't flattened out completely, which I think prevents it from reaching it's actual dimensions. It was about 1 1/2 - 2 inches shorter in length than the crib mattress. I just try to center it as best I can. (2) There is no way to secure the pad to the mattress, so the pad shifts around while I'm putting the sheet on, which is annoying. After the sheet is on I have to reach up underneath to position it properly. Would be better if there were small elastic straps that went around and underneath mattress to hold it in place. That would solve both issues I mentioned, since the product does stretch a little.
