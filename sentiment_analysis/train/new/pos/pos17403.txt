I exclusively single pump, so my whole setup gets a lot of use. I have to change the membrane weekly to ensure optimum yield (recommendation for double pumping is usually once a month for supplemental pumping. So at 6-8 sessions a day, I would change mine every two weeks if I double pumped), so go through them quickly.They fit perfectly on Maymom valves or those directly from Medela.Best part of this is the price!
