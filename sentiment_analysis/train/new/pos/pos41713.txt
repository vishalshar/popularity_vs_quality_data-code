My diaper bag was literally a nightmare! An explosion of baby and mommy products + all sorts of knick knacks. I decided enough was enough and did major research to get organized. After searching the web and watching countless YouTube videos I decided the best option was the SugarSNAP filing system. They arrived today and today I dumped my diaper bag on the floor and went for it. I can't believe everything I had just thrown in my diaper bag fit in these slim pouches with room to spare. They are clearly labeled so I know what is in each one. No more digging around and pulling everything out looking for something. No more sending my husband on what he calls "death missions" when asking him for something from the bag. I LOVE these bags and I'm SO upset it took me this long to find them! I've been an unorganized disaster until now. I can't tell you how glad I am to have found this product. All my personal belongings fit nicely also. I've been carrying my items in a makeup bag that is so stuffed it won't even close. Things are always falling out and I have no idea why I've been using it. The madness is over lol and I feel so good I can actually take a nap and dream about my beautifully organized bag. Oh... One more thing. They come on a ring and can be clipped together and easily removed and or transferred to another bag!!! So cool!!!
