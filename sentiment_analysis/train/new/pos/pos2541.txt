I love those shopping cart cover.  It covers the entire area well and actually stays put.  It would be nice to have a bit of cushioning on the part that covers the seat but still isn't that big of a deal.  It has lasted through both of my kids so far and has kept them both entertained during our shopping ventures!  I love that it also works as a play mat or makeshift highchair.
