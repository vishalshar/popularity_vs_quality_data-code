This was a really great buy! The theme for our nursery is baby Lion King and this complimented everything we already had. It was a little difficult to build, but once we figured it out, it came together fairly quick. I wish this would have come with instructions, they are at the bottom of the play pen, making it difficult to read because they are covered by the fabric (which is what made the building process a tad bit more difficult). Overall this is a really nice product, worth the money, can't wait to see the baby play in it.
