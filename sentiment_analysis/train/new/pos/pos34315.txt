I almost didn't purchase this item based on the reviews.  I would have been sad!I deliberated a long time over which walker to get for my daughter.  I have other Chicco products and do like them a lot.  So many of the reviews mention things like tipping, etc.  To be honest, I don't think there is a product out there that can save our kids from themselves (a rubber room?!).  Of course a baby will find a way to tip something over or fall and bump their heads...but that's why parental involvement is always necessary.  Who lets their very young baby out of their sight for more than a second or two?Our daughter loves this toy.  She actually laughs and smiles when she sees it and immediately crawls to it to start walking or playing with the front.  The music is silly and cute, but I'm glad it can be turned off and has two volume settings.  The shape sorter on the front and ball chute (which makes noise) are the perfect size for baby (our daughter is 9 months old).While it is lightweight and not perfectly designed (I've rarely found anything that is), your child should only need to use this toy for a few months at the most before they outgrow it or learn how to walk on their own.I do think it is a bit overpriced for what it is mostly because it does have such a short lifespan (not that it will wear out, just that baby won't need it for too long).I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has hardwood floors.  When our pediatrician mentioned getting a walker, she asked if we had carpets or hard floors.  She said carpet is better for all of these types of toys.  Not only because the toys function better (don't move as fast), but safer for the babies in general (not as many bumps and bruises when learning how to walk).
