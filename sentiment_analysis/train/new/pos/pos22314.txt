It just arrived, yesterday.  Our little, fuss budget 5 week old loves this mobile.  She can see the glowing animals at night.  The mobile distracts her long enough to give us time to grab a bottle and a diaper.  Tonight, she is in her crib cooing at the lights.  It is our hope that as she becomes more comfortable with her new 'friends,' the time of comfort and distraction while in her crib will gradually increase.  She's already calmer and more content in her crib than ever before.  The remote is an awesome thing for us to have.We did a lot of research on mobiles for very young ones and knew we definitely needed a mobile that she could see at night.  This mobile design looked like our best bet.  We were still a little concerned that such a little one wouldn't yet be able to see the mobile, but she can.  As we hoped, the glowing feature did the trick!  She may be too young to make out the animals' faces due to  distance, but she can see the pretty glowing lights.  Her vision is improving with every passing week.  (She's also too young to see the projection feature, but she'll enjoy it, later.  We were more concerned about now.)We also ordered an 8 pack of C batteries (we read 4 C batteries would last about a month) and a 4 pack of AAA batteries for the remote (which takes 2).  The AAA batteries will last us for quite some time.  If it only costs us 4 C batteries a month ... with our little fussy one ... it will be well worth it.
