I think this one is great design and easy to attach. It is very helpful however it loosens so the cup holder rotates. My water bottle felt down quite few times. Even baby bottle falls off which is smaller and lighter. Once you fold the stroller the cup holder slips off and falls out of the stroller attachment which is still there.
