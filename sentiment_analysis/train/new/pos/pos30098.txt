My husband made fun of me for buying this necklace, saying that he could have made it himself. Sure, he COULD, but if I asked him to, WOULD he? I think we all know that answer to that one.Marital issues aside, this necklace has been great for me and my 8-month-old. It's attractive enough and gives my little one something to chew and play with while I'm holding him.It's also nice to have an accessory that is baby-proof. I was feeling a bit frumpy because I couldn't wear any jewelry with it being torn apart by my little octopus of a baby.The only downside is he really like to chew the cord and it will quickly absorb all the saliva in his mouth which leaves the cord cold and clammy against my neck. But then, babies tend to leak everywhere as it is, so I suppose it's one of the job hazards.
