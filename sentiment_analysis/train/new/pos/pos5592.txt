I purchased this for my 2 year old and he loves playing with it! I wish I had gotten this sooner but even now at 2 years old it keeps him entertained and pretty soon his baby brother will be able to play with it too! That said, I wouldn't pay the full price for this but got it at a great deal so couldn't go wrong!
