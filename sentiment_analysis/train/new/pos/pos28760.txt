I pre-ordered this item for my son's bazillions stuffed animals. I was not disappointed when it arrived.  I just counted the actual number of stuffed animals in there and there are 44 (see the pictures to see the pile of them) with room for more. Like anything you're stuffing full, if you really wanted to arrange the order you stuffed it, the more you can fit in there. As it stands I could probably stuff another 10 small-medium sized stuffed animals in there and still have it close without issue.The mesh on top is thicker and will be durable for little kid's wear and tear.  The zipper is also a good study quality and is a nice one that is very easy to zip. It also could stand up to a bit of over stuffing and wouldn't instantly break open.  Finally, the plush outside is also good 'stuffed animal' quality, the inside of it is just the raw side of the outter-plush, which is a bit unfinished, but I don't see any reason for it to be lined so certainly not a negative.  See the pictures for the added ones.
