This is softer than some other wool soaker covers, and seems very well made.  I used it on my daughter at night right from the beginning, with a snappi'd prefold underneath, even though the leg openings gapped.  Sometimes the diaper would feel damp in the morning, but there was no leakage on her pajamas or sheets, and then over the day, with an airing-out, the diaper would dry and not hold any odors.  I have spot cleaned it a couple of times when poop leaked out the prefold, because you do have to hand-wash (and periodically lanolin treat) the diaper, and because it is thick it takes a long time to air dry, but that's just standard care for wool.  The Kissa's is more expensive than some other similar styles I saw online, but I liked that it said it would fit a wider weight range than some others, so I figured we could use it longer.  So far (daughter is 14 weeks) it's still going strong-- not at all tight around the legs-- so I think we'll be able to use it for a while longer, and I think it will hold up over time.
