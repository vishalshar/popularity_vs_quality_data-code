We bought this for our 6 yr old so that we can put our 1 yr old in the main seatI liked that it is a sturdy addition and my son liked it so much; he was having fun riding it.However, u can use it only if you have 2 kids since with 3, it will be difficult to fit everyoneIt is easier to use for people who are taller than 160 cm since you will need your arms to extend to reach the stroller and push
