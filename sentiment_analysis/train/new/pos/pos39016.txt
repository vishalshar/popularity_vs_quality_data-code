I like this stroller.  My favorite single stroller is our mia moda, which is the main reason for getting a double made by them even though there are cheaper options out there.  Both of my kids are very comfortable in this stroller.  My 2 year old loves the options her sit or stand seat offers, and I appreciate still being able to strap her in if needed.  Two things I wish mia moda would change - the sun shade size and how big it is when it folds down.  The sun shade does not offer much coverage for my baby.  It could be larger towards the front of the stroller.  This stroller is much larger than I expected it to be when folded down.  So large that we can't fit it in the trunk of our minivan.  We have to remove the back seat to fit this stroller in our vehicle, which is doable with 2 kids, but will be a problem when we have another.  Overall, I am pleased with this stroller.  It fits our current needs well.
