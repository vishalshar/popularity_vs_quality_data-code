Our baby has reflux issues and is a spit-up queen, so we desperately needed more burp clothes.  We'd been using some prefold diapers, but wanted something that looked a bit nicer.  Some friends had given us Babylicious burp clothes in a gift set, and those were too small and the flannel backing was cheap, plus they constantly came out of the wash wrinkled (and who wants to iron a burp cloth?).The Trend Lab burp cloths are nicer than the Babylicious cloths.  Like them, they have a colorful fabric back, with an absorbent fabric on the other side.  In the case of the Trend Lab cloths, the absorbent fabric is terry cloth, which works better and is thick enough that the burp cloths don't wrinkle in the dryer.  On the other hand, they aren't huge; that can be an advantage if you want something to put in a diaper bag, but is a disadvantage if you have a child who spits up a lot, as they get soaked pretty quickly.All in all, the cheapest and most absorbent option for a burp cloth is still a prefold diaper -- plus they are great soft cloths for household use once they baby's outgrown them.  I'm not sure you'd want to use one of the nicer Trend Lab cloths as a rag.  However, it's nice to have a few of the Trend Lab cloths for more formal occasions when you're out with the baby.FYI:  Another absorbent option -- one that's much larger than the Trend Lab cloths, and also nicer than a white prefold -- is the Aden + Anais burp cloth.  They're more expensive, but they're big and can also be used as a bib.
