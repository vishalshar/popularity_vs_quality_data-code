I got this for my one month old daughter and it works perfectly. It is easy to put baby in right after a bath so she doesn't get cold, and its super cute, she seems to be nice and cozy when she is in it and it does a good job of drying her off. I've used it about 5 times so far and I'm very happy with the quality and it really helps to simplify my life when I'm trying to keep her warm while I get her clothes together, and have to carry her to the other room.. I would definately reccommend it.
