We bought this crib for our grandaughter to use for visits. I am so pleased with what an attractive crib this is and how sturdy it seems to be. It is not so easy to put together as the directions are a bit incomplete. It would have be easier if the side pieces were labeled with stickers so that you don't start putting them together wrong. The little storage compartment underneath is not of the quality as the crib and was missing the center support. My husband just made one as we felt it would not be strong enough without it. It is handy for diapers and toys, but nothing heavy. All in all, we are very pleased and think we have a safe, attractive crib for the baby. I am espcially pleaased that the crib will convert.
