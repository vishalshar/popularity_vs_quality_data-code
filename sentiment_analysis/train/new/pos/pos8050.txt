Near perfect.Pros.The oven door lock is super easy to install. You just need to make sure that you clean the area you mean to adhere to it to before you peel off the label. I notice there are some people who rate this low, and I believe it is because they don't really understand how this works. The black handle on the grey part does not move, it should not move. The grey and black part are one piece, the part you want to move and the part that has the spring in it is the metal hinge itself. If you know this going it you won't be so confused.Cons.The only con that I can find is that when the oven has been on for a prolonged time, say over an hour the lock adhesive can get a little loose and isn't as strong. Once the oven is off again and the oven has cooled back down, the adhesive re solidified and was as strong as before.
