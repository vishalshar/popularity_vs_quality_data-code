Ok, this is adorable. I love it and as a toy is very cute however my baby doesn't seem to be interested at all in it. He's 8 months old now and has had it for several months but still not interested. I make it rattle a little, bc it's really too tight to rattle much, and dangle it in front of him,  even hand it to him and he literally hands it back and picks something else up. I gave it four stars bc maybe it's just him and the fact that it's such a tight rattle. I do love the company, the fact that they put out safe, non toxic toys that I'm not scared to give my baby and there isn't anything wrong with it (unless it's not supposed to be this tight but I'm assuming that's a safety issue). He does love their triangles toy <3
