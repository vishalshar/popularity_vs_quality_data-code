I purchased the Wood Baby Toy Gift Set for my infant daughter. She is currently five weeks old and I wanted to introduce the rattle to her especially. We are trying to create a Montessori style environment for our daughter and the toy shapes contained in this gift set are recommended by Montessori. All in all, the product is excellent. While she is still too young to enjoy these toys, they are well made and will see a lot of use in the future. I keep the toys (in the muslin bag they came in) on her playmat in her nursery. So far, we have mainly used the wood beads and rattle.The only downside I could possible mention is the egg and pestle seem quite small. That said...they are very little hands that will be playing with them! I would not leave the egg and pestle with an unsupervised child...but she will be playing with them when I'm sitting with her. The rest of the toys are perfect sized. Again, I think the egg and pestle are probably the right size as well...I'm just so used to seeing children with big chunks of plastic that I have to remind myself small toys are okay!Would order this set as a gift for others. And they are so much better than having your baby playing with plastic!
