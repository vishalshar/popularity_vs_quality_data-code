I did a TON of research when looking for a straw cup for our baby. He is on thickened liquids (nectar) and our feeding therapist recommended straw cup vs. sippy cup. I found it frustrating that so many straw cups on the market have some sort of valve or a requirement to "bite" to suck. For a young baby, I wanted an easy straw to suck a thickened liquid out of AND it had to be easy to clean (dishwasher) and not hide mold in yucky places. We primarily use the take n toss straw cups at home, but I wanted one that could be thrown in a diaper bag. This fits the bill! No yucky mold buildup anywhere, it's SO easy to clean. The straw comes apart into two pieces that I rinse and put everything in the dishwasher. It's very easy for him to suck. 4 stars instead of 5 because of two things: the "weighted" straw doesn't move around to all sides real well, it's kind of rigid; the straw material on the sucking end is a type of material that easily stains. He used it while eating spaghetti ONE TIME and now the suck end of the straw is orange and it does not wash off. Other than that, I love it!
