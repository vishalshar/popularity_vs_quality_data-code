This was our second bedding set.  We kept baby's gender a surprise and initially purchased a much more expensive "organic" alphabet-themed nursery set in neutral colors.  I was very disappointed with the quality of that product, especially considering its price, and in the end the neutral tans, browns, and greens were very blah.  It practically fell apart after washing and baby never got to use it.  I still liked the alphabet theme and found this much more colorful (though not at all too much color, and still very gender neutral) and classic set...also found it "used" (though it appeared new, perhaps open, not used) for a great bargain thanks to Amazon.  The nursery looks great, it's easy to match with other things because of the primary color palate and variety of animals (not just jungle, forest, or sea, etc.).  And baby seems to love it--he looks at the letters on the bumpers which stand out with bright characters on the off-white background.  It was easy to get dark brown "black-out" curtains that match nicely and keep it neutral, though any colors might have worked.  I think we'll be able to use it again in the future boy or girl (we had a boy:).  We also got the adorable elephant lamp and I'm purchasing the mobile now.  Really love this product, and thanks, Amazon, for taking away some of my guilt about buying another set by helping me find such a bargain (w/ my $20 coupon, I paid $32 for the set!).
