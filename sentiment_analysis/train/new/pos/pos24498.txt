If my child gets anything close to a red bum, it is time for a FuzziBunz.  I use both FBz and disposable diapers.  I always use disposables when I am out and about. And I also use them at night.  Otherwise, my son is in a FBz most of the day.  They are fantastic for avoiding diaper rash.  My child has had one diaper rash in 18 months and that was using disposables (Luvs).  After that, I gave FBz a try and I keep him in them all day.  I change my son frequently. I go through 4 FBz between0730 and 1200.  No diaper rashes. The diaper is soft and does not irritate the skin.  The padding is absorbent and doesn't have any of those nasty chemicals in them.  I do recommend following the cleaning and care instructions but here is what I do and I am completely satisfied.  I wash when my pail has about 5-6 diapers because the ammonia odor is quite overwhelming by that time.  I always rinse and spin first. For extra soiled diapers I run the rinse and spin twice.  I then run my washer on cottons/heavy duty. I do not use any special laundry soap.  I use Wisk like I do form my whole family. I also have a sanitize feature that I use once a month when I notice the diapers are holding odor or are not bright and white.  I then line dry. I never use the dryer. I actually hang all of the diapers and inserts on a plastic hanger which I loaded up with clips (like for hanging pants).  I can fit all 6 FBz and their single inserts on this one hanger. I then take it out to the back porch and hang it in the sun.  Super easy.
