I think the idea of making a stainless steel pail is great! Not only is it easy to clean but the smell is well contained. I can even use my cloth diaper bag with this pail which was a major selling point for us! Cost is more than we wanted to spend, however it has proved to be worth it. Another plus, Amazon's shipping was super fast, especially considering the size of the thing!*In response to all the Negative Nellies out there...this product does not have magical properties. Of course it's going to smell when you open it, it's been holding dirty diapers! What matters is if it contains the smell when it's closed, which it DOES. (And which plastic ones do NOT.) Additionally, this is not a Mary Poppins bag! It's not bottomless, and it requires to be emptied on a REGULAR basis. Quit being lazy and empty your can before it gets so full you have to rip it out. These are NOT PRODUCT FAILURES, or reasons to mark a product down, deterring other people from having a great product, these are your own problems. If you are expecting magic in the real world, you have bigger issues than what to do with stinky poo.*Also, to help those of you claiming to have trouble with opening the sliding door...you must apply gentle downward pressure, THEN slide it open. With one hand, it works perfect every time.*This is coming from a mom of two, one who is no longer in diapers and the other a toddler with stinky boy poo. And who has previously owned plastic diaper pails that were less than satisfactory in the smell and clean departments. I hope this helps the sensible people out there.
