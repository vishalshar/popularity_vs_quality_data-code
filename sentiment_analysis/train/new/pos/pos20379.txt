Easy to assemble, stable, very comfortable for baby, The straps adjust , right now baby is very small but can sit and eat comfortably in this High Chair. There seems to be a lot of room for her to grow. We had an earlier version of this same chair  5 years ago and it was excellent . We expect to get also quite a lot of use from this one and pass it on to another child when this baby outgrows it. This high chair  is light weight and folds easily.
