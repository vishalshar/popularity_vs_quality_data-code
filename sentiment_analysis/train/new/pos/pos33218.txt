Purchased for my granddaughter who is learning these concepts. Cute song, easy to learn, and it seems children, or the children in my family, learn best with singing, so that's great. The only disappointment is that the case on top, which is supposedly packed with toys, is packed with toys all the same color as the car to which they are adhered. I can't even tell they are toys and though the space would be great for packing our own little things, it is not big enough to pack things of a size appropriate for a two year old. The mother and baby, safely in a car seat, are quite cute and it is a favorite toy. I like that all the little people family can go for a ride in these Little People toys.
