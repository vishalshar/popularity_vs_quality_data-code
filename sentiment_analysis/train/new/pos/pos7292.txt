I have an overly active 8-month-old baby girl.  At this stage of the game, washing her was nearly impossible without putting all the soap in her eyes (no big deal with baby shampoo) or nearly drowning her as the result of her twisting and contorting because she refused to sit/lay still long enough for me to accomplish this task.  When I came across these visors, I was doubtful that they would fit on an 8-month-old or that they would even shield her face/eyes as they claimed. Well....I'm sold! The price is unbeatable, especially for this 2-pack and they do exactly what they say if you get them on correctly. I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5, because it is very tricky to get the visor properly adjusted on a wriggly baby's head and the velcro does catch the hair when you're trying to fasten it.  Otherwise, I have no real complaint.
