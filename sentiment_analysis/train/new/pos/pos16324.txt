both products...the one to hold the shower head and the one for the wall were great.  Just be careful on your tile size...if the tile is too smallor you are not able to aline the suction cups on a full tile, it will not stick well.  If you following that guideline, you should beok.  It is a strong grip and has not come off yet....Happy with the product
