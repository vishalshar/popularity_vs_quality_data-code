Love the hair flower clips in my daughter's hair. She gets lots of compliments when we are out.  Very unique!  I did have a problem with the metal part on the clip on 2 of the hair flowers.  I emailed the company Modern Accents and within a few hours I was send an email with an apology and was told replacements would be sent for both clips.  Wonderful company to work with.  Will order more from them.
