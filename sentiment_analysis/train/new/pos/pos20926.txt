I saw a mother using this when my son was only a couple of months old, and thought "Hey, that's cool". When it came time to find a solution to my son's inability to sit on his own in the grocery cart (he outgrew his car seat at 4 months), I had a hard time finding this. Finally, I met a woman with one, and she provided the manufacturer's name. I bought one, and plan to purchase them as gifts for all of the new parents I know. It's good to have early, because the baby will need it before you realize! We also use this in the high chair at our favorite restaurant. They have a decrepit old chair that I refer to as the "Chair of Death". This pad and strap make it work for our son though. I strongly suggest purchasing this and carrying it with you everywhere. It's quite portable and handy!
