I have a chocolate lab so this harness was obviously the first one I wanted to try. My son loved it from the moment he saw it and started hugging it like it was a stuffed animal. After one or two uses, he got used to it being on his back. Now when I'm in a large department store, at the zoo, or in any large crowded area, I don't have to constantly be chasing after him. He's at the age where he wants to walk independently, so this allows him to do so within the confines of where I want to go. I really couldn't care less about the fact my kid is on a leash; it gives him the freedom he desires and lets me stop worrying about him wandering away.
