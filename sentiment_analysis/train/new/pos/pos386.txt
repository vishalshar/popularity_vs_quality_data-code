I've been using 2 of these at work to see who is coming through the lobby doors when I'm in my office and there is no one at the desk,  and for after hours meetings when we need to leave a door unlocked for latecomers. Works great, and we're not using all the features - I turned off the mic so there is no eaves dropping. Unfortunately, the signal stops about 4 feet from anyone else's desk.
