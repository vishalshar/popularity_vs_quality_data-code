I was SO excited to find Dr. Brown's bottles in lavender!! These look even better in person than the picture you see on the website. The color is rich and much more fun than the original clear, white and blue ones. Same bottles, same effectiveness, just with more pizazz! And if you're not familiar with Dr. Brown's bottles, I've used them with all 4 of my little ones and they drastically reduce fussiness due to excess air swallowed during feedings. Highly recommend!
