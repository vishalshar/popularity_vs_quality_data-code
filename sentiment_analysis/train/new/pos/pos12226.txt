I ran a home daycare for about two years and needed a way to cordon off the dogs from the rest of the downstairs.  It required a really long gate and this was pretty much the only one I found that fit.  We had this gate from 2007-2013 until we moved and it was wonderful!  It was so sturdy and took so much abuse and has held up so well, and never damaged the walI with the wall mountings. We tried a spring-loaded one and it constantly came down and buckled.  I liked the walk-through section, and would have loved a foot pedal opening, but overall I was super happy with the gate.
