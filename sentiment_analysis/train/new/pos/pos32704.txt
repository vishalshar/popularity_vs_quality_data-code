This cube is adorable. I bought this for my son back when he was only a couple months old. He is 15 months now, and still finds it entertaining.  It is really vibrant, even after I washed and dried it. I know you are not supposed to do that to most toys, but I refuse to give my children anything unwashed. Anyway, it survived the wash (I took the pictures out to wash of course), and it is a really cute plush toy.
