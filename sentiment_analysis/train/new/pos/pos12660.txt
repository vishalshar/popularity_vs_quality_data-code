This is probably the best and most convenient purchase ive made in awhile.  If you have kids and are tired of stepping on their toys in the tub or having them thrown on the floor, put away wet or left in the tub I would recommend buying this. It can be hooked to the inside or outside of the tub and holds a LOT of toys for its size. its just the right size for everything, My daughters is 4 so she stuffs her barbies, squirt guns, a squirt bottle, scrubby, cup, a few water squirters and some plastic toys in this thing. The netting allows the toys to drip dry so they dont mold. You can flip the whole thing on the outside of the tub if you want to take a bath. I also noticed my daughter likes cleaning up her bath toys now since I bought this.
