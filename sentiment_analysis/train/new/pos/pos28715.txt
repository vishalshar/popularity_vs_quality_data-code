I had one of these 4 years when my oldest child was teething. LOVED it. That teether lasted through 2 (back-to-back) kids. Batteries held up like a champ, it still looked new, no breaks in the plastic, held up through frequent warm soapy washes (never fully submerged it, just wash and rinse) Loved it until I lost it.  Que baby #3. When she began showing signs of teething around 3 months old - I looked all over for this teether (WalMart, Target, BX...) No luck...but of course Amazon had it! (and at a decent price too) Arrived quickly and am in love with it just as before.Baby  can easily grab it and bring it to her mouth (she's now 5 months old). She enjoys biting on the vibrating part as well as the rings.  It's easy for her to hold in her tiny hands, the colors are vibrant, and appealing for "me" to look at every day as well - not like some other obnoxious baby toys out there, lol and soft enough for her not to whine too much if it hits her face (still working on her arm coordination).  I'm such a believer in this teether that I've decided to purchase one as part of every baby gift I give going forward! Love to share products that I've fallen in love with with others :)  GET IT. It doesn't disappoint!
