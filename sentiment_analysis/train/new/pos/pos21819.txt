This wall sticker is Beautiful!  I've bought other wall decals that look cheap...not this one.  This one looks almost as if it is actually painted on the wall.  Very pretty and elegant looking.  After putting it up my thought was that I should have ordered more.  Unlike plastic coated one's that have a glossy, plastic shine to them, this one is printed on paper with a matte finish.  You can put two or more of these decorations together and make your own designs.  The seller doesn't identify what flower they are supposed to be but they remind me of magnolias.
