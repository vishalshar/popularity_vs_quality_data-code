These are excellent mattress covers: thick and durable.  I haven't had a problem with the plastic bunching after washing/drying like I did with a different mattress cover.  Per someone's review here, we've been layering mattress cover and top sheet with another mattress cover and top sheet to make it easier when it needs to be changed- great idea!  And it's nice to have 2 of these for that reason.
