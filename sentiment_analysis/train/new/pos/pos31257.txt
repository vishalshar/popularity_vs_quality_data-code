I bought this for my nephew who is 4 months old and is really starting to like grabbing and playing with toys.  Covered in bright, captivating colors and a variety of fun textures, it is about 8 inches across, so it's not too large or overwhelming for the baby to maneuver around.Sir Prance A Lot (the knight) has a squeaker inside his head and is covered in a soft, fuzzy blue and green polyester fabric.  There is also a clip on top of his head so that the toy can be attached to a stroller or car seat.  The horse is mostly covered in a shinier, more satin-like fabric.  There are also ribbon "tags" for his mane and lining the edge of the "blanket" underneath his saddle.  The crinkle material that my nephew loves so much is located in the hooves and under the saddle blanket, and there is a bell inside the horse's head.  Two plastic rings make up the tail of Sir Prance A Lot's horse.It arrived in a sealed plastic bag, so it was well protected from the rain and snow.
