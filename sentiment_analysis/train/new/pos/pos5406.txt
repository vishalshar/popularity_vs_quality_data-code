Very satisfied with this playpen. It's big enough and sturdy enough for 2 grandchildren. Please note that 1 fitted sheet comes with the playpen. We bought a separate fitted sheet not knowing this, but having 2 sets works out when a replacement is needed on the fly (ie. spilled milk, diaper leak, etc.).As always, Amazon service and delivery time can't be beat.
