~BACKGROUND~I purchased this item - specifically the "Boy O Boy" to use for my newborn son in October 2012 to document his monthly birthday and growth.~PROS~- Easy to use - just peel and stick.- Reusable - just remove and put back on the paper for the next baby or to pass on to family/friends.- Stickers are nicely made.- Unique and interesting designs.~CONS~- None really!~TIPS~- If you know your baby's gender, buy it beforehand so that you are able to use month "0"!  :)- We use something similar to: C.R. Gibson First Year Timeline Photo Frame, White to house the month to month pictures.~CONCLUSION~It's just a neat way to take pictures of your baby as he/she grows and know exactly how how he/she is in the picture.
