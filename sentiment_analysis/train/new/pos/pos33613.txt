I use this on my City Mini GT.  I like it but wish it was just a little wider. I like the height. My feet can slip straight under it but I still have to adjust my stride just a little so my feet fall in the middle otherwise they hit the wheels.  I am six feet tall.  It is sturdy and very easy to attach and detach from the stroller.  They only thing I don't like about it is the clip to raise it when not in use. It is hard to clip and unclip so I just use a bungee cord.
