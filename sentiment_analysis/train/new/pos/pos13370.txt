This was a LITTLE complicated because the instructions aren't real clear when you've never used something like this before, like me.  But once you catch on, it's okay.  The only downside is that you need to be REALLY careful with the transfer sheet because there isn't any room for error.  This really isn't for beginners unless you have a laser level and drawn light pencil lines for a guide when you apply.  I wasn't aware of this (I thought they were more clings or stickers when I bought them) and one or two words are slightly crooked, but it is a REALLY terrific nursery idea.  I DO recommend it - just make sure you known what you're doing ;)
