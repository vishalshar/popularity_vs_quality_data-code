This bottle is perfect for our 2-month old. She is fed exclusively with breast milk, and when we decided to start pumping and using bottles (so Dad could get in on the feeding action) we had such a hard time finding a bottle that worked for her. This bottle simulates the let down of your breasts, which is great!The only downside is that these bottles leak if heated in a bottle warmer (with steam). The seal on the bottle holds otherwise. My husband and I ended up to heating up the breast milk in the storage bottles and then pouring it in this one for the feedings. Great product!
