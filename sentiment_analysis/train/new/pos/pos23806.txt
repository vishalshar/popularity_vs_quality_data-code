Purchased for my 5 mos old grandson since he started crawling and wanted something to keep him busy.  He loves this!!  Music is so cute!  Like a carnival/circus melody.  His head turns from side-to-side while rolling as well as the gadgets on his back.  That piece can actually be taken apart and baby can play with the pieces.  Button in front turns it on but you have to push down on his green tail in the back to make him roll.  My grandson already knows to push his tail and make him move.  I was worried about the grinding noise it makes when he tries to stop the wheels from moving but this toy is built tough.  Has to be because it's made for a baby.  Should take many abuses. lol
