This is a good quality, durable case and the color is perfect.  It protects the tablet well and the hard material makes it easier to handle a tablet of this size. The only adjustment I would make is that with a 12.2 tablet, the cover needs to have a strap to secure it.  If I hold my tablet in landscape position, the top 3rd of the cover flaps down.
