A friend of mine recommended the mother towel, and I am glad they did!  As I new parent, bathing is quite an intimidating process.  I guess we have to bathe our children, but why does it have to be so challenging?  This Mother Towel has really made this activity much easier.  It's like an apron with Velcro, which makes it much simpler to pick up my daughter from the tub.  I also don't get drenched which is a wonderful perk!  The size is great, and the material is soft.  We are using it frequently.
