I'm quite happy with this sleeping bag. The 2.5 tog bag has a polyester filling, not thick at all - just like a fleece blanket. I do throw a woven blanket over it and the baby doesn't kick it off because of the sleeping bag. So it could have been warmer in my opinion. On the other hand I don't heat his room at all, so the temperature there is around 65 degrees and all he wears under the bag is a thin footed pajama. My baby is 7.5 months old and the bag has a lot of room for him to grow - he is 26.5" high and the bag is 37" long. So it seems he will sleep in it until he is 18 months. The bag washes well, and I dry it on medium heat setting, even though it says to use the low setting - nothing happened to it. I did order another one from Keen Distribution directly - they have more colors available. I figured you need two of them (I had to wash it every day for a while, so you better have one more).So the four stars is for not being warm enough, other than that - easy to use, washes well, the cotton is soft and cuddly and I did order one more.Hope this helps.
