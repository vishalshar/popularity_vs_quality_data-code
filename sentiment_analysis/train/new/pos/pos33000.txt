I built an oak bassinet for my granddaughter and while designing it, I researched the commercial pads in use to ensure I that the dimensions of my design were compatible with the pads and mattress products used in commercial bassinets. I'm a carpenter, not a seamstress so making a pad was outside my skill set. Since the bassinet was intended to serve more than one child, I wanted to have a durable, and replaceable pad. I purchased this pad and found it to be a reasonable price, well made and a good complement to an "heirloom bassinet" that has been deployed successfully and is fully approved by my daughter, a very picky customer!
