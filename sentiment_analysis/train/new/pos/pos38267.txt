I bought this cup after seeing it recommended on a blog I read regularly. I figured for the price and with the recommendation it had to be better than the cheap(er) two-pack cups I picked up Target. I do think this is a good cup, but I wish I had bought the one with the handles. I put this in my daughter's stocking for Christmas; she was 13 months old at the time. We tried using it right away but she had a hard time holding the cup because when it was full it was pretty heavy and without handles it was hard for her to grip. Plus, it we used it at dinner time for water, she had an especially hard time picking it up when her hands would be covered in food. Now that she is nearly 17 months old she has a much easier time.I still don't love that if she doesn't put it down perfectly it rolls all over. But it is nice that we have not yet had a leak (can't say that about the Nuby and Playtex brands). I also really enjoy that the straw can be covered up when the cup is not in use.Overall I'm pretty happy because I have learned that most sippy cups can become leaky pieces of junk pretty quickly. I would probably scoop up more of these though if they were only a couple bucks cheaper.
