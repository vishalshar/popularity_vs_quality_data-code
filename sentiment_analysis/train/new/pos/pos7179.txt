The bane of my urban existence is the space suitcases take up in a home where every spare square foot is valuable.  I bought one of these for a stroller, and immediately upon seeing how sturdy they are, I realized they were perfect for holding suitcases, so I bought 2 more.  Just stick them on a door-and you are set! Take them with you to a hotel, and you don't have to jump over your suitcase your entire vacation! They will hold any bulky item , without having to drill or leave holes.  True, they are on the expensive side, but considering they are portable, and all the different ways they can be used during the year, I think you will find they are worth every penny.
