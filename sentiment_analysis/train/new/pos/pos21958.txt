I love the OXO line! This is our first sippy/straw cup from the OXO line. I've tried all brand variations of different toddler sippy cups, but in the end the straws always get really moldy and they don't sell replacements. I chose this cup because they have replacement straws which will make it easier to replace if needed so w/o buying a whole new sippy cup-especially when my daughter who is 2.5 has already established a liking for a particular cup. This cup is very durable and of great quality! I love that the cup is clear, which makes managing her liquid intake easy.
