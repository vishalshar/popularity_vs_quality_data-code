We bought our first Secure Stair Gate 3 years ago on the advice of friends.  It worked very well until... you guessed it, the latch knob broke and the gate was stuck shut (not a safety issue for us since we use this to stop children from going into the basement).I read many reviews and was skeptical enough about buying another one that I contacted The First Years.  They didn't offer me a free gate or anything, but they did reassure me that the latch has been redesigned.Our new replacement Secure Stair Gate does indeed have a different latch mechanism, and it has not yet broken.  The latch portion is still riveted (screws would allow me to fix it myself), but I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that the redesign has made this a better gate.  It fit into our existing hinge and latch plates, so no new holes were required to fit the new one into the old doorway.
