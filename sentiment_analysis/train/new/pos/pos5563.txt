This is like putting your baby inside a sleeping bag, which is perfect for winter.  I open it up when we are in the car, so our LO doesn't get overheated.  The other nice thing is that LO gets dressed regularly, snuggles in the car seat and we have LO in the car within minutes instead of the usual routine of getting baby in their clothes followed by a coat and covering with a blanket.  Awesome.
