I got these for my 3 1/2 year old daughter at preschool for her lunches.  She can easily open them and we use them daily.  Needless to say, she is neither very neat or very gentle and these have held up to major wear and tear.  They have also handled smashed blueberries, crushed oranges, PB and J sandwich messes and come out clean and ready for the next round.  The closure is velcro so you don't get the same super seal as a ziploc or something but I haven't found that hours in the bag have lost freshness.  I fold it to where it's enclosed.  The design is also cute and sweet and not too garish as some others that I have seen.  These have been handwashed and dishwasher washed and still show no sign of wear.  Would recommend to anyone.
