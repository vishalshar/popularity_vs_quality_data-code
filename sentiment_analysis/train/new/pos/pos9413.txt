I really like these swaddle blankets. They are very multi-purpose and do a ton of things; I used them to cover the stroller basinet mattress and as a sun shade over the top of the stroller at times. I've seen a few styles of Aden and Anais swaddles and I was a bit sad these weren't the super-soft to the touch ones I'd seen in the store. They certainly aren't at all rough, just feel like standard cotton instead of the other style that's softer. However, these two have been much more durable than my softer swaddle. No loose threads at all after months of use.As for using them to swaddle, they are a bit bulky but big enough to do the trick fine. I think they're a great multi-purpose gift as well.
