We have been storing my 20 month daughter's toys in an open box in the living room since she was born. I finally got sick of looking at them at night and wanted something that I could close after she had gone to bed. This fits the bill perfectly. My daughter likes to climb and she likes to climb into the toy box. So I like that the box is soft. I also like that it has an organizing compartment that I can put all of the little plastic random toys that we seem to accumulate. It has a side compartment to put books or puzzles and a fold down playmat that we don't use, but I think I would have when she was younger. But the best part- it closes! So my living room looks much neater at night or when we have company. My husband always complains when I buy things that he feels are unnecessary, I thought he would complain about this purchase, since we already had a toy box. But even he likes it and feels it is much better than what we had before. I highly recommend this toy box.
