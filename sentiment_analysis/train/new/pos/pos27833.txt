We used one of these while on vacation and it was great...the only problem was that we based our purchase on the older version which was entirely analog with no digital sounds or buttons. The older model also had a lot of great "real" toys built in with a larger tray to place toys.The newer model featured here (the one we bought) is great too, but the mostly digital focus is a step backwards in my opinion. Of course our baby loves this one, I just wish that it had less of the electronic buttons and more of the "old-school" toys. Without seeing the old one, it is hard to imagine...it had a cool globe thingy and lots of things to turn and move around. We make up for this by attaching stuff to the new version and by not installing the cup holder. Also, we did not install batteries...when our baby gets older, we will add the batteries to hold his attention.Our baby was 4 months old and had no problems with this. I think it actually helped him gain some independence and some motor skills.Overall a very good purchase and glad we didn't get the ones that move in a huge circle.
