Received this quickly and set up in under 30 seconds.  Seems sturdy and functional, only time will tell though how it hangs up.  One note to clarify the issue of the lid being too tight and making the sides buckle in that other reviewers have complained about.  If you read the instructions, and follow some common sense, the lid fits inside the hamper and there is a large lip all the way around to keep it up at the top.  It will buckle if you try to fit the hamper inside the lid, as it is smaller by design.
