Four stars only because I don't have the baby yet and have not used the product yet. I plan to update.Even though little one inst here yet I already am in LOVE with this product. It was so easy to put together! It arrived very quickly and was in perfect condition. I put it together in literally minutes! Looks just like pictured and actually holds a lot more on the tray then I imagined! Its wonderful and absolutely beautiful in my nursery.Only disappointment/complaints:1) Did not know it came in other colors! On the box it showed it also comes in blue, red, pink etc and had I known that I would have ordered the red to match our nursery theme more. Wish that was listed on amazon as well.2) The product was wrapped in plastic and sadly the plastic was UNDER the screws. It was hard to peel it off and there is little pieces that are impossible to remove around almost every screw. Though it doesn't distract from the product and doesn't appear to be dangerous to me. :) It was just a hassle unwrapping it.
