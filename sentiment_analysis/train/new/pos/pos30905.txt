A sweet little design with 20 photo pages. It's not specifically branded for Grandma or as a brag book, so it could be a good photo album for anyone and anything one wants to show off. The photo square on the cover is genius. I stuck in a 2X3" wallet photo but it didn't quite fill in the space. I'd recommend cutting up a big photo into a 2.25" square to best use the cover slot.
