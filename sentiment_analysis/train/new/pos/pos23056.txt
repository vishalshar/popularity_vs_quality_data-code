I purchased this pump after my daughter was born in July 2008.  I had difficulties nursing and pumping so this pump did not work for me then.  Now after the birth of my son October 2011 I have been using a Medela Harmony hand pump for about a month since I returned to work and decided to give this pump a revisit.  I went from getting 3-5 ounces in 15-20 minutes one side at a time to 5-7 ounces in under 15 minutes.  I pump 3 times a day 5 times a week so a double electric is huge for me.  The pump is loud but hey it's a pump, it has a motor, big deal.  I haven't used the pump with batteries yet and I'm still working out some of the kinks.  I still can't believe I got 7 ounces my first morning pump this time around, that's about half of what I was getting a whole day with the Medela hand pump.  I used the main pump (stronger suction) on my more empty breast which seems to be a pretty good technique.  I also used the silicon adapters.  I can't afford a more expensive pump right now so I am hoping the motor holds out.  I will update later after I've had more time with the pump this time around.  Also, I had the pump stored in our garage in the nylon cooler bag for 3 years and it still works fine.
