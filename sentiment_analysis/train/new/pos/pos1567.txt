This mobile looks pretty over my baby's crib.  It's big enough for baby to look at lying on her back.  Easy to assemble.  The toys face down so the baby actually gets to see their faces.  The only complaint is the music goes way too fast - it excites my baby rather than calming her down.  My baby kicks to the rhythm instead of falling asleep.  I'm looking for a good replacement of the mobile part.
