I really like this bouncer. When my son was having a difficult time sleeping in his bassinet, I would just put him in the bouncer and he'd fall right asleep. I know almost everything had to do with the vibrating motion feature. This was a real life saver for a Mom who had to deal with a one month old infant who wasn't sleeping much. The only thing I don't like about it is that you sometimes have to keep shifting the on/off button back and forth in order for it to go on, even after you put in new batteries. Other than that, I have no complaints. I'd recommend it.
