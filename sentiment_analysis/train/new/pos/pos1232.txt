If you had all the time in the world you could make these yourself, but who does. The envelopes are paper with standard life saver mints inside. We put one on each place setting at our baby's homecoming/christening party and they really gave each place setting a nice extra touch that was very noticeable for the money. The phrases were very cute and they went well with our rubber ducky theme. I put some more in a little bin in the restroom. I wouldn't rely on these exclusively for a giveaway but they certainly have a great presence that made our guests feel like we really did think of everything!
