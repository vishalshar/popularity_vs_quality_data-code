These are nice baskets and a good value for the price.  I found them to be slightly smaller than I had hoped.  The baskets are quite a bit smaller at the base than at the top.  The measurements provided are for the top of the basket.  So the storage capacity is quite a bit smaller than the measurements might lead one to believe.  Still nice baskets but I probably wouldn't have purchased based on their actual size.
