My friends loved this blanket for their girl.  They said that most of the blankets for their girl are the smaller ones you get for newborns so they are excited to have this larger blanket for her crib.  When I received it, I opened it and just thought it seemed so soft and comforting.I don't know that white was the most sensible thing I could have bought for them, but it's so pretty, and maybe it will be more of a decorative memorabilia for their firstborn than a practical gift? I think that's fine because the baby's mother is a dear childhood friend of mine so I wanted to make sure I sent a very special gift.
