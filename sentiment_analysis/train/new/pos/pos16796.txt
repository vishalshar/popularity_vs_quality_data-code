these little stickers are awesome and encourage you to photograph your baby every month as he/she grows during his/her first year of life. I really like this idea, and am so happy that I have photos every month of my baby for the first 12 months (where you see most rapid changes) - I would definitely recommend to everyone. Is also a great/thoughtful gift for new parents.
