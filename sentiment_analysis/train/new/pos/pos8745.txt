Nice 1st truck for baby - our little one is 10 months old and loves this tool truck. he takes out each tool and the driver guy to play with, throw, chew, and each has held up to his smashing, bam bam, rough and tumble play. The truck is light and has no sharp corners that he can hurt himself on. The wheels can be turned with the screw driver or wrench and make sounds. As he gets older, I'm sure he will love this tool truck even more.
