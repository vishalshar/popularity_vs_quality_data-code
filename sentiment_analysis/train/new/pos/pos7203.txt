Does the job I needed it for which was to transform sister's carseat into a "new" carseat so the opinionated 3 year-old would use it!  It's a thin, basic, slipcover.  It would not provide much protection against anything moist.  It has an elastic drawstring around the edge and a velcro panel to fit the straps through.  I'm using it on a Safet 1st Guide 65 and it doesn't quite fit around the sides but I think it will be "good enough".  I think it's absolutely hideous but my daughter loves it and if it keeps me from having to buy a different carseat, I'll say it's a good product!
