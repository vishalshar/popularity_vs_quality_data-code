I'll admit, I was laughed at by my family when a box came in the mail labeled baby playnest. I was asked why I had gotten a bird nest for my baby and so now it is referred to as the baby bird nest. I bought this when my baby was around five weeks old (She's four months now) and I've sat her up against the side at first with a rolled up receiving blanket behind her for extra support. She loves to look at the bright colors and pictures on the edges of the nest, everything is beautifully illustrated and in wonderful detail. I didn't buy the playnest and gym version of this toy because of bad reviews on it, but to make this into a playnest and gym I put a Bright Starts gym over the nest by sliding it between the mat and the arches, causing the arches to hang over the nest. inflating it is super easy, you can use a pump or an air compressor but I've just inflated it with my mouth and it only took about five minutes. Remember to put the tube inside the fabric part before inflating it. I really like the three dimentional details on the nest, the squeaky duck beak, the silky bucket, the fuzzy sheep's back, the shiny crinckle wing and the big crinckly pig pen door. I actually like this over the Bumbo and other infant positioning seats for helping them to learn to sit up independently because it allows for more space for movement in a very safe space. If the baby flops over they are surrounded on all sides by squishy innertube. It's nice to put a baby in something like this without confining them with straps and not having to worry that the child will get hurt or fall out.
