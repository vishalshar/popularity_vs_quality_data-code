I love these booster seats. I have had a in home day care for 17 years.  I only use these boosters for all kids that can sit up on themselves.  The 3 pt harness is fully adjustable and the child is safe and secure.  The toddlers I use only the booster at the table.  The booster is height adjustable which helps to get the child at the correct height to eat easily.  The younger kids is use with the tray and tray liner.  I purchased extra liners from Fischer-Price and use one at each meal/child.  They come off easily and I just put in dish washer.  Has made clean up so much quicker.  I also just set the trays to put the food items on prior to putting on the tray.  Love that they attach to the chair on the bottom and the back.  You can get it held tightly to the chair.  The kids feet do rest on the chair so they will try to push the chair up.  They can some but not enough to be of concern.  The price at Amazon was much better then the local stores.  Plus this color wasn't available locally.  The color blends in with more natural colors.  Chair is nice and portable.  The back does fold down to carry but never folds down at unwanted times.  Yes I love these chairs.  I do have kids with food allergies.  It is nice to be able to move the child away from the table where others may "share" their food.
