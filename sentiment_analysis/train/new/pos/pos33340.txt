One of the best neck support pillows. I purchased this as a last resort, I had tried so many other neck support pillows and nothing worked for my baby. Most of them pushed baby's head forward and only added to the problem. My baby's physical therapist was very impressed with this pillow. I buy one for all my new mom friends.
