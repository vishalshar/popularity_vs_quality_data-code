Dad here.  I think this is a scam.  If you believe it works, it will, until it doesn't.  The baby cried a couple nights, we put it on her, she didn't cry.  I still don't believe it works, but she didn't cry and I didn't want to take a chance.  Months later, we are trying new foods (rice cereal) and nothing stops her from crying.  The necklace looks nice on her though so 5-stars for that.  As far as mystical healing / soothing properties, I don't believe in that stuff, though several of my wife's friends do.  We wrap her ankle with it overnight when we use it, but it looks nice as a necklace during the day.
