This is the best!! Seriously one of the best baby items I've purchased. I have a stooke high chair. The trays that fit it run about $60-$100 so there was no way. Plus the whole point of the chair is you can push it right up to the table, and our kitchen is tiny so the tray would take up too much space anyway. However I quickly realized that putting food on the table top was gross (our cat was always up there) and messy. A plate was out of the question as my 7 month old would happily throw that and all the food on the floor. So I found this tray, it's easy to clean as the top lifts off. I even bring it to restaurants and my parents house.
