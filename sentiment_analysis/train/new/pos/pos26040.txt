These are such a hot seller right now! I customize them (put baby's name or birth stats). I was using a different vendor who was a little bit cheaper, but after shipping, ended up costing more than this seller. Not to mention this seller is 2 day for prime. I am so happy I found this seller, best price around that I have found (and I have looked ALOT!!)The blanket is a beautiful light mint color with a paisley print satin border. It is very soft and by far my best baby shower gift. I always make them for everyone I know having a girl. I really like how inside the head is a soft rattle.. that is just the icing on the cake to me. This blanket is the perfect size for little ones too. I would highly recommend this seller and this product!!
