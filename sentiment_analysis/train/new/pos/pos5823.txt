We bought this for our trip to Disney World after learning how much it rains during our first trip.  The cover fit the stroller well even with our two kids inside but is impossible to get back into the packaging so don't bother trying.  The fit was as shown in the provided picture.  It did rip on the bottom along the exterior stitching.  I am going to try and stitch additional fabric over it to prevent further damage.
