The hammock is a great addition to a baby bathtub. My only complaint is when you use it the first time make sure you put enough water in it before you put baby in otherwise it flips. It becomes top heavy and the tub flips over. But we use this tub almost daily and once we realized we had to put enough water in first everything went great. There is a line along the bottom of the tub. Fill it to that line and you should be good. It's much better than using a reg tub so the baby doesn't sit on the bottom of the tub when they can't hold up their heads. My daughter is a first time mom and was very scarred giving a baby. This was very helpful
