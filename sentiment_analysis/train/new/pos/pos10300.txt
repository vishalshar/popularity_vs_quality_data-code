I ordered this bowl and spoon set at the recommendation of a friend that the spoon was great.  I could have just ordered the spoons from another website, but I needed a travel bowl like this with separator anyway.  I wish I had ordered this sooner!!! The spoon is fantastic!!! It is easier for me to feed my son and easier for him to eat his purees. He is currently 8 months old and this would have been great from 6 months when we started on solids. I highly recommend this product.  The bowl is convenient and the spoon has been a lifesaver. The only wish Amazon or the seller would let you choose a color. The image shows a blue bowl and I received a pink one with green top, orange spoon. I have a boy and it would be nice to have a choice between a traditional boy color or girl color.
