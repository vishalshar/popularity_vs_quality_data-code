I was trying to figure out what size to buy for my babies, so I looked up the info on their website.  Here is what I learned:It is recommended to get the swim diapers according to weight, not age.  (You will notice that the age and weights below do NOT match up.)  If you baby has bigger thighs, and you are in between sizes, then go up a size.  It is supposed to be snug around the thighs to keep in solids, but you don't want it too tight.Here is the sizing from the Manufacturer:12 months = 10 - 15 lbs18 months = 15 - 20 lbs24 months = 18 - 25 lbs2T = 20 - 30 lbs3T = 30 - 40 lbs4T = 40+ lbsI hope this is helpful to you as well.
