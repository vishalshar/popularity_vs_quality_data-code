I ordered two packs of these to combine them into one long mat for my daughter's play area in our living room.  They were a great addition to her play area.  I have hardwood floors throughout the house and my daughter was bonking her little head so much when she was learning to crawl.  The mat pieces are very thick and feel comfortable, even to me, to walk on.  There is lots of cushion to them.  When she mastered crawling, and wanted to crawl absolutely everywhere and far away from her mat,  I transformed them into cubes that she used to pull herself up on and that she's currently using as a way to walk around with.  I wish I had bought these sooner.  My daughter hated tummy time in the beginning and I believe it was because of the hard floor being so uncomfortable for her.  These were a great solution to make my floors softer and more comfortable to my baby.
