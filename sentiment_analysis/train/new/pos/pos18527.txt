I looked at all the different spout covers avalible and decided on this one because it's so cute and looked like it was the softest in case baby did hit their head. I'm really happy with this one. It fits perfectly on the bath spout and there is a cute feature where a small stream of water comes out of the big whales mouth. My baby is going to love this once he's old enough. The small whale on top is there in case you have a shower pull, however I would not recomend this one if you have that because you'll have to remove the whale each time you take a shower in order to access the pull.
