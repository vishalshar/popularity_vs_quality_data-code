I bought this for our baby with combination of Lamaze socks and it works out well. It catches baby's attention and the rattling is just right sound level, not too noisy, not too quiet. But, if your baby's hand is chunky, you will have little bit of issues with one of the rattles. The strip is made out of beautiful but fuzzy material and it is not too long, so it barely fits on the hand of our little one. The other rattle is pretty ok.
