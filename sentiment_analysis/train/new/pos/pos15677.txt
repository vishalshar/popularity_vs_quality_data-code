I love my double BOB! but this summer the bugs have been horrible, so walking in the evening was difficult with 2 young kids.  WE bought the sun shield for the stroller and not only does if keep the sun out but also those pesky bugs and mosquitos.  The cover takes a bit of a learning curve to get it fitted properly but once you get it down it is so easy.  My son has sensitive eye and loves having his shade on the stroller!
