We bought this when my son was starting to sit up on his own, around 6 months. For a couple of months, it worked perfectly- we set it up in any room where we were, put a bunch of toys on its, and sat him down. It cushioned him when he fell and he learned to roll over and eventually crawl on this mat, which was a huge for us because we have hardwood floors.  It was easy to wipe off with a wet towel when the dog hairs got to be too much (which didn't take long), and it traveled pretty well.However, once his fine motor skills developed a little more, the inserted pieces were too tempting and the minute we set him down on the mat, up they came, and into the mouth they went.  He incessantly pulled the borders off and ate those, so we had to put it away. I think we will probably pull it out again when he is old enough to actually put the pieces back in where they belong and is not so keen on eating everything. I'd say this is a good buy for up to 10 months or so and then again after about 2.
