I have used similar red bags in the past & felt like they should be labeled disposable or one use so I honestly didn't have much hope when ordering this bag. I truthfully only ordered it because the bright color would be easy to spot. When the bag arrived I promptly opened it to ensure my Britax infant seat would fit. The bag was stuffed inside its own storage bag. When opened this bag is huge! My seat plus a base fit with plenty of room to spare. The fabric is thicker canvas not the thin, umbrella like material of other bags. I loved the cute message printed on the bag & the place to write in baby's name. The real test came on our long trip. The bag was gate checked 3 times each way and carried across numerous airports with not much gentleness. The bag stayed intact, no holes & stayed closed to completely protect our expensive seat. The only sign of wear on the bag was the dirt the bag was designed to keep out.  This is definitely a bag we will be able to use again & again.
