Pros:-Thick and will be really warm as temperatures start to drop-Really vibrant pattern, it's almost exactly like the picture-Pretty big and should be big enough well into the toddler stage-The fabric can take a beatingCons:-The pattern is one-sided-It's really stiffI was looking for blankets that I could swaddle my two month old son in and he would be able to kick around without him kicking the blanket off. He likes being swaddled, but still likes to be able to move his legs and likes the resistance. As much as I like the camouflage pattern, it's only on one side and personally I am not a big fan and the blanket has NO ability to stretch. In fact, it's really stiff and rough almost like it's starched. That probably will go away with washing it a few times, but it's a bit disconcerting considering it's a baby blanket. Although, the blanket is really warm (hence thermal) and pretty big so it will make an excellent car blanket. Overall it was a good purchase, just not exactly what I was looking for. My package arrived sooner than expected and if you are looking for something warm, durable, and functional this is a good product. I will update on the starchiness when I put it through the washer and dryer a few times.UPDATE: Put it through the wash a few times (I did once with fabric softener) and it did the trick. I'm glad I bought two because it's the go-to blanket for traveling. It's not cashmere soft, but it's a nice blanket that can get tossed around and I don't care if some mushed carrots and baby cereal gets on to. Overall, I'm pretty happy I bought these.
