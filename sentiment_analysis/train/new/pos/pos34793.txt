I purchased an Amazon Open Box item, and it was awesome. Saved approximately $10 per gate by purchasing Open Box. I purchased this to fence off my kitchen area as I am housebreaking an 11 week old Wheaten terrier.  The only caution I have for those who are using this to fence off puppies is, be cautious that he/she may sneak out as my little escape artist has done!
