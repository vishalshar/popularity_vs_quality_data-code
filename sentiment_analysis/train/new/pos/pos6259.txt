My daughter has used the Dora utensils for several years and though she can use adult utensils, she still uses these on occasion simply because she likes them.  They have been through the dishwasher innumerous times in the silverware bin on the bottom-rack with no adverse effect.  There has been no fading or chipping of the color on the plastic handles and the metal has remained untarnished.
