Baby manicures are the absolute worst, and you have to trim their nails every other day, right? These clippers make the job easier because you can use them while baby is sleeping and therefore still, but even in daylight the light on the clippers makes it easier to see what you're doing. And when  you're dealing with tiny fingers, tiny nails, and tiny babies, as well as postpartum hormones that make you cry if you nip baby's finger... well, any help is good help.The clippers are sharp and make clean cuts, not applying excessive pressure to the nails and unduly upsetting baby. The included nail file... well, the grit is so fine you'd be at it forever trying to remove length, but for cleanup it's fine. Good luck keeping track of it, though.The large grip is helpful if your hands shake at all, as mine do - not good for fine detail work like baby manicure day.The primary drawback to these is that the safety feature(?) of plastic around the top of the clippers actually makes them a bit harder to use. I think it's meant so you don't cut too close to the edge of the nail, but it just makes it a bit unwieldy. They're basically impossible to use for toenail trims on an infant because of this - the bulk just doesn't fit. Works fine for toddler toes, though. Not that I've ever had to cut my toddler's toenails while he was sleeping or anything.
