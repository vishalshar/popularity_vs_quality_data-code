This product fits our Summer Infant Contour Changing Pad like a glove. The color appears lighter than pictured, however it still matches our changing table hardware perfectly. It is very soft to touch and as a result, we have chosen this as our primary cover out of the three we have available. The exceptional quality of this product has ignited my interest in other products the manufacturer carries. This is money well-spent in my book.
