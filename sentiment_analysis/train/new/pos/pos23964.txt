We have a late teether who is now 17 months and working on her 7th tooth.  She teeths slow and HARD.  She has tried and despised many, many teethers.  While the freezable teethers were fine before she had any teeth at all, she can't comfortably put them into her mouth anymore.  These sticks (both of which we use as teethers, minus the ridiculous round guard thing) are her absolute favorite teethers, and, along with her toothbrush and bits of ice, the only thing she'll even try to alleviate teething distress.  We love them.  And we love that they are made of PVC, pthalate, and bpa free, plant (not petroleum) based plastic.
