Disclaimer - my son never loved being placed in a swing or a product like this so we didn't get a ton of use on this. But for a high needs baby this was still nice, it gave me some small moments to go to the bathroom or prep a meal before my son screamed to be held.Pros:+As others have said, the quality is nice and the seat seems comfortable.+There are multiple settings.+The main reason I bought this is because it can plug into the wall, it has worked fine+Easy to put together+Very sturdy (but does take a lot of space and doesn't fold easily)Cons:-After a month of use I had to call customer service to replace the motor (great customer service, easy to replace the part).  I have a feeling that if I used it more then I would have to replace it again.-My son was 10 pounds when he was born and grew out of this before his first birthday-The little guy never was too interested in the mobile or the toys on the trey.  They are very dull in color.-We never used the music settings or various sounds but they seemed very loud for being so close to little ears.Although there are a bunch of cons this still is the best plug in swing I could find after a lot of research. In retrospect I wouldn't buy this, the rock and play we eventually bought would have been fit for purpose.

However, I know some kinds, who love swings and if my boy were a swing lover this probably would have lasted much longer!
