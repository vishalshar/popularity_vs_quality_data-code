My husband and I got this for our 3 month old for Christmas and he loves it!  The handles are made so he can get his chubby little hands wrapped around them and press the buttons.  Any time he cries, we turn it on, and he stops immediately to look at the lights and grab ahold of it.  Recently, we took a plane ride and took this toy with us...and the passengers on the plane were happy because it kept him quite without blaring the music (thanks to the volume settings).  I would definitely recommend this to any parent whose baby is interested in lights.
