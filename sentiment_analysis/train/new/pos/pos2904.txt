I still have it and I'm using it. People are complaining of the Lansinoh bags not fitting, well if you freeze them in this bin, they do fit. I double bag the frozen pouches in ziploc bags and store in a separate freezer bin when I have more milk than will fit in this bin alone. I primarily use this to flatten and freeze fresh milk not just as a 'permanent' storage.
