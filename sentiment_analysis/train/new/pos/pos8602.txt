I received this as a baby shower gift and I absolutely fell in love with how beautiful it is! I couldn't be happier. I can't wait to see how it holds up to washing/drying over a period of time. (will update the review after a few months)UPDATE (10 months later)- This wonderful set has done VERY well in the washing and drying process. It has remained soft, no pilling, no tearing, no discoloration! I recommend this to anyone!
