I almost returned this. I had the label printed off and the box ready to go. I was unconvinced it was needed and felt guilty about buying a sheepskin to begin with. The baby was playing in her playpen and the floor was drafty. I put her on it and she took a two hour nap (unheard of). When she was done playing, for the first time this winter, her little hands were not ice cold from the draft that lays low on the ground in our flat. We kept it. Sometimes I still feel a little guilty, but it's incredibly soft and fluffy and warm. She loves to run her fingers through it as she lies down. It's a really decent size for the money, smelled only so faintly sheepy (like wool) when unpacked, but not at all chemical, and I had picked the company because they seemed legit (no outsourced overseas labor). This is a beautiful rug. I'm glad we didn't return.  We now carry it back and forth between her playpen, the living room floor, and the crib for play each and every day.Update:It is summer and I cut holes in this for straps to or it in her stroller as a liner. It's the only thing that stops her from sweating buckets and she sits and lies so comfortably on it. I may have to purchase a dedicated sheepy stroller liner at this point.Update:the now 17 month old kiddo uses this as a rug in her "playroom" (a glorified hallway nook with a toy chest and baby gates). It's super cushy. She loves to sit and lay on it while she smashes her blocks into the floor with gusto. I washed it once on a delicate/wool cycle in the washing machine. My mom actually did it with Meyers detergent, which I wouldn't have done, but it came out absolutely clean and fine, air dried over the course of 2-3 days and I brushed it out with a carding brush back to utter fluffiness. Mostly, brushing it out seems to do the trick on making it clean and new again. We only washed because of outright necessity (spills etc)
