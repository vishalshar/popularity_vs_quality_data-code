Wow, this is WAY better than the NoseFrida. I've used both and here is my observation:NoseFrida1. All the pieces fall apart2. The pieces are hard and the main tube to suction my baby's snot is big and hard.  His nostrils are so tiny so he cries bad when I try to put it against/up his nose3. It has the filter you have to replace all the time. This falls off as well.4. No case, no cap so unsanitaryThe #1 Baby Nasal Aspirator1. Soft tip made from silicon and is narrow so it goes up easily in my baby's nostrils w/out hurting him. He doesnt cry.2. Has a case and cap to cover the tip to keep clean3. Does not fall off and stays together.4. No replacements5. Just the best, works really well. Cord can be a bit longer.
