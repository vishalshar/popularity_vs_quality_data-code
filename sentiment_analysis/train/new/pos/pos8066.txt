We got this for our almost 3 year old son. He loves using it. Although it's a bit tricky, he has figured out how to turn around all by himself. I like that is has a tall lip that helps keep everything in the toilet. We had a friend from his class over for a playdate the other day and she's potty learning too. She saw it and instantly figured how to climb up, turn around, and use it.There are two positions for the step, which is nice. You can also adjust the height of the feet. I like how easy it is to put on to the toilet (just hook the little tongue from the back under the seat) and how nicely it folds up when an adult needs to use the toilet.It is a bit unstable, but it's just plastic and I've yet to see a review for a seat like this that doesn't mention that. Also, while the high lip is great, it adds a large amount of plastic to the front, so sometimes pee ends up on the inside of the seat instead of in the toilet. Not a huge deal breaker, but I figured I'd mention it.Update 7/30 - Still like this seat a lot. Got a second one for our downstairs bathroom. We brought it to my mother's house when we visited. She must have smaller toilet seats than we do, as it wasn't as easy to get the Kiddyloo to sit on her toilets. However, if I sort of kicked the legs out a bit after putting the seat on, it would fit just fine. My son still really loves the independence the seat gives him to go to the potty by himself.
