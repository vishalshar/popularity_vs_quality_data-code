My 20 month old had outgrown our Ergo and I needed something just a LITTLE bigger (especially in the back panel--he's a leaner) until he made it to a toddler/preschool carrier size. I hadn't heard of Beco until recently and this is great! The perfect size for my 34.5"+ 27lb toddler.PROS: Soft body, extra padding for child's legs, super cute print on back panel, adjustment strap for top of shoulder strap (helps keep kiddo snug if you want a tighter fit or loosens if you want a more loose fit for a wiggler), toy holding loop, very safe buckles, velcro pocket on waist band to hold items. Fits my narrow shoulders better than the Ergo.CONS: Very few. Preferential, really. New out of box the waist band is very stiff, although the rest of the carrier is soft. I haven't owned it long enough to wear it in or wash it, so I'm not sure how that will affect things. Having been used to the Ergo previously, the buckles and straps take a little getting used to as they adjust differently.Good to know: I'm 5'6", a little overweight ("fluffy" if you will) and this carrier fits me well. It also fits my 6'3" husband.
