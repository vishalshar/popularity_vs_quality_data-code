I cannot tell you how much we love the HABA pacifier clips.  We had tried many of the fabric ones before we found the HABA wooden ones. They would get yucky and grungy quick because the baby would both suck on his pacifier, and would then chew on the fabric pacifier clip.  YUCK. Then came the day when we saw a wooden one. Was it more expensive? Yes. Is it totally worth it? YES.The wooden clip doesn't get dirty and yucky the way a fabric one does - our son has chewed on his while teething and it came through that just fine, no broken beads, no chipped paint . They clip on to clothes so easily!Plus, we get a ton of compliments on these because they are different and work well. I highly recommend them!
