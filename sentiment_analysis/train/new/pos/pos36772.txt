This was a breeze to put together. The back of the chair is cushiony and high enough to support my daughter's head (the top of it hits right at the top of her neck). The toys are simple but my daughter seems to like them, specially the sound and lights. My 4 yr old son liked it too and actually wanted to get in! He pushes his sister around all over the house and she loves it! She's able to touch the floor, she's 20 lbs and about 28 inches tall. The only thing is, the battery for the lights and sound part is not replaceable so that my be an issue when it starts dying out but hopefully it'll last until she no longer needs the walker.
