I'm glad I bought this hamper!  I only wish there were a few other color selections, but my first baby was a "surprise" so I went with Ecru.  It's easy to wash and has an inner bag for "Grab'N Go" laundry days.  I'm not into frilly designs for my girls and am buying this same hamper for my 2nd daughter's room knowing that if the main theme changes, I can still use this hamper.  Plus, if I ever have boys, they could use it too.
