I bought this in preparation for a move from Germany back to the US. I wanted to get it ahead of time to let our daughter get used to it, since all of our furniture would be packed up and on a boat for a loooong time.I had her take naps in it at home instead of her crib (13-14 months old) and for date nights, I would bring it to the babysitter's house.It fit easily in our big luggage for the flight back to the US and it wasn't heavy at all. It fit perfectly under the "desk" built into our hotel room and you can see Chloe didn't have an issue sleeping on it. She was able to crawl up on down from it with no problem. She does tend to...migrate...when she sleeps, so we would put blankets or pillows down if the floor wasn't carpeted.I would and have recommended this to friends and family.Pic 1 - 15 months old (babysitter's house)Pic 2 - 17 months old (hotel in Germany)Pic 3 - 18 months old (hotel in US)Pic 4 - 21 months old (in our new home!)
