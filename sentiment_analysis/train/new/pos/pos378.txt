I had gotten the Eddie Bauer Shopping Cart Cover, Geo Print from my baby shower, and planned to use it when my son could sit up. However, the first time I tried to use that cover, I couldn't get it to fit on any of the carts I tried, and my son just flopped over. The Leachco cover seemed like the perfect solution! My son started using it at 5 months, before he could really sit up alone but he was strong enough to be propped up. He loved sitting in the "big kid" seat and looking around while shopping! The pillows on either side were really comfy and he leaned over on them plenty of times. He's even fallen asleep on them! The strap to hold him to the cart feels very sturdy too, because you loop it through the actual seat of the cart, UNLIKE the Eddie Bauer one. It also has straps to hook toys to, and I just leave two toys permanently attached, even when I fold it up. The green color is super cute and can be used for a boy or girl. The pillows are also removable, as they are just inside a "pocket" and one or both can be removed. This is nice in restaurants where the pillows take up too much room. Absolutely love this cover!
