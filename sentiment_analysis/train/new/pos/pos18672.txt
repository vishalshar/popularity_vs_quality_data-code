I am not pregnant. I am a side sleeper with back pain and I have always slept with one pillow between my legs. I have slept with this for 3 nights now, and I plan on sleeping with it every night now. I prefer the open side in front of me with the long side supporting my back, but it can be used both ways. I am not saying it is working miracles for my back, I just like sleeping with this instead of pillows that can move around and fall off the bed when I move. It is hard to turn over with this pillow, but I'm almost always on my right side anyway so that hasn't been a big deal for me. The inside seam is hard and doesn't have much give, but if it did I think the pillow would stretch out and then not be as comfortable. I just adjust my position a little if it is bothering me. It is also comfortable to lay on my back on this pillow. It keeps my legs elevated just enough to keep the pressure off my lower back, and it feels like I'm laying in a snuggly cocoon :) The material is a little rough, so I am looking for a softer cover to replace this one with. I haven't had much luck in my online search, so I may just make one. I also wish it was it was stuffed just a little more but it works. I could probably even stuff it more myself.Update-I've had this a couple months. Used every night and even took on vacation with me. It has not flattened out but the seam does seem to be softer, or maybe I've just gotten used to it. I seriously don't know how I ever slept without this pillow. My dog even likes it and tries to get in the "loop" with me.
