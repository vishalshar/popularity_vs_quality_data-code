My newborn developed a mild case of cradle cap and had some dandruff issues when she was about 2 weeks old. A few weeks later when she was around 5 weeks old we gave her an olive oil treatment and used the brush, which worked beautifully in cleaning her scalp and gently removing the dry skin. The brush can be used when wet or dry and is gentle but very effective! It can be easily cleaned with mild soap.
