These are pretty great and stain resistant. They are bulky though which other reviewers have mentioned. I didn't think it would matter but my baby hated doing tummy time in them, he would just face plant because the diapers put his butt so far in the air. They are decently absorbent and they have held up well, the fabric that touches the baby's skin is not the irritating micro terry that some people have mentioned and my baby is very prone to random rashes and these diapers did not give him them. Also it is very doable to just take out the inside liner and replace it with another one so less laundry and less money if you just want to buy a few shells and get a bunch of liners. In the newborn days we went through about six shells a day and 12-15 liners. They are supposed to be line dried but I gave up after awhile and started tossing them in the dryer on a gentle cycle and they seem none worse for the wear.
