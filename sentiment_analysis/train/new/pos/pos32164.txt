I've been using a similar stainless steel container, Fresh Baby So Easy Divided Dish, Green for over a year to pack lunch for my almost 3 year old and been very happy with it. No spill and easy to clean. Unfortunately, it got lost for a week and that's when I purchased this Innobaby brand, hoping this would be a little larger. The product claims to hold 11 oz. Well, turns out they are identical in size (9 fl oz/250 ml) and dimensions. If you are looking for a stainless steel lunch box I'd recommend either one of these. It's a great airtight container with a 3-way adjustable divider. I personally like Fresh Baby better because it's $3 cheaper as of 6/24/14 and has cute prints on the lid.
