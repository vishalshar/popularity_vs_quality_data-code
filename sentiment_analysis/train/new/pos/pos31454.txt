After doing quite a bit of online research, I found the Graco TurboBooster seat to be rated in the top percentage of pretty much every site I found.  That alone had me interested, but then, thankfully, my daughter actually liked the butterfly patter...well, that was the icing on the cake.  The seat works great.  It has two (retractable) cup holders.  And the headrest sticks out far enough that when she falls asleep she now has somewhere to rest her head (instead of falling forward or to the side like in toddler seats).  This is a great booster seat at an even better price.
