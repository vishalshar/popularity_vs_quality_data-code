We picked out the barnyard bedding and almost everything that goes with it for our baby's room.  We don't know what we're having, so we thought this was nice and neutral.  Little did we know it would be so difficult to hang!  If you haven't hung your border yet, here are some tips that I hope will help you!!1 - Be very careful when you remove the plastic wrapping - the directions are on the back of the label.  ALSO be very careful when you remove the label - if it rips you are going to have a hard time reading the directions!2 - No matter what kind of paint you've used I would invest in some vinyl to vinyl wallpaper paste - It will save you some headaches - the border will definitely stick!We followed the directions perfectly - and the border still didn't stick.  After we used the wallpaper paste it went up without a problem and looks GREAT!!  I just hope the baby doesn't take it down!!
