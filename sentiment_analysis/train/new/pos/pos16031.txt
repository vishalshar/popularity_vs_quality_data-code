This is a nice car seat with very easy adjustments.  I use this seat between 2 grandaughters that are a year apart and the shoulder adjustment is so easy.  Also, their heads are supported very nicely without any additional use of support.  There are a couple of inconveniences to this car seat.  The first one is that the seat is rather large in the rear-facing position and would not work in smaller cars because it sticks out a lot.  The second one is that the crotch strap is hard to buckle.  I have learned to buckle it first then the chest straps.  In the front facing position the size of the seat is fine.  The seat is very comfy and very easy to adjust.
