This is a really cute, spine bound baby record book.  It has all the essentials and adequate space for pictures.  It only has room for one baby shower, so if you have more you won't have room to record them all.  It has a page to record the weight and height (and percentile) for each month in the first year, an immunization page, and a dental page where you can record when your baby's teeth come in.  There is a page for a letter from Mommy and A page for a letter from Daddy.  It has first vacation and first holiday pages, then one page each for birthdays one through four with room for a picture and a brief description of the events.  It has a page for the first day of school and size pages in the back for "special memories" (keepsakes, artwork, clippings, pictures, etc.).  The artwork is adorable and I like the layout, but this book is just very simple and brief.  I would recommend it for very busy moms that don't have a lot of time for  filling stuff in or just don't like that sort of thing.  Truthfully, I got a record book with a similar layout for my second child and I really miss some of the extra stuff.  I have opted for a looseleaf book like the one I got for my firstborn with more room for pictures and information, especially the monthly progress that is missing in this book.  You cannot add pages to this one since it is bound.  I am returning it and going with a more expansive record book.
