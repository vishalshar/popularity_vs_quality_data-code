My daughter is barely 2 months old and she is able to keep her pacifier in with this.  Prior to this she would spit the paci out constantly and get very upset especially when she was falling asleep. I constantly had to hold it or put it back in for her,  I love that it is the soothie pacifier, this is the only pacifier she would take,,tried 4 different types.  We left it at grandmas one night, and I knew when I realized it that it would be a long night,,,I immediately ordered a 2nd one, one to keep at home and one to keep in the diaper bag at all times.  She also likes to hold the stuffed animal in her sleep since she spits out her paci when she is asleep.  I just lve how it helps the paci stay close to her mouth and also she has learned to put the paci back in by herself.My friend ordered  1 based on my recommendation but her baby does not know how to use it, so it is definitely not for all babies.4 stars because the stuffed animal could be a little heavier, it is pretty light! And also because it's hard to sanitize these pacifiers since it's attched to the toy.  I had to buy wipes.
