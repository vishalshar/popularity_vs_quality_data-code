I was TERRIFIED of clipping my daughter's nails for fear of cutting her. I refused to do it and would file her nails with baby nail files, which took forever and she fought me on it. Next I bought an expensive battery powered baby nail file that did a terrible job, was loud & the vibration was a bit much for even ME. Then there are the "mini" clippers but they're just tiny versions of an adult clipper. I came across this bee clipper at Toys R Us and it transformed grooming my daughter's nails from an experience fraught with fear and apprehension to one that is calm and quick. The person who wrote the two star review of this bee clipper missed the entire point of the product's design. YES the bee's head sticks out past the clipper -- SO YOU DON'T CUT YOUR KID'S FINGER!! It's a safeguard feature. It also keeps you from cutting the nail back too far which can be painful for your child. It's the way the bee clipper is designed and why it's so much better than others out there. Now I can cut my daughter's nails quickly and confidently, knowing I'm not going to clip her skin or cut the nail back too far. You still have to be careful -- of course -- but I have never cut my daughter even when I was snipping away and suddenly felt certain I'd nipped her fingertip off. Not a single nick or cut with this clipper. It's a fantastic design. Plus, my daughter likes the bee design. I tell her the bee is coming to "kiss" her finger tips and toes. When she gets a long nail she'll ask me, "Mommy, does the bee need to come?" and almost looks forward to it now. Thank goodness for this little bee. I used it from the time she was about 15 months to now when she's two. I wish I'd found this when she was an infant.
