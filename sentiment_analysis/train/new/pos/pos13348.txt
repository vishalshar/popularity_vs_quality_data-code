This works well for its intended purpose.  It easily cuts through the sandwich.  I haven't tried PB&J, but I have done turkey with mayo and mustard and had no problem with the contents squishing out.  This by no means uses an entire slice of bread.  Probably just over 2/3.  Not a huge deal...I just put the rest on the plate too.  Or use star cutters to cut additional shapes out of the remaining sandwich pieces.  Or use this multiple times on one sandwich.  It's not a necessary food tool by any means, but it makes a cute little bite sized mini-sandwich and my kids find it entertaining.Our current favorite is "peanut butter dippers" which helps solve the squishing jelly problem some people have had.  We put butter and peanut butter on bread and use this tool to create the squares.  Then the kids tip the bit sized pieces into jelly or honey, or just eat them plain.  It's one of their favorite lunches!  They love the interactive nature.  And it totally solves the lunch box dilemma of a soggy sandwich by lunch time!  We put Jelly in one compartment of a lunch box and the dippers in another.  It's been such a great use of this tool!I couldn't really envision this before I bought it, so hopefully the attached pictures will help!  Easy to dishwasher clean too.  We've had this for many months and it still works as well as the day we got it.  It shows no signs of wear even after repeated dishwasher washings.
