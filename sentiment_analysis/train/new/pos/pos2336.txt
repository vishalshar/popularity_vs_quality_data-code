I bought these booster seats to avoid having to switch my boys other booster seats from one car to another and back again.  Originally, I was concerned that my 6 year old boys would not be tall enough for these seats.  We still have to position the shoulder belt lower in their full back booster seats, but these were just perfect!  My boys are small for their age but in these seats, the shoulder belt rests exactly where it should and doesn't cut into their necks.  The booster seats are small enough to fit into a trunk if needed, they are well padded, the cup holders are sturdy and slide into the seat when not being used, and my boys (and I) love that they can buckle themselves up.  Over all, these seats are well made and safe if used properly.
