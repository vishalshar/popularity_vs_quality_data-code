I wanted to stock up on these for our second baby (nipples generally only last 3 months, so I threw out all the nipples from our 18 month old). I saved all the Playtex Drop In Nursers to reuse, but now Playtex has changed their nipples and they are more expensive in the stores. I just wanted to buy what I had used and loved with our first baby. Even though these are advertised for the Playtex VentAire, they work/fit with the Playtex Dropin Nursers as well. I found these as an AddOn options for 1.99, but now I see the price is much higher (probably because Playtex is in the process of discontinuing them). Thanks Amazon for helping me find a hard to find product!
