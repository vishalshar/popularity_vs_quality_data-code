I bought this for an upcoming trip to Europe, but may be returning it.  My 17 month old is big for his age and in size 2T clothing.  This is snug on him with very little room to grow in the straps.  Since the straps are adjustable, they should have made them longer.  I just ordered their PortaChair and will compare the two and return one of them.  Overall it seems to be made well, and I felt he was secure in it, but given the strap length I don't know how much more use we will get out of it.
