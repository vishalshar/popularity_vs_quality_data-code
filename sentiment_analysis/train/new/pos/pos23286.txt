Absolutely love this high chair. Worth the price when you consider it will be a part of your home years after your children have grown. I decided to buy the Tripp Trapp when I discovered some friends of mine had older children who still use the chair far beyond infancy. Why buy a $200 high chair that only will be used in infancy then discarded? The tray was an extra $50 but I love the design, easy to clean! The chair itself is easy to clean also. No dingy food bits wedged in crevices! My only complaint is that the chest strap mechanism is difficult to use, to the point where I almost want to just sew on a plastic buckle that's easy to deal with. All things considered the chair is very well designed, easy to accommodate the child throughout the lifespan, and easy to keep clean. I thoroughly reccommend this product!
