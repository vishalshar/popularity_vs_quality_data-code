I ordered these burp cloths as well as a 3-pack of "Carters Burp Pads" ... and I MUCH prefer these! I think I'm going to order some more! They are made from cloth material (not gauzey like the burp pads) that is soft on baby's skin, and are thick/absorbant enough to keep your shoulder dry even through massive amounts of spit-up. I would (and will) buy these again and again.
