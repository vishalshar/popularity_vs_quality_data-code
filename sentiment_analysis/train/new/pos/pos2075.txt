My 18 month old daughter really likes this keyboard. We wanted to introduce her to musical instruments and thought this would be a great start. It seems well constructed and should survive being stepped on and dropped. We were a bit disappointed that only the white keys work. The black ones are just for show and don't move at all. We wish there were a song tutorial or a Simon type of game, especially since the keys light up different colors. Cookie Monster does give positive feedback when your child hits many keys very fast. Song choices are very limited too, would have liked more I know, I know, that's asking a lot for such an affordable toy. But that's what it is, a toy. Not so much an educational tool, but a toy. As long as you keep this in mind, you'll be happy. Oh, one more thing ..... there is no volume control, just an on/off switch underneath, and this thing can be pretty loud. All in all a good purchase.
