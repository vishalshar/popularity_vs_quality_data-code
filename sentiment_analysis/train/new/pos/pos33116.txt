This has brackets that can move above molding, whereas other gates are spring loaded at the bottom so they won't go up against your wall if you have molding. This gate is pretty heavy duty, easy to open with one hand and my dog is 12 pounds and jumps on it and it doesn't come out of the wall (but make sure you use wall anchors, not included). My opening is a weird length so I had to arrange it in a squared off triangle type shape but I decorated the extra space ... You have to be flexible with your placement because the angles don't always work in your favor..that's why mine isn't straight across.
