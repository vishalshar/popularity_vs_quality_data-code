I noticed a lot of other reviews mentioning this rack being "great but small" and it makes me wonder how many bottles they use in a day.  My 2 month old daughter eats 7 times a day, and I can fit all 7 bottles on the rack at once, with room to spare.  I could probably fit another 3 if I wanted to.  I hook the bottles on the side, with only about 5 or 6 "blades" of grass.This drying rack is awesome, its pretty small, but holds a lot of bottles for it's size.  It's much better than other bottle drying racks, because it can hold all pieces upright so you don't have water collecting in any parts, so everything gets completely dry.Edited July 7-28-10:  I added a picture of just how much this rack can actually hold.  I would not typically use this many bottles in a day, but I upgraded from short to tall, because my daughter now eats more. Today I needed to wash all 13 bottles at once.  They ALL fit.
