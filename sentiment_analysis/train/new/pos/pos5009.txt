I ordered two of these: one blue and one pink.The pink one is almost an inch shorter than the blue.The blue "pocket" for the number strip is much shorter, so the plastic strip sticks out, unlike the pink which is hidden inside.Pros:It works. I'm impressed by the Velcro after a weeks worth of use (on and off, on and off...)It's small and streamline, I wanted to avoid big and bulky and this did just that.Cons:It is scratchy, although my kids did not complain. The initial stiffness wore off after one use.After reading reviews I thought it'd fit my 4-yr old better. It's a tight fit on her ankle, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone over 5, except maybe on the wrist.Overall, I'm happy with both of them because they served their purpose, but I do question the inconsistent products that were sent out at the same time.
