At first I was ticked that I bought the wrong thing. I thought I was buying a waterproof fitted sheet. This isn't that. This is just a crib size pad. But I like this better. I put it under my fitted sheet and then I can just pull this up to clean. No bunching in the corners, etc. This didn't shift and it definitely protects the mattress from the unstoppable baby drool pool.
