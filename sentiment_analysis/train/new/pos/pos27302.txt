The openings are small, but it's actually pretty easy to fill up. I've been sending these for my son's snack and he loves them because they're a little different and a larger size than the gogo squeeze that I've been buying. I love how inexpensive they are! They haven't leaked once and cleaning them is really simple. Also, if you lose a top, a top from one of the commercial foods fits just fine.Editing to add... one of the zips broke after writing this review. I contacted the company directly and they replied within an hour, offerin to ship out the next day a new set. So great!
