I think The Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys are great! They were so much fun for my son and I. I purchased this set of tub toys before my son was born. Using them during bath time as a first time parent with my son was awesome! I only wish they would have lasted longer. I was only able to keep them for about a year, because they are so cute, it is very hard to get every last drop of water out of these toys. Even with regular cleaning they eventually began to smell. I would recommend these if you are looking for more fun during bath time.Just try to keep them clean!Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys
