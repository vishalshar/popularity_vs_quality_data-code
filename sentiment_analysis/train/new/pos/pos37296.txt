I ordered this bed after reading all the reviews and felt that there were more positive experiences than negative. I wanted something to match the furniture already in the room and this was a perfect match as expected.  Assembly took about 90 minutes and was pretty easy. I took the time to make sure I had all the proper pieces before we got underway and perhaps the only challenging part was the very start and the very end of assembly. The start of assembly required that we insert wooden slats (for mattress support) and as one would probably expect, you get one in and the one right next to it would pop out. So it required two sets of hands but that is to be expected and easily overcome with a helper. We took a mallet (use a rag to protect the wood) to ensure that each slat was fully inserted into the sideboards.  The end of assembly was the drawer on the bottom and anytime there are cam bolts, it can take a little extra touch to make sure everything attaches as expected. But we got it together and it is sturdy, looks great, and just what we wanted.  The best part was I ordered it on Wednesday and it was at our house on Thursday! You can't get any better shipping then that! I would highly recommend this product.
