The crib is perfect we had no issues assembling it and it's a beautiful crib once put together. We got the espresso which I think it's a little dark but we still like it. The instructions were really easy to follow and everything was lining up great. There is one error in the instructions which I noted on one of the pictures I put up but it was not enough to bring it down to 4 starts. It was an easy fix. Our crib came in great shape with just about 2-3 dents but you can't really see them unless your face close to it so I don't mind. The crib is very sturdy and it's pretty big which I love. We looked at a whole bunch of cribs before we found this one. My wife and I are extremely happy with the crib we picked and we both love it.
