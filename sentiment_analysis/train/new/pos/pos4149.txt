I know it feels wrong to spend $40 on a sheet of plastic and zip ties, but where else are you going to find a roll of plastic with these dimensions? The hole punch was useless, but poking a screwdriver through the plastic was easy. With my mom's help holding the roll as I attached it to our banister, I installed it in about 10 mins. Baby is safe and I haven't ruined the look of my new home!
