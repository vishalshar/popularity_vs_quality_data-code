I tried several other pregnancy pillows before I ended up with this one. This is the only one out there that I could find that wasn't made to go under your neck/head as well as between your knees. I have problems with neck pain and headaches and needed to be able to use my regular pillow. I am currently in my last month of pregnancy and having been using this pillow every night since about 4 months. I would not be able to sleep without this pillow. With any body pillow it is hard to roll over with it but at this point I am so huge that the rolling over at all is a task anyway. I have had a lot of hip and back pain throughout my pregnancy and this pillow is the only reason I am able to get any sleep at all at night because he it provides excellent support for my both my back and hips.The air flow strap on it was more hassle than it was worth and was usually in the way more than anything so within the first few weeks of using the pillow I made my own replacement cover (without the extra strap thing) for the pillow out of an old sheet and it works much better without that thing. Although the air-flow strap was a bit of a nuisance I still give this pillow 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone who wants to be able to use their own pillow under their head and still have a contoured body pillow to put your arms around and the curve to go between your knees. This pillow is also excellent for putting behind you to allow you to lie on a backwards angle without actually lying on your back. I bet this will also come in very handy once baby boy arrives to provide support during breatfeeding, either way I'll be holding on to this pillow long after pregnancy as it is the most comfortable body pillow I have ever owned and tried quite a few over the years!
