This looks like a quality product. The green color is lighter than what I saw on the computer but I was hoping that would be the case.  This is going to look great in my son's nursery which is jungle themed with lots of yellow's and greens!  Just what I was expecting!Please note, someone else commented that the back feet didn't have pads;  this must have been a manufacturing error because all four feet of mine had the pads.  Also, the description is a little misleading, saying that you can customize this bank but that's not the case.  I was hoping there would be a card or something I could send in to request the letters that I could then apply myself later but this is not the case.
