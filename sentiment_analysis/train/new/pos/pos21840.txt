I purchased these for my twins who were teething thinking it would be a good teething tool to use while we are on the go since they are small. When I first gave them to them, they seemed to like them and they used the sticks for a few weeks, however they quickly became bored with it and I found that most of the time they would end up flipping the stick and chewing on the wrong end. Eventually, they just gave up on these completely.Pros:1. Size is good if you are on the go, or need something small to always store away to have on hand for your teething baby.2. Concept is good and when the baby does chew on the little "gummy" part of the stick, it really does seem to help soothe their gums.Cons:1. Babies (mine at least) can easily get bored with it.2. Babies can flip the stick and use the wrong end.Overall, it is a decent teething option if your kid will chew on the gummy part. Colors are cute and I loved the fact that it came in a pack of colors for both boys and girls (since I have a boy and girl set of twins I can hardly ever find anything that has both colors mixed together).
