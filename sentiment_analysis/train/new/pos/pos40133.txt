My son is 11 months old and enjoys playing with this toy (under close supervision, of course).  He examines each piece and likes to put the animals in and out of the ark through the open section on top (the roof and little "house" components come apart, i.e. the roof in two panels and the house in one piece).Pros:- Eco friendly (wood / nontoxic paint)- Affordable price- Good size- Good for a variety of agesCons:- Pieces are only painted on one side- Shapes are a bit ambiguous to use as a "sorting" toy, in addition to the fact the the base is angled and unless you pick up the ark, it is awkward to push the corresponding animal through its respective opening
