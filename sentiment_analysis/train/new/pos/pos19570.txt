My infant daughter has never believed in sleeping.  She napped no more than 30 minutes at a time with a max of 2 naps a day from very early on.  Night time was a disaster.  She woke up every hour and was nursing/ sucking for comfort for an hours at a time.  Once I figured out she needed to be swaddled at night, I put her in the ones I had on hand even buying another one.  She kept wiggling out of them and the few moments of peace at night were becoming fewer and fewer.  I came across this one with the free legs and convertible arms and even though the price was a bit high for my taste, I gave it a try. My baby was 4 months old when I put her in this and she finally slept a bit more soundly.  She still woke frequently but this helped immensely.  She was about 8 months old when she finally decided she could sleep without this.  Would highly recommend.
