I agree this playard is really confusing to put up and take down!  When you put it up, you have to be careful not to allow the bottom to flatten out before you get all four sides popped into place.  Once all four sides are clicked into place and forming a rectangle, then you can push down the center and drop in the mattress.  Reversing the process is even worse.  There is a circular plastic part in the center of the floor under the mattress that you are supposed to twist and lift before collapsing the sides.  I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to do this, and I'm a mom of seven!  Then I noticed there is actually a little handle-lever that you are supposed to lift up from the center circular part.  Nowhere in the directions did I notice this lever.  It seemed like they wanted you to twist the entire circle to release the legs and floor. Once you pull that lever and the bottom collapses inward, you can pop down the sides.  Just be careful to get both interior buttons pushed on each side so that each side will fully fold up.I've gone through 5 different portacrib playards in the past 20 years.  This one is my favorite.  It's slightly bigger (wider) than Graco so an older toddler can sleep comfortably when traveling.  It's considerably lighter to carry (16lbs vs 22lbs).  No bells and whistles (changing tables or other unnecessaries) and the price is fantastic.  Minus a half star for complicated folding requirements and another half star off for crappy directions.
