I was skeptical about buying this product rather than rolling up some blankets to prop my son up in his Exersaucer.  It is hands-down my new favorite baby product.  It provides excellent trunk support for babies who can hold up their head and neck but don't have stability in their torso.  My son LOVES this product.  People who say that it goes "up too high" are not putting it on correctly.  Once baby is secured in the Huggabebe and you place him/her in an exersaucer, they "sink down." Therefore, when you are securing baby in the product on the floor (as directed), you place their head at the top of the headrest.  Once you place them in the exersaucer, they will settle down and be perfectly supported.  If their arms are "trapped," move them to the outside of the wrap.It is very soft and machine washable (and dryer safe).  I just washed mine tonight and it came out beautifully.  I chose to air dry it and am surprised at how quickly it is drying with how thick it is.  If you are on the fence, take the plunge and buy this.  You will be happy you did!  I am recommending this to all my new mom friends.
