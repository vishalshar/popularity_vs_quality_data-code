Beautiful night light. I only wish there was a way to stop the constant color change and set to a constant color. The constant changing creates a constant "light-dark-light" phenomenon which is quite disruptive and noticeable even with my eyes closed. This light works when it's out of sight, like in the bathroom, but I couldn't tolerate it in the hallway next to my bedroom, as the constant changing was disturbing to my eyes and sleep from all the way down the hall. The colors and design are otherwise quite beautiful and ornate looking.
