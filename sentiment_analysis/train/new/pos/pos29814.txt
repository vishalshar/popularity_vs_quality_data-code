This was a baby gift for a new mommy!  She loves it so much and says she stuffs it with everything she needs and there is still more room.  I must say I like that it doesn't look like a duffle bag but more like a really nice quality hand bag.  I like the way it sits on the shoulder totally full and doesn't feel like you need a crane to help you carry it like many diaper bags.Yes, I would recommend this item
