I am really conflicted with this review because in some aspects it deserves 5 stars while in other areas closer to 2 or 3 stars, let me explain. I purchased this piggyback rider to take with me to Costa Rica where we would be doing some pretty extensive hiking. I used to it carry around my 4 year old boy who weighs 35 lbs. I used it without the harness attaching my son to me and this allowed him to climb up and down very quickly and efficiently. It looks awesome, everyone stares in amazement and my son had a perfect vantage point over my shoulders on the hikes. He loved it. I could feel a lot of weight on my shoulders but it wasn't unbearable. The benefits of quickly carrying him during portions of the hike far outweighed the stress on my shoulders. But here is the problem, the night after the long hike, my back was killing me as I tried to sleep. I got up out of bed at 5:00am and could barely stand up. The stress on my back from carrying him was horrible. I am 33 years old and in pretty good shape. If I had some Ibuprofen available I probably would have been ok, but with no medicine and this pain, 4 stars is the best I can say for this product. I wish they could find a way to incorporate some of the weight and stresses on the hips which would make this carrier a for sure 5 star product. In the end, I am going to keep the carrier, but I won't use it for such long periods again.
