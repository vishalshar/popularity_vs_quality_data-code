I had given up on the idea of cloth diapering my newborn, but immediately got sick of all of the disposables I was wasting money on. However, my "one size" diapers were way too big. I found these on Amazon, and decided to give them a go. My baby is just now growing out of them at almost 13 pounds (3 1/2 months), and I am sad to have to move into my already-purchased larger size diapers. These diapers never seemed to get damp from the inserts/prefolds, they didn't stain, the insides aren't the plasticy-type material you get with most diaper covers, and my baby never had a blowout out the tops. However, I really wish they had leg gussets...as leaking occasionally occurred (but not often).  If they made them with leg gussets, I think they would be pretty close to the perfect diaper at the perfect price (I'd even pay a bit more for the gussets!). I suppose leaking could have been averted if I used prefolds with a snappy...but I folded them into simple "inserts" instead...and they weren't secured tightly around the baby's legs. I will definitely be using these for the next baby!
