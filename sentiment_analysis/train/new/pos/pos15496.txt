We ordered a plain plastic changing pad (30 inches long) to put on top of our baby's dresser to use for changing. LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 30", White  I was pretty much disgusted with how ridiculously priced "changing pad covers" are. I didn't need anything fancy, so I ordered three of these carter's bassinet jersey sheets in white.  They are 100% cotton and very soft.  They fit very snugly over the changing pad. It could be maybe an inch or two longer to use on the changing pad we purchased that I linked to above, since on the long sides, the sheet pulls up a bit on the sides.  It's nothing that will inhibit its use, it just means you see a couple inches of the pad showing. This doesn't bother me since the pad and sheets are both white, and didn't cost a fortune like changing pad covers. I've washed the sheets once, so I can't yet attest to their longevity, but considering they are a third of the price of anything else, I could replace them several times and not worry about it!  Very happy to have this changing pad / sheet arrangement.
