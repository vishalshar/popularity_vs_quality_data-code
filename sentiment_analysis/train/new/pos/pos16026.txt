I have tried EVERY sippy cup made and this is the best!!! I love this cup because my sons love it and it makes transitioning from bottle to cup an easy endeavor. The only drawback is the fact that the spouts can easily be broken by children who enjoy chewing on the silicone spout. A damaged spout turns this cup into a faucet and must be replaced immediately, but making sure the boys are never allowed to just chew on the spout when they are finished drinking solves this!
