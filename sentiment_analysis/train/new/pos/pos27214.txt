This is exactly what I was looking for, I am so glad I didn't spend 5x as much for the other brands! I don't know why people don't like this seat! I got the baby pink color, which I was not thrilled with since I have a boy, but it's kept in the bathroom and nobody else sees it but us! I started putting my son on the potty (little Baby Bjorn) when he was 8 months old and at 13 months I felt he was ready to sit on the toilet with a trainer seat. I LOVE not having to clean out the potty every time he uses it!  With this, I just spray it down once a day. The seat is perfect for a boy (and girl I would assume). It offers plenty of support. Highly recommend, even ordered a second for Grandma's house!!As far as the other reviewers giving 1 star because it doesn't fit their toilet - please do not go by this! I have an "oval" shaped toilet and it fits fine. Measure the OPENING of your toilet seat if it is AT LEAST 10 inches long (front to back) and 8 1/4 wide it WILL fit. If your toilet seat is any smaller than it will NOT fit - order a different trainer seat. A few inches wider or longer should be fine since it has a pretty big base, but it may shift around a little bit.This is probably not a good seat if you want your child to climb up independently unless they are over 3 years old. But then again you should be with your child under 3 in the bathroom anyways. They do have toilet trainer seats with handles and step stools attached but I would think they would be a pain to have to move out of the way for adults.I LOVE this seat :)
