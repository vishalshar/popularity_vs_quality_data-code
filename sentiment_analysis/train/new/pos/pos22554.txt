I purchased both the Pecoware open stock bowl and dinner plate and 2 sets of the Zak Designs plate/bowl/cup combo with Thomas the Tank Engine. I would recommend the Pecoware product over the Zak Designs product, as it feels stronger: the plastic is thicker and the edges are more rounded. I also prefer the more classic pictures of Thomas and his friends on the Pecoware dishes.
