I'm glad I made this purchase. My little one loves looking around when we're out shopping and likes being free of her car seat. It's pretty easy to put on (once you've done it a couple of times) and easy to pack up (again, once you've had a little bit of practice with it) I like the little pockets on the side and back and the loops are great for keeping her toys in front of her and off the floor! The one thing I'm not a fan of is the buckle, you have to remove one side of the buckle from the seat cover in order to pull it through the back of the carriage, then re-install it in the seat cover (it can be a little frustrating especially if you're little one doesn't like to sit still) - also the buckle doesn't fit through the backing of all carriages. For example, I brought it Target and their carriage doesn't have holes large enough to fit the buckle through, so I had to remove the seat cover's buckle and loop Target's seat belt through instead only to find out it didn't fit around my baby. I just nestled her in with blankets and kept a close eye on her. Not a deal breaker but something to think about.
