I absolutely love this bedding. I previously bought a bedding set that was over $100 and it's hardly comparable to this set. I bought this set as a back up to my original, expensive set, but we always use this set over the expensive set.  It is super soft and brightly colored. It has held up to many washings without fading.  Buy this set! I also bought the Everything for Kids Happiness 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set,Turquoise/Pink and it is just as good.
