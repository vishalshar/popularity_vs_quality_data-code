My kid pees and poops in this thing.Things to like: There is some music played when the kid goes. It's nice for two reasons: (i) the kid gets to have some fun and (ii) you know that they went which is great since it's a bit hard with the orange color to see if the kid went pee. It's also easy to get the bowl out of the duck so you can go dump it in the human sized crapper.Bummers: the sound went off on this thing at like midnight one night. Scared the crap out of me! Sounded like a killer clown had broke into the house and was going to kill me. So the sound has been shut off since then. I wish that the switch for the music was in a more friendly position; it's on the bottom which means it's not the most accessible. Since our kid doesn't really need the audible feedback anymore it's been off for a while now. I have to say that I am missing the music a bit, pretty catchy.
