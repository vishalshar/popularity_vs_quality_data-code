I was really hesitant to purchase this because of the reviews, but decided the price couldn't be beat and I would give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised when I received this and saw what a great product this is.To all the people trying to hang something heavy on a door with Velcro...there are sewn-in loops on the organizer to hang it by nails...should be common sense! The Velcro straps are for if you want to hang it from a crib. It's sad this product has low reviews because of user error. It is very sturdy and stays in shape with the regular weight of the contents that are placed in it. I really couldn't be any happier with this, and I can't believe how inexpensive it was to purchase.
