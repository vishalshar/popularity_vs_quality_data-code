We wanted an extra toy to take on trips and to restaurants. This has a nice loop which we could easily connect to the baby carrier with a toy strap so my son doesn't drop it on the floor.  The disks are a softer plastic. However, the squirrel itself is a harder plastic--sometimes he bites too hard on that and gets frustrated.
