I hate wasting money on disposable gift bags and tissue paper, so I look for fun ways to present baby shower gifts. A child-size tote of some sort works well, and for a recent baby boy shower with a jungle animal and forest animal theme, this Safari Friends Backpack from green Sprouts was absolutely perfect. I slipped my gift ensemble inside with a card, and it essentially became two gifts. A new baby gift from Mommy and Daddy’s registry list and a grow-into gift for toddler or preschool stage.The Safari Friends red monkey is cheery and cute, with a bit of a nod to the ageless and popular sock monkey. The backpack is constructed with a light, but durable canvas material and has a little bit of squeezable cushioning to it. I gave the backpack a quick spritz of ScotchGard™ for extra protection from stains and spills. Even a young child will be able to figure out how to open and close their own pack easily. There’s a simple magnetic outer flap closure and a drawstring cinch closure inside. A sewn-in pocket would be nice, but this bright little backpack is probably best kept simple, simple. ~ SB
