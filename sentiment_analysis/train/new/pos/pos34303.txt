I read most of the reviews before making my decision  to go ahead and get this and I don't regret buying it. I'm currently in the process of redecorating my daughters room with the JoJo Designs Happy Owl theme so there are owls throughout her room. I also did the RoomMates RMK1439SLM Scroll Tree Peel & Stick Wall Decal MegaPack on her walls so when searching for an owl lamp this was one of the first ones that popped up on Amazon.The lamp is well made and has a substantial weight to it, the shade is also very well made and is absolutely adorable. It also comes with an energy saving 60 watt bulb so no need to run out and get one. Everything needed is there in the box. The reason I gave 4 stars is because also of the switch placement. I do wish that it was where the bulb is located but unfortunately it is on the power cord somewhere in the middle. I've uploaded a pic since most complaints were about the power switch placement but no one thought about uploading a picture so you can see what they were talking about.The disadvantage for me with this is that since I have the power cord behind her dresser where I'm going to be placing this so that it's out of her way (so she doesn't tug on it) its an inconvenience.The lamp doesn't look cheap but if you can deal with the power switch placement I'd recommend getting this if you're interested.
