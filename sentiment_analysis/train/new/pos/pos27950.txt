It wasn't an easy choice but I am trilled with it. So here are the reasons I picked Mountain Buggy and never regretted it:1. The MB has a hand break. Very very convenient and safe up and down hill to stay in control of your buggy.2. The handle height can be adapted easily. I can use my weight more efficiently to maneuver the MB (especially when the front wheel is locked).3. The seat reclines fully. Yes!4. The design is sleek, well thought through, in all its details. I can strap my baby without passing his arms through loops (which he hates), he can't press the fastener and untie himself (because of the safety feature of that one buckle), the shock absorbers are smoother than BOB's.
