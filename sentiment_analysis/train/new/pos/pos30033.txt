I use this washcloths for almost everything!  I clean my baby's face, gums, spit ups, give baby baths, use them as cushioning when I sit him up in the sink, etc.  I like that they are not too big so it's easier to handle, than let say a spit up cloth.  Also, they are very absorbent! I have to admit, they're not the highest quality, however, for what I use them, they are the perfect little cloth.  I've own them for about 2 months and they're still working great.  I'll definitely order more once the set I have is not longer usable.
