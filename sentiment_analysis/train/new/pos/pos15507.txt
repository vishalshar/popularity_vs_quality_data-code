We loved this swing. Most of all because in addition to running off batteries-it PLUGS into the wall-i.e. it has an adapter. Maybe I just have bad parent luck-but every time I'd be desperate to use our old swing (baby colicky in the middle of the night-swing only thing that works) and of course the batteries were dead. I'm not sure why all swings don't plug in-but most of them don't and I would NEVER even take a battery-operated swing for free.In addition- I love the neutral colors and it is quite snuggly. All three of my children ALWAYS feel asleep in the swing. Our second wasn't s found of it-but it did make her sleep.GOOD:Neutral peaceful colorsExtra soft fabricsSwing can swing two ways-front to back or side to side.Nice selection of music/soundsQuietBAD:The only thing is that we had to quit using it because our baby got too big and the swing just couldn't swing well-but I didn't take away a star-because our baby was and is off the carts as far as weight and height. I doubt any swing could have worked when he got close to 30 lbs.Please say if this review is helpful to you-I've started reviewing things I've bought to return the favor of many reviews that I have benefited from reading on Amazon. But, I don't know if others rely on reviews as much as I do-and I don't need to be spending time on things that don't help people. Also, feel free to ask any questions in the comments and I will answer them.
