I'm now 25 weeks pregnant but bought this when I was 22. I tried the Snoogle couldn't get comfortable. I'm one of those people who spread out at night and don't like things or pillows in the way. The Snoogle body pillow literally took the space of another person! Now, if you sleep with your husband like I do, that's just taking up waaaaaay too much space for a queen size bed. I tried shoving a regular pillow under my belly, but thought it was too thick. Then I saw this product. I knew My Brest Friend made great nursing pillows, so I decided to give this a shot. It's perfect for me. I like to sleep on my tummy, and of course being pregnant you can't. But since it's recommended to sleep on your left side, this was the best alternative. I put the thinnest section under my tummy, and instant relief! Since I fall asleep on my side anyway before I go on my tummy, this made it so easy. Then I adjust myself to be more on my tummy without being uncomfortable. It is like sleeping on your tummy but on your side. This pillow is great also because it's small, doesn't take up any space, you can still sleep with your hubby, and my cat likes to sleep with me too. So with three beings in the bed, this is perfect!
