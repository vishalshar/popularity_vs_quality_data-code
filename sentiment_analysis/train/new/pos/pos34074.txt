Everything in this set is very well made and it's a great value! I thought I would be using the scissors for nail-cutting a lot more, but for me the clippers are easier. I also use the soft bristle brush to stimulate my baby's scalp while in the bath to help with cradle cap. I haven't used the toothbrush yet (I use a washcloth and my finger because she doesn't have teeth yet!), but it seems like it will be useful. I honestly don't have one negative thing to say about this set, and I can be very judgmental. Would DEFINITELY recommend.
