I reviewed many backpacks to carry my infant son's items back and forth to daycare. I was looking for one that was PVC, BPA & Phthalate-free, which can be very harmful to children and adults alike. Surprisingly, the regulations are less stringent on backpacks, lunchbags, etc. than they are on toys and kids wear these all day!I came across this one because it not only met my criteria to be PVC, BPA & Phthalate-free, but it was also a smaller size bag, that my son will be able to grow into and use. I believe its durability will last several years and I feel good that he's carrying something that's not going to be a potential health concern.The only thing that would've made it a 5-star, is that the straps, which are adjustable and connect inside the bag can come lose, making the bag slip off. I just tied a knot and they are fine.Otherwise, I love this product and it's super cute! I don't even carry a diaper bag these days.
