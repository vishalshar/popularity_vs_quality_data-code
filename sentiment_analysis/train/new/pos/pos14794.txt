This caddy was a must have in the first month of my baby's life. Every diaper changing need is stored here and can be taken everywhere.  The attached changing pad made changing the diaper in the living room, bedroom etc super easy and convenient.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the changing pad that comes with it has threading through it so if the baby pees it goes through the threading holes and can get on the back and if really bad leak through, kind of silly for being the thing that is supposed to protect from that. Otherwise we used it everyday and would highly recommend.
