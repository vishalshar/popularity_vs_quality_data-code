I had another Fisher Price bouncer and my baby boy loves the vibration, music, and lights, so we decided to purchase a second one to have downstairs as well. I purchased this one because it had music, lights, vibration, and the 2 sided toy bar.  Our baby is almost 8 weeks old and loves sitting in it and attempting to hit the toys on the bar, which are nice because one has beads in it and another is crinkly. I also love that the seat sits him more upright than other bouncers because our baby has pretty bad reflux and in the other one he will spit up, but this one he hasn't yet, and I think it is because he is pretty upright in it. The colors are also a bonus - nice and gender neutral with the contrasting black and white for baby, which is what they see best at the 0-3 month stage.
