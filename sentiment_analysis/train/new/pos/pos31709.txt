Who doesn't like a stuffed plush bear? It's a rhetorical question, of course - everyone loves stuffed animals, and bears are especially popular. The Burton & Burton bear is a cutie, and he's eight inches of cuddly softness. The red message pillow is sewn to the bears paws with a single thread on each side, so if you feel like removing the heart after Valentine's Day, it won't hurt anything.The Valentine's Day Bear was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.
