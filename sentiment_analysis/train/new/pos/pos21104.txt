with a roaming two-year-old in the house these protectors are worth their weight in gold. which considering the price we actually may be paying their weight in gold. thier plastic construction makes them easy to modify with regular kitchen shears, and the included Velcro strips makes sure your Handsy child will not remove them from your devices. I have actually cut out holes to still have access to certain features on the devices I am protecting. four instance I made small changes to the top in order for the DVD player to open while still protecting all of the buttons. if you have small children you should put all of your devices on a high shelf, if that is not an option then buy one of these, or 5.
