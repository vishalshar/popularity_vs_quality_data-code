Not only are they soft, natural, breathable, and ridiculously adorableâ€¦ but they WORK!!!  I lanolinize them much more HEAVILY than the company recommends (with 1/4 tsp NOW liquid lanolin) every week or so, right after I wash them, because I love the softness it gives the wool AND the natural moisturizing properties for my son's skin and my own hands.  Lanolinizing isn't really that hard, either: hot water +lanolin +soap and shake.  Mix into the damp (just washed) covers and warm water.  Soak 30 minutes or overnight.  Whatever.  Totally no big deal.  And it's nice on dry hands, too!  I started lanolinizing my wool sweaters and my son's wool blanket, too.  It's heavenly.I just cannot BELIEVE how easy (and cheap) it is to diaper this way!  I only have 12 ozocozy pre folds, which I fold and place into these covers, 3 wool covers, and 3 g diaper covers, which I also use with pre folds, when I need him to be sitting for a potentially longer period and 100% waterproof.  I drop the dirty pre folds into a bucket of vinegar water and power wash them in my front loading machine every day, so there's never any smell whatsoever.  I don't even rinse the poop off or anything.  They smell brand spanking new, and my son's butt looks well-aired and pristine.If only clothing myself could be so soft and easy.To be fair, though, I bought another wool cover from these guys, the soaker pull up brief, and it was terrible.  Very scratchy, and my son's butt always felt damp 10 minutes after I put it on him.  He didn't soak through it, mind you, but I just don't like the idea of feeling pee (even if it's only water vapor) when I pick him up. Gross.  It was only 1 layer of wool though, and these overs have 2 layers, so maybe that's the trade off for having a thinner cover.Don't be scared to try wool.  I almost chickened out, but I'm SO glad I gave it a fair chance!
