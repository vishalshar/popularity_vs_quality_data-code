I love this set! It is a good quality set, nicely made quilt, with coordinating accessories. As a foster parent, never knowing if I will have a boy or girl, I feel this is neutral enough to work for either. Overall, I am extremely happy with this set and the accessories that I bought to go along with. I like the wrinkle free fabrics, it was nice to pull the bedskirt and sheet out of the washer and not have to iron it.I did only give 4 stars for two reasons - 1) When I washed the quilt, some of the fabrics used for the animals pilled pretty badly, and 2) I feel there could be some improvement in how to hang the diaper stacker. It would work fine on cribs that have a thin rail along the top, but mine does not so it hangs sloppily on the side of the crib. I also would have preferred to get something else in the bundle instead of the single curtain panel, but that's just me and that did not affect my rating.
