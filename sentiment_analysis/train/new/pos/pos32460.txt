I purchased two of these bags for my kids.  They are terrific!!  They held all of our stuffed animals and solved our problem of stuffed animals being all over the place!  Unfortunately, one of the side panels ripped after a few months.  I contacted the company on a holiday weekend never thinking it would be resolved within 24 hours!!  They offered to send me a new one but unfortunately they were out of stock so they refunded me the price plus shipping and told me to keep the defective one! How incredible!!!  All this was accomplished through email!  What a company!  I can't say enough about them!!  I will recommend them to every parent I know with a stuff animal problem!!
