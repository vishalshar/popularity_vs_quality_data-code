Much better than a reusable changing pad.  Yes, the reusable ones are environmentally friendly, but they are not as sanitary or as large as these pads.  These pads will cover almost the entire flat surface on the changing kiosk in public restrooms.  I found that the reusable one would get all kinds of stuff from the diaper.  If you have a boy, he's gonna let it go one day and it will be on the pad.  So, if you have a reusable one and you're travelling what do you do? You're stuck with a dirty, unusable pad or you have these disposable ones!  This is how I start my life as a new mom!  Only six weeks old travelling 9 hours to North Carolina by car.  Poo all over the changing pad!  Then about three months later I discovered these!As I mentioned, they cover the entire surface and when you are done, the great thing about these is the baking soda liner in them.  Sometimes you have to change a diaper on the side of the road or in a parking lot and there is no trash can.  Or you are at a friends house and they do not have children or they have older children who do not use diapers anymore.  The baking soda in the liner once you wrap the diaper up in it, neutralizes the odor of the diaper.  Once the diaper is safely wrapped up in the pad you can throw the diaper in a proper receptacle when you are able to or throw it away safely in your social host's trash can without them having to suffer from after effects of a dirty diaper in a trash can.These are folded flatter than a diaper so I put two in my diaper bag with a couple of diapers.  These are also lighter than a reusable changing pad so you are saving space and making your bag lighter.  Worth every penny.  You should compare prices with your local Walmart or Target.  Sometimes the prices are the same or are cheaper.  Sometimes the convenience of delivery or where you are is worth the slightly higher price.
