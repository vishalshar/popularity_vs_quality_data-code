Great cup for my 22 mo. son who figured out how to use it right away.  He loves that it has Mickey Mouse on it & it's the perfect size for him.  The no spill seal is a great invention and works well if not damaged.  This is our first Sassy cup and when it arrived in it's original packaging seemed perfect.  After removing it from the packaging, hand washing it and filling it with juice, realized it had a leak.  The sealed was slightly damaged in one spot and no if tipped pour liquid from that spot.  Planning to contact Sassy.
