Our two sons are 20 months apart in age and this stroller is fantastic for our needs!I didn't like the idea of 'tucking' one boy under the stroller seat of the other, but preferred a side-by-side option that allowed both boys to have as much of a view as possible, while still allowing easy access (through doors) for indoor treks.The E3 Twin accommodates our off-the-charts-sized eldest son and our little guy (with a snuzzler in the reclined position at first).  There's also room to grow, so our eldest (37" at age two) will be able to use the stroller for a long time to come.  The various reclining positions are easy to implement.  It handles very smoothly. The harnesses securely hold both boys and have lots of room for adjustment.The only thing I'd change would be to add a hand brake to help slow the stroller's momentum down hills.Phil & Teds doesn't seem to offer a rain canopy for the stroller, but after checking for comparable dimensions, I was able to order a City Mini Jogger canopy that fits like it was made for our e3 twin!I recommend this stroller to friends with two little ones.  At the closeout price, you can't beat it!
