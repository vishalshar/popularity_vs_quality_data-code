I found these little guys just a little bit too late.  By the time I ordered them, my baby was 6-7 months old and taking her socks off was a new game!  I think these would be perfect for an infant when they are just born and you just can't find those perfect socks that ever seem to stay on because they are kicking them off.  I plan on buying these as gifts for new parents.  Any older than 5-6 months might be a bit of a waste since babies are starting to play with their feet and are physically pulling off their socks.  The sock ons are good but my persistent little bugger did get them off after pulling a bit, but she was almost 7 months old.
