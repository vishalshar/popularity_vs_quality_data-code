First and foremost, I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation. I didn't pay anything for it. My reason for giving it a 4 star rating is because the color differs from the pictured shown. Its more of a pale pink. I'm not picky about it but if you're looking for this specific color this is not it. Though Maxboost Fusion Snap-on has a lot of colors and designs to choose from. Its also not as thick as I had expected. Its a bit on the light/thin side but the quality is really good for what they price of $19.95.What I liked is that its easy to put on the phone and haven't had to clean it much but I did smudge it I just wiped it with a baby wipe and it went back to "new". Its also not a hassle to take out like a particular case I had for another phone. It doesn't obstruct the camera lens or the volume/side buttons. Very useful. I've had this battery case about a week now but so far it was met its purpose expectations. At least for me personally.
