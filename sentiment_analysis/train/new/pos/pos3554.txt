When I purchased a Nuk bottle for my two month old, it came with a nipple, but I didn't realize the flow was medium on it, so I had to buy some slow flow nipples (thank goodness for Amazon!). These work wonderfully and they prevent my little one from choking on too much milk.My baby was strictly breastfed for two and a half months until I got a job and was forced to give him a bottle. I like the design of this nipple, and he took right to it. He still likes to nurse, which is a relief for me since my first born seemed to enjoy the bottle more once he started eating from it.Disclaimer: If my review helped please take a second and click that it was helpful below. I take honesty seriously when writing a review. I always rely on customer reviews when shopping, and I rely on amazon for reviews of nearly everything before I buy no matter where I end up purchasing an item. I always try to tell it as it is when it comes to any product or service I am reviewing. I have no affiliation with the company. I do not receive any benefit from giving only positive reviews, and I will certainly give a negative review for a product if it should be warranted. I also do not review anything that I would not have otherwise purchased on my own. All opinions are my own in reflection of my own personal experience with this product, seller, and / or service. My reviews are always honest and accurate to my experiences. There has been no attempt to influence my opinion. I am happy to write reviews and love the feedback! I hope you find my review helpful.
