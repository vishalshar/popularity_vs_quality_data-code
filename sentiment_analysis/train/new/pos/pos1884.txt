My kids are at the age where it is a game to throw everything over, whether high chair, car seat, or shopping cart. We had tried homemade route first using lanyards we already had, theme park drink holder strings, bungees, and pacifier clips. I was happy to find these as it was perfect for my needs and it had many color choices. They have fit on every cup/bottle we have tried. A couple of negatives are when the bottle/cup are thrown over, it dangles so that the lid/sippy/bottle tip is facing the ground. We found that because some of our cups leak anyway, that we were short some drink when we pulled up the cup. The other issue we had was the velcro that ties around the highchair, car seat, etc part. The ends of the ribbon/rope/string are heavy and rough. The baby scratched his hands whenever he moved them accidentally along the Velcro end. Despite any negative issues, I would still recommend buying this product.
