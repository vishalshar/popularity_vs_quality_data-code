We bought this for the City mini double stroller, as we have a newborn and 2 1/2 year old.  Honestly, this was a lifesaver.  We have the Orbit Baby travel system, which doesn't offer a double option, except for the "sidekick" option, which isn't acceptable for a long outing.  So, I was back to the drawing board, because the Orbit infant seat isn't compatible with ANY other stroller, so I had to find an option that would hold a newborn and a toddler, and compactness and functionality were key.  The stroller itself is great, and this is a great addition.  It's very narrow, but that can't be helped considering this stroller line was built for compactness.  It's insanely east to attach and detach, is comfortable for long walks, and the handles make it easy to transport baby in if you want to keep them in the bassinet for a short time.  The only drawback I see is that the sunshade could be more covering, like the sunshades on the stroller.  But over all I am so thankful I found this item because it has solved all my problems, and I don't have to buy yet another stroller in a few months...just take it off and she's ready to join her sister in the next umbrella seat!  Stroller crisis averted...and money saved!FYI...if you have a stroller with gray accents, as most of the color options do, I could highly recommend getting the gray bassinet. We have the purple stroller, and the gray goes perfectly.  Even though the frame is black, the black bassinet wouldn't have looked right.
