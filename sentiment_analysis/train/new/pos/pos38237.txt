I must have trawled through hundreds of amazon reviews on double strollers before finally deciding to buy this one. and boy, i do not regret it a single bit!!!! this stroller is worth every cent and every second i spent researching on it. It is as good as what everybody says about it.Pros- sturdy frame, feels very durable and safe to use on my 2 rascals (15kg 4yr old and 9kg 1yr old)- ample space for each boy to sit comfortably, yet compact enough to fit through EVERY passageway, doorway, lift, escalator i have pushed it through  (i stay in space-scarce Singapore, a tiny island where everything is about saving space)- LOOOVVVEEE it that it is just as wide as a regular wheelchair, so as long as a wheelchair can fit through, so can the stroller, eg going to the loo (disabled cubicle)!- for all the compactness of it, the manufacturers did not scrimp on leg space like some others who made those 3-wheel double jogging strollers with a single tiny triangular footrest expecting both kids to share one space, and the unfortunate taller one to dangle his legs over the wheel. My older son can easily use the footrest to climb onto his seat, and is totally comfortable resting his feet on his very own space- seats can be adjusted almost fully upright, my boys have such a great view that they just sit there quietly everytime they are strapped in (and you know how restless boys can get!!). The full recline function i havent actually tried yet, but i appreciate that the manufacturers actually thought of providing a raincover for use just when the seat is fully reclined!- the front swivel wheels are fantastic, i have no probs manouvering the stroller at all. 360 deg turn is a piece of cake!- the individual canopies extend very nicely and neatly and do a great job of shading the kids from the sun!- there is a nice deep pocket behind each seat, to place diapers, wipes, shoes etc- the storage compartment underneath the seats is admittedly a bit difficult to use if you wanna put in anything bigger than a pouch, but this is easily resolved by buying a Mommy Hook to hang the diaper bag- the stroller is heavy yes but for 1.6m and 50kg me, i have no issue with lifting it up by myself into my car boot, so i'm quite happy with the weight overall!- the folding and unfolding is super easy, it doesnt take much space when folded and can stay propped against the wall as long as i rem to lock the back wheel, and fits easily into the boot of my Honda Jazz with space to spare- the side-by-side seating ensures both kids get the same good view (fair and square) but there is ample space in between them so they cant reach over easily to disturb each other!- the wheels look very tough and prob can handle some brisk walks if not jogs (as all the rest say, this is not a jogging stroller)- my 2 rascals SUPER LOVE IT!!!!! :) :) :) :) they are very happy everytime they sit in it. and my parents and inlaws are also super impressed by it.Cons- not sold in Spore!!!- accessories like belly bar not sold in Spore!!- a tad expensive compared to other strollers in the market (although i still feel its worth the money)- the orange-and-grey version not shippable to Spore. thats my boy's fav color ...Summary - this is an excellent buy if you are willing to spend a bit, stay in the city with disabled-friendly facilities, and are looking for a stroller for either 2 toddlers or 1 tod and 1 baby.
