I used a regular body pillow until 35 weeks ... I know ... but it just wasn't doing the job and I decided that if this helped me even for a week, it was worth it, because I was that miserable and uncomfortable, waking up totally stiff and unable to walk.The snoogle is great.  The Jersey cover is soft and nice, right out of the box.  I thought that it was too soft to give me enough cushioning between my legs, but it was actually great.  I don't think it takes up too much space on the bed.  I slept SO MUCH BETTER.I struggled with what color to get and eventually got the sand, hoping it would look good with a cream bed ensemble.  For what it's worth, the sand has a very khaki/drab feel.  It's a kind of yellow that looks like it could be a 10 year old white that just yellowed and stained over the years.  I don't like the color at all and realize anything else would have been better.  Still love the pillow, but if you're wondering about color, I'd stay away from the Sand unless you have that khaki/army green/etc color scheme going.  This is definitely not a cream or ivory relative.  Way too yellow and drab for that.  Not docking any stars for this because it is called SAND after all.  Just hoping to help you if you're also wondering about colors and considering the sand.Happy pregnancy!
