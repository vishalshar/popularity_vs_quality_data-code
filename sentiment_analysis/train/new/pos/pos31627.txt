Unfortunately my wife would not let me give this pacifier to our son because it was not the right tip. However, The pacifier was really good quality and very cute. For the brief period of time my son used it before I was sent to pacifier prison he seemed to enjoy it. Wasn't to heavy or bulky like some novelty pacifiers are. If your kid takes the nuk (or whatever it is), this is a great one. I still stand by my opinion that the style of nipple is not that important. I'm sure that is not a popular opinion.
