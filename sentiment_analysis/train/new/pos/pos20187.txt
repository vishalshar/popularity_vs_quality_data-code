The quality of the frame is good. The included matting is not great quality but nice enough if you are not a close observer. The ink pad design is flawed- you can't really get more than one good print with the current design. I would recommend to the manufacturer to include at least 2 pads (if not more)- I think it would be worth paying an extra few cents. You can get more than one print off of the single pad but there is a "shadow" of the previous print on the subsequent prints. Instead of using the preprinted labels I turned one over and wrote out my Baby's name to make the item more personal.I recommend printing while the baby is asleep or has just fed to get the best prints- you can even lightly tape the paper to a book if you want a hard surface that isn't a table.
