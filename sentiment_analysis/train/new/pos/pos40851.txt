This bed  has served as my son's regular sleep space away from home for months now (from 20-30mos so far). It's much more roomy than most travel cribs. The down side to that is it's tricky finding proper sheets. We simply went with regular crib sheets.I used a crib-sized mattress pad to add a little extra cushion and support, but I didn't go out of my way to find an extra travel mattress that would fit. I hadn't seen any good recs for one anyway.Overall, this is great value for the money and will likely provide a regularly sleeping space for my son until he's 3 or so.
