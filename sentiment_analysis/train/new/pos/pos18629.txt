I bought these blankets because I wasn't sure the extra expense of muslin blankets would be worth the cost. Similar blankets are going for $50+.Anyway, these blankets turned out to be well worth the price.  Don't waste your money on the little flannel blankets, buy a pack of these.  After using these, I bought more and eventually the more expensive brand, and threw out all the flannel ones.These get softer with each washing, hold up to multiple washings well, look nice, and most important are big enough to securely swaddle the baby.  They are light weight and all-around a great blanket.Giving them 4 stars because they are not quite as soft or large as the more expensive brand, but they are great blankets and I use them every day.
