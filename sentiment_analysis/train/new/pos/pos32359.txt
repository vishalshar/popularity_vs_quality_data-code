I got this pump because I was tired of hand expressing whenever I needed to leave my baby for a short time.This pump is a godsend .Being that I never used a electric I cant compare the two,however I do know this pump is very comfortable & expresses milk quickly .I can get 4-9 oz out of one breast in  3-7 minutes.I express milk daily & store it for later use.The silicone petals produce a letdown as if my baby were nursing.The kit itself is very handy for travel.I keep a small bottle of hand sanitizer in my kit.Just the other day I was pumping in a dressing room while shopping.It is very discreet.You just have to purchase two extra gel packs to keep the milk cool, but most hospitals give them away with thier going home kit,so needless to say I didn't have to purchase anything extra.
