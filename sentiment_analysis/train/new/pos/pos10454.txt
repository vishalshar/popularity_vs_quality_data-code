We've gone through a ridiculous number of cups for our "spirited" one-year-old, and this cup is by far the best we've found.  I'm sure everyone already knows that straw cups are better than sippy cups (although I admit that we have both types), so I'll skip that part.Here's why the Vital Straw Cup is absolutely genius:1.  It's translucent but not completely clear, so I can see what's in the cup and how much is left without necessarily seeing all the little bits of food that make their way in there with my son's backwash.  E[...] . .2.  It has a lid, so I can just throw it in my bag without getting the straw dirty.  But what makes the lid even better is that if we don't want to deal with it, I can pop the entire thing off!3.  It has a textured surface (the opaque part of the cup), so my son can grip it easily.4.  It's absolutely does not leak. He has thrown this thing countless times (like I said, "spirited"), and it has yet to give up a drop.5.  The straw actually stays put.  No matter how hard he throw it, the straw does not become dislodged.6.  It fits standard-size cup holders.7.  It's not obnoxious-looking, like so many baby/children's products are.I'm not sure what the less-than-glowing reviews are referring to, as we have three of these, and I haven't found any of them difficult to drink out of.  My son has been using this cup since before he turned one, and he's never had a problem with it.
