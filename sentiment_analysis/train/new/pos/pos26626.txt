As a self-acknowledged expert on packing coolers, I appreciate a thin ice pack that can lie on top of a six-pack or container of dip, between stacked containers, or even between them vertically.  However, it's important to note that this item does not retain total flexibility when frozen, and can't be easily wrapped around items the way I had visualized it.  Once frozen, the gel becomes completely hard and inflexible, and the slim joints between the pillows don't offer much play until it starts to thaw out.  It is basically a rigid, flat mat, and if that is what you are expecting, you will be satisfied.
