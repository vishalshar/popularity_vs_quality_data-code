After seeing a few negative reviews on this product I was a bit skeptical in getting these forMy LG, but I was really tired of using the snappi as the ones I got were a bit weak and flimsy and they would leave a mark across her stomach, so I went ahead and got the boingos and believe me I don't regret one bit, they are awesome they hold tight once angled properly and the best part is it doesn't leave a mark on her tummy which was a plus for me, my LG seems really comfortable now in cloth than when I was using the snappi, they do poke little holes in the diapers but the holes will disappear after washing,  I have only been using these for a few days now but if ever I encounter any problems will be sure to let you know.
