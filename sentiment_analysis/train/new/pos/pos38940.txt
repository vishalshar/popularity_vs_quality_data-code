This is an inexpensive but very well-made monitor. This monitor does what we wanted it to do; it provides excellent sound from the grandbaby's room to wherever we position the receiver anywhere throughout our large home.  The sound it produces is clear and perfect.  We love this monitor and it was much less expensive than many of the other ones we looked at.  This monitor has provided a year's use already and we expect many more years of great service. This is a great product!
