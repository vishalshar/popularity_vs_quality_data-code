I love this bedding! I looked for months for a cute girly jungle theme & everything I found was unbelievably expensive. This was even cheaper than what I was looking for and it looks great. The colors are very bright & vibrant.The blanket's border feels like velvet which makes feel more "boutique." I had no problems with the bumper fitting my crib. I love the fact that this is so much more than just pink. There is several shades of pink, green, red, brown, blue... and that makes it so much easier to find things to match it. I bought this for my first baby girl (3rd child) & I could not be happier with it!!
