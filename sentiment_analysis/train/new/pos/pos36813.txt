I bought this for my son because his old booster seat (Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster Seat) didn't fit under our new kitchen table when strapped on his chair.  We got it in black, which blends in nicely with our black kitchen chairs.  I love it because it's low enough to scoot under the table, and it's so easy to just pick up and move to another seat, so a chair isn't tied up with a booster.  It's easy to clean since it's just one piece, and no straps to get gunky or dangle.My son LOVES it because it is soft and comfy, and it puts him at the perfect height at the table.  We don't take it when we go to visit other people because he just sits in a chair a little low then.I would not recommend this for kids under 2 (like my youngest son who is 18 mo) because they need to be strapped in.  But for older kids (my older son is 3 1/2) it is perfect.  Well worth the price.
