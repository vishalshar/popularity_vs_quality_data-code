I was worried about the lock after reading other reviews, but really needed something to store cleaning products in away from my 2 year old.I have been using this for over a month now and have not had any problems.  It's a nice size, my tall dishwasher soap fits well.  My daughter who figures out how to use/do everything has not figured this out yet.  It has been a relief to have my cleaning supplies locked up, I don't have any doors on my kitchen cabinets and she was starting to climb on top of the counters to get stuff, now they are safely locked up from her.  I gave it only four stars because the lock does seem cheep, but so far I have not had any problems with it.
