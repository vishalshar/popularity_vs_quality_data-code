I purchased this attracted to the word "Mozart" - he's my favorite composer. This picture is a little misleading - I was intrigued with these circles. This picture actually shows 3 magic flutes. What I liked about it is that the circular format is very interesting - plays almost like a harmonica - but I was surprised with the accuracy of the notes.
