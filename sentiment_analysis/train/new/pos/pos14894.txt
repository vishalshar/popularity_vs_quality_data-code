I bought an Olive Kids bedding set for my toddler's bed (crib converted to toddler). It was an animal print, super cute, but no matter how many times I washed it with tricks and hints to soften bedding, it stayed itchy and scratchy and he was very vocal about his disapproval. I got back to Amazon (my favorite place to shop for such things) and was looking around. I found this one, and I hmm'd and hah'd a while, mostly over the price which seems so high for kid's bedding. They aren't off in comparison, so I bit the bullet. I absolute love it! I didn't catch that it had the huggable end (on blanket & sheet) to keep kids from kicking it off, that ends up being great and makes making the bed take a second. The sheets & comforter are very soft. Washes up well in my opinion. Other reviews mention the puckering of the embroidery portion; I really didn't notice much of that. It looks slightly wrinkled, but if I (and I don't have care to) wanted to, I could easily iron it flat. Glad I bought this set, and have since bought accessories here and there that are part of this set, and some aren't I just made it work.
