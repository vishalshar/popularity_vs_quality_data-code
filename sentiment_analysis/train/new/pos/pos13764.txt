At swimming lessons, my newly two year old son was digging around in the "pool" toys bin for something to play with during free time. He literally squealed "phone!" when he saw this at the bottom of the bin! Of course, at that point, it was waterlogged and no longer working, but that didn't matter. He was fascinated by the "glass"/clear screen and holding it in the water, waving his little fingers behind it and watching it splash. He was quoting Duck Dynasty ("Happy, Happy, Happy!") upon seeing the happy face "app" button. He played with it the entire 10 minutes (we were surprised that it mostly floats, too!) The next day at free time, it was the first thing he went to in the bin. All week, he kept digging for that phone to play with.He liked it so much, I decided to purchase one to have at our house (probably not for use in the pool!) It is really simple and cute, and is a favorite (even my seven year old enjoys pretending on it!)
