Tired of being gnawed upon and constantly cleaning dropped teething rings while wearing my little one in the Moby wrap, I began looking into teething jewelry. Lots of the silicone baby-safe jewelry stated things in the review like "picks up lint" (gross!) or tangles in hair (ouch!). I kept looking and found this wooden key necklace. I figured if my little teether didn't like it, we could use it as a pretend play house key.  The first time I wrote this, my daughter happily chewed away on it for a good 20 minutes while I did some housework. She really enjoys it. It is easy for her to hold and easy to wear. The cotton string is long enough that I don't feel choked if she pulls on it. My only suggestion for improvement would be some sort of breakaway clasp on the necklace so the string could be removed temporarily so baby could use the teether when not in the baby carrier without concern of getting tangled up in the string. Great little product!
