We started using this swing when our son was one week old.... not as a swing of course, but as a bassinet. The chair folds out into the prefect place for a baby to sleep soundly...and you can even carry it from room to room without disturbing them. By month two we rocked him in the chair to calm him, and if he fell alseep we just opened the chair right up and left him go (no moving a sleeping baby). And now at four months old he love to swing in his swing and listen to the various songs it plays. I even sit him the the seat for feedings. This product really does have multi uses, WE COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT!!!Re-review: OK, no more than 2 days after i first wrote this review, the motor went out on our swing. My brother who is an electrical tech said it was a poorly designed motor upon taking it apart.Fisherprice does offer replacement motors for $25... but like my brother said it's a poor design and a new one will eventually give out too. Anyway, my fiance and I went out and bought a Graco Luvin Hug swing which is Awesome to say the least. I still do love the 3 in one rocker swing. It's a fantastic idea, and if you have the money to keep buying new motors... it's worth it
