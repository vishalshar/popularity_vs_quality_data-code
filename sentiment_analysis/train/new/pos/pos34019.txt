Really.  These are the best bibs.  They're sturdy, and the pouches stay open on their own.  The bibs actually lie flat until you snap them into place to form the pouches before using them, which means you just unsnap them to dump the leftovers. They're easy to clean.  The instructions say to wipe them down, but I've also found that if I just throw them in a regular cold laundry load, they come out clean and nearly dry.  If I wash them by hand, it takes a while for them to dry.  They're really wide, so they give good protection to our little guy's clothes.  They snap in the back, so he doesn't rip them off like he doesn't rip them off like he does the Velcro ones.  Also, the snaps don't wear down with use (food, washing, chewing...) like Velcro does.  If you're looking for a super compact bib, this is not the one, but if you're looking for a super effective bib, this is it.The only downside I see to these bibs is the not so great designs on them.  This is by far the best looking one.
