I wanted a diaper bag that didn't look like one, well this is it. It looks like a nice large black purse. I actually use it as a purse because I was tired of carrying her diaper bag and my purse every where. Plenty of pockets and room for your stuff, and extra out fit or two for your baby, burp cloths, diapers, wipes, bottles, etc. Everything I need for myself and my daughter fits in here with plenty of room left. It has a clip for your keys and a clip to attach it to a stroller or cart which is nice at the grocery store. I have been using this daily for 2 months now and really like it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because even though it has long straps for some reason it NEVER stays on my shoulder without me holding it. So if I am trying to take my daughter out in her car seat and have this on my shoulder at the same time it NEVER fails that the bag drops off my shoulder and then I am dragging it along with the car seat. So now I go outside and put my bag in the car first and then get my daughter and put her in. So I really dislike that, but  compared to all the positives about it I deal with it.
