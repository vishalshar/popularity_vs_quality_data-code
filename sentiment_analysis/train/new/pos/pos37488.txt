I love having this toy attached to my car seat and my son (3 months) loves it as well. It does, in fact, say on it's tag not to leave it on in moving vehicles but I can't see any issues with doing so. If you do choose to take it off the Velcro is very easy to take off and put back on very easily. The tunes are quite catchy and my son has just started grabbing for the toys. The only problem I have had with it is that the batteries that it came with seem to be dying and I have only been using it for a month or so. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this as it has helped in many car rides and grocery store trips.
