I really love this cabinet. It's perfect for our nursery. It's pricey, but I don't know how we'd keep things organized without it. To make it just a little bit better, I installed three small hooks on the left side of the cabinet, to hang small toys to give to my baby to distract him while I change him. If you have a mobile infant, be sure to mount the cabinet pretty high on the wall; otherwise, your baby will try to reach up and grab at the wipes, etc.
