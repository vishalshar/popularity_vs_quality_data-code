This is our second Bunnies by the Bay Wee Plush (we have it in white and pink). My daughter loved the white so much that she requested the pink for years without giving up, so I finally got one for her stocking. The first we bought in an airport when she was 1 1/2, and she slept on it like a pillow during the flight. No she's 5 1/2 and she still wanted to get the pink one.These do get somewhat matted and less puffy over time, as one might expect. I have washed ours in the washing machine about twice. But for the amount of play and cuddling it gets it looks great, and it ages well (kind of has a vintage look). A very classy, high-end looking stuffed animal. All the features are sewn on. It has little blush on the cheeks which is a nice detail. The fur is supper soft. The body is very round and plump, but squishy and floppy. The ears are floppy. When you set it down it always flops into a new (but still sitting up) position, which gives it a lot of personality.
