My cousin has children who are 22 months apart, and when my little guy was born 22 months after my daughter, I knew I needed to invest in a double stroller!  This has been a life saver!!  I tried taking them both out once before I purchased this with my son in a baby bjorn carrier and my daughter in the stroller.  It was not fun!  This stroller is so versatile and easy to use!  Totally worth the money!  I wish I purchased this when my daughter was born and then spent the money on the doubles kit when my son arrived, but you live and learn!  I LOVE my phil and ted's explorer stroller!!
