Despite mixed reviews for this toilet lock, I purchased two to fit relatively standard toilets in my home.  Installation took under two minutes, and I didn't have any problems with reaching into the toilet to complete the installation.  You shouldn't have to get dirty, in the water or otherwise too up close with gross.  Besides, a little soap and water can go a long way if you aren't unreasonably squeemish about poopies (if you have kids and you aren't over it yet. . . you may have a problem with OCD).I am sure that in some situations the lock would break if it was subjected to repeated or significant force, but my 13 month old cannot open it.  I try to prevent her from playing near the toilet anyway, through parenting rather than gadgets, but the lock gives me peace of mind that she won't make a mess or get hurt if she gets by my watchful eye.I am only giving 4 stars on account of the perceived chance of the lock failing or breaking under ordinary use (like if a guest tries to opent the toilet without unlocking it) and the fact that my plastic toilet seat has been slightly damaged on the bottom by the lock.  There are several chips and dings around the edge of the seat where parts of the lock are sandwiched between the seat and the rim of the bowl with some force when people sit down on the toilet. Please don't comment that I am being unduly harsh.  I say that the product is a steal for what it costs, but it isn't perfect, and 4/5 seems fair to me.
