I'm surprised by how many people have complained about the comfort of this seat.  Both of my babies have slept peacefully in it.  I actually bought it because a chiropractor friend of mine thought it had better back support than most seats out there.  I agreed because it actually has a back support on it unlike so many seats that are just a sling of fabric with nothing under it.  I agree that the toys aren't very exciting but it depends on what use you have for it.  Neither of my children enjoyed playing in the seat but it was a great place for them to take a nap and still be close to me.  When they were ready to play I took them out and either played with them myself or put them on the floor with a play mat toy over them.  This seat took up a lot less space than a pack and play so it was a perfect nap spot on the main floor of the house.  We never took it outside, but rather liked the zip up feature as extra protection from our dog who loved to kiss the babies.  The only thing I didn't like about the seat is because of the net, it is short and the baby outgrows it as soon as their feet grow long enough to reach the bottom.  In the same respect, when my children were that large (one was very tall for her age), they were ready to get out of it and roll around on the floor.
