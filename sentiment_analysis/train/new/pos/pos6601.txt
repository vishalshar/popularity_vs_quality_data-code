Solid wood product with great colors.  The toy is of such high quality that even after use by our children - rough-housing boys - it can be passed on to their cousins.  The wood balls have minor dings from being thrown on hard floors and the fireplace; however, the paint does not chip.  The boxes are still in like-new condition.  They are loose enough for a toddler to stack them inside one another and not too loose that they feel flimsy or cheap.  Highly recommended.
