Great pacifier!! Life saver!! Recommend for the following reasons:1. They are orthodontic. For some silly reason, we only had philips avent soothies for the first six months of my son's life. He was colicky and needed a pacifier, but could not keep them in, so someone had to hold it in for him. We just thought he couldn't keep any pacifier in, but I had a brilliant idea to try and order a different kind and voila! He can keep it in until he decides to spit it out!2. They are up/down ambiguous, so it's easier for me to put it in and he can even do it himself.3. He used to always grab at his other pacifiers, like the ones with the loop or ring and he was always pulling it out. This one has hardly anything for him to hold onto.4. Glow in the dark! I don't know if he'll be able to find it at night by himself, but if I charge it and hand it to him in his crib, he is mystified by it long enough for me to sneak out unnoticed.I need to buy more!
