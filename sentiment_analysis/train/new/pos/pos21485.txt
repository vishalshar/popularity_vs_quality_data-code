My 1 yo was constantly twiddling with my other boob. You know, the one he wasn't drinking from. It drive me mad! I keep trying to give him toys, or my hands to play with. But NO! He would simply not have it! And then, I found this.  Ordered it and as soon as fit arrived, i put it to the test. Voila! Freedom! Now, he'll nurse, leave my other tata alone and if he still needs to chew on something, he goes straight to it. It's a boobie saver!
