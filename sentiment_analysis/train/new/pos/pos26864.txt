I looked at dozens of "first tooth/first curl" porcelain boxes on the Internet, & had my heart set on a very expensive set of Limoges porcelain boxes, before I chanced upon this Mud Pie set. The price was so inexpensive that I wasn't expecting to be dazzled or anything, but boy was I ever wrong. This is PERFECT for either your child or as a gift for other parents.
