I got this to protect my toddler from the sharp edges of the marble island in our new house.  This product does a great job of reducing a potential danger.  Instead of sharp marble corners, I now have soft, foam covered corners.  It doesn't eliminate danger, but it does reduce it.That said, the small adhesive squares that come with the product were not sufficient to get it to stick in my house.  It might have worked better if I'd been putting it on a straight edge, but with a corner, the bend in the foam makes it harder to stick.  I purchased a heavier duty double sided adhesive strip and it worked great.  I'd also suggest attaching only one side, allowing it to stick, then folding over the other part of the corner.  It was an extra $4 to get the stronger adhesive, but worth it and not an overall negative for the product.
