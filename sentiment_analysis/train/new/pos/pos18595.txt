Fits great in Graco Pack & Play changing station - covers the entire area so little one isn't touching cold surface of the plastic like mat. Great size to lay on floor or bed too. 4 month old still fits on this with whole body covered, unsure why anyone would use the "lap pads." Wash/dry fine without wear/tear like other waterproof mats. It is all one layer, so no separation with multiple washes.
