It's basically, well, a bassinet stand. And, well, it works as expected. And it works, you know, with the Skate system.Seriously though, it's lightweight, holds the bassinet very securely using the standard system the Peg uses across this line and also has wheels which make moving it through the house very simple - and brakes to keep it where you put it once you get there.My only complaint is when assembling, it seemed like it was more difficult than it should be to fully open each leg to lock it using the locking button. Granted, once it's in there, it's secure. But I think I had to roll a natural 20 against my strength to get it there.We never once used the little storage platform that was on the bottom. When I disassembled for storage after the bassinet stage I found it had perfectly collected dust and grime instead. Eww. But, with a quick wipe, it did clean easily.
