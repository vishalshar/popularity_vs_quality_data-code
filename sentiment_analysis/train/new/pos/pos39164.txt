There are plenty of more expensive playmat options out there, but really, for less money, this activity gym is great.  My daughter loves all the dangling animals, especially the frog that vibrates which is a totally new and interesting sensation for her to feel, and the musical sun, which, as others have said, would've been nice if it played music for a longer time.  That is my only complaint.  She is least interested in the dangling teething leaves as actual teethers, but likes to pull on them.  Also, this gym comes with one of the better baby mirrors I have seen.  A lot of mirrors designed for baby seem to distort things or make things look blurry.  This is a really good mirror that once she discovered herself in it, really captivated her.  This activity gym is bright and colorful and has lots of little holes in the arches so that you can add other toys with rings for your baby to play with, which I have done to keep things interesting for her.  I've yet to wash this so I can't comment on how well it holds up in the wash, but the fabric is easily wiped clean with a damp rag which I've done to clean up drool and little spit up spots.  Baby gear is not cheap so when you can find something more affordable that does just as good of a job as something more expensive, you shouldn't pass it up.
