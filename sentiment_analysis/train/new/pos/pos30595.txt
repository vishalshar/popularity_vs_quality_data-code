I like the two different sides this blanket has to offer, very soft. It's a cute blanket, don't think the picture does justice although the color pink is very light, with pops of orange, yellow & bright pink flowers, lime green stems & leaves. Looking at Minnie's dress, small butterfly & lady bug all have the light & or, bright pink.I noticed after washing in cool water, medium heat (not the instructions: cold, gentle & tumble dry on low) I've lost 1/2" in width & length, don't want to lose more.The only reason giving 4 stars is, I would have liked this to coordinate with the Disney Baby, Minnie Mouse Crib Sheet in Pink (& aqua) accents, but this is much lighter with bolder accent colors.
