I recently traveled with my 1 year old daughter and we took our peg-perego si with us.  We bought this bag as the other bags have different dimensions that wouldn't work for the size of our stroller.  The peg-perego si fit perfectly into this bag.  The bag is thin & light and does its job well.  Our stroller didn't get dirty nor damaged.  It was used for 4 flights and barely shows signs of wear.  It comes with a tag to put personal information (name, phone #, address) and the zippers are easy to open and close.  Recommend it.Edited to add:  I've done a lot more traveling since my last review, so figured I'd give an update.  My daughter and I spent all summer traveling in europe and this stroller bag has survived more flights and abuse from baggage handlers than I can count.  It's worn on a few places but the zipper still works and everything is in perfect working condition.  This bag saved my daughter's stroller for sure.
