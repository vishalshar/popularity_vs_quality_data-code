Love it, I didn't realize how important the bumpers on the handle bars would be. I would have thought that the wood would be a bit cheaper so I was pleasantly surprised.  Also, the tool to assemble are included. My 2 year old was a bit smaller but I added another hole to the seat and it was perfect.
