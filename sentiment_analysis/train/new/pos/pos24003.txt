I bought this pump for using at work and for taking on a vacation.  It was extremely convenient, and I loved using it!!  That's why I was so disappointed when I started having some problems with the suction.  Because of my previous success, I wasn't ready to give up on it and called the First Years Parent Service for help.  Their customer service was awesome and they talked me through a cleaning process which brought my suction back to life!!To save other moms (who might be having the same problem) a phone call, here's what they told me. I took notes, so for anyone interested:  -To check for milk in pumping mechanism/to clean the inside of the pump; twist the blue rim to take off the top.  Then flip it over and line the little blue hole up with the middle of the handle and pull the two pieces apart. Then I just took out the clear plastic part and handwashed the inside parts of the pump separately.  -To put back together; place the clear plastic part back into the blue part.  They told me to rub my finger around the edges of the clear plastic to make sure there were no air bubbles (not doing this step was the reason I was having problems with the suction!!)  To attach the two pieces, make the hook on the white handle, clip under the white "push pin".  In order to twist these two parts together, its important to flip it over again and line the little blue hole up with the middle of the handle, then twist a half way around so the little hole is furthest away from the handle.  In attaching the handle to the rest of the pump, just line up the two arrows, then twist so that the arrow on the handle lines up with the line on the other part.I'm still using this pump and its working great!!  I would definitely recommend it for the on-the-go and busy moms!!
