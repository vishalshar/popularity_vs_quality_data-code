When looking for a high chair I knew what I didn't want: a stand-alone piece to take up space and something with a hideous cushion design that went with nothing in my house. This chair is perfect. Not only is it easy to assemble and use, it also has an easily removable (and washable) cushion that has a pattern that doesn't clash with my decor. There aren't a whole lot of nooks and crannies for food to get trapped so the base is also easy to clean, and it doesn't take up anymore space than a regular dining room chair.The only drawback is that it does occupy one of your existing chairs, but for my small family it's a non-issue.
