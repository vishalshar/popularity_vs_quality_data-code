The crib is just as it looks in the picture. We wanted the Ikea sundvik but they were sold out. I was worried I wouldn't like this one as much but I was pleasantly surprised. It came with no issues and was free delivery with the super saver shipping. Came in a very large box, so not a lot of assembly. My husband did it himself in 30 minutes. The baby hasn't slept in it yet, so not sure how it stands up to a lot of use. I would recommend it just based on looks though.
