A permanent solution to the front wheel castering problem is TY25797 graphite aresol spray from John Deere. Remove the front wheel, Shake well and put a light coating on the wheel mounting post. Let the coating dry, then reinstall. You will have to move the wheel around by hand to break it in. After a week or so of regular use it will caster freely- I did this over a year ago and have had no further problems. This spray is pretty nasty stuff so be careful!Also the three wheel strollers are notoriously sensitive to tire pressure. If you are having front wheel wobbling issues, the lubrication above and tire pressure should fix it.[...]Of note, our handle broke at the junction between the handlebar and the brake unit. So far no help from customer service on a replacement part or assistance in getting the issue repaired.// update- I had an excellent customer service experience getting our broken handlebar sorted out- kudos to Customer support team.
