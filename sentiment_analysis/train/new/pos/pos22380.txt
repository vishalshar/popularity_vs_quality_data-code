I love this thing!  The biscotti color is just beautiful and the fabric/velvet are really nice and clean easily with just a baby wipe.  It's very luxerious looking!  More importantly though I love the fact that my son's head doesn't slump forward when he falls asleep in the car, he stays nice and sugglie!We also have the Boulevard 70CS that were using for our older child and loved so it was kind of a no-brainer that we wanted to get the Pavilion, which is replacing the Boulevard model.  At first I found the new HUGS straps very frustrating to work with (you have to hold the release button and pull the strap ABOVE the chest clip to get slack) but even after figuring that out I still found that the straps are not long enough for our little chubs.  I called Britax (1-888-427-4829), as suggested by another reviewer, and provided the car seat serial number, batch number and manufacture date and they sent longer straps free of charge, no questions asked.  They indicated that the longer straps are for children in the highest height/weight percentile, which certainly applies to us!  I am super impressed with their products and their customer service.  We have now spent a small fortune on 4 Britax car seats (Boulevard, Pavilion and 2 Frontiers) but for the safety, piece of mind, ease of installing and everyday use and customer service I consider them worth every penny!
