We purchased one of these before our baby was born along with the Simmons Changing Pad and this thing works GREAT (so does the pad)!  I am actually buying two more because my daughter likes having her diaper off a little too much and has had some accidents on the only one we have.  Soooo, Mom told me to get two more so she didn't have to wash it so much.  Not that the washing matters, this thing has held up GREAT in the wash with no problems (after at least 10 washes)!  I'm not sure what machines other peeps are using or what they are washing it with, but my wife throws it in with the towels and it comes out perfect.Now, the reason for the 5 stars... our daughter Annabelle absolutley LOVES this thing!  It must be the terry cloth feel but it's one of the few places I can place her where she is happy for minutes at a time.  After changing her and putting on her nightgown, she will lay there for sometimes 15 minutes as I talk to her and get her to smile and talk.  It's really turned into a GREAT bonding moment for Dad and daughter and I really think it's the terrycloth.  When that's not on there and we just use the vinyl pad, she's never happy, it's almost like she's missing a cuddly stuffed animal or something... all I know is that these special moments I have with my daughter have really meant alot to me and I really don't think they would have happened if it wasn't for her cover... I'm really trying to be serious here, I have no connection to this product and I rarely post my opinion, but I felt several peeps on here were WAY to harsh on this product.  As I like to say in the computer world, it must be "user error".Good luck and God bless!
