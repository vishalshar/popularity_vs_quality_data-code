My husband plays soccer so I was looking for a toy to incorporate this for my baby girl. Most things I found where clearly boyish, this was the most "girly" one I could find. While it's not her favorite toy, she does like the noise it makes and watching mommy move it (I don't have her hold it yet as I'm afraid she's going to knock herself in the head with it).Plastic is not painted so no need to work about that if your little one likes to gnaw/chew things
