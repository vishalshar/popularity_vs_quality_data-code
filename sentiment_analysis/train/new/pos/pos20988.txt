The bebepod is the best out there.  Our grown children purchased the other well known foam seat with snap on tray.  We purchased the bebepod.  Our granddaughter, who is nearly 6 months old has to practically squeeze into the other seat.  The Prince Lionheart has more room, yet holds her firmly in the seat.  The back is a better support, and it has a lap belt and belts to secure it to a chair.  Be sure to purchase the FLEX bebepod.  If it doesn't say FLEX, then the pommel won't twist off for the additional tray.  We also purchased the tray that is available for the FLEX seat.  The white pommel "twists" off and the tray slides into the bracket.  The tray has a playmat, a placemat, and a grooved area with a removable toy.  This has become her high chair at our house.  It is so portable, we even take her and sit her in front of the mirror to "play" with the other baby.  It's definitely worth the money!
