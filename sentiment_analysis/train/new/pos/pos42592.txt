When it was time for me to go back to work, I was a little worried about what type of bottles I would use for my son. My experience with weaning my now-ten-year-old daughter from breast to bottle was quite horrifying. Both of us were crying: she because she wanted breast when I wanted her to get used to the bottle and I was crying because she was screaming and crying so much and I knew this was something that she would eventually have to get used to, and nobody likes it when their baby is miserable. I finally had to call on my mother to help me get my daughter accustomed to taking a bottle nipple. Fast forward ten years to a new baby and time to go back to work and I really didn't want to go through that experience again. Also I wanted to pump breastmilk at work to ensure that my son would be breastfed for a little while longer. After receiving an advertisement in my email from LearningCurve for these bottles and after looking at the website and reading different reviews I decided to give these bottles a try. And boy am I glad I did! My son was 12 weeks old when I first tried these bottles and nipples with him, and he sucked as if I was nursing him from my breast! My husband and I couldn't believe what we were seeing and hearing - since my little one was sucking quite loudly and vigorously! I was so happy and relieved that neither of us would have a traumatic experience trying to get him to take a bottle nipple. And he has absolutely no problems going from breast to bottle and back again. It's almost as if he doesn't know the difference. Thank you, thank you for these bottles; I am convinced that they have saved both my son and me from days and days of crying.
