I have tried a few different brands of shields to try to get my baby to nurse effectively, and so far these are my favorite.  I have found that most shields have large holes for the milk to come through, and my skin ends up coming through as well and this is very painful.  These shields are very flimsy, but the holes are smaller and therefore much more comfortable in that aspect.  The biggest con that I can see is that they are smaller in the middle so they are a little awkward to place.  But because of the flimsy material, they are not terribly difficult to place and I can feel the baby nursing much better and he is able to nurse more effectively emptying the breast with little trouble.  This was not happening with the other brands of shields.  So I give this product 4 stars even though there are a few flaws.  But I am purchasing more, if that gives you any idea of how I feel about it.
