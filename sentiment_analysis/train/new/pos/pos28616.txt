Vibrant and beautiful colors, be aware that the crib fitted sheet does run a little smaller than the standard crib mattress size, even though I checked the dimensions before purchasing.  Other than the comforter's colors fading after first wash, the comforter is very soft and baby seems comfortable and I absolutely love this set.  I'm able to incorporate different colors in the kids room when I want to mix it up and it still matches.
