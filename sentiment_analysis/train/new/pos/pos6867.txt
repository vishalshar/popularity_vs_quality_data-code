We have been using adaptable car seats with LATCH (as boosters) for our two boys, but recently bought a car with a third-row seat.  We bought two of these in hopes that they would be light enough to be easily moveable to access the back seat or move the kids back there when other adults need to use the middle row.  This seat gets excellent points for that- light, portable, and easy to move around the car.  Attractive, easy to asssemble, and the boys love the dual cup holders and moveable arm rests.  The seat also makes it easy to position the shoulder strap appropriately for the child's size.  Other pluses: the fabric is easy to put on and take off, making clean-up easy, and the back is easy to remove but stays properly attached unless released- we remove the back for even easier portability to other cars on short trips.Drawbacks: the plastic material is more flexible (flimsy?) than I would like.  The side supports on the head rest are just slightly too small, such that the boys' heads slide off sometimes when they are sleeping (a silly millimeter or two more would seem to have done the trick).  The boys complained about their bottoms hurting on longer trips (a few hours or more), although we seem to have fixed that by sliding a thin piece of foam rubber under the bottom seat cover.Overall, the shortcomings are acceptable given that there is a significant increase in cost to the next models up the food chain, and some of those that I have had experience with (through neighbors, nieces and nephews) have other drawbacks that this seat doesn't.Bottom line- happy with the purchase.
