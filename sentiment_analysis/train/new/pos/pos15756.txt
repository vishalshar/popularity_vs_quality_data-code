Bought this xtra camera with new baby monitor for 4 year old with bedroom on different level.  Works great! comes in handy especially when child is sick and needs monitoring . Easy to flip between cameras with slide selector switch on side of unit. Monitor has screen saver mode to turn off to save picture but sound still is on. Many people mistake this for a problem with monitor unit but it is'nt. I have recommended this to several people looking for baby monitors. Worth the money. No interference! Night vision is right on the money. Many people say they can't see the colors at night . Thats not the purpose with this unit.Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8" Screen - Silver
