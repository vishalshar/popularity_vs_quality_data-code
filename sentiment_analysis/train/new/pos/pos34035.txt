I bought these in place of the disposable NUK pads. I found that wearing the disposables for more than a few hours would start to have an odor and that drove me crazy - maybe because the ventilation wasn't good enough. Since buying these Udder Cover pads, I haven't had that issue! I can wear these all day and not have issues with odors. I also love that you can wash them and they're ready to go again instead of spending money each month on a 30 day (or more often, less) supply box - just pop them in the washer with all the newborn clothes washing you're doing anyway!! I pump my milk instead of breastfeed directly and I haven't had issues with leaking through these yet, and I've had as much as 7 hour gaps between pumping sessions.The downfall is that you can definitely tell you're wearing them in a t-shirt if you have a thin nursing bra on, as they're a little bit thicker than a disposable (although disposables were visible too).  They do crumple a little bit after washing, but they do shape back easily...I'm sure if you ironed them they'd be good as new again.Overall I've been very happy with these, and you can't beat the price!  I bought 3 packages and have washed them over and over...no issues with them falling apart or anything.
