The first day we got this swing and put our 3 month old on the swing, he fell asleep right away.  Even to this day, this swing has done its job wonderfully.  Our 3 month old is the type of baby that you need to rock to sleep, so this swing was just perfect.  As my baby started growing, carrying and rocking him all the time started giving me back pain.  So, I definitely recommend this swing to anyone that has the same issues or just wants their baby to be rocked by a swing instead of manually.The product has three timer settings - 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes.  This is great to make sure the baby falls asleep before the swing shuts off.  Also, this product has many swing speed settings - but we usually just set it to the first or second slowest swing speed because the faster swing speeds looked uncomfortably fast.  There are also two positions in which you can recline the seat - a semi-reclined and a fully-reclined position.  Our baby doesn't like to lay flat on his back most of the time, so we put him on the semi-reclined position and he's fine.  The swing is also portable and folds up easily.  Although we haven't brought it anywhere else yet, the swing doesn't take up that much space once it's folded so I can't see any real issues moving this swing around.
