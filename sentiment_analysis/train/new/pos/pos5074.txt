The quality of these forks and spoons is very nice - solid and without sharp edges that cheaply made molded plastic items often have.  They go through the dishwasher just fine.  Also the forks are not too sharp.  I feel very safe giving these to my 12-month old to feed herself with or play with.  The handles are very easy to hold and not too long; for example she can stick the munchkin spoon's handle in her mouth too far and gag herself, and does not do so with these.  Also the shorter handle is easier for her to manipulate as she learns to use the spoon herself.  The colors are great, and so between the number and quality, this is a great deal for the price.There might be some better options for the "first spoon" when parent is completely spoonfeeding the child, but for the stage where the kid is learning to use flatware - these are the best I've found.  Actually I may have figured out why they called these "take and toss" - when your child is taking the spoon and not giving it back, or tossing it on the floor, it's nice to have more spoons at hand to keep giving them or feeding them with!
