This stroller is exactly what we wanted, with the single exception that it is a bit bulky. The single step brakes are great. It is really easy to collapse and setup. The basinet is great. However, the latch system for the basinet is a bit tricky since you have to bend down to make sure that the clips caught on. The handling is great and provides a smooth ride. The only recommendation would be to make the entire system thinner. The basinet is soo big my baby can completely roll over on either side before hitting the wall. There also is no way to hold on with a single hand, both hands are required. The wheels are large and filled with air to provide better shock absorption. It goes over gravel and bumps with little disturbance. A really great basinet type stroller.
