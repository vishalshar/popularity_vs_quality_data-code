Really really great product! We have a double decor switch in our bathroom (one switch for the fan and the other switch for the light) and this product fits perfectly on top of the light switch to allow my 3 year old son to turn the light on and off all by himself (and the fan switch is still easily accessible to the adults). It was super easy to install and we are so happy with the results. I'm going to order another one for his bedroom. :)
