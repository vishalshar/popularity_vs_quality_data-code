This is a no-frills swaddling blanket. It is not super soft like a curl-up-comfy-cozy-lie-on-couch blanket. It is a swaddling blanket. Light, comfortable material, color is exactly as pictured. I really love the size - it is a nice large size (compared to what I had bought 5 yrs ago for my son from gerber). It is perfect for what I needed to get for my nephew - which is not so much for swaddling, but as a light blanket that can be used in a stroller on a cool day, or using in layers on a colder one. This is a good, solid product. You won't be disappointed if you are looking for a nice, light swaddling blanket type.
