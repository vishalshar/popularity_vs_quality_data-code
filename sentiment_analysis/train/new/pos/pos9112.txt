I have had this bag now for about 8 months.  It's a great diaper bag for at least 4 reasons:1. Still looks/acts/feels new (the elastic on the inside is getting a little stretched out from being stuffed with toys, but that's it).2. Roomy without being too boxy, and just the right amount of stiffness and flexibility.3. Neutral color with no frills (I hated the idea of a pink, quilted, embroidered diaper bag).4. The strap is long enough to use this as a messenger bag (but I'm on the petite side).My only gripe about the bag: the black liner!  It makes it hard to see in there sometimes!  I wish they would change it to tan or gray.
