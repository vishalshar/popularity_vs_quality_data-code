So, a good friend of mine bought out the local ToysRus of these cups.  I didn't know what the big deal was, but he informed me of the nice "side effect" of these cups: they teach the little ones how to take sips out of a cup.  And, have since implemented this to my kids' routine...and it WORKS.  I was first just happy to get rid of their nasty old sippy cups, but having switched over completely to these now, i've seen the difference when having them sip out of a regular cup.  The seal on these is VERY good, and much easier to clean than a regular sippy cup with the little rubber insert.  One negative is if your kid drops the sippy on the floor, it will "splatter" a bit, as the seal on these goes all the way around, and holds a little milk in it (in the ready to be sipped).  That is so far, the only negative i have.  Took my kids a while to get used to them, but once they did all the other sippy cups got tossed!
