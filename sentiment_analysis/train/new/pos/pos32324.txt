My baby is only 5 weeks old and she loves the colors and hitting the button with her feet.  It's WAY more expensive than the non-digital versions of these, but I think it's worth the money.  It gets my baby involved in paying attention to causal relationships.  Most of the toys that you get kids just play music at them or have moving images.  Not much interactivity until you get them an iPad.  I'd rather have this at the earlier stages.One Year Update (7/2015): It worked great and the baby ended up having fun with it for the first six months.  I have some pretty fun videos of the baby kicking the base like crazy, as well as reaching up with her legs to hit the upper sensors.  For whatever reason, she never used her hands.  That may just be the progression of things, or it may just be my daughter.Downside, is it broke at some point.  The sound stop working.  I took the base apart and found that they were using some cheap solder jobs with thin wiring within the device.  The sound not working was because one of the wires became unsoldered from the speaker.  Also, taking it apart broke the soldering to the battery pack.  Like I said, weak solder joints.  So I bought a soldering iron and soldered the two wires back to where they were originally attached and they seem to be working.  Even if it was broken for good, my wife wanted us to buy another one.
