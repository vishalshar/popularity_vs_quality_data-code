the zoli cup is very easy for the kids to use and might be one of the best choice when they first switch from a bottle.  although some others may complain it's hard to wash, i think that's the problem for most cups anyway.  my complaint is it doesn't stay long--the body of the cup will show obvious wear very soon and looks old and kinda dirty (even after wash).  if you little one loves to chew the straw, you may have to change the straw every week.....the oxo tod sippy also uses a soft straw but the straw survives much better.
