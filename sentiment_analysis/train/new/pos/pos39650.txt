I love this product. When my son was young, I would use this to see if he was actually sleeping or just playing in his crib. I could talk to him using the monitor and tell him to go back to sleep or in the morning that I was coming to get him. It worked great for the most part and had better range than my previous audio monitor. When my daughter was born several months later I liked being able to cycle through and see both rooms, although the split view does not have sound so I had to use the rotating screen option.Unfortunately after over a year of owning this I've noticed that the battery is not holding a charge for very long. I used to be able to have it on for 2 naps during the day and for several hours before bed when I would plug it back in for the night. Now I'm only able to get about 2-3 hours before it needs to be charged again if I'm lucky.  If I could find a replacement battery on their website I would be happy but I think I am going to have to call them to order one or try to find one online. Other than the battery I would still recommend this product. I love having a camera so I can see what my child is doing rather than trying to listen to just audio and having to guess.
