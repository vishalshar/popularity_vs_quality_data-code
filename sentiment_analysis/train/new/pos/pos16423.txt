The Baby Einstein Seek and Discover Deluxe Gym is definitely worth buying---for either a boy or a girl! The colors are bold and bright; excellent for tummy time or laying on their back. There are toys to play with and pictures to see everywhere. Our son's two favorite things were the mirror (which he still loves today, at almost 14 months old) and the singing star. We saw some of his first smiles when he would watch the star light up and sing. Very durable and should last through any and all children you plan to have. Very, very highly recommended!!!
