So stinkin' cute, I can't stand it.  I feel like my car is exuding pink girliness as I drive down the street.  But here's the bugaboo... WHY can't these stick on well?  It's not only the Munchkin brand, but so far the dang suction cups are a pain.  Will keep reattaching.  Until baby is big enough to rip it off the window herself.
