Our 80th percentile height and 5th percentile weight toddler had absolutely no pants that would fit him.  Once you hit 12 months and you can get them with the elastic button adjuster life is much better.  Before that, what are you supposed to do?  Belt don't exist for babies because they're a suffocation hazard.  You can only wear overalls so many days in a row before it gets old.  Enter these!They fit on any pants with belt loops and can be made basically as tight as you want.  We got the neutral pack to go with most the colors of his pants, but would recommend the same pack for girls.  They're not something I would generally want to draw attention to, so putting a pink one on denim just seems ridiculous to me.  Adding the clips makes it so they can be used with pants that don't have loops.  We used them this last weekend on his tux pants and it worked great.  The downside to no loops is the middle rides up when he bends over- I'd recommend a large safety pin to keep it in place.  We got these when he was 8 months old- he's now 2 1/2 and we still use them and will be able to for a long time.They're also great when potty training because he doesn't have to figure out how to undo a belt.  He can just pull down and he's good to go.
