Over the past month, I've purchased five different cabinet locks and none of them seemed to work.  Either they didn't fit my cabinet knobs correctly, they broke with a little pressure or they were too diffucult to get unlocked for daily use. I purchased these and I really, really like them.  They're easy for an adult to get on and off, but not for a infant/toddler.  Unfortunalty, they still didn't fit my stupid cabinet knob (I'm using this to lock up my the cleaning supplies under the kitcjen sink).  So, instead of searching for new lock and one that might not neccesarily be as sturdy as this one, I just replaced my cabinet knobs!  Cost me around $3 at Home Depot ([...])  Works like a charm and took me seconds to swap them out.
