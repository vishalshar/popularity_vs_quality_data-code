I have recently purchased and installed three of these handles and they do exactly what I had hoped they would do.~  They stay put!  (They are positioned inside a freestanding shower stall.)~  They provide some guidance and support as I turn around and step in and out of the shower.I never thought I would feel secure in this shower, but with these grips in place, my confidence has returned and my fear has subsided.I am very happy with this purchase, and I WAS NOT PAID FOR nor did I receive any free product THIS REVIEW!
