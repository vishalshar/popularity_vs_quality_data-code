This stroller really is lightweight and very compact.  Opening and closing is simple and do-able with one hand if you really must.  The wheels are not great and the front wheels do a marginal job of rotating 360 degrees.  Also, I am 5' 2" and I found the handle height to be uncomfortable high for me.  There is next to no storage space underneath, but the small bag that comes with the stroller is cute and will hold diapers, wipes, a burp cloth and a small toy.  All in all, I am happy with this purchase.
