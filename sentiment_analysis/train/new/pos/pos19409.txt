These bottles are very cute, I love that they come with the holder, but some of the stoppers don't fit well for the bottles- so that's the reason why it gets a 4.  I don't use them hardly at all, so the stopper issue doesn't bother me, but it should be noted that there could be an issue.  Meaning... I'm not able to put the rim and nipple back on the bottle with stopper in place.  But, use a standard stopper and it's fine.  The caps work well.  The paint/decorations on the bottle don't chip... I've been using these for 9 months now.  Happy with them.
