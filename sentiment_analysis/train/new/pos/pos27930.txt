This was something I purchased after having my baby home for a few days. What a relief! Before having this, I kidded myself into thinking i would change my daughter in her room or in my room.  This caddy allowed me to neatly organize and contain her diapering essentials and have them handy in the living room. The case is so pretty that I don't mind storing it right under my coffee table. I'll be getting this as a shower gift for my friends in the future - its just one of those things you don't think about when you're pregnant but it's so helpful to have.
