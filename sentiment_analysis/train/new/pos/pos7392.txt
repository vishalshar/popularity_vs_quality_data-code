I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation, but my opinion wouldn't change whether I paid for it or not. It's an awesome case! Pretty sturdy, protects your device really well. It's light and not bulky at all. I was really surprised by how fast it shipped too. Also, it DOES fit the iPod Touch 5G. I've been searching for a case for my iPod and I thought it might not fit because the buttons on the side are different from the ones on the iPhone, but it's fine. Fits really well. The volume buttons may not line up the same way the ones on the iPhone do, but it still fits. The plastic separation part on the case actually goes between the two volume buttons on the side and it doesn't block anything at all. So if you've been looking for a case that would fit your iPod too, get one of these. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.
