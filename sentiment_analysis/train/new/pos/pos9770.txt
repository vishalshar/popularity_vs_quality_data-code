This crib set exceeded my expectations! It fits perfectly in the 4-in-1 Lauren crib that we purchased and the colors are very true to the pictures you see online depending on your screen resolution. One thing to note though is the polka dots that you see in the picture are not white, but more of a greenish-yellow. Still a very good set and still looks great with white in the room. Honestly, you can't beat it for the price. I would have willingly paid a little bit more for this set if need be just because it's a large amount of pieces and very good quality. Everywhere else I have looked is selling 4-piece crib sets for the same price...if not a little bit more! This is definitely worth the money and you will be very pleased with the results.
