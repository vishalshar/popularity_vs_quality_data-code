Aiming to eliminate back pain, I ordered this pillow.  Ordering online, I wasn't sure what to expect, and was prepared to send this back if needed.  I have already used the boppy and random throw pillows to support my arm while nursing...and was never very comfortable.  I love the way this pillow props my elbow up while nursing so I don't hunch my shoulders forward.  I also love the paisley shape; I find it to be so versatile.  I can put either the wide or narrow section under my elbow on the side I am nursing.  The shape also allows for options depending on how wide of a chair you are sitting in.  I've found this to be comfortable on couches, in large recliners, as well as smaller wooden chairs with confining arms.  A bonus I've found is after a feeding I have used the pillow on my lap to prop baby up comfortably.  The fabric is nothing special- seems to be a polyester, but it is soft, washable, and I like the grey/white pattern.  The handle on the wide side of the pillow is so useful, I take it in the car with me, to meetings and gatherings.  I have used it for 2 months now, and it is holding its shape well.  It is not memory foam, but a sturdy foam that cushions without collapsing.When my daughter saw the pillow, she remarked that when I am finished using it for nursing, I can use it as a "knee pillow"-- to prop between my knees while side sleeping.  She's right; it would serve that purpose marvelously!I feel this pillow would be appropriate for any nursing mom, regardless of her chest size.  I wear a DD bra and like to have the support under my arm, easing tension in arm, shoulder and neck muscles.  My chiropractor approves!  He also shared that he once had a patient with a fussy baby; when she introduced the nursing pillow, the baby was no longer fussy.  Perhaps this is better for the tiny spines of our babies as well!  I am currently nursing my 6th baby, and only wish I had discovered this pillow earlier!  Highly recommended!
