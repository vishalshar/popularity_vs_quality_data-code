I bought this backpack/harness for my 18 month-old son for a trip to Disney World in October. To say that I was glad I had it was an understatement. He's at an age where he doesn't want to be in the stroller and is way too curious to stay by my side. Having this allowed him to walk on his own, as he wished, while still keeping him close by me. This was particularly important in the airport, as I was by myself with 3 kids, a stroller and a car seat and only 1 person offered to help me during the entire trip down to FL and back.Previous reviewers commented that the backpack was too small. Perhaps for a child of 3 or 4; I know my almost 4 year-old daughter would have thought so. But for my son it was the perfect size. It easily accommodated 2 board books, 2 cars and 3 horses from the Little People farm. He especially liked that he looked like a big kid with a backpack and wanted to wear it everywhere. Without the toys and books a sippy cup can easily fit in it, along with a snack.Reviewers have also said that some people disapprove of the idea of harnessing your child or the appearance of having a kid on a leash. To this I say: those people who make negative comments about this kind of thing have no idea what they're talking about. Keeping your child safe in a mall, airport, parking lot, etc. is vital. Those who frown on safety can keep their judgments to themselves or walk a mile in my shoes - at which point they would be glad they had this harness. For what it's worth, I saw dozens of families at Disney World whose toddlers had harnesses of various types. All the kids seemed happy.The best part about this is that the "leash" can be detached, making it ideal for when my son is able to go to preschool next year. Right now he wears it without the leash when we drop his older sister at preschool, so he can be like her.I highly recommend this to anyone who has a child that is old enough to want to walk but not old enough to trust to stay nearby.
