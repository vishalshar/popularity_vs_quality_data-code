We love our Moby D! It is by far the most secure wrap you will find. If you've seen moms walking around using other wraps or slings, you'll notice one thing in common - they still hold their babies anyway! Be it with their hand under baby's bottom, around their middle, or totally supporting them - their instinct is to not completely trust their sling/wrap. This is not the case with the Moby wraps. I can walk, shop, clean around the house, whatever - and I know that Fidget isn't going to budge.The Moby is also quite comfortable. I've seen a TON of slings that hang across the torso on a strap, and/or hang down to the waist or lower - don't get one of those! They are very bad for your back! (Even if you don't get a Moby, I would never recommend one of those.) The Moby can be worn a number of different ways, which makes it easier to adjust it to you (body type, comfort, etc.) and your growing little one. Ours is a knit cotton fabric, like a t-shirt, but slightly heavier.I will caution you to try out the Moby a couple of times before you try to put baby in it. (We found that an unopened 2liter soda bottle was the perfect weight & shape for practice.) However, it really only took me about 5 minutes to figure it out, and it helps that they include a little manual. They also have a website where you can watch a demonstration. Also, it can get a little warm in the Moby! There is a lot of fabric, which why it's so secure & comfortable, but it also means that you stay quite toasty.The best part about it is that babies LOVE it. If Fidget is having a crabby day, won't go to sleep, etc. I just pop him in there and he is a happy (usually sleeping!) camper. We have used it several times just for the calming effect. It is perfect for those moms who are into "babywearing", as it promotes closeness AND security. My personal opinion is that it would be great for preemie Kangaroo Care - there is enough fabric to remain modest during the skin-to-skin time. Enjoy!
