I was a bit worried when I ordered this since a bunch of reviews said the music sounded demonic but it doesn't.  It has a typical wind up music box of bramhs and sounds great.  The animals are well made, the tags are big but can be cut off, and the rest of the product was great.  It arrived earlier than expected too! If you love classic pooh this is the perfect monile!
