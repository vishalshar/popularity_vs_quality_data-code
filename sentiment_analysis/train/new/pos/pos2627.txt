I bought this monitor 7 years ago when my first child was born. I loved it not only did you hear your child when he/she fussed but you also had the indicator lights so if you could not hear your baby you could visually see if him/her was awake or fussing. I just had my third child and decided to buy a new monitor because i could not find my ac adapters for my Fisher Price monitor( it is true it does suck the life out of batteries but you know what, so does every other peice of equipment if you think about it) and didnt want to buy batteries all the time. I thought that I found the perfect one but I had more buzzing and noise from my new one then I did with my old one. With my new monitor you have to have the reciever so far away from the base or all you hear is buzzing noises even if you switch channels and with my fisher price one I could have the base and reciever back to back on a wall and never have buzzing sounds. The clarity of it is awesome. If I turn it up I can hear my child breathing, that is how awesome the clarity is and that is what I look for when purchasing a monitor and I enjoy the led lights when its too loud that I cant hear my child. I wish I never bought the other monitor because I always find my self returing to my old one(Fisher Price). I find it to be the best monitor and would recommend it to anyone. Try it and if you dont like it you can always return it to the store!
