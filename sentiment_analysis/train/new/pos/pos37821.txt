I own the baby bjorn plastic bib and this one and there are superficial differences . The plastic of the bjorn are stronger and harder.. this one is malleable.  The bjorn clasp is better, bigger and deeper. However when my toddlers were 12-18mo olds they didnt like the hard plastic so its really up to the purchaser to decide.  Overall i got it for a great price so Im happy with it.
