I've tried Johnson's and Lansinoh as well, but these Tommee Tippee are my favorite disposable pads.They come sealed in pairs, which is so handy to just throw a few packs in your purse or diaper bag, they stick just the perfect amount without being difficult to remove or shift, they are very soft, and DANG they hold an insane amount of milk before they feel full or damp. I also love that they don't make much of a crinkly noise. Definitely my favorites, and I keep ordering them!However, I did want to try reusable pads as well, so if you're curious, I found all the diaper cotton reusable pads to be too labor-intensive (you have to wash them after every time they get wet, so you either have to own a bazillion, or you have to do laundry all the time! So I finally found a reusable option that works: LANAcare organic wool pads, specifically the Ekstra version. Wool has antibacterial properties, so you only have to wash the pads about once ever 2-4 weeks or so, so I own three pairs of the reusable pads, and that's plenty! It's very handy! They are expensive, but read the reviews and check out they're website, because if it sounds like a fit for your lifestyle, THEY ARE WELL WORTH IT. I use the wool pads at night and whenever I'm at home, but I prefer to use these Tommee Tippee disposables for when I'm at work during the day, just because the Tommee Tippee have never ever leaked, while the wool pads have occasionally leaked a bit, and I just don't want to risk it when I'm at work!Oh, but also note, if I couldn't use these Tommee Tippee as my disposable choice for some reason, I would definitely use Lansinoh before I used Johnson's again. Johnson's is awkwardly curved with a weird nipple protrusion, and feels wet/full much faster than these Tommee Tippee ones do.
