I have been using my Bumbleride Indie stroller for a little over 2 months now. Not only does my 4 month old love itA few things we love about the Indie:-Light compared to other jogging strollers-Can fit in the back of my Mazda 3 with a large suitcase, foldable dog crate, and other items. This was not the case for other strollers. The Indie folds up well for its size as a jogging stroller-Works great over grass, on the shore of the lake, down a bumpy road, trails-Can have a fixed front wheel for jogging (I have only used it for light jogging)-Very smooth ride, easy to push over different terrain-Adjustable handlebar-Large undercarriage-Appearance-looks great! I get compliments all the time-Easy to pop open to unfold, a little more effort for folding upOverall, we love the Bumbleride Indie. After trying to figure out which stroller we wanted to purchase and trying out a couple of different jogging strollers, this one seemed to work best for the needs of our family, and we are very happy with  our purchase!
