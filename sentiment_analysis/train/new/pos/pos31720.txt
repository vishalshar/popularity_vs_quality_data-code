Arrived fast and just in time for a 2k mile road-trip.  Until now I'd not seen anything that worked well for children. All the pillows that don't fit right & never seem to allow my kids to keep their head 'up'.  Trying to constantly avoid the rubbing of the seat-belt on their face/neck, they always look so uncomfortable.  No more sleeping hunched over & with their neck all turned to the side or some other weird position.  This actually allows kids to use the seat-belt to their advantage. Happy with my purchase ... would definitely recommend this for kids.- Pros -1. Took me 20-seconds to affix to the seat-belt (Velcro)2. Very soft, lots of padding3. seems to stay in place well4. washable- Cons -1. could be even larger, this is about '18 so it can slide out of position
