I wish I had bought these before my daughter gnawed on her crib. It looks like a beaver had a few snacks! My complaints are that the straps should be placed so that they work with cribs with the wide solid center piece on the front and back. Currently there is a center strap on the long pieces that are of no use to me. Two, I wish the tags were placed so that they are on the outside of the crib. Currently they are on the inside so that my daughter can pull them out and I'm afraid she'll rip a piece off and choke on it because she loves to chew on the tags. I prefer not to cut them off because they have the washing instructions but looks like I will have to. And I wish the tabs were sewn on better. One tore off when I was removing the pads, I wasn't exactly gentle but neither is my strong baby when she yanks on things. Overall they are a good buy!
