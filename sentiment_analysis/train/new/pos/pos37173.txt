So far, so good! Purchased this for my almost 2 year old since he loves watching Mickey Mouse on TV. We have several other lovie blankets but thought we'd try something new. I think my son was confused as to where the rest of Mickey's body is but I think he likes it so far.Pros:The blanket is soft and the tags were easy to remove without leaving holes on the itemMickey's ears "crinkle" but that feature may be better selling point for a younger child since it doesn't really attract my sons attention muchMachine washable in case of accidents or just to keep Mickey "fresh"Vibrant red and yellow colors that didn't run in the wash and stain other items in the same cycle.Cons:Cannot be put in dryer like most of my other lovies because the ears will loose the "crinkle"Mickey's nose looks a bit too long, more like Pinocchio
