I have been using this seat for at least 2 years for my daughter. We were recently in an accident involving a semi. The impact was on the side of the car where my she was sitting. This seat kept her head and body amazingly stable. I will be purchasing this seat again since I have to replace her last one (the crash was definitely not minor).
