I bought these to swaddle my newborn boy when he was around 5ish weeks old. Unfortunately when i decided to pull the trigger and order them, he didnt wanna be swaddled anymore lol.I received them with 2 day prime, and at first i will say i thought they were very stiff and "mean" feeling. But honestly, after using it for only a short time, like hours... they soften right up!These muslin blankets are GREAT for all types of things!!! I never thought i would use them for anything else other than swaddle blankets, but wow i use them for everything! I especially LOVE how large they are... i just toss it over the carseat and thenhold the handle, and it performs JUST like those car seat covers. It is a big help becuase his chicco car seat has a terrible visor that barely even covers any sun from his face, and this is great for his poor little face.They also make great nursing covers, and can double as a little rag to wipe the "extra" that comes out of the corners of his mouth lol.Also when i take my 28 month old to the park, its getting cold out now... so i wear the baby in my beco baby carrier and i can use the muslin wrap as a blanket over him inside the baby carrier, and it will keep him toasty warm without overheating him.I have never used an aden + anais, so i cant compare them, but its a muslin wrap, and they get soooo soft they must be similar.I would def. recommend!!! Remember, they get very soft and comfy after a little movement! :)
