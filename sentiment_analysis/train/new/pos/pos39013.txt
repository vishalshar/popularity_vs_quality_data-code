These bottle work great.  They alleviate the gas issue and are the perfect size so the formula doesn't constantly leak out of her mouth!  If you throw them in the dishwasher a lot the numbers so start to wear.  I go between hand washing and the dishwasher.  But overall they are excellent without a gazillion pieces to wash.  This is my third child and I have owned every bottle and this by far is my favorite.  Better than some super expensive ones I have owned!
