I had a fisher price soother for my first baby, the rain-forest one.  We all loved it!  it is safer than a mobile and easy for him to turn on himself.  When he was only 4 months old I would hear him wake up at night, turn on his soother, and put himself back to sleep!  Eventually after 4 years of use, that one broke, so I replaced it with this Lion King soother for my second baby.  It's ok, it has all of the benefits of the rain-forest one.  It says "features music from the movie!" but, just to be clear, it features ONE song from the movie, "Can you feel the love tonight."  I think that is a little misleading.  Why don't they just say it plays that song?  After owning both soothers I also think this Lion King soother is a little more stimulating than the rainforest one because it has 3 characters that move instead of two and a fish with bubbles.  The music is not quite as relaxing and is a little faster as well.  This probably isn't a concern for most but my first baby was VERY sensitive to over-stimulation, we didn't even use the motion on his soother until he was 10 months old.  With my second this isn't much of a concern.  So, it's good because it's a soother and they're really great products, but I definitely wouldn't pay more for this one over a generic animal one.
