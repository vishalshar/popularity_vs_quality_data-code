Alright, I'll admit that the thing looks like a clutch purse, but the pattern and color is neutral enough that dads like me won't mind carrying the thing around. The packaging says "Make any bag a diaper bag!," so the idea that you can put this in a messenger bag and have a diaper bag, but we've just been using it on its own. We're really happy with the quality of this changing station; the zippers are bulky and strong, and the stitching is tight. It's a great complement to our Skip Hop Via Messenger Diaper Bag (Platinum), with which we are also very happy.This item is not strictly necessary because you probably have a diaper bag with a changing pad, but we've found this useful for quick trips out with the baby. For example, we took this with us to the baby's first trip to the pediatrician, and it contained all that we would need -- a few diapers and wipes. If we were going somewhere for a longer period of time with the stroller, then of course we'd just take the full diaper bag. But for those short trips, the Studio Pronto is just right.A couple of other key points:- It's free of BPA, PVC, and phthalates, noting it "meets or exceeds applicable safety standards."- The changing pad zips off and can be used independently.- The integrated pillow is a bit thin, but comfortable enough and doesn't add bulk to the item.The Studio Pronto is made in China.
