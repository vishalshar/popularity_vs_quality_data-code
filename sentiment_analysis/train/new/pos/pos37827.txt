The product is quite simple so there's not much to report -- the bag is large enough, folds compactly into an attached pocket when not carrying a stroller and has a nice drawstring mechanism. I bought this after trying the 'Gatecheck' version of a similar product, which was cheaply made and only lasted 4 flights. I have no complaints after multiple uses.
