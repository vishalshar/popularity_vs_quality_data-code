Firstly, the pros: beautifully crafted, well thought out design; easy to put together and fabric comes off easy to wash; the plush fabric is nice and soft; moves nice and smooth; sturdyThe main cons - all of which are rather minor but they are the reason for not giving it 5/5 and most have been noted by others:somewhat noisy while operating but my son doesn't seem to mind; possibility that another small child might get fingers caught in moving base - but infant in the capsule is completely safe; wide base makes it a bit difficult to move around the house - it is not heavy but a bit cumbersome.
