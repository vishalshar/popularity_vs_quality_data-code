I like this brush for several reasons.  The large sponge on the end and its shape allow easy cleaning for the bottom of baby bottles.  The brushes and the second sponge get the sides and the underneath rim of the bottle.  The fully attached nipple brush does a good job of cleaning the nipples and the fact it is attached means it doesn't get lost or accidentally thrown away.I now use these brushes to clean my son's sippy cups and the nipple brush is able to get inside the spout to clean it.Yes, the plastic bridge between the two ends can be broken by applying too much force when cleaning the bottles (to get leftover milk that has set clean).  I have found that one brush will last me 3 or 4 months before I need to replace it.  I make sure to rise the milk out after my son is done even if I do not get around to actually washing the bottle at that time.  If I forget and the milk sits, I fill the bottle with hot water and let it soak for a few minutes while I am cleaning up something else, by then it is easy to clean with this brush.
