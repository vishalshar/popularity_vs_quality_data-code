This comfortable, sleek design is perfect for a growing infant. The cover fits snug around the sides and keeps my son warm when it's cold or too cool. It's easy to clean spit up, milk, and overloaded diaper explosions.The only downside was the recall on the security button (Amazon notified us), but the manufacturer is taking care of that and it's easy to replace!I also purchases the dual stroller that goes great with this and if you have two kids, like I do, it's a must also!
