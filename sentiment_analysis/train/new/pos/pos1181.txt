I have been using this great carrier for the past 3.5 months. It has been great, easy to use, and definitely served it's purpose, BUT just in the past couple of weeks my curiously 3.5 month old has decided he doesn't really want to face me when there is so much going on in this big world! And that's where this carrier becomes a problem! This carrier is not designed to let your baby face out. Apparently, some "expert" doctor on their website says that's it's unhealthy for baby to face out because they could get overstimulated so they particularly design their carriers to avoid letting the baby face out. Well expert or no expert I know when my baby wants to look out and learn, and when he decides that's enough. So I now have a new baby bjorn comfort carrier which is like the perfect marriage of the comfortablilty of Ergobaby with the ease of use of the original bjorn. My curious little guy can now face out and enjoy his surroundings, and when he has had enough I can easily turn him around and let him face his mommy again!
