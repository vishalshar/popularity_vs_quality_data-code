I have learned how important it is to have sharp nail clippers when going after baby nails. I've tried using some of the less expensive nail clippers at from the drug store and it is painful for my toddler (age 2.5) when the dull clippers tug at her nails. FWIW, my daughter has sensory issues and nail trimming is extra challenging in our house. I ordered a pair of these nail clippers and was impressed by how comfortable they were for me to hold. They were sharp enough to cut the nails on the first clip. Partway through her second hand with these clippers, she relaxed enough to let me finish the job.Note that these do not have a magnifying glass, a light, or anything else. I've not appreciated those bells and whistles on any of my nail clippers so these was a great purchase for me.
