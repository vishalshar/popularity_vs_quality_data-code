I wanted something separate for Tummy time because any other fabric that I used collected a lot of cat hair. This mat is perfect and slippery just like I wanted. The only problem with the slippery is the fact that the little pillow that I want to put under her slides around a lot and has to be readjusted. Overall I am very happy and this will definitely increase our tummy time.
