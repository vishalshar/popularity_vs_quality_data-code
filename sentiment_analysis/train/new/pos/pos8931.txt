One of the best purchases of my pregnancy, hands down, if not the best. I've been using it from the 4th month, now in my ninth, have used it mostly for side-lying support. It's the perfect angle for the belly support. At some point during the pregnancy I did add another softer pillow on top but I still preferred it on top of the wedge rather than standalone -- since the angle of the wedge really gives you that support and reduced the strain on my back. Also, late in the pregnancy I sometimes have been using it under my hip while lying on my back, which has been very comfortable. As others said, using it -- along with other (regular!) pillows -- is much more comfortable and flexible than the full body pillow... which my husband bought for me (the Leachco snoogle) and which we then returned after a couple of weeks because it just wasn't doing the trick.One con though -- the description of the product says the slipcover is cotton. The product cover I received was in fact not cotton and so I am using an extra pillowcase on top. It wasn't a major issue but it was kind of annoying since I particularly picked the version that came with the cover. At the time there was another cheaper version that did not mention the cover, I should've just gotten that one!
