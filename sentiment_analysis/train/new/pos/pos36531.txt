Got this rattle my my daughter was first able to hold on to things. It's perfect for an almost newborn.  The black and white is graphic which is the only thing they can see in the beginning and the colors are bright which is the second thing their eyes can see.Best of all, it is supper light so whenever she dropped it (often on her own head) she didn't get hurt. We had a more substantial rattle and when she was 3 months old she did drop it on her forehead.  Didn't get permanently hurt but there was quite a bit of crying and the spot stayed red for a bit.  After that I bought more of this brand of rattle in different colors.
