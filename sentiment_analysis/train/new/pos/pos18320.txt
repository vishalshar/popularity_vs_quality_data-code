After researching several different brands of cribs and going to several different local stores, I chose this crib for my baby girl. It looks very expensive  and is a great size for my baby. My husband who is not all that handy, had no problems putting it together. We also have moved several times and it is holding up very well. Skip the pricey boutiques and get this crib.We love it!
