I purchased the cocalo daniella bedding set and decided to get this piece too. It arrived quickly and is very cute. The light plate is very small, so u will need to touch up that part of the wall with paint. The night light is very small however it does light the room nicely for a baby. Overall it's a nice piece but overpriced. I give it 4 stars because if the price and the size.
