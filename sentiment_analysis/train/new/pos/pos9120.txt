I went through several umbrella strollers before finding my match, the Joovy. I tried several cheaper ones and what this one provides that they others did not: 1) great sunshade. The others had detachable shades that were tough to maneuver and didn't provide comparable coverage. 2) single handed, near flat recline. The seat lies back with a simple button and a pull of a cord. 3) a carrier strap. One of the main reasons for having an umbrella stroller is for travel and the strap is necessary for hauling through airports and such. 4) it's so lightweight! There are a few slightly lighter ones out there, but they are more expensive and really, this is light enough for me to carry down the (many) stairs off our front porch in one hand with ease. My only complaints are that the carriage is pretty small for holding things. However, I think they are generally small on all umbrella strollers. It was as big, if not bigger, as the other three brands I tried first. Also, the height isn't adjustable, so if you're super tall, then it would probably be a deal breaker. I am not, so I can't mark it down any stars at all. Very happy!
