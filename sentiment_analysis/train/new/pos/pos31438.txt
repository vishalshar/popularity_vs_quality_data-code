I purchased these after the foam ones got destroyed only a few uses in. These are MUCH more durable than the foam version. They slide easily onto any door hinge regardless of how the door is hung (wide hinge gap or narrow) so you don't have to wrestle with it at all. They're inconspicuous enough that people who come over worry about the kids hurting themselves with the doors until I point them out, which is nice too. The only thing that kept me from giving five full stars is that when one kid pushes hard on the door to try and get it to close, when they let go the door rebounds with a little too much energy and sometimes knocks them. Ultimately that's obviously the kid's fault and not the door guard, but the consistency of the material of the guard makes it bounce back more than some other door guards. Also I have twins so usually one of them is trying to squash the other with the door so it does seem a bit like justice to have the door knock into them a little..
