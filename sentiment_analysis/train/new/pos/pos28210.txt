My coffee table is 154 inches.  My friends handed down their safety first elasticized table bumper but it was the small (goes up to 140 inches, I think) and couldn't stretch to fit.  Then I looked into the safety first bumper in medium but everyone says unless your table is MUCH bigger it doesn't fit snugly and just sags.  So I came across the Thudguard bumper and problem solved!  It is elasticized but is not a fixed length...you wrap it tightly around your table until you get to the end and then velcro fasten the end around that area of the bumper.  Although my 13 month old can pull the guard away from the table about an inch, she has not been able to get it off of the table at all and the fit feels snug and secure.  If you have a table that is between 140-170 inches around, then this is probably the best bet for you.  Oh it's ugly, but what functional table bumper isn't?
