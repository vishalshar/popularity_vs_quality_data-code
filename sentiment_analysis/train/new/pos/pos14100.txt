I love this baby bather. It's big, has lot of space for baby shampoo, clothes, etc and the fact that u can dress them on the changer that's attached.  the Only thing that wasn't made rIght is the way you hold the baby. If you are rightie and like to hold the baby on your left arm and wash with your right, then it's a problem because it's made to hold the baby on your right arm and wash with left. Which is a problem for me. Other than that it's a great product.
