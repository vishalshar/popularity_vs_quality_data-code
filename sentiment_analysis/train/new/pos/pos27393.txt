I love this stroller so far.  In the lightweight stroller department I have had two Maclaren's (volo & Quest), a Quinny Zapp and a Baby Jogger City Mini. The Cybex Onyx is so far my favorite stroller of all of these.  It has a wonderful sunshade (better then the city mini which I didn't think was possible),  a great recline, it handles very well on smoother surfaces, it is very maneuverable, I personally love the umbrella fold with a carry strap and I find the folding mechanism very easy.  The storage is limited as with any umbrella style stroller but that is my only complaint.  I think it is an awesome stroller, I'm very pleased with it. I'm always on the lookout for the perfect stroller (I have owned over 10 different ones) and this one comes pretty close.
