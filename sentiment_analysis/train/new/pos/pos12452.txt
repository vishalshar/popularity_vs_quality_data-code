PRO's-* Easy set up.* Works great on our IPhone 5S's.* Has amazing sound sensor, camera is upstairs and will pick up noises we make in the kitchen downstairs. YOU CAN HEAR THE BABY BREATHING EASILY.* Easy to transport and use in different spot if needed, battery lasts 2 hours so it never really loses connection.* You can talk to or play pranks on your spouse through the system* The night vision works great - HINT (If you turn your phone sideways, it gives you extended wide view)* You dont have to listen to the sound all the time, it will send you an alert (you set the time parameters. Very nice feature) I always listen though.* You can still use your phone for other things and it will send you an alert as long as you set up the "Allow notifications" and the "Banner" bar. This is nice when you have to take a call, you won't miss your babies activity.CON's-* Can easily, by accident, turn on the music. The face of the box has hard to see buttons that you will touch if not careful and if it's not at a prior lower level....you have made lots of noise.* As above, the mobile app has this feature. You have to minimize it or select the different option at top to prevent this. It is EASILY fixed, this is just a heads up.* It does not pivot, so if you clamp to the crib it needs to be centered. We are ok with it.The charger cord sticks straight out, ours is now bent. I bought a Micro SB Right angle #AB-U44 to resolve any further damage.
