It's not easy to find large burp cloths, and these do the trick. They're a little thick and slightly difficult to open one--handed while trying to handle a baby in the other, but compared to thinner and smaller burp cloths, these are definitely large and offer much more protection, especially if your baby spits up a lot like mine did when he was little. We've had these for over 6 months and they last great through a lot of washes.
