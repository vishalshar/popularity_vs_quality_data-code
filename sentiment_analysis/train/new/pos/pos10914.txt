I was very disappointed when I bought the now widely-available Gerber Birdseye 10 Count Flatfold Cloth Diapers, White, they aren't the burpy diapers we always had.  It seemed like Gerber had made a business decision to make extra-thin open-weave cheap "birdseye" things and sell them instead of the classic white cloth diapers that are so perfect.I tried a pack of these Kushies 6 Pack Washable Flat Diapers, White which everyone raves about.  In my opinion, the Kushies are too thick, soft, and linty - very flannel-like.  Feels more like a towel than a burpy diaper.  I really wanted the old Gerbers that we always used in our family.These said "gauze", which sounds like something that's full of holes, so I didn't get my hopes up when I took a chance and bought a pack of them.  But I was very pleasantly surprised when they arrived.  These "gauze" cloth diapers are the sturdy, soft, perfect ones you remember!  They're thick but not too thick, absorbent enough to protect your shirt from spit-up, but not overly plush.  Definitely not see-through.  And we know from experience that they last forever and only get better in the wash.These are tough to find in stores now, since Gerber is obviously pushing the cheaper "birdseye" weave.  Let's all vote with our dollars and only buy these "gauze" cloth diapers.  Hopefully we can get Gerber to stop making that "birdseye" garbage and just go back to only making these, and hopefully they'll just call these "cloth diapers" so it's not confusing.
