I was skeptical at first, but after reading other reviews I figured for the price, why not give it a try. And I'm glad I did! My 3 year old son is now sleeping in his toddler bed again after weeks of waking up in the middle of the night and only feeling comfort on the couch. It seems to add a sense of comfort and warmth, that now I have trouble waking him up in the morning! Machine washable (with some slight shrinkage) and a great fit overall for his crib/toddler mattress. It's the perfect next step for the kid who is not ready for a twin bed, but slowly outgrowing his toddler bed.
