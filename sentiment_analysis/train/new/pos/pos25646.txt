I have an old version of this product that has been well used! It works just fine! It is comfortable, suction is great, I get about seven ounces a pumping (I do both breasts) and I can pump/clean up in less than twenty minutes. I have read all of the negative reviews and I have no problem with this pump other than the bottles leak if you use them with the lids that come with them and my cord does have a short in it because it is about three plus years old. I am also going to try out the premium double soon to see how that works and I will leave a review!
