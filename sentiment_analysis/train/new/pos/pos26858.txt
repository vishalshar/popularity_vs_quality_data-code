Firstly, let me just say that I am very glad that I ignored the "most helpful" review saying that it would come apart. I completely feared this because my baby seems to eat everything he can get his hands on, and he's only about 5 months! Well, I received the product and I couldn't be happier with the concept. It is a soft silicone material, comparable to other teething toys on the market, and my baby took to it instantly. The bonus: it is shaped like a pacifier, so babies can suck on it and it fits comfortably in their mouths. I can't say enough good things about this product.Now about it coming apart, the green and red and green and blue teether's are two parts brought together, however the pink and the light blue teethers are one peice (i.e. there is no way it will come apart!!). I completely recommend the light blue, considering that is the one I bought for my baby boy. It is a very nice color, just as shown in the picture, and it is only about fifty cents more than the original "raZ-berry teether".So, if you really want the contrast in colors, you can take the risk with one of the dual-color raz-berry teethers; Many people have been more than happy with the those and never had a problem with it coming apart. But personally, I would recommend the one-color ones; They are just as cute and you won't have to worry about the possibility that it will come apart. Enjoy!
