These pink vinyl rubber duckies are adorable.  I don't know what in the world I am going to do with them but they're Breast Cancer Awareness and they're rubber duckies so I had to have them!  They're slightly smaller than I expected but they're a good value and I will find something cute to do with them.  Until then they're going to be hiding around the house peaking out at everyone!I'm a huge BCA supporter.  I lost my aunt to complications from BC and my mom and I are always sporting pink especially October.  I wear my BCA stuff all year round though.
