My sweet baby girl was a baldy until she was over 2. We wanted to adorn her light blonde peach fuzz with some hats and bows. I searched for something I could find in a bundle for a great value. These were so sturdy that even stretching repeatedly the elastic stayed strong. The fit was perfect-not too tight or too loose. The variety of colors allowed us to have something for every outfit.
