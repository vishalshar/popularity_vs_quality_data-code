I got this for dog use. I have rottweilers commonly though there is the occasional rescue of varying types and breeds.  My grown dogs pretty much respect fences and gates so don't usually go slamming against them or try to jump on or climb them- generally they don't NEED gates period to behave themselves.Puppies are a different matter. Puppies, especially large breed puppies can and sometimes will chew a wood or flimsy plastic gate in minutes- heck they'll chew WALLS. That is NOT going to happen with this metal gate. I am very pleased with the sturdy metal construction. I got it out, took it to the door, adjusted to the frame, set the little pin in the nearest hole then used the screw device to put the tension on it...DONE! And it is nice and snug- it would take strength and work to dislodge it with just hitting it or pulling on it- my grown dogs could probably fling themselves against it and only scooch the pads along a little in the door frame but not totally dislodge it (jumping it would be easier for them). I do see how the bars could be a bit far apart for a very small toy breed newly weaned puppy. If that is the case temporarily line it with something....fabric, mesh wire, whatever- until the pup gets too big to fit through. It need not be rocket science.The only thing I have the slightest concern about is the pads on the sides. The screws that hold the pads are snug but the pads themselves still rotate and wiggle slightly and the screw isn't all that deeply set in the middle. That could work in our favor as there is less wear on the pad where the screw is. I hear tell you can get pads at the hardware store that work as replacements and spacers if need be...so even that is easy if I need to do something about that.This looks to be a gate that will last me a good, long time, through many, many dogs. I'm very pleased and it seems to be very worth the price. If something breaks or that changes I'll edit later.
