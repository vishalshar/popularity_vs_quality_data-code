We are so pleased with this product!  It comes ready to use as the co-sleeper, so you just have to unpack it and pull (or push) all of the rails until everthing is sturdy (and it WILL BE sturdy!).  Read the directions and there will be no problems.I have read other reviews and some people have stated that you need to use a "ridiulous amount of effort" to lock the top rails into place.  I do not see where this was the case.  Everything locked and unlocked easily, my husband and I both had no trouble changing the mini co-sleeper to the bassinet, and back again.  We even folded it all the way down and put it in the carry case (the way it arrives) and we still had no trouble setting it back up.The mini co-sleeper comes with the fitted sheet (it's smart to order an extra sheet...regular crib sheets won't fit and these have velcro on the back so there's no chance of it popping off during the night).  You can also purchase the extender legs if it is not at the right height for your bed (ours was just right).All in all, I'd say it's worth the price and is very well made.  A big help for c-section & breastfeeding moms!Check the various colors that this item comes in...I was sure to register for the Tan Dot print...it's neutral enough for a boy or girl and it doesn't look wild in our bedroom.
