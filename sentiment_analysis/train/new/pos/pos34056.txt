Initially we bought a Maclaren Quest Sport for our little one since we wanted something low key, easy to fold, and lightweight (and practically everyone we know owns one).  The more we used it, the more we became aware of its limitations.  In researching other choices, our friend showed us her Baby Jogger City Mini and we loved it!Pros:- Easy fold: this is by far the easiest stroller to fold!- Full recline and fully adjustable: it doesn't have preset recline settings, you basically have the freedom to adjust it as you'd like from most upright to full recline- Handling: smooth and easy.  Though it's not as smooth as a full jogging stroller, this mini stroller does great.- Weight: For the features it offers, it's actually surprisingly light.  In between an umbrella stroller and a full-size stroller.- Compact: once folded, it takes little space in the trunk- Full sunshade: we overlooked this with the first stroller.  The three-setting sunshade + peeping windows are great.- Easy to adjust straps: it's a breeze. No need to push straps through tiny holes to be able to change the levels.- Colors: great color combinations, it was hard to choose just one!Cons:- Accessories: expensive- Basket: a little hard to reachOverall, we're very happy with our City Mini.  We still use our Maclaren, mostly when we travel through air, but our first choice is the City Mini.
