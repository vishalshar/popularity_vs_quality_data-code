Our little girl was born six weeks early so is quite literally a little girl. As I couldn't find the preemie size online and she will grow we bought two of the newborn ones. They are very easy to use and as the Velcro dictates the size you wrap her in it works very well. I was a bit concerned at the chunky zip which is close to her face but you can wrap her and adjust it so she sleeps soundly. Very easy to use even for a new Dad changing her bleary eyed at 3am!
