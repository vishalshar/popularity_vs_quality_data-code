So... Last min I decided not to bring a rolling carry on- too much with toddler and stroller... WELL, it turns out the evenflow tribute car seat ($50 on Amazon- only weights 9 lbs! Way lighter than our normal seat so great for travel!) fits in our umbrella stroller and this strap holds it snugly in by the latch straps!!!! SO convienent for traveling with a toddler! I rolled my guy off the plane sleeping like he was in an infant seat (you obviously have to wake them up to install seat in car... But still)
