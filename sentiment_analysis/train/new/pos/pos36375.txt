I just had my 4th child, so I've tried a lot of different baby bathing options.  I really love this bather, it works great for me and my new daughter (now 6 weeks old).Here's how I use it:  I have an approximately 21" long X 16" wide X 5 1/2" deep sink in my laundry room which is what I've used to bathe the last 2 babies in.  I had my husband install a sprayer faucet in the laundry room and for me this bather product is great for laying the baby in inside the sink while I give her a nice warm shower with the sprayer.  She doesn't complain about being cold, she quite loves the shower in fact.  I think it would work fine with a regular faucet as well though, even if you didn't have a sprayer.Since it is mesh, it dries quickly and it stores nicely under the laundry room sink.  I honestly can't think of one negative for me in regards to this product.  I like it much better than any other newborn/young baby bather I've ever used especially the plastic tubs with the sponge foam inserts.
