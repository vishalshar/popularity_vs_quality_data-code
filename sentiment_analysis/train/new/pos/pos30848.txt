These are amazing! They are my absolute favorite sippy cups! I now have three for each of my children. One for water, one for milk, and one for their green juice. My daughter is STILL using the first one I ordered when she was 9 months old, and she will be 3 at the end of March! I love them because they are virtually indestructible! I'm sure at some point I will have one break, but that hasn't happened yet despite the 100’s of times they have been dropped on our travertine floors and even outside. I also love that they are metal and keep drinks cold all day! This is a big plus on hot summer days and when traveling with milk. There are a few things which I think should be mentioned. These DO NOT have a stopper, so for smaller infants the flow will probably be too fast. My daughter started using a regular straw first, so these were not a problem for her. Also, because they do not have a stopper, they will pour out if they are turned upside down with the lid open. I have personally used these cups every single day for the past two years and I have NEVER had an issue with mold or leaks. In all honesty, if you are having problems with your cup leaking or growing mold it’s probably user error. I've never had one actually leak with the lid correctly on and closed. I have found that if the spout portion is still wet, when I go to close the lid of the cup, the spout moves and creates a gap where the air hole is which, yes will lead to leaks, but this is not the cup leaking…it’s improper installation. In addition, I have never ever had one grow mold. When cleaning, the actual metal cup should NOT be put in the dishwasher, this could damage the insulated double metal wall. However, the spout and straw can be put in the dishwasher, but they need to be taken apart for cleaning and drying.
