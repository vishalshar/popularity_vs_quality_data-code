My daughter looks adorable in this after a shower, the color and fabric has held up to washing and use for the last 3 months and still looks as good as the day we got it. The material is good quality, but is not exactly soft - it does a good job though dealing with a wet baby after a shower - IYou will be hard pressed to find a better robe for a young girl at this price.
