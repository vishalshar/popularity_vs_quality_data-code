Many books and websites recommend that the ideal room temperature for babies to minimize risk of SIDS is on the cool side, i.e. around 67/68 F, but at the same time, blankets in the crib are a big no-no. I found this issue a bit confounding when my son was a few months old, especially when the weather got colder and the temperature at night in his room would sometimes drop to close to 65F - how exactly are you supposed to keep the kid comfortable at that temperature without a blanket ? Bundle him up in three layers of clothing? As a result, I became a big fan of sleep sacks/wearable blankets (warm, comfy, and no suffocation hazard, yay) and have bought a variety of designs, materials and brands as my son got older.I bought the Gunapod online a few months ago when my son outgrew the last model. I chose it primarily (1) because it was one of the relatively few brands that came in larger sizes, (2) because I liked the colors (including some designs that are not too obviously gendered), (3) because I liked the zipper design. In retrospect, this was a really good purchase; although this is not the cheapest brand out there, I'm particularly happy about the zipper choices/combinations, and in my opinion this completely justifies the price. The shoulder snaps and side/front zippers make it easier to put on and take off than any of the other models I've had (also easier for diaper changes). If I unzip the bottom, my son can walk around in it for a while before he goes to bed, which he quite likes, and even when he grows a bit too tall for this particular size, he can probably wear it to bed for a while longer with the bottom unzipped. In addition, the item is still in really good shape after regular washes.
