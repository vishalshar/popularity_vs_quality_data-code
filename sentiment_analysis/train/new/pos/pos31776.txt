I bought this as a little "add-on" toy, never expecting it would become her favorite toy for awhile, still clutched in her little hand after falling asleep. She loves the crunchy sounds, the smallness of it (I think) and especially those ribbon legs, clamping down on them with her gums and pulling furiously when she was teething. Very cute well-made little turtle, Fred is.
