I bought two sets of these (since I pump 8 times a day) -- they are much easier than the multipiece shields. In my experience, they are easier to clean if you have a good brush and you can see the milk stream better. Whatever you use, even if you are groggy at 3 am, rinse these out with hot water. What makes for difficult cleaning is allowing milk to dry on these. The stuff is like glue!
