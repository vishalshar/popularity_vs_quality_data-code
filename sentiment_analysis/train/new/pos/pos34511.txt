Our newborn (a month old) would get really upset if he wasn't tightly swaddled at night. Just allowing him to sleep in thick PJs without some kind of blanket would not work. I don't really know why the SleepSack is any different than just PJs, but it seems he really likes to be in it and I feel that it's a lot safer than just a swaddling blanket, especially now that he is older and can start to break open the swaddle. It provides us with the comfort of a safe sleep, and it seems to keep him calm at night. All in all a great purchase. My only minor issue is that the 0-3 mo small size we have seems a bit big for him at 7lbs. Maybe the swaddle SleepSack would be better.
