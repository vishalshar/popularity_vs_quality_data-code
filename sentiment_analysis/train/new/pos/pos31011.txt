My daughter loved her walker so much.  We had it for 3 months now and there wasn't a day that she was not in it.  She has now mastered the art of actually walking forward, as oppose to backwards, sideways and just standing still.  Set up was a breeze and the collapsible feature is nice, but I never use it since she in it so often.  All the other reviews that complain that the product is unsafe and folds up are wrong they installed it incorrectly.  I had the same problem until I read the instructions clearly.  The product is safe when set up correctly, enough said.  Other reviews should spend more time reading the instructions than posting videos that give the product a bad name.  Best Walker for the money.
