I know a lot people have had issues with the Safety 1st Outlet Plugs, and only recently has our son (almost 2yrs old) cottoned on to the fact, that he can remove them.  While I do understand many concerns others have with the Safety 1st Outlet Plugs, they did served us well for almost 2 years, but honestly, if I was to do this all again, I would purchase these units.  But seeing the price of the Safety 1st Outlet Plugs and the amount you get, I personally cannot argue against them either, especially for the first year.For us though, as soon as we spotted him pulling one of the Safety 1st plug covers out, we started to search (Amazon) for a replacement product. The price and concept took my interest so I figured we'd try these.  When they arrived (three packs) I promptly replaced the Safety 1st Outlet Plugs, in locations where he's predominantly active.Do they work?  Well as I was putting them in, he was trying to pull them out, with no luck, so yes, they work.  They work for two reasons, the first and mostly likely reason is the dome shape, they (children) cannot grasp the edges to forcibly remove them.  Secondly, the center mechanism, rotates in and out, while in, it pushes the sides of the plugs pins out, requiring even more force to remove them from the plug.  When the mechanism rotates outwards, this creates a semi functional pulling pin, to pull them out.  You DO need a coin or flat edge to rotate the pin.  You can, with some force, pull them out, they are not perfect, but when I say you can, I mean adults and with some arguable force.  I would personally recommend though, like anything plastic, test each one, to ensure that they are fastened.All that said, I think these will do nicely, I gave them 4 Stars, because they are not perfect, but by far the best of this class for the price.
