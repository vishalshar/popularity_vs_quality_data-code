Our daughter is 7 mo but we've used this chair since 4 mo.  I originally liked the design but love the nano much more for functionality.  It is super easy to clean (daily wipe down and the cover is removable and I just hose it off in the shower).My daughter has no problem slouching and loves playing in her chair while I'm cooking dinner.Tray is great and easy to remove.  We did completely remove the harness straps and the buckle pad after a month as they do collect food and are unecessary if baby can sit up well.I love the way it folds. I can fold/unfold with one hand while holding baby and it props against the wall or in the kitchen nicely.Lastly, it is an extremely sturdy and stable/safe chair!  I HIGHLY recommend it, especially for those that like modern design and don't have a lot of space!
