In the last three years, I have bought three of these - for home, Grandma's house, and the diaper bag. We're now using them on our second child and we refer to it as the snot-sucker. Kid's nose whistling? Boogers you see but can't get? No problem. Spray some saline up there, wait 15 seconds or so for things to soften up, and suck it out. The instructions say to use a tissue as a filter, I find that a half a tissue works better. I also cut the tube from the mouthpiece to the nose nozzle shorter, as it was so long it would twist and kink up, usually while I was wrestling a toddler. I also bought a set of OXO Tot brushes to clean it with (one looks like a long mascara wand). Everything comes apart for washing and air drying. I love it.
