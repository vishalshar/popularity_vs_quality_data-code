My little boy loves this seat.  So does everyone else who visits.  What a great invention.  No more having the extra potty seat insert hanging around.  The only draw back is for little boys...you better really keep it tucked down if they sit to pee.  It comes out straight through onto the floor.  Good time to get those boys standing!!  And cleaning it is a pain with all the grooves. But over-all an excellent product.  I have had it almost a year and it has taken a lot of wear and tear from a 3/4 yr old. I use clorox wipes to keep it clean on a daily basis. General toilet bowl cleaners weekly.  My husband did cuss it when installing it....but he survived.  Still holding up great.....would definitely recommend it to a friend!!  I have 9 nephews, all under the age of 8, who visit often...It has gotten the use/abuse.  Definitely would buy another if something should happen to this one.
