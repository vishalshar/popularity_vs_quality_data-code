Bought this to help our 2-month old son fall asleep, and he loves it. There are three stages of the light show so you can change it as your child grows. The Penguin can be set to play music or nature sounds, and shuts off automatically.  The projected images are blurry unless you can place the soother within about 3 feet of the ceiling, and I wish it ran for a longer period because sometimes the baby isn't asleep before it shuts off. Bottom line? This works great for our kid, hope the same goes for you!
