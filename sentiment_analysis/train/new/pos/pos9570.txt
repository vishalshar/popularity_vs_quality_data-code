I ordered this travel tray for my 18 mth old when we took her on her first real vacation( 9 hr car ride). This item shipped quickly from the seller (2 days) and completely met out expectations. It's made of rigid foam so its light weight and easy to pack without being flimsy. It was perfect for coloring and lunch on the go. She's totally in love with Elmo so that helped as well and the pockets were great for hiding the binky for quick access.
