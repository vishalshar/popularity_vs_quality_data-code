this bath toy scoop works great (once you have it installed) I had some trouble getting the adhesive pads to stick to my tile shower, and I really didn't want to have to drill holes. The first time I tried, the whole thing just fell off the wall (in the middle of the night and scared me half to death). The second time, I had to place the adhesive mounting bracket on the tile and every time I used the rest room for the next 2 days, I'd lean my whole weight against the bracket to get it to adhere. It has been up for about a month now without incident. We don't use this tub for showers, so I can't say how much that would impact the adhesive strip's strength. I is cue though and does hold quite a few toys, though some of the smallest ones can fall through the holes.
