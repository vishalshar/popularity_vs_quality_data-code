This is my daughter's favorite toy. After the first one died we promptly ordered a replacement! Only problem is that it smells terrible like it was too close to some stinky incense. Hoping the smell will fade soon otherwise I'll be surface washing hoping to get rid of the smell. Songs are not annoying, my husband and I find ourselves humming them throughout the day.
