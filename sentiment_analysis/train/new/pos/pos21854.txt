This is my niece's favorite toy.  The little owl has been perfect for her grip, and she loves watching them move when driving.  She puts it in her mouth a lot, but mostly the fuzzy head and less the teether, so I wouldn't know about how well that works (plus she's not teething).  Plus I think my sister likes that she can stow it away when she wants.  Not sure why she's so fascinated with this one, but I would definitely recommend it regardless.
