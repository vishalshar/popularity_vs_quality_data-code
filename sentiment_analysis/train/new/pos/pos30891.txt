I have spent the last 2 month looking for a roomy but not too big diaper bag!(my daughter is now 2 months old)Its very hard to find one the right size. I hate those big bulky ones..but the tiny ones are no help either!This one is perfect.I do wish it had little side compartments (on most diaper bags for bottles) Thats where I usually keep my cell and keys.A simple diaper organizer insert helped with that.Other than that. I love it!
