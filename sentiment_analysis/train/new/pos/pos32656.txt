For us this has been a great potty.  My daughter loves using it (even if half the time its a game to her), she likes being a big girl and having her own flusher.  Far better than the first years elmo potty.  The opening on this potty is wider but not so big they'll fall in.  The 1st years potty opening is so small that unless i repositioned her on the potty she'd pee on the floor.  She's not a big girl either, so if you've got a bigger kid stay away from the other potty.  I love the storage in the tank for wipes and extra pull-ups.  I like that she can do it all herself, lift the lid, sit on the potty, put down the lid and use her lil flusher just like a big kid.
