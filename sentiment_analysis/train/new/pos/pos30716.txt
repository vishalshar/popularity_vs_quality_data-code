We bought this changing table because it matched our crib/dresser combo and was priced correctly.  It took me about 1 hour to assemble as I am 34 weeks pregnant and had to be down on the floor to do it.  A non pregnant person might have been faster at assembly.  I like the shelves and was able to accessorize with cute baskets underneath. The dark color looks great with the pinks and blues I have in the nursery. The pad that comes with it is less than desirable in my opinion. It's flat, doesn't provide much padding, and doesn't have the safety lips.  But I had already been giving a changing pad and cover and it fits great in the space provided.UPDATE:  It's been three months since we started using our changing table. It has held up well. My only negative finding is with each end of the changing table where the pad meets the wood.  Unfortunately at the ends of each side there is an opening the entire depth of the changing pad.  We place a few items at the end such as diaper creme or the Snuza, etc.  Everything slides out this opening if the baby kicks or if I accidentally knock something over.  I would have liked to see this part closed.  Other than that I still love the look and function of the table. I decided not to attach the wheels and the table stands great.  We did not see the need since we would not be moving it around. This might be necessary in a daycare or other type of setting.
