My little guy had some trouble with breastfeeding at first, so we had to supplement him with formula and pumped milk from a bottle.  We started with Playtex Ventaire bottles with slow flow nipples, but I found that if he started to nod off, the Playtex nipple would continue to drip into his mouth, which caused him to wake himself up with a mouthful of milk/formula, and it would occasionally cause him to choke.I did some research and decided to try the Nuk Orthodontic Nipple because I read that its construction made a baby work a little harder to get the contents out of the bottle.  Because the hole in the nipple is aimed at the roof of the baby's mouth instead of the back of the throat, it definitely takes more effort to use these nipples over the traditional style.  I really like that these do not constantly drip; he does have to work to get the contents of the bottle flowing.These nipples also have a vent hole to help reduce the amount of air the baby swallows.  From what I can tell, the vent works quite well.  My baby burps and spits up a lot anyway, as many babies do, but since we switched to these nipples, he seems to spit up less, which is great.The only problem I have had with these nipples has been that of the 10 I have bought, three of them did not flow at all (the hole did not go all the way through the silicone).  They're not too expensive, so I don't mind buying extras, but I feel that they should work.  I've contacted Nuk but have not yet heard back.  If all of the nipples had worked perfectly, I would definitely give a 5 star rating.
