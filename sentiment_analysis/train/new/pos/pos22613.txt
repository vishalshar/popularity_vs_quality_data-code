This pram is the BOMB! Fantastic double pram, or single pram with awesome shopping space! No need for an uncomfortable trolley ride for you (single) bub, cause heaps of shopping fits in the basket when only one child on board.Pushes great, smooth and can be maneuvered with just one hand at times.Great space between parent and pram allows for really long legs/big stride, no kicking the pram as you go!Folds piece of cake!Very light to handle.Getting heaps of compliments and stares out and about, Im in Australia, and had this pram shipped over, total cost $420 AUD, which is SO CHEAP compared to our bulky side-by-side prams you get here for more than $600 AUD. So VERY pleased with the price!Have a 2yr old (big boy) and am 7 months preg with another big boy.. this pram is easy for me to push, fold, carry has heaps of seat room for my 2yr old, so i know both boys will be using pram for quite some time. :)Couldn't be happier.One fault..  :(And we cant fix/alter it either.. on the seat mechanism where the pram adjusts up and down (recline/sit up) it locks into place, but is sloppy :(So essentially when you have it in your desired position, your child can rock it back and forth a good 1-2cm, making us worry the plastic parts will break..So fingers crossed it wont, and this pram will last us at least 4 years!
