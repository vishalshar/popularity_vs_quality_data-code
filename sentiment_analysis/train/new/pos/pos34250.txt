I purchased this unit 3 and a half years ago and didn't realize the size of it.  Its much bigger than I expected and that's the best part about it.  My wife and I and our two kids can fit inside there and take shelter from the sun for lunch, or whatever, as we usually take it to the beach, or set it up in the backyard when we are outside playing.  When around other kids, it is a kid magnet as kids love going in and out.  Kind of tough at the beach when trying to keep sand out, but it shakes out so easily that it is not a big deal.I highly recommend this over an umbrella or anything similar that I've seen.  Its taken some abuse over nearly 4 years and is giving me a hard time to open and close recently.  Its still quite serviceable and I love having it.
