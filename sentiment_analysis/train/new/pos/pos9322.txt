I've used these cloths as cloth baby wipes for over a year now and they're still in great shape.  True to another reviewer, I've had some fraying around the edges, but not enough to make a difference or need to trash them by any means.  I've put them through how many washes over 1+ years while using cloth diapers?  Still in heavy use.Tip: I keep these in a plastic container w/ lid that was originally for disposable wipes.  Once we used the disposable wipes, we had a container to keep our cloth wipe solution in (a bit of water + a few drips of tea tree oil and lavendar) and then just throw a dry cloth wipe in there when needed.  I wish I would have bought 2 packs because after more than a year, it's inevitable a few get lost in travel, etc.
