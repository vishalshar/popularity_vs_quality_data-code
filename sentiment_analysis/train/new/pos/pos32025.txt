I've been using this warmer 6-8 times a day for several months. This warmer is far superior to some of the cheaper bottle warmers. I also have the Munchkin rapid warmer. That one often overheats the milk, which means you're losing nutrients, but it also super-heats the outside of the bottle, so you have to wait for it to cool down before you can give it to the baby. The Kiinde has never overheated the milk for me, and the outside of the bottle stays room temperature. You can also leave the bottle sitting in the warmer after it has been heated without worrying about the milk or the bottle getting overheated.It is also fantastic for thawing/warming frozen breastmilk. I wish I could figure out how to make it work with the little plastic food storage containers I'm now using since our baby has started solids.The drawback is that it takes a couple extra minutes for the milk to warm, but protecting the quality of breastmilk is worth the wait!
