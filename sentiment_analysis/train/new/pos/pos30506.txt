Bedding set exceeded expectations!Imagine my surprise when the top sheet had a fitted end - HOW GENIUS - why aren't all top sheets like this?I was worried transitioning my daughter from the crib to the toddler bed considering she never kept her blankets on in the crib (and the transition was taking place in December). Not sure if it was just the toddler bed or this great bedding, but with the transition she had no problem sleeping with a top sheet and blankets through the night.Also, the pattern is very cute and the fleece blanket is very soft! Great set.
