Great product for a small family. We regularly use it to get the kids to bed in our room and easily drop the sides to move the kids into their room. It's not the best method for child rearing but it works for us to stop the kids from falling on the floor. Easy to get up and down and doesn't make a sound if you lube the hinges.
