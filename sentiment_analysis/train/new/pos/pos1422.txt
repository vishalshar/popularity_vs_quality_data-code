I had to stop nursing unexpectedly for medical reasons and my baby took to this bottle right away. I highly recommend it for the natural feeling nipple and bottle. Even the actual bottle is squeezable medical grade silicone. It's a natural reflex for baby to squeeze as she or he is drinking which is closer to breastfeeding as well.
