Well packaged.  Construction took 1.5 hours due to poor construction instructions.  However the final table is solid, sturdy and a perfect height.  I am 5ft 9 and my husband is just under 6ft and we had concerns that other tables were a bit low and might strain our backs. With a newborn you can't under estimate the amount of time you will be spending standing at the table changing diapers.  The rails surrounding the changing pad give me an extra level if comfort that the baby will stay out and the table comes with an additional strap for security.The only downsides are the thinner particle board used for the lower shelves, but as long as you aren't planning to store  anything super heavy like 20+ lb per shelf you should be fine.  We have diapers, wipes and a wipe-warmer, board books, blankets/washcloths and a bin of toys packed on and they work just fine.Also while the sliding drawer is nice it does not slide open very far making it difficult to access small items that may have shifted to the back.Overall I would definitely buy again for the price and recommend to others.
