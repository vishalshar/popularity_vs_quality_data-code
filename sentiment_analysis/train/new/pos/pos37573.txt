We had the Boogin Head clips for a while and I love the designs and they never could be pulled off by our baby.  But, the metal clips rust easily (I was washing them daily because of day care) and I started to notice that as my baby got older, she was intrigued by the metal clip and would suck on it.  So, while these plastic clip paci holders don't hold quite as strong (if you pull hard enough they do come off), I feel much better knowing that she won't be putting rusty metal in her mouth if she grabs for the clip.  So far, my 6 month old hasn't pulled the clip off her clothing yet either and so it does the job.
