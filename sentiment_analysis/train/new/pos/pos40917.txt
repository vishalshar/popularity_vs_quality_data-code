My 18-month-old has HATED HATED HATED baths since the very beginning, screaming/screeching her way through the FEW that I gave her (she really seemed to be scared)! So I've been doing sink-side sponge baths, much to my frustration, wondering when I'd ever be able to get her to take a bath! Now, I think a big part of her fear was just that the baby bathtub I purchased (Primo Eurotub - see my review!) was HUGE!!! 774 people rated it on Amazon and gave it 4.5 stars, but she hated it and so did I! It didn't matter that I used the right end of it (it has moldings on the bottom, and you use one end for infants, to support their back, and the other for toddlers, who can sit up) AND kept my hands on her the whole time - NOTHING helped!!!! (Buy the Munchkin inflatable ducky tub - it's about $10 cheaper and a lot smaller, so it makes the baby feel more secure! Plus it's cute, and I think it's a good distraction! It even quacks!) ANYWAY, she LOVES crayons, and when I saw this, I bought it immediately, and as soon as she saw it, she couldn't wait to get her hands on it! It even helped her get a little closer to that stupid Primo tub - she wouldn't climb into it, but she would at least get close enough to reach in and get the crayons out of it, when it was filled with water! BEST BEST BEST tub toy I could've gotten her! Will definitely be buying more crayons! Oh, and combined with the Munchkin ducky tub, after only TWO baths, now I have to try to get her OUT of the tub!!!!!
