Seems crazy and I was a huge skeptic but I was so desperate I figured it wouldn't hurt to try an amber necklace for my son. Did seem to work and if nothing else is super cute. Still a skeptic I tried it myself when I had a horrible headache but didn't want to take a pain relieving med. my headache cleared up fairly quickly after putting it on and usually once I get a migraine like that only Advil can help.
