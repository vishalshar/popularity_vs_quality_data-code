I started putting my then 4 months old here so he can be feel part of the family as we ate dinners or I did stuff in the kitchen.Now using it to feed solids to 6 months old.Good things about the chair:+ really does fold pretty flat in a matter of seconds+ the tray can be attached to the chair when it is stored flat, so no extra space required+ inner tray is removable, seamless - very easy to rinse off.+ the fabric is soft and wipes easily. (did not have to do any serious washing yet)+ the chair reclines, great for younger infants and/or when giving a bottle+ The tray slides in 3 position - closer or further from the baby.+ the seat itself slides up and down (easily!), so the height of the chair can be adjusted depending on what you need.I don't find any huge negatives, but some things are so-so:-the chair has pretty big footprint, but I suppose it has to for stability- when folding the chair, the tray has to be removed first and then reattached for storage - slightly annoying.- I do wish the tray would be a swing-out tray. I can't say it's a negative, I knew what I was getting! Just realizing that swing out tray will be easier with an older child.- the belts are a little awkward to manipulate, but they do the job.overall - happy with this chair!
