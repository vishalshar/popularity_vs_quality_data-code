Having had a Safety 1st booster seat previously, this was my first choice.  Easy to clean, easy to use, and comfortable for the kiddos.  Can be used with tray or without and they include a plug for the tray hole so if you're not using it the kids can't put food in the hole.  The belts attach securely to the chair and the kid.  My 20 pounder couldn't jar it loose or tip it over.  Surfaces are smooth and wipe off easily and tray is easy to remove and clean.  I do it 3-5 times a day.  I have two and the trays are easily interchangeable.  The size is good for toddlers and when they get older, they will fit easily at the table, too.
