I have to say that this is probably the best item we purchased for our new baby.  It keeps me in bed for those late night feedings so I don't have to go downstairs to warm a bottle, and then I can get right back to sleep.  However, the cooler is quite cheaply made.  I accidentally dropped the lid from about 3 feet up and it cracked wide open.  A little duct tape did the trick, but it could have been made more sturdy.  Still very glad I bought this though
