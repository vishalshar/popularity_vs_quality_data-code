Best sippy cup on the market and I have tried them ALL. Yea, as other reviewers have noted, the milk will drip out if the kiddo tips it over. Yea with a new cup sometimes it will draw milk up if it's warm and seep out without any help from anyone. That is annoying. However, I bought another one for Grandma's house and another one as back up for me, so with the negatives, I STILL love this cup. I can clean it easily. The lid screws on easily. The handles are easy for my kid to hold. If my kid is leaning back, the weighted straw works well with easy suction through the straw. Overall, I would recommend and buy more as needed.
