The Badger Wood High Chair is like a piece of furniture.  I have it in my dinning room and blends great with my furniture.  My grandson (who I bought it for) at 2 1/2 feels it is a big boy chair.  It is well made, sturdy and very nice looking.  The front tray is removable so you can put the chair right up to the table when the child is ready. I would recommend this high chair for a secondary high chair.  The only flaw I see, is that the straps dangle down the back of the chair.  In a regular high chair the straps are secured to the seat back. On the badger, while safe, the straps are not secured to the back of the chair leaving more moving room for the child in the seat.
