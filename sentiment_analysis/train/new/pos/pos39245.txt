About 60 years ago, yo-yo's were a big deal, with travelling Duncan demonstrators who amazed us kids with tricks. Those yo-yo's had wooden axles and were fairly easy to make "catch" on the string. This latter day yo-yo is fun and does all the tricks, but it has a metal axle that is very smooth, and I've had difficulty getting it to wind back up from scratch if the string is fully extended. That's the only reason I did not give it five stars. (Probably operator error)
