This was a cute baby doll Moses basket with pretty bedding. However, it was much smaller in size than I expected. The bottom portion is very small, where the doll would lay. I returned it as many of my daughter's baby dolls were too big for it. It is a good size, however,for smaller baby dolls and for younger little girls to carry, around the ages of 3-5.
