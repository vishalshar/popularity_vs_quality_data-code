I traveled alone with baby for the first time at the end of August and this gadget was a life saver! I purchased an airplane seat for my baby so I needed something to make traveling easier with an 18 month old and her heavy chicco convertible car seat. It was a breeze to push, easier than a stroller and the brakes were easily accessible. Her car seat was safe and secure in the travelmate deluxe and I even strapped her in the car seat to push around the airport. TSA had no issues hand checking the car seat on the travelmate deluxe and didn't ask me to remove the car seat from it. Every parent who saw me pushing my daughter around in it stopped and commented about how easily I was traveling with baby. It was even easy on the airplane. Since my baby had her own seat, I locked the wheels on the travelmate deluxe and placed it under the seat in front of hers. I showed the flight attendants that it was secure and locked under the seat and they had no issues with me putting it there.
