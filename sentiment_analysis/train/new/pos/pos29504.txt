I have used changing pads for about 6years now and am about to have another baby, so this will be used for another few years at least. I love this changer! It is plenty big to change a bigger toddler, slightly padded (so any surface is comfy for baby), and the material is soft and still easy to clean. I love how it folds up for on the go & the neutral color plus pretty stitching are perfect for both me and hubby. I have 2 in diapers and 4 that need wipes regularly. I can store at least 3 size 4 or 5 diapers as well as up to 6 size 2's and still have a bit of room for a small wipes case... I just carry an attatched soft wipes case (bought seperately) on the holder thing. Because between 4 munchkins, ni matter how long or short the outing, you will ALWAYS need wipes. Yes it is bulky.. It would never fit in my bulky purse.. It would fit in my diape bag but leave little room to spare. The fact is, the things i need to carry take up space. Period. This is a terrificly efficient way of doing it. No more searching around for essentials, no more oops I forgot to refill on diapes. And this isn't a worthless thin and skinny piece of useless junk that fits into everything but does nothing well. I am very VERY careful about spending and even so, this was money well spent. GOOD JOB Brica!!! Thank you for an awesome product and for valuing my time and money!!
