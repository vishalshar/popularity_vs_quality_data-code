i'm the type to research new things for like forever before buying it...I bought two of these before buying more to try them out, also bought grovia and g diapers...from the different styles of cloth diapers I chose the all-in-ones cuz I'm really busy ...I don't have time to mess with inserts, clipping on anything...I hate to do laundryfrom the all-in-ones I looked at , I chose this style and brand for these reasons:-the outer covering is made of good material-it doesn't have velcro which snags other things in the wash, yes i sometimes do wash these with other clothes on sterile options on my washing machine, no lint threads to pull from velcro to keep looking like new-the one size should be sufficient for baby until toddlerhood-bulkier than grovia around crotch area, but the grovia padding doesn't dry that fast and the snaps on Grovia, the side/top snaps are awkward to snap on because they are on the insides, flaps in instead of out (hip area, which is good for the look but awkward when trying to do things fast-the flaps dry quickly but very absorbent, my infant (7 week old ) is dry , doesn't wake up because she feels wet-nothing to snap on, however i do like that the grovia has the second flap snap on (so that you can make less bulky, gives that option), but grovia padding are very narrow, whereas padding here is wider and actually saves the actual diaper most of the time, -with amazon 6 for $110 deal , cheaper than grovia-can survive hot/sterile wash (instructions are for cold wash and hot wash but I just do one long hot wash with regular green eco high efficiency costco brand detergent), whereas the other brands rec warm wash, which makes me nervous about putting it through very hot hot wash-very soft, although grovia is softer on the inside, but definitely softer than disposable diapers; my daughter has less redness in private area but because more bulky than disposable diapers she gets these indentation around her legs which she got with disposable diapers but it's wider with these cloth diapers.  less irritating than disposable diapers for sure because it's softer material.-dries quickly, dries with rest of swaddle blankets and baby clothes, whereas the grovia ones take longer, the grovia took two cyles in the dryer but still a little damp around the corners where the cloth bunchesI use the kushies biodegradable/flushable liners which are wide, with this cloth diaper ...and great combo, because the liners filter the solids, even the yellow pee color and I'm just left with wet diaper,  no need to wash the diaper in the toilet (gross) or in the shower (gross, and don't have time to disinfect everything). When my daughter did have a blowout and the poo got on the sides of the diaper, all I had to do was take a few wipes and wiped the sides down, even with the yellow stain, I just placed that thing on sterile wash after a day of collecting enough diapers to put in wash and everything washed out.I'm a busy mom, working 80+ hours a week sometimes and I told my husband that I care about the earth but I don't have the time or luxury to do cloth diapers, but after trying this it's as easy as disposables (or else I wouldn't do it) .  (sorry for the writing, i just don't have time to correct grammatical errors but really wanted to write a review to encourage other busy parents to do cloth diapers, the new technology makes this an option now).cons and suggestion to company who makes these: make the main diaper part narrower on the crotch area without narrowing the padding inside; also it might be good to have the option of having one of the padding snap on if less is needed for younger kids, but this might just make it cumbersome to use, because it definitely saves time not having to snap anything on /attach anything elsegrovia has a more V shape (which holds babys shape more deeply) .  these bumgenius freetime is more like a shallower rectangular shape which holds baby in a more shallow wider way, which is good for catching things during blowouts, not much leakage but the fit is better on the grovia because is deeper. i don't know if this makes sense, but something for the people who design this to change for the next version...leakage with pee did occur with grovia because of the more V shape, but some medium between current crotch width and the grovia oneDefinitely happy with these new tech in cloth diaper to make it easier for parents to go green.  I've been using these about two weeks, so I will update at later time to see how material holds up...6 MONTHS LATER6 months later after so many sanitary washes the diapers still look like new and still absorbent. And I even wash them twice in the sanitary cycle every 2.5 days. I do have the washer that senses the weight of the load so I don't waste so much water, which is something of a concern in California because we have a drought. I do notice a type of malodorous scent to them once my daughter gets them wet, hence that's why I wash them twice in the sanitary cycle. My mom decided to wash them in bleach once and they still held their colors and didn't break down. The scent only is noticeable when the diaper is wet with pee, I'm tempted to cut one open to see the inner lining and how it looks like...I might sacrifice one to just know what it looks like inside after 6 months of use just to make sure there's not mold growing in there. I will update later...but still enjoying these and now clean up is even easier withe the kushie biodegradable flushable liners because her bowel movements are more solid, so if everything is caught in the liner (which most of the time it is) I roll them off and no poop clean up from the diaper...oh one more thing, I don't line dry them, I just put them on regular cycle drying and they dry pretty quickly...don't have time for line drying but they haven't shrunk or shredded...also, my daughter is now 6 months, ..the only time was when we went on a trip and decided to use disposable ones. They are so absorbent that we sometimes leave them on for 12 hours at night when my husband and I are too lazy to change her because we've worked 80hr weeks and the last thing we want to do is freaking change the diaper at freaking 2am. it keeps her dry...I've never had to change her because she was crying with being uncomfortable.
