I love this stroller!  I have the single that I used with my oldest and, when we found out we were having another baby I agonized over whether or not to get the Graco Duo Glider, because I could click the infant carrier in (I also have the single Graco travel system).  I have bought so many strollers that I was bound and determined to only buy ONE double stroller.  And I am very happy with the choice I made.  It costs a bit more than some, but is less than the Peg Perego and Maclaren ones.... and I think, a better stroller.The manufacturer suggests that this stroller is for children four months and up, but I've put my baby in it since she was a few weeks old.  Since it reclines and has fabric on the sides, she seems to be held in securely and comfortably.It is light and folds compactly.  It took several uses for the folding mechanism to "warm up" and become easy to use.  My single Swift was like this, too.  But now it's great.I have a small trunk/back area (I drive a Jeep Liberty).  I keep this stroller, a travel potty, and the giant single Graco in the back..... and they all fit with a few bags of groceries.The features I enjoy most are the side by side seats, reclining seats, that the stroller fits through all doorways, the handles are fabulously comfortable, and the stroller maneuvers very smoothly.  There are only two drawbacks (which are minor) to the stroller.  The lock, once it's folded, pops off.  Also, the hoods seem to detach from the bar they click onto when I close the stroller.  I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or it's a quirk with the stroller.  It is very simple to re-attach the hoods, though.I love this stroller and know I won't need to go through several double strollers like I did with my single one.
