My son loves CARS. This nap mat is washed one a week and I have had it for a month. It washes and drys nicely. The ONLY reason I won't give this 5 stars is because sometimes the foam in the middle of the mat is a little bit damp even after I have it in the dryer so I need to air dry it for a couple hours. Not a big deal. I love that it folds up nicely and has a place to put his name. Overall, nice product.
