I really love this chair. I have 16- month old twins, and this is the second chair I have bought. The first table chair is a Phil & Ted Me Too, and the Inglesina is absolutely superior in ever way.  Comparing the two I have found:-- The Phil&Ted is not nearly as comfortable for the child. There is virtually no padding, and the nylon seat is held up by a frame of hard metal bars. So the child has only a hard bar to lean against and a hard metal bar between their chest and the table.  The Inglesina has a well-padded (removable!) seat and and high, padded back for the child to lean against. The sides are padded as well, and there is no hard bar in front, only the clip for the safety straps.-- The Phil & Ted's safety straps are useless. They are an odd design that doesn't allow you to securely strap the child in, and they tend to fall down the child shoulders, rendering them unable to raise their arms. By contrast, the Inglesina has a nice thick, easy to use strap and click buckle that holds the child securely but comfortably.-- Most astonishingly, the Phil&Ted cannot be disassembled so there is no way to clean it properly. Who on earth makes a toddler high chair that can't be laundered?? I've tried spot cleaning it, but because of the gathers in the fabric, its almost impossible to clean it well. I hate it; its a bacteria laden mess at this point. By contrast, the Inglesina is easy..you just click off the arms and remove the seat, which is machine-washable. You don't even have to unclamp the arms from the table. Wonderful!I just ordered another Inglesina and as soon as I get it, the Phil& Ted is going in the trash. It wasn't inexpensive either, so I am really disgusted.Get the Inglesina, you won't regret it!
