I was worried when I first received these that they were simply too small for my toddler. He is a BIG eater and I didn't feel the plates and dividers were large enough to hold sufficient food for him. I found after the first time I used them that they held enough food (and I could always refill for seconds if needed), and they were sturdy and stayed in place well on the table with the rubber grips on the bottom to prevent sliding. My son is in a mildly picky phase and separating his food helps get him to eat more. I wasn't bothered by the plates not being microwave-safe as we don't reheat in plastic, anyway. So leftovers are just transferred to the plates after being reheated. I also purchased the matching bowls and found those to be larger in size and held a very fair portion. Overall, for the price and construction, I am very pleased with these plates.
