I wanted to love this pillow more, but couldn't get the angle right.  I feel like this needed a little more height in order to support my growing belly a littl better.  Even like 15 degrees more would have helped so much.  I love how soft and cushy it is, and it helped more in later pregnancy, but in the beginning stages where I was not feeling comfortable, I really wanted something more. I ended up stacking this on top of a regular pillow to get a little bit of height, which helped, but of course it was easy to slip off.
