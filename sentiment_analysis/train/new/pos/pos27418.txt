This is very useful piece of equipment. I am using it for my lil one and this thing has already taken off loads of mucus out of thatlittle nose. My baby gets really comfortable after the mucus is out of her nose. When I did not had this thing my baby nose use to get scratches because of continuous usage of wipes or soft tissue. This thing has reduced her nose touching to minimal and She is happy baby even when her nose is running. I will recommend this aspirator to anyone without any doubt.Now some kids might not like to put this humming thing which sucks mucus off there nose. This thing may irritate them. But I will recommend you to give it a try. If your baby don't mind this then you will appreciate this forever. My baby is so comfortable with this now that She knows what posture she has to make when this thing comes to her nose.Try it !
