I have two grandchildren ages 5 and 4. I had booster seats for them but I didn't like the way the seat belt went around their necks. So I decided to purchase a car seat that would hold the strap in place. This was easy to assemble and it held the seat belt lower so that the fear of them being choked by it is now resolved. They love the drink holder and cannot wait to go into Grammy's car. It does leave little room in between the back seats, but I purchased it for safety so it works.
