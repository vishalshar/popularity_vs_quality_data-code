I'm very happy with this rotating motor (the little hook at the bottom turns).  I bought a mobile that is a butterfly that flaps its wings.  However, my baby soon let us know that she liked it when it was rotating.  So, we'd hand rotate the thing.  If we got tired and stopped, our little taskmaster would yell and scream.  I looked at little motors on electrical sites, and I was not looking forward to the thought of rigging up a system (even thought I'm an electrical engineer), because I'm pretty exhausted these days.  I'm so happy to have found this Hleeduo product.  It is almost perfect.  The hook rotation is about 2 times per minute.  That is very slow at the hook, but if your mobile has any significant radius (ours is over a foot wide) the outside turns pretty fast.Our mobile already had music, so I opened the case (three screws) and clipped both wires to the speaker.  The motor still works and is very quiet.I'd give 5 stars if the motor had a timer to auto shut off after 15 and/or 30 minutes.  Right now, you have to remember to shut it off after your baby falls asleep.  But there doesn't appear to be a big battery drain, so this isn't a huge issue.
