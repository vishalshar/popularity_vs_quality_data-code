LOVE how this smells - not sure its any better than other baby washes I've used but I love the smell of this it reminds me of lilly of the valley or maybe peonies, just a lovely floral fragrance, not overwhelming, but I love that its not baby power smell like most baby products.  It is highly fragranced which won't be for everyone, or every kid's skin (I have one of my three kids that has eczema and sensitive skin and I don't use this on her, not because it has caused any problems, but with the fragrance I just don't want to take a chance) but for kids that don't have sensitive skin its great and smells wonderful!
