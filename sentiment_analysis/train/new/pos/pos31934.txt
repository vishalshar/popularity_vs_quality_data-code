I Initially Hesitated To Buy This Power Strip Cover Based On Some Reviews, But This Cover Actually Works Very Well If You Take The Time To Latch It Properly. Very Adjustable And Very Secure. It Does Not Prevent A Child From Unplugging A Cord, But It Does Prevent All Access To The Outlets And It Keeps The End Of The Cord From Coming Out Of The Cover, If You Have A Child Who Likes To Chew On Cord Ends.
