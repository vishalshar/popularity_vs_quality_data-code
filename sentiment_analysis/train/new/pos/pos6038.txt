I wish there was an option to plug it in instead of only using battery operated. I really love the idea behind this clock, but ended up getting the regular one, rather than the travel one, because it had a few more options. Also, you can only set one time for the sheep to wake up, compared to the regular clock, you can set two daytime switches, so we use the regular clock for nap and night. Good if you don't mind using on battery power, and only one wake up time. Otherwise, get the regular clock, not the travel one.
