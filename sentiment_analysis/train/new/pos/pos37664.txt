These are good quality disposable pads and they are large enough to cover the whole area underneath my baby (he is about 2 months old). They're nicer and thicker than I expected, and they don't stick to the baby's bottom like some other brands do. You can use them a couple of times if they don't get dirty. I keep a couple in my diaper bag and reuse them until they get something on them. I'll be purchasing more!
