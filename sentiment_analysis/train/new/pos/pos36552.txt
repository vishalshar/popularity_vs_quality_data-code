I don't know why my granddaughter's bottles disappear. I swear she must throw them away when no one's looking. I've lost track of how often I've had to replace both the 4 oz and 8 oz plastic bottles--something than never happened when my grandson was small (or my children for that matter.) This tether works perfectly. I unscrew the top of the bottle, place the ring around the bottle's neck (I use the small ring) then tighten the top and nipple and secure the velcro closure around the side of the stroller (or grocery cart). Haven't lost another bottle.
