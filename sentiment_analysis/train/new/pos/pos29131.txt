My 10 week old loves this! I spent a lot of time researching options for my baby. He has acid reflux and wasn't happy laying on his back. He was fussy and only liked being held. I went back and forth thinking I should get a co-sleeper instead but wasn't sure I wanted to fork up 100+ for something he may not like. He won't even stay in the other 5+ items we got from dream glider to bassinet. He will stay in the rock and play but the doctor said it was giving him a flat spot. I researched other lounger chairs by other brands that were slightly cheap but settled on this one. I do not regret it. My baby loved it from the minute we put him in it. It's amazing. We've been able to have him on the couch with us in the lounger, in our bed and just about everywhere else. You can't leave the baby alone in it and have to be watching him. We get out baby to sleep then put him in it and he stays still resting. he can probably roll out of it when he gets bigger because he's strong already but even if we only get another month or two out of it, it will still be worth it. The material is comfy and easy to take off and wash. It has a carry handle that makes it great to transport. The dip where the seat is works great and is perfect to put my son in an upright position to help his acid reflux. He's 13 lbs and 23".
