First off - our mat doesn't have the same letters or colors that the mat shown in the picture has. Whatever - I read the previous reviews and decided that didn't really matter much to me.What is totally awesome about this is that it grows with your baby. Our child loves the mat, and has since become to mobile for the padded underneath part. So we keep the activity mat on top of a different padded mat that we bought at Sam's. It's much larger for him to roll around on.The hanging animals on the activity mat actually do stuff - the bird plays music, one animal rattles, and the other has rings. You can also hang other things from that mat as well, as there are additional hooks. The mirror, for our child, was neither here nor there.Also - the tag says not to machine wash. I'm of the opinion that if I can't wash it then I don't want it. So I washed everything - even the hanging parts (even the bird that plays music). It all came out fine. Wash at your own risk, though!I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.
