I love this product! I like that it has a case that's easily washable and holds up well. I just pack it up and put it in the diaper bag. We've had previous issues where the forks are not sharp enough, and our daugher has a hard time feeding herself because of that, but these are just right. Not sharp enough where we worry about her hurting herself, but sharp enough to pierce things, like vegetables, pasta, etc. The spoon is slightly wider than her other spoons, but she took to it well and has no problems.
