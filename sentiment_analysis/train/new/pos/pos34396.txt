We have three of these pillows for our girls and they are an absolute must have when it comes time for bed.  Every night I tuck them in with their favorite blanket and these pillows.  I don't know how we managed before them...two of my girls have medical issues and seizures and when they are really sick or having terrible seizure activity they make a "nest" using these snoogle pillows, blankets and their stuffed animals.  They are comfortable and durable...unfortunately, they have been cleaned multiple times from vomit (seizures cause them to vomit).  I would recommend that if you have to clean it, try to hand clean it.  If you have to wash it, like we have numerous times, wash on a gentle cold cycle with nothing else with it and then lay it out flat (reshape if you have too) to dry.  Even with the numerous washings our snoogles are in great shape but the fabric has faded from the extra washing.  The fabric itself has held up really well, there are no tears, no pulled fabric and they have been used camping, at hotels, on the floor, on their beds, taken to friends houses...they are awesome!  (My oldest daughter liked the smaller ones so much, she asked for an adult size for herself and has it at college now).
