Needed two seats specifically to use for vacation, for flying and use in rental cars.  Bought two of these.  Our regular car seats would not have fit in the airplane seats and would have been WAY too heavy to lug through the airports.  We shopped extensively and found very, very few seats that would have even fit in the airplane seats.  These were perfect.  Light weight, economical, and we found very easy to use.  Installed easily and quickly in a rental Chevy HHR and a rental Jeep Liberty (two "small" SUV's).  They also stacked together neatly for handling through airport (couple of bungee straps held together).
