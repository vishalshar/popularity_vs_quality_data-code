If you are looking for an easy to use cloth diaper system these work perfectly with an insert/prefold of your choice.My husband and I think many cloth diaper shells/covers are ridiculously covered in a thousand snaps and even thought they may fit newborn through toddler, they look absurd. These are very simple, with only two modest snaps on each side and adjustable elastic to accommodate a growing baby. It is a very clever design, deceptively simple and great for no nonsense diapering.We do EC/infant potty traning so we needed a simple diaper solution that could come off and go back on quickly and easily and these are it.The reason for the missing fifth star is the price and the front part of the diaper doesn't have adjustable elastic, only the back, so it looks weird on tiny newborns. Not a huge deal but it'd be nice.
