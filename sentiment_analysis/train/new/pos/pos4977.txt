Our 4 month old has been sleeping in his swing up until now, and we got this mobile for the crib transition. The first time in his crib he slept six hours straight! The mobile is great. I looked at all of  He critical reviews on this one, and so far haven't had any of those issues. The music is loud enough, but not scratchy. It lasts for 30 minutes, at least so far with fresh batteries. The light isn't too bright, the images are projected on the uneven canopy, but they are still clear. The ceiling projection is really clear as well. I put a photo and video, ended up choosing this one over the fisher price, I like the bright animals/designs better. Only complaint is I wish it had a remote!
