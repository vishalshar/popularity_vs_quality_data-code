This was one of two covers I bought for my first cloth diapering attempt.  The other cover I bought was a Thirsties. I prefer this one 10 fold. For starters I read the other review about the leg gusset and I completely disagree.  The leg gusset in the Thirsties only serves to annoy me.  They have done nothing to prevent leakage and they are a bad fit around my sons chubby legs.  These fit my son perfectly and fit the cloth prefold perfectly in place.  The Thirsties on the other hand seem that you have to shove the prefold in to fit on all sides.  I can change out the prefold in these very quickly whereas I have to fumble to get him changed with the Thirsties. I've found that the waist band of the Thirsties does not sit flush with the waist once the prefold is in.The Bummis however,  does.I would recommend these to anyone using prefolds.
