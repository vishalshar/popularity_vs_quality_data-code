Absolutely gorgeous and 10 times better than A &A blankets. They are super soft and still so after washing. Can't beat the price either!ETA: I am addicted to these and just purchased my third set. I bought originally for my newborn but love them so much I am buying some for my 2 year old who gets very hot. These are the perfect little airy blanket for her. She loves them!
