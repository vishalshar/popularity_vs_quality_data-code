I bought this for a friend's impending baby along with a couple other items from the green/brown/elephant/girl grouping (who knew there was such a thing until my friend let me know about it). I bought without checking reviews, and only afterwards worried because the other blanket had less than a 4 star average. Made me paranoid enough to open up this package and check when it arrived. I'll have some explaining to do about that part when I give them to her!In any case, I was quite pleased with this blanket (and all the other items too). I can pretty much say the same thing about this blanket as the other Carter's Green Elephant Boa Blanket, Green/Choc, 30 X 40"---No construction problems at all. The design elements were thoughtfully done/well applied and will not be a source of rubbing or irritation to the baby (once she finally gets here!). The edging was also well done, so no worries.The material is a very soft, very lightweight plush-type. Light but capable of holding warmth but will work with layers depending on how much chill you are trying to keep out (enough by itself in a cooler indoors area, but if it's truly cold out then layers will be wanted).This is an adorable design on a well-crafted blanket. Highly recommended!JTG
