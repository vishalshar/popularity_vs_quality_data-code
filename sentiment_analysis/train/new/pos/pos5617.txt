We have been searching for something like this for awhile now, as my son grew taller, his legs have no place to 'rest' on. Instead of stepping on the car seats itself (and gets dirty), now he has this footrest with plenty of space. Instruction was clear/user friendly and it was very simple to assemble/install, my son really like it! The height of the footrest can also be adjusted so it can still be used when he keeps growing.
