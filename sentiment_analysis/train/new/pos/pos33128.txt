These organizers are a GREAT idea, and work well.  My only gripe is:  Why are they just limited to babies and kids???  I'm a great-grandmother, and also, admittedly, a clothes horse.  I've been looking for organizers like these to help separate all the different items in my closet, and yes, some in different sizes.The plastic hangers work just fine, but the labels in the pack are all pre-marked: 3 months, 6 months, 2T, etc.  Of the 36 labels in the package, 30 of them are pre-marked with baby sizes!!  Arrgh!Why not just leave all the labels blank, and let the user write whatever they want on them??  That way, a mother could put whatever she wants on her baby's clothes, and a great-grandmother like me can put what she wants.Also, I don't want just sizes on them; I want to put "slacks,"  "skirts," "blouses," whatever.Bottom Line:  A great idea, but quit pushing them to just babies and kids.  Leave the labels blank.  You'd be expanding your marketing base tremendously.Oh, yes.  One other point....I am making my own labels out of white mailing labels, cut down to the right size, to solve my problem with these labels.  They work just as well.
