I was skeptical at first, since there are no other reviews. I did a quick Google search about bamboo inserts to see what other CDers had to say.I use mostly microfiber inserts with hemp doublers. I use covers, not pockets (sorry, my CD jargon isn't up to par!).DS often leaks out of his nappies.So far with these, we haven't had any leaks! They are super-absorbant, and seem very very soft to the touch so I can imagine they are comfy to wear.I also like how they are dark so I don't have to worry about the ick factor of discoloration.They cannot be boiled though, so I have to do some research into how to strip them when the time comes...
