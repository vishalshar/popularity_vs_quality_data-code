we just got this for our McClaren Twin Triumph and love it. I've tried it at all times of day to see if any sun would hit them and at it's lowest point (the sun), only their feet were out in it. This has helped us to be able to have much more enjoyable and cool days out and about.  Plus, it really does fold down with the stroller, so you don't have to remove it each time. It's very flexible and would work on any stroller.
