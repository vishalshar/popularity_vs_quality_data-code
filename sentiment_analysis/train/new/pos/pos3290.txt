These blankets are great.  They aren't any bigger, or bulkier than regular receiving blankets, but are warmer and have a bit of a stretch to them so you can get a snug swaddle with them.They are great for diaper bags when you need something a little warmer for those winter days or chilly family members house, but don't want to take up a lot of room with a bulky warm blanket.
