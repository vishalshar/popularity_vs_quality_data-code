The reason I did not give this product a 5/5:As previously stated by other reviews, the drawers will fall through without support. This however is easily fixed.This is how:1) Go to Home Depot and purchase two 1/8th inch thick 2 ft by 4 ft tempered hardboard sheets, and wood glue. We used Titebond wood glue.2) (Cut at home with table saw or have cut in store): 3 pieces of 10" by 18", and three pieces of 21.25" x 18".3) Glue tempered hardboard in place, smooth side up, overnight. We put books on each side of the glued areas on each shelf to help the glue secure. It will look like he attached picture.Hope this helps!
