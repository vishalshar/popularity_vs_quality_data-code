Santa got this bedding for my 2 year old daughter, who loves all things purple and Tinkerbell.  This fits the requirements.  She loves it so much.  It is soft brushed cotton after the initial wash.  My daughter has had this on her bed for almost 2 months and she still loves it.  The set has been washed over a dozen times and keeps it color and shape.My only complaint is in the inital wash, the filling in the comforter shifted some and became bunched in areas.  My daughter has not noticed and the problem has not gotten worse in subsequent washings.  Also, when my son was in a toddler bed, his top sheet had an elastic gathered bottom that helped keep the sheet on the matteress and easier for making the bed.  I wish this set had the same.
