I am going to stand up for this product. The reviews I have read are ridiculous indeed. This swing is a must for any new parent. This swing has literally saved my sanity with a colicy newborn. It works beautifully even after 8 months of daily use. The motor is not, I repeat, NOT loud. Sure you do here some sound, but not annoying and baby doesn't notice or care. The swing does not swing off center if the legs are expanded correctly. The swing only clicks when swinging if you stupidly try to change the direction of the swinging seat while the swing is in motion. The click will cease once turned off and on again.  The swing is not cheaply made, quite the opposite. This swing is soft, comfortable and generally very well made. New parents are typically scared of the fast swinging of swings. This swing does swing well, a little fast on the lowest setting. Guess what new parents, the faster the better. Babies love faster, not slower. My daughter would only quiet down with the fastest setting right at birth. She was asleep in about 20 seconds with this miracle swing.  Well, there you have it. This lovely product has saved me from potentially countless sleepless nights. Wonderful product, don't hesitate, just buy it and set it up before you give birth.
