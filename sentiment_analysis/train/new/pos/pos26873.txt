These are good organic sheets. Am giving 4 stars instead of 5 as it would be nice if the fabric/thread count were thicker. Will be plenty sufficient though since babies don't use them for years like do adults. It is great to have this as an option for our newborn. We have Naturepedic twin mattresses for our two other girls and really like those, so we decided to try these bassinet sheets.
