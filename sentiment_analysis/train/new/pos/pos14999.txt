I looked high & low around my local stores to find one of these because we were having a problem with our freezer door popping open. When someone would open the door to the fridge & then close it, no matter it was a soft close or a hard close it would pop open the freezer without us knowing & would start to defrost out or food & then when we would shut it the food would all freeze again.Since this happened several times & much stuff went into the trash because of freezer burn, I search all over to try to find one of these.  I know they would exist for babies not to pull open the fridge.  Couldn't find this anywhere.  Got on Amazon right away & found several right away.  Saw the different designs & knew this was what I wanted.  I didn't even realize that when I ordered it, it came with two.  So right now we have had the first one on for about three months ago & the spare it put away & won't be taken out unless we break this one.Very easy to set up & use.
