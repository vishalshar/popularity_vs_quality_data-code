I got this bag to take on a beach vacation and I love it! I wanted something large enough to carry my snorkeling fins and mask, a shortie wet suit, and a towel. This bag proved to be the perfect size. The best thing about it is that the sand on my equipment falls right through the netting, rather than collecting at the bottom as would happen with a solid bottom bag. I imagine it would work equally well for kids beach toys, as shown in the picture. It's synthetic, so it dries quickly when wet. There is a zipper pocket to hold valuables, such house or car keys. I can't speak to long-term durability, but for this price, I've gotten my money's worth in one trip. The same company offers a solid beach bag in the same color scheme, and we also purchased it. I like it for things we want to keep sand off of, such as our Kindles.
