We've been using this seat for about 4 months and really like it. I did need to buy a simple IKEA chair since our regular dining room chairs compress when you sit on them and even though it seemed solidly strapped in, I wasn't comfortable with it. The tray will temporarily stain with orange foods like carrot and sweet potato. The clips to contain the straps on the back and underside are useless- our baby just wants to play with the straps and we leave them hanging down. I do love that this is so much smaller than a standard high chair.
