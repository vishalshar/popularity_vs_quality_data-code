I LOVE this baby carrier. It has been a lifesaver!!So far, it has endured wonderfully with two of my children, and it has plenty of life left in it. It is especially great to have on hand for trips or running errands. A little side zipper to stick your wallet in it, and another pocket that pulls out an attached sun/rain cover for your child's head.It has saved me many times when my child wanted to take a nap, and I needed to do house chores while getting him/her to sleep. A double-win.It is the easiest carrier to put on, and the adjustments were easy to make to allow my husband to carry my kids with the back position. So, this is just not for women to wear.This should be your top priority to get this if you are expecting! ;)
