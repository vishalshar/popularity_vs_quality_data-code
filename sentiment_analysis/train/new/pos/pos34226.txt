Someone gave me a blue one for my son who needed a booster seat at the table after he was too big for the high chair and he LOVES it.  So, when our little girl graduated from the high chair, I ordered her this pink one.  It is so easy to clean and they actually stick to the chair because of the material it is made out of and does not slide around like other booster seats therefore there are not straps you have to try to figure out.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because there are no safety straps to keep them from getting out of the seat like in the high chair, but, after time, they have learned that they cannot get up from the table before asking.  It is easily portable to a restaurant or to someone's home, too.  I think this is a fabulous item for yourself or as a gift!
