I did my research, so I knew these would fit around the posts that we needed to attach our gates too. I appreciate the convenience of this product (we did not have to buy different size bolts or anything), but be very careful when tightening things up. This wood seems very soft and we had two sets split from tightening too tightly. You just have to go slow to get it tight enough to hold but not so tight that the wood splits. Otherwise, easy to install and use and has held up great (the 2 that didnt split) since installation.
