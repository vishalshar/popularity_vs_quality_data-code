I really like this bed for my son and he loves it.  The one flaw is the room left on the sides of bed when using the crib mattress.  My son (a two year old)ends up sleeping in the pit surrounding his crib mattress.  He rolls off into the sides during the night.  He does no hurt himself nor does he wake up.  I suppose I will go ahead and purchase a twin mattress.  Otherwise this bed is great!!!
