I've bought Boo Boo Buddy ice packs in the past and these green sprouts ones are MUCH sturdier and better quality. The others leak eventually but the plastic on these has held up well. Anytime my kids have an "owie" ice packs are my go-to for soothing them. These also stay cold a good amount of time are much more comfortable than a standard ice pack. The designs are also cute. My kids like them. I highly recommend these.
