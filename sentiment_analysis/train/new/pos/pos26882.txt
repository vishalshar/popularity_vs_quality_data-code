Looks good. Feels good. But I can see why it may cover smaller babies' faces when snapped.  My baby is on the taller side.  Note: there isn't a lining so I add a blanket inside for extra warmth when needed.  But that's ok. In this way, you control the warmth as needed. So far, quality seems very nice!
