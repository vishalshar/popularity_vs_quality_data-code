I am having a really hard time rating this. I absolutely 100% love this product. In fact it's the only one I use on a couple of my door cabinets. Every time it breaks, I replace it with the same one because I hate all the other options. But that is the problem - it breaks. The cable tears a little every time we slide it to open the cabinet so eventually the cable breaks. I still love it, I still buy it. But... For this quality, I should only have to pay $1 or $2. But even that is a problematic statement. It's great quality- it's just the wrong type of cable. I've given it 5 stars every other time because at least it lasted 6 months, but this time it broke after only a month so I have to give 4 stars. Any other product would get a bad review, but I absolutely love this and wish I could use only this kind all over the house. Most people only need to child proof for 6-18 months so they don't need to last very long anyway.
