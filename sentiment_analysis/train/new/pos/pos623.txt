Needed a bumper case for my 6-plus and this was priced well and arrived very quickly. Ordered it on the 6th and it arrived on the 8th. Well packaged and a excellent quality product. Clear plastic back protects the back of the phone.The bumper is a 'little' thin at the plug location and feels like it may tear there at some point. I've been using it for two weeks and no issues at this point. If it does I will see how the vendor handles the problem (If it happens).So far a quality product for a good price.
