its beautiful and cute, the Crib Quilt is made well, the fitted sheet did fit the mattress, but the pillow is thin we were putting it under our baby's head when he was a month old but doesn't use it anymore (he is 9 months now), the bag is simple we put our baby's stuff in it when we go out, overall its nice I recommend it
