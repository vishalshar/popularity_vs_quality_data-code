I actually use these little blankets in my puppy packs I give new puppy owners. I am a small hobby breeder and I include a blanket in a puppy pack for my puppy's new homes with mama's scent on it. These little blankets are soft and durable for puppies, and easy to wash. I loved the colors (I bought 2 of the blue and 3 of the pink because I had 2 male puppies and 3 females). New puppy homes love them and appreciate them very much.Obviously the more common use is for infants. I think this little blanket is just darling and would be a wonderful baby shower gift for someone. The blanket is just the right size for tummy time on the floor, or to cover a car seat carrier if it's cold outside, and of course to bundle you your little one at night. The elephant is darling and the brown piping around the edges is a nice touch.
