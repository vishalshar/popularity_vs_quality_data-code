I had previously purchased the Spectra 9 from Mother's Milk and was enjoying it's use until it began to stop suctioning correctly. I ended up returning it, with a full refund. Since I was out a pump, I desperately looked for another. I FINALLY settled for the Spectra Dew. I had it overnighted so my supply would not drop (it had already dropped about 2 ounces from having to go to a manual pump for 3 days). Amazon quoted me an arrival date of October 26, 2012 - October 29, 2012... I got upset because I had paid $85 for overnight! Well, to my surprise, I messaged them to cancel the order and they informed me that it would INDEED ship in one day, and offered to send it to me still. I agreed, and they gave me a $30 discount for the trouble.This pump is absolutely AMAZING. I used it RIGHT AWAY!!!! It drained my breasts in 20 minutes (both), and quietly at that. My baby was right next to me sleeping and it didn't even stir him. It sounds EXACTLY like a person breathing heavily. The neck of the nipple shields are wide, so it's nice for larger areolas because you can get more in and you won't have to buy additional shields. The suction is fantastic, it pulls gently yet firmly so that it does not pull painfully, but pulls hard enough to get ALL your milk out. You don't even have to fuss with your breasts to squeeze out the milk that any other pump would leave stuck near the base of your breasts (I wear a 38 J nursing bra, so you can tell how far my milk has to travel and how hard it can be for boobs this big to fuss with a pump).I promise you will not regret buying this pump. Don't waste your money on other hospital grade pumps or whatever else. THIS is the perfect pump.
