We've had these for several months and they're our go-to cup for toddler meal times. I really like the stylish colors (my standards have dropped a bit since having a kid okay? At least they're not primary colors.) and the fact that the cup is transparent so my son doesn't feel the need to open the cup to see what's inside.  We only wash them in the dish washer (top rack) and they get catapulted from the high chair often. I've only had one cup develop a small crack in the side of the lid but it's still usable. I feel like they're durable enough for our purposes and I'll buy them again when these wear out.
