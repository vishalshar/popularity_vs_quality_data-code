When a friend bought these for me as a gift at my baby shower I was a little creeped out. I thought to myself, "What kind of a person gives someone tit stickers as a present? Gross. She's probably just jellie because my boobs are so amazing looking right now." I shoved them into a dark corner of the closet in my freshly painted nursery along with all the other weird crap people give a mommy to be and promptly forgot about them.Three months the later I found myself crying along with my newborn as I stood in front of the open door of the freezer completely topless. For the past half hour I had been reaching in and grabbing random groceries to stick on my boobs. Popsicles, frozen peas, crockpot freezer meals I had found on Pinterest that all tasted like butt...you name it. The floor was cluttered with rejected frozen items and I just stood there red-eyed with snot dripping from my nose and falling down onto my hellishly painful breasts. All self-respect was lost.At that moment it occurred to me that I was desperate enough to try anything and I had a package of creepy tit stickers in the back of the closet upstairs. I carefully held onto my girls and winced my way up the stairs, eventually crawling my way along on all fours until I reached the closet door. With shaking hands I lifted the package of gel soothes to my face and chewed through the package to reveal two strange circular tit stickers. I took a deep breath and peeled one off. With eyes squeezed shut I blindly  brought it to my chest and secured it in place. Instant relief. Tears of joy fell from my eyes. I could hear Lionel Richie singing Hello with a thousand angels singing background vocals. It was an experience that far surpassed my usual Almanzo Wilder offering me a drink from the well wearing nothing but overalls fantasy. It was amazing.This time around, I made sure to buy Lansing Gel Soothes long before my baby's arrival. And, you better believe I bought the two pack.
