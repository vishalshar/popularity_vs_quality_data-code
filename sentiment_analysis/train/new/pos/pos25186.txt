I recently just purchased the Verve, and I couldn't disagree more with the other reviews posted. For my first child, I purchased the City Select thinking it would be a great option to have all the different modes for the future (I knew I'd have two children within a few years). I'm a petite person, and even with all of my weight pushing down on that stroller, I couldn't even get it up a curb with two kids in it. A friend recommended me to Phil & Teds because of its compact solution to accommodate two little ones (and can actually make it up a curb without breaking my back). I chose the Verve for its sleek look, and I can't say I've ever seen a more compact fold for a double stroller. The best part is I don't have to take off the second seat when I fold it either. I'm a City Mom at heart even though I live in Colorado, and I haven't had any issues with the wheels no matter where I take it. If they can hold up in the snow, I'm sold! I will say that the gear space was a little bit cramped, but I bought bags that attach to the side of the stroller to hold all of my "mom supplies." Lastly, the height difference between my husband and me (6'2" and 5'1") is never an issue because of the adjustable handle bar. My friend recommended this brand to me and I would definitely pass along the recommendation to anyone too!
