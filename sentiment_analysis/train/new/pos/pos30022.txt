Well worth what I paid for it (almost $200 including shipping) and better quality than I was expecting (I didn't have high expectations). The directions are easy to follow if you have experience putting together items like this. I've assembled about a dozen in the last 15 years and this took me about 1 1/2 hours. Parts and hardware are all together in one bag so you will have to seperate yourself and there will be left over hardware when assembly is completed. If you have ever owned furniture like this then you have dealt with the headaches of the bottoms of the drawers falling out. These drawers have an additional support that you install to prevent that from happening. Plus it has an optional feature that you can install that only allows one drawer to open at a time to prevent tipping or in my case to prevent my daughter from removing everything all at once. It is heavy when delivered, so I would suggest having some help to move. I'm considering purchasing a another.
