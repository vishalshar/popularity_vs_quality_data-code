Use these on two dog strollers, the large Pet Gear AT3 and smaller Pet Gear Special Edition No zip Small stroller (dogs up to 45 lb).  Use to hold plastic grocery bags, clip on ends of leashes for dogs.  They're strong enough to hold a litre water bottle or a leash attached to a 11 lb chiuhaua.  It's a simple concept: strong velcro straps (so they are adjustable and don't scratch the stroller) attached to a large carabiner.  I thought about hooks but glad setled on these carabiners instead because whatever is on them can't slip or be pulled off. Love em!
