When I bought these bugs for my 2 months old boy I anticipated him to get attracted; but his reaction exceeded all my expectations. When he saw these toys hanging on his bouncer he said his first "Wow!" :-) Or, whatever he said, definitely meant a big Wow. I had never seen him that excited before. My little man was even more attracted when he discovered that the bugs have crunchy wings, they rattle and the dragonfly buzzes. Toys came in different colors then shown on the picture; but they look even nicer.  The size is perfect also: enough to attract an infant's attention, but not too big so he can hold them easily. He can spend 30 minutes or even more kicking these toys, touching wings and even talking to them! The bugs became his best friends - and mine too because, while he is busy with them in his bouncer or crib, I can spare time for some homework.
