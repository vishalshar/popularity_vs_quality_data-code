This is my second diaper bag and it's very near perfect!  (My first diaper bag was  Skip-Hop...I didn't like the lack of structure in the bag, the outside got filthy after just a few months, and you could only carry it one way with the shoulder strap).  I love the ability to carry it like a backpack, which was wonderful through the airport and sightseeing on our recent vacation.  The material is durable and cleans off very easily.  I'd be surprised if it stains at all.  Lots of pockets to keep things organized, too.  Overall, worth the price!
