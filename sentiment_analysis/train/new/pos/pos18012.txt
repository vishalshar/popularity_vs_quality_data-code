This is our third diaper pail.  We tried the Munchkin Arm & Hammer pail and the Ubbi before this one.I love this one.  The 2-lid system does a pretty good job keeping smells inside.  Don't believe anybody who tells you that there isn't any smell, because there is.  My experience, though, is that the smell is much more tolerable than the other two (2) pails.  You don't have to scramble to open and close the lid as fast as you can.  The 2nd lid keeps things pretty contained.It seems well constructed, though it's made of plastic (vs the aluminum Ubbi).The only complaint I have is that I don't like the liner.  The liner is one continuous bag that you cut yourself when you replace it.  It's pretty easy to do.  My wife loves it, but I'd rather use regular trash bags like the Ubbi.
