These are great! Stood the test of the microwave, freezer, and dishwasher. I got 16 2oz cubes. I wish they were easier to take along out with me, I think I'd have to take a frozen cube container and put it in a zip-loc baggy in case the lid popped off and let it thaw in the diaper bag for a very short time before using. It'd be nice also to have some kind of label system...labels don't do well when you freeze them!
