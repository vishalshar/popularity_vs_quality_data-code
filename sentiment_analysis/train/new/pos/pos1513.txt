I was tired of broken eggs, cheese everywhere, and the "fridger door" (as my 2 year old son say's) open all the time.  I was very careful to clean the area of the fridge door with alcohol first and then let the adhesive set overnight without opening the door.  I bet that is the key to getting the unit to work properly.  I've only had it a month, but there is no stress in the plastic yet.  My son simply stopped trying to open the "fridger." I was lucky for that; I am sure some kids just work really hard to pry it open. I forgot about the lock a couple times and pulled the door really hard myself, but it still didn't budge.  I expect it to last several more months if not more.  For the price; I'll be okay with that because I like how this particular latch works and looks.  It closes itself when I close the fridge. Some people may have a different fridge door that causes it to work differently or break easier, but I'm glad I tried it.  I'm going to add a picture of it on my fridge too for other people to reference.  I had a hard time figuring exactly where to put it, but the way it is seems perfect.
