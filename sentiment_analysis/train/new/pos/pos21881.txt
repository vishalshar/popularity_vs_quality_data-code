I bought these in an attempt keep my DS's socks on. So far they work somewhat successfully. My DS's socks remain on for the majority of the day, but he's able to wiggle his left sock off. I'm not sure if it's if the product's fault, or if it's the type of socks he's wearing. My money is on the socks, but until I know for sure they get 4 stars.The sock ons are made of a stretchy fabric that allows for a snug fit, but not so snug as it makes getting them on and off difficult. The product is also the same size all around so there is no need to worry about which side goes where. They are well made and have so far stood up to my very determined 7 month old.I would buy these again, and will probably buy more soon, and I've already recommended these to friends.
