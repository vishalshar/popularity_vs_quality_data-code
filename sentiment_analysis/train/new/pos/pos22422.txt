It surprises me that Stork Craft hasn't revamped the directions on the crib after so many complaints about the assembly directions. I am fortunate to have a father and husband who are both handy and tackled the job without much headache. They did mention the following:You need to be able to anticipate a couple steps ahead in order to avoid back-tracking on your assembly.You can't tighten all the parts until the end or the crib won't fit together properly.There is a picture showing you what size screw you will be using at certain times- I guess this picture is not true to size and if you're following the directions exactly, this will lead you astray. Luckily my dad noticed right away that it didn't make sense and they avoided any "screw"-up!Shape is cute, color and quality are decent and overall I'm happy this is the one we selected.
