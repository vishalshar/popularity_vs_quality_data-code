I ordered these to have on hand for my granchildren, it seems one of them always needs a warm / cold pack, usually the latter. I think they are a perfect size for those small area needs, like as with a swollen bug bite / bee sting / scraped / bruised spots or mild sun burn. Maybe use one to relieve a head / tooth ache. I could probably add many more uses but it's up to the individual user as how you'd benefit from them. They are covered with terry cloth material and come with a gel pack and a built in pocket for your hand / the user's to help hold it in place. I hope I actually don't have to use these too often, but I'm better prepared now, just in case. I'd recommend these for all parents, as well as grand parents that have little ones coming to visit. It may also be a good medical asset for home care givers for the elderly / any person relying on assistance.
