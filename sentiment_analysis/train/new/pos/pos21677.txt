My granddaughter who is three months old has made this her favorite toy, has to be in bed with her every night. I'm very concerned about the back of the toy . It is completely open in the back. Held together with Velcro. Could be opened easily when she gets older. So grand mom will have to find her a better replacement for her favorite toy.
