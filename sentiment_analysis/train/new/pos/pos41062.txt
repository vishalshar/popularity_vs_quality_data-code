Here's what I love about this sling:1. Easy to use, even for a newby to baby slings! Watched the DVD a few times and looked at the included photo instructions, all of which are way to follow and understand. After two attempts I think I got it, and ready to use it in public!2. My 3 week old really seems to love it, she's fallen asleep in it twice, and I even was able to breastfeeding using it! Which was also easy to do.3. The orange color is very pretty and not obnoxious, and the quality of the fabric seems like it will last a long time.4. Looking forward to using this around the house and in public, especially since I have a 2.5 year old I have to chase around!5. My husband totally wore it and carried my 2.5 year old around the house (she's about 28 pounds). She seemed to like it. Prob not something to use for long periods with her but its cool she can also use it.6. The padded shoulder is nice!!!7. The length I got (medium) is good. I'm 5'5", size 8 , medium frame and its perfect. It fits my hubbie too, who's 5'8" medium to broad frame (the tail just doesn't hang as long which is ok)What I don't like:1. The materiel is kind of rough. Perhaps bc is woven?? But it would be nice if it were a bit smoother. It's not stiff though. If the fabric were softer I would give it 5 stars.
