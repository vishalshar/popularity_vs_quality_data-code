Just got these bottles after looking at many many brands on the market.Other brands I have personally used areDr. Brown's Natural Flow 4oz Wide Neck Bottles-2 Pack wide base (too much to clean, bottle larger than usable space to allow for vent design, just ended up very bulky)Tommee Tippee 3-pack Closer to Nature Bottle 5oz (mostly nice, but "shoulder" on bottle trapped a lot of milk making it hard to feed it all without a lot of tipping and finesse and lack of grip on lid makes it very hard to open)Comotomo bottles look and feel very well made and fit together nicely, one of my nipples was not flowing, the hole was not made cleanly, but Amazon immediately issued me a credit that let me order 2 replacement nipples. The other one flows good and thankfully is actually low flow, so many brands claim they are and aren't! These feel good in my hand and the babies even seem to like placing there hands on them, I am guessing they will be easy for them to hold in the near future. Lid snaps on well and seems to seal great, i could not make these leak in the lid or around the screw lid, its seals up to the silicone tight! Nipple locks into outer ring tightly and would be hard to get on wrong.The frosted silicone is very grippy on the body of the bottle and is thicker and firmer on the top two thirds of it to give structure and thinner on the bottom third for squeeze-ability, someone really thought it out. I have training in Industrial Design and i have to say I'm very impressed how they addressed nearly all my issues with bottles.Biggest selling points for me were:*Breastfeeding compatible nipple (as much as there ever is)*Milk not being trapped in the bottle (i pump breast milk and it is too precious to waste)*Easy to clean (i have newborn twins i do not need more hassle)and*Good looks (might seem silly but bottle feeding is already a drag, something stylish rather than clinical makes me smile)___Pros:________________________*Truly low flow nipple*Clean design that lets you wash it really easy, no bottle brush, my hand and a sponge fit in fine and there are no fussy undercuts to wash around (a big issue with Dr. Browns bottles)*Good nipple shape for breastfed babies or anyone for that matter*2 vents built into nipple to let air back in and reduce vacuum that can lead to ear pain and bubbles*No loud branding, brand name is only in frosted letters on bottle, very low key*Volume measurements molded into the frosted silicone bottle, can not wear off (slightly hard to read)*Shape allows all the milk to drain into the nipple easily, no "shoulder" on the bottle*Different colored rings on each bottle lets you designate one for each child (I have twins) or for different uses?*Soft silicone body lets you give a little squeeze for sleepy babies or newborns just figuring it out*Tab on lid ring makes for easy unscrewing (a big problem with TommeeTippee brand)___Cons:________________________*Pricy (but I think worth it, and how many do you really need after all?)*Might tip over a bit easy (but they don't seem to leak)*Color of lid rings are pink and green, I think it would be smarter to have non sex associated colors ( I have B/G twins so it works out, but something more neutral than pink would be better for most folks)*Volume marking can be hard to read, they are frost on a clear background, no color*Too wide for my Dr Browns bottle warmer, I'm guessing other brands as well (it fits if I remove the inner basket, but that causes other issues)
