bought this for my grandson who just turned one. It looks sturdy--he only sat in it for a short time. I wold have liked it if we were able to put the chair in a sleeve for ease of transport. I bought a fabric pen and put my grandsons name on the chair. I am hoping the umbrella stays up once it is tightened.
