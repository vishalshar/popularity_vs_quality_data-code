I was disappointed at first, because the washcloths seemed very thin, almost like a knockoff of a washcloth (I also have a different brand that was thick and luxurious, so these felt very cheap by comparison). However, after the baby arrived and I started actually washing her, I quickly realized that these are much, much better than the thick ones. Because they are thinner, they work much better to get into hard to reach, wrinkly places, like the folds under the baby's chin, around her nose and mouth, etc. The thick washcloths are too thick and crude for that task, and can't get between folds. I have been using these washcloths at bath time to wash my daughter (face and body), so I've been using them every day for over a year now. I wash them once a week in her general laundry, cold water and dry on low. They've held up great! No fraying along the edges (though the edging looks a bit cheap too... but I'm impressed that there has been no fraying at all!), no signs of wear, no stiffness, no staining or color problems. They look and feel exactly the same. I also love that there are so many of them in a pack, more than the usual packs, so we have enough to use a new one every day at bath time, plus a couple extra just in case, before I have to do laundry again. I'm very happy with these washcloths - they've really overturned my first impression and come through!
