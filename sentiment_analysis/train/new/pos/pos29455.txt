My 10 month old son and I love this booster seat!!!  He is my third and with the first two booster seats were boring, just a tray that you could TRY and attach a suction toy to keep them occupied, but let's be honest, they always throw those off every five seconds so when you're in the kitchen most of your time was spent picking said toy back up off the floor.  That's where this tray rocks!  The Thomas train and stop crossing are all attached onto a base that inserts into the actual feeding tray.  So while I am busy doing something, I can put the baby in the booster and let him play with Thomas while I actually get some stuff done.  And believe me, as all babies, he has tried his hardest to lift Thomas off that track and throw him, but he can't!  It's brilliant!  Then, when mommy actually managed to get things prepared in a fair amount of time, I can push him over to the table, remove the Thomas level, and a plain try sits underneath for meal time.  Brilliant!
