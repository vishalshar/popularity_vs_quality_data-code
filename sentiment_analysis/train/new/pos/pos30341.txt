I thoroughly researched pacis before I chose ones that I was ok with my son using, and among the ones we tried, this was the only one he ever liked.  It's kind of frustrating that Prime shipping isn't available because when I need them in a pinch (this is the only place I have EVER seen them), I just have to wait it out.  However, I chose it because of the nipple shape (which is close to an actual nipple but for some reason hard to find) and the materials (silicone). Also, oddly enough, we get actual compliments on this pacifier all the time (bizarre I know).  People will say, "I really like that pacifier!" or "What a cute pacifier!".  It never occurred to me to notice a child's pacifer! Haha
