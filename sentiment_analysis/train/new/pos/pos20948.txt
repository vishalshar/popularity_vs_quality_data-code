I bought one of these cuz the blue bulb just wasn't doing the trick. From all the reviews i got this one instead of the one that came with the filters. Have been using it since my infant was 5 months old. If i would have known about it sooner, i would have def. gotten it sooner. I LOVE THIS THING!!! Def. rec to put saline up the nose before you suck the boogies out. Just easier to loosen things up and you don't pass out from trying to suck stuff out. I have never gotten the goo in to the tube attached to the bulb. The rubber nose applicators are soft and you don't have to worry about hurting their noses. I would rec. to buy a replacement kit as well. I don't use the tube but it's nice to switch out the rubber nose applicators if one gets clogged. Just recently my DD had a nasty cold and she was severely congested. This thing sucked it all out, A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! The best part is that your "filter" is half a tissue balled up in to catch the goo. Then you just take it out and flush. Rinse out the bulb and use again, i usually wipe it out with a sanitizer sheet. As a first time mom, I encourage every mom to buy this. You will love it as much as i do!!!! I would give it 10 stars if i could!!!
