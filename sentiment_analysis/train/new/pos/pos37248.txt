These are cute. The new mother didn't want "plain Jane" white or ecru things.... she wanted color... these fit that bill, and, while not matching the decor, I think they will blend with the decor. When my kids were babies, I found it was difficult to have too many receiving blankets, as they are so versatile...swaddle, sure, but... lightweight blanket, burp cloth, even very light towel. If you have a baby with a sensitive stomach, and if you are wearing a suit, good luck with a "burp cloth".... they aren't large enough. Go to a coulple of doubled receiving blankets, or a cloth diaper.Want to change the baby, and need to set baby on a table, a seat in the car, or the floor? I used to grab a receiving blanket as often as a changing pad. They take up less room in the diaper bag.
