So I went to the store to buy a car seat that fit with my wonderful graco stroller. This is my third child and I had to throw away my other car seat from my first since it was expired. Well, the new car seats would not fit with my old stroller. So according to Babies R Us I had to buy a whole new system if I wanted the car seat to click into a stroller. Graco switched to a new click system since my first was born. I was severely bummed. I loved my old stroller and I didn't want to spend 300 dollars on another set. So I checked amazon and they had the click connect so I didn't have to buy a whole new set.The only negative is that you cannot adjust the straps from the front of the carrier. You have to do it from the back which I know is going get annoying with coat changes when the weather gets colder.
