This is my second one of these, but I broke the first tripping on the corner of the bed post putting my daughter in her bed.  It was in the up position and I had already carried my daughter up the stairs (50 lbs), so I thought I could reach over fine, which normally is no issue, but I tripped and leaned all my weight on it (210 lbs). As I laid my daughter down.  So at 260 lbs of lateral weight (at an unknown additional force) I snapped one of the hinge arms used to fold it up and down.  Honestly it's a great bed rail and lasted us years before my clumsiness broke it.  I'm happy to replace it with the same one.
