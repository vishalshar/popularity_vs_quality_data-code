so many nightlights are just too bright and that level of light can interfere with the natural melatonin levels and sleep patterns that a growing child needs.  This cute little ladybug is the best solution. I have had this for about 2 years now for my 1.5 year old - who is now 3.5 years old. I have not yet changed the batteries, he uses it every night. it shines up ton he ceiling and walls with a gentle light of stars and moon. It is very dark where we live and I have black out shades on the room, so this is perfect. If your room has some ambient light, then this might not be 'bright' enough. There are 3 colors, yellow, green, blue and the 4th setting is for it to rotate through each color. The light will run for 45 minutes and then turn off on its own. The ladybug is hard plastic, and turns on with a touch of the finger on the top. And its safe for a child to handle and play with. its pretty rugged as I have dropped it a few times (we take it with on  our travels) and it has not shown and wear or tear.I highly recommend this nightlight!
