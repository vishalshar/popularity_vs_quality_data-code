I normally do not write reviews but I have been so pleased with these bottles that I decided I would. First let me say I have always used Avent bottles in the past and so I purchased them again when I found out I was having twins. It had been five years since last using them and Avent had changed the nipple design. I am still not sure why they changed it because I never had the bottles leak in the past but the redesigned ones leak all the time. I saw the Gerber Gentleflow bottles here on Amazon and read that they could be used with Avent nipples so I decided I would give them a try. I must say that I have not once experienced any leaking from these bottles with the use of the nipples they come with nor the Avent ones. You can not go wrong with buying these and you will save a ton of money in the process. The one thing I am noticing is that some of the writing is wearing off on the bottles but the measurements show no sign of wear yet so those could be printed on there differently. If they do start to wear off I will just call Gerber and I am sure there outstanding customer service will take care of it.
