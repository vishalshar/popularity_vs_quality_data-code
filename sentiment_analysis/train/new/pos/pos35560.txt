I'm so glad we bought this. We bought an exersaucer & the baby liked it, but had no clue what to do with her legs. First time she was in the jumper, she knew right what to do & got a big grin! She loves it. I like the tray to put stuff on & it acts like a bumper too...although you still have to watch fingers. PS Now she knows how to bounce in the exersaucer too. But if I was choosing one or the other, I'd pick this jumper.
