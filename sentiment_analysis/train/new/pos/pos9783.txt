This changing table is amazing. I read a lot of reviews on it prior to purchase and was a bit worried. A few people said it had scratches... not sure if it was actual scratches or fuzzy's from the protective foam (which looked like scratches everywhere until you wipe them off) i got the package inside by myself just fine by pushing it (21 weeks pregnant) and assembled the whole thing. I think it is easily a one person job. The only trouble i came to was the very last drawer i went to assemble, a piece of blank wood screwed into the side panel was not cut properly and i will have to saw it down a tad tonight to make the backboard fit.
