I wanted to write a review for this seat, because after much researching, I couldn't really find any helpful information.  I have a Britax Blvd. for my 15 month old daughter in my Honda minivan, which she is very happy with, but it couldn't fit in my husband's Dodge Ram 2500 truck.  It was too tall and would leave her in too much of an upright position.  After looking at the back's of a lot of other car seats, I felt this on would be a good fit without losing too much of the comfort for my daughter.  It fits very nicely in the extra cab and my daughter seems very comfortable.  It is very easy to install and it's very lightweight.  After lugging the Britax seat all over the airport and on and off the plane on a recent trip, I will be looking forward to traveling with this one instead.  The straps do not come with any covers, but that is an easy fix.  Adjusting the straps to fit her was very easy and there are multiple options to move them as she grows.  Overall, I think it will be a great seat to have as an extra.  The Britax will still be her main car seat; I don't think you can find a better seat than that one.If you need a seat to fit in the back of a truck, this is a good one.
