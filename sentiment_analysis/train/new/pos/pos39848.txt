I was dying to wear some sort of jewelry after having my little babykins, and this piece is very similar to what I wore before he came along. I got the "jade" version, and it really looks like jade. I hold him all the time, wear him in a sling while grocery shopping and such, and he really likes holding onto it and playing with it. I think that the length is perfect, personally. It can get a little soggy but not enough to bother me. I wish the tie were something a tad more substantial but I don't know what they could use that would be baby proof.  Overall I really like this, my nugget likes it and I wear it ALL the time.
