Once we found this item in a local store (many phone calls to the stores/customer service later), we immediately were impressed with the quality and price.  This piece is a perfect height to double as a changing table which is our intention.  The only problem we noticed is that the top needs a little reinforcing during the assembly process.  My husband used a couple blocks of wood and a few screws to more securely attach the top to the base.  Most of the piece is treated pine with only the top and drawer faces being verneer.  The color is very similar to the color viewed on-line.
