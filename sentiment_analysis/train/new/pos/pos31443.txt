Overall my wife and I are very happy with our purchase of this product.  It rides smoothly, is easy to turn / push and for us (average height) the  push bar is in a fine location.  Seems like a sturdy stroller, has reflectors for safety, and it has a "sun roof" so we can look down on our child when pushing him.Here is what we did not like (and what made it 4-star instead of 5-star)1) The instructions that came with the product were for the Baby Trend High Chair - which has nothing to do with a jogging stroller2) The instructions that are available online (On this products page) have some steps that don't need to be done (they are already done)3) The front wheel lock (to lock it straight) does not work.  It isn't something we will use so we aren't exchanging it, just something I noticed.4) When folding the stroller, to get it as compact as it can get and to lock it shut, you need to rotate the tire to the side.  Otherwise it will not close properly.  This was not mentioned in the instruction manual and in my opinion wasn't completely intuitive.
