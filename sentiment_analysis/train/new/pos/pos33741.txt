This monitor does not have rechargeable batteries as some of the other reviews suggest. I owned a previous version of this monitor which did come with rechargeable batteries. I liked it very much except that the batteries eventually lost the ability to hold a charge as other reviewers indicate. I ordered this monitor to replace it not realizing that this one does not have rechargeable batteries. I was going to return it, but after researching, realized that the rechargeable version is no longer available. (I found this out by looking at the website with updates for "Baby Bargains" by Denise and Alan Fields - great book by the way.) I decided to keep the monitor anyway because I have not been able to find another monitor that meets my needs with rechargeable batteries.
