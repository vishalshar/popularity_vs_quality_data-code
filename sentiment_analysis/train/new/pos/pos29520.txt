Yes, my kids can pick these up and throw them, HOWEVER, I don't think there is a dish in existence that can't be tipped or picked up. This dish is a fun color and the weight and shape encourage the kids to leave them on the table - they are definitely a bit more challenging to pick up than any other options we've tried. What I love about this dish is that it stays put while the kids are eating - it doesn't slide around on the table when they are trying to scoop up the food. It isn't deep enough to make scooping food difficult for my 18 mo old twins, but is just deep enough to give them a surface to scoop against.Our dishes arrived quickly and were exactly as advertised. We've been very happy with them.
