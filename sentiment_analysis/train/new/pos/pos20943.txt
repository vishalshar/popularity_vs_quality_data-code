We have the Avent Classic and classic plus bottles. For my firstborn, we used a munchkin basket in the dishwasher. It could only hold 5 nipples on the top, and when we put nipples in the bottom, they got flipped over and filed with soapy water that didn't rinse completely. We just had our second kid who is eating 8 bottles a day, so we needed a better solution to wash so many nipples. This nipple holder is perfect! I can put six nipples in each holder, so a total of 12. The nipples pop in easily, the holder stays put in the dishwasher, and the nipples come out clean with no soap residue. With the Avent Classic bottles, all of the other pieces are just rings that we put around the prongs in the dishwasher, so we have no need for the basket anymore. Wish I'd found this a couple years ago with my first!
