Excellent product for the price. I will be ordering these again if I ever need another set. The end that connects to the pump is a hair smaller than the original and actually STAY ON my Pump In Style. The original hoses would come off with the tiniest tug. The purple ends seem to fit the flanges just fine and the hoses are more robust. 5 star!!
