We ordered this for baby #3 before he was born and are very happy with it. The pastel colors are gender neutral and the fabric is super soft. A few reviews I read stated that the music was out of tune so I was a little hesitant to buy it at first. My husband and I are both musicians and have listened to the music over and over and have yet to hear a single note out of tune. I assume the manufacturer fixed the problem or the reviewers were mistaken. Overall, we are very pleased with this purchase and look forward to giving it to our new baby when he arrives.
