My daughter is in love with lions, but I was going back for my college reunion and our mascot is the tiger so we picked this up to hopefully entertain her.  And she loved it!!  (Also was a huge hit at reunions!)  You can pull the tail to make the Tiger jiggle/shake, the plastic loop holds diiferent shaped/colored discs to play and suck on, and the ball jingles.  She likes to suck on teh little satin pieces on the ball and the tail.  Very cute and a good value for the money!We attach it to her bouncer/entertainer and to the car seat... and she likes to just carry it around with her.
