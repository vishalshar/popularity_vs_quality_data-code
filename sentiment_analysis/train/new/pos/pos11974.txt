This was a great addition to my son's playroom.  Good size decals and easy to apply.  The decals are fabric and not vinyl just as an FYI.  It does say in the description, but I missed that part and I was surprised that  they were fabric when I opened the package. We painted the walls a light blue and it looks really nice against the blue.  Great product.
