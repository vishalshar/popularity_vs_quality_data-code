Prior to ordering this item for my beautiful new grandson, I naturally read the reviews and pondered a bit before making a decision.  From the reviews, I surmised my only real issue would be the "loud" motor.  I decided it would be a small price to pay for the luxury of saving space, etc. so I ordered it.  I'm very glad I did because I can honestly say the motor is actually relatively quiet and my grandson loves it.  Perfect size, easy to assemble and very good pricing.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
