What a great invention!  It is not expensive and does what it suppose to do. Our son hates getting water down his face when we wash his hair. This visor takes care of that. It does take some getting used to if your child is not used to having something constricting around his head. It does put gentle pressure around your baby's head so to create a seal so the water doesn't leak down. Our child did get used to it and now he doesn't care if we put it on him. Very useful product!! Makes washing his hair a breeze.
