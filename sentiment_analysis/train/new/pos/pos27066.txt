I bought this for my son's room as part of a redecorating project. His room was somewhat baby-ish in style and he's at an age (nearly 7) where he's wanting to move away from that although I'm not ready for him to be too grown up just yet either. Initially, I wasn't sure what I would use it for, but I did know that I wanted orange as an accent color, and I thought this would keep some of that little boy feel without being too much little boy.It's made out of a heavy canvas and seems very sturdy. Also, it's quite large. I didn't pay much attention to the dimensions (my fault) so when it arrived, I was surprised by the size and wasn't sure I still wanted it. It's so big, my son could sit down and put it over his head and hide. In the end, I was glad to have it. I used it for all his super-hero costumes and similar stuffs. It's plenty big to hold everything -- he's got about 20+ costumes plus accessories to go with them. And the pop of orange is perfect.My only complaint is that a small part of the fox wasn't stitched to the bag properly. This doesn't affect usage at all and no one notices unless I point it out. It was probably just a manufacturing glitch -- those things happen sometimes -- but it annoys my OCD. This little issue didn't affect my rating (but if I could give it 4.5 stars, I would because of it). Other reviews have indicated problems with the bin falling over or having smelly plastic, but I do not have either issue. This bin has no problems staying upright and does not have a weird smell.All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this purchase. It's a great size, it's sturdy, the color is perfect for the room, I love the fox, and my son likes it, too. I would definitely buy another of these.
