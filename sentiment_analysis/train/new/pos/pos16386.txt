I decided to cloth diaper my son, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought one pack of cloths. (They only had that one style of pre-folds.) So I got on Amazon to see if there was something inexpensive but maybe of better quality. I *thought* this item was what I was looking for. $5.00 more than Wal-Mart and it said "premium" and some other stuff to make me think so. The package came and it is the same thing I already bought! Not the diaper's fault; I'm just telling you.I have no issues with this diaper. I've not used the fancier ones nor do I intend to since this is wonderful. I have to change my toddler every 2 hours and he is a very heavy wetter. They have held up quite well with all of the washes I've done. No stains, but this is a matter of how you wash and not of the cloth. My one issue is that my son has some fuzz on him when I change him. This could be because I've never put them in the dryer.I recommend these cloth diapers and do not see a need to go all out on the fancy ones. What is the point? :)
