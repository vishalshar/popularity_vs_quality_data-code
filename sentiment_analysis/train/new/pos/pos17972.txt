I've been using pampers swaddlers on my 2.5 year old son and our preemie daughter, it's honestly the only brand we use. Pampers is a fantastic company, their customer service is outstanding, and their pampers rewards it worth doing for some free goodies!With that being said, I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because of the amount you get. Our daughter was born at 27 weeks, and came home after a 73 day stay in the NICU. She was only 5lbs when coming home, and needed to be in preemie sized diapers for a good month or two after coming home. Anyone with babies knows that they go through at least 10-15 diapers a day...if not more. So essentially, we were going through almost an entire bag a day. I know she wasn't in preemie sized diapers for THAT long, but other preemies are. I wish there was an option to purchase at LEAST one box of these with more in them so I could have gotten more for my money. We only purchase larger boxes for all the other size as they are much better value. Pamper's should consider preemie boxes of diapers for us preemie parents....especially with mounting medical bills it would be nice to save money somewhere....With all that being said, I still chose pampers swaddlers over any brand, and if for some unfortunate reason you need to purchase preemie diapers, I highly recommend swaddlers.
