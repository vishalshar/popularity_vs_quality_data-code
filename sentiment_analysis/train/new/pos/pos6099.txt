I bought both the Mickey and the Minnie for my daughters.  I had borrowed a harness buddy from a friend for a Disney World trip and it really came in handy.  My oldest daughter (the youngest is still way too young to walk or have use of the harness buddy) loves her Mickey and plays with it around the house.  She doesn't mind wearing it when we are out and about.  I use it mainly when we are going somewhere crowded, on long walks, or when I have more than one preschooler out with me.  It helps keep your little one close while giving them their independence (both hands free).
