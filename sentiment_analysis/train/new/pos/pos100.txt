We have multiple little ones, and it was time for the two-year old to get her very own sleeping bag. She loves it, great "fun" design and playing "camping out" in the basement is much fun. We found this works well for a small child, fun design, and sufficiently cozy to let the parents know all is ok.  We would not take this with us on a hike or camping trip ... we would rely on the more "standard heavy duty outdoor gear" to keep the children warm in the mountains overnight. We anticipate she will "grow out of this" in a few years and graduate to a more robust sleeping bag.  For a two year old, we found this just the right mix of "real" and "play" features.
