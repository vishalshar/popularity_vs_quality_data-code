We bougt this for our second sons nursery.  I've never worked with any type of wall paper before, so I was a bit nervous.  I did a ton of research and read every single review.  I was nervous about how many people couldn't get it to hang, I was also nervous about 'buffing' my brand new painted walls to get extra 'stick' as some sites reviewed.We found the wall paper was difficult to hang, at first.  After about a 6o seconds, the glue would start to set and it would stick.  This is the method we used:1.  Set a level line around the room.  I chose to use the bottom of the top scallop so it would be entirely covered once the wall paper was hung, and this worked awesome as you could easily slide the wall paper just a smidge to check it was level.  I used a tape measure to measure from the top of the kick board to the line and from the cieiling to the line.  Then I used a 5 foot level to draw a straight line.2.  Measure (twice) and cut the wall paper to the lenght you want to attempt.  Don't do too much.  The water paper is hard to old up for the first 60 seconds or so until it starts to adhere.  If you take on too much, it's hard to get a good 'stick'.3.  We used warm water, as recommended.  My husband would roll the paper back on it's self and I would line up the starting point and then we'd spread it against the wall, him unrolling and me roughtly smoothing with a wet sponge and hold it until it started to stick.  Working quickly, we'd both start smoothing the paper.  We found the best way to stick the scallops was by hand.  After the majority of the paper was stuck, wed work from the middle up and down sticking each one individually.  It was a bit time consuming, but in the end, it stucky nicely and we haven't had any problems with it peeling.Good luck!
