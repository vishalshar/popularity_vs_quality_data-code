...Which is exactly what I wanted. Yes, it is made of plastic, but as an experienced mom, I think EVERYTHING should be made of plastic. My first bassinet was a lovely co-sleeper type that was about 130 dollars. My son spent all of two nights in the thing, he HATED it. So this time around, I am going sensibly priced. It's light-weight, extremely cleanable, and best of all, inexpensive. Plus, although it was cheap, the bassinet is adorable when put together. It was easy to put together and will store well in the event that I lose my mind and decide to have another baby.Realistically, if you are looking for a product made out of solid cherry with egyptian cotton bedding, you are not going to get it for 40 bucks...
