I'm in the construction industry here in central Florida and after trying ODOGard  on some of my job sites (abandoned homes with all types of garbage closed up fridges and you can only guess what else)  It works great.I have tried other products but this one by far beats them all hands down.For people like me in my line of work I would like to see it in a six pack or case package.As for now I have increased my next order.If you give it to your wife she will not return it, She said it is better then any other off the shelf odor eliminator she has ever used.Thanks Rem Brand.
