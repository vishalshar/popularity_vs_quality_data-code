I bought this product when I had my third baby. I was a little hesitant but the reviews convicted me to gave it a try. I'm glad I did. First of all the design is well thought out and very sturdy. It was very easy to assemble. I think it took me 20 minutes from start to finish and the instructions were easy to follow. The most important reason my baby sleeps in it for hours.  With my other children I've used other swings (3 different ones to be exact). This works better than all of them by far. To be fair they were not as high tech or expensive as this one but as a new mother I recommend putting your money into this. It buys you time and much needed rest. I was going to buy the infant insert but never got around to it and I don't think you really need it. Using a couple of swaddle blankets works just fine and also keeps it clean in case there is a diaper leak. It is easy to clean. You can wipe it and clean it with a towel and water. It also plays white noise and has several settings that help relax the baby.  I would have given this product five stars but my one small complaint is that it makes noise. It's not loud but it's noticeable. My baby doesn't seem bothered by it at all but I notice it.
