I was hesitant to give my little guy a pacifier because I was afraid of nipple confusion. So glad I purchased this and so is my husband. Our babe has had no problem breastfeeding and having this guy as a soother for when he's fussy. The material is soft and pliable similar to a real nipple. I'm definitely going to purchase a couple more.
