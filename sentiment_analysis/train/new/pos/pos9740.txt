The Dr. Brown's bottles have more threads on the neck and different from other brands (Medela) which means they are not fully secure if using caps from other systems. Also, the design of Dr. Browns with the aerator and attachment makes it difficult to secure since they require at least 3 components (a flat disk, the aerator, and the collar). These caps replace the 3 part contraption and work great to secure bottles.If you plan on carry Dr. Brown's in a diaper bag on the go or just generally want to secure them around the house the caps are a must. It is annoying to have to carry an additional part, but much better than spilling hard earned milk or having to clean up a bag that is soaking wet.
