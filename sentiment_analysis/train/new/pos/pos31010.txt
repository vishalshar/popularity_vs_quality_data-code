---------------------------Verdict: BUY (if you value your hearing)---------------------------My kiddo is somewhat picky when it comes to pacifiers. These milk brand pacifiers are orthodontic designed to be easy for babies to suck on and keep in their mouth. I do not know where I would be without them!Pros:---------------------------- solid quality- orthodontic design- fun patterns- easy to cleanCons:---------------------------- The design makes them a little squeaky. So if your baby is a strong sucker she might end up sounding like Maggie Simpson!
