This is so cute, and my daughter loves it. We're just starting our trip, so I don't know how well it will hold up over time, but it's well made and seems like it will do well.When I was shopping, I wished I had more pictures to see for a size comparison to see how it might measure up to my daughter. She is 5 years old, maybe a little on the petite side. Here's a picture of her pretending to sleep. She was nodding off, but when she heard I was going to take a picture, she woke up and posed for me.
