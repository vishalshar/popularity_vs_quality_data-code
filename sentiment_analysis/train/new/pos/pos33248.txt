We just got back from a trip that included four separate flights (2 to get there, 2 to get back).  This bag was a life saver.  I didn't know until shortly before the trip what we should do with the car seat, so when I found out we had to check it as checked luggage (we didn't have a ticket for our 15 month old or he could have counted it as his carry-on), I started looking for a solution.This bag was reasonably priced, roomy, and durable.  We put his car seat, portable booster seat, and diaper bag filled with diapers and books into it.  With all this inside the bag ended up being kind of heavy because it is so roomy, but the strap held up well - no sign of the stitching or the bag itself starting to tear.  Because of the weight, wheels might have been nice, but it was our choice to fill it so full, and the bag was only $15.  The airplane luggage handling isn't always so kind to wheels anyway.  I saw the ones with wheels, opted for the cheaper version without wheels, and I'm not sorry.  If you have a family's worth of luggage, often you rent a cart at the airport anyway.I would like to note that the pictures make it look like there is some sort of rigidity to the back and maybe some of the sides of the bag, but there isn't.  It is just a heavy weight coated nylon or something, like a good duffel bag.So... good value for the price - I highly recommend if you don't do a ton of traveling with kids!  For one thing, once they get older you use their seat on the plane and there are other solutions for transporting it (strapping their seat to your carry-on, for example).  That is a big reason why we opted for a lower-cost item when you have to buy so much other stuff the first few years that you only use for a short while.  I was very pleased to find this product!
