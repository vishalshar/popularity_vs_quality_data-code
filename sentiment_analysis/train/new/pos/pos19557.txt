My daughter absolutely LOVES this! We purchased it when she was about 3 months to help increase tummy time, and it was an instant hit. At 5 months, it's still one of her faves.To parents: when I first opened and saw the product, it looked a little small, boring, and not what I expected...but, I gave it a try and it is 100%+ baby approved!!!
