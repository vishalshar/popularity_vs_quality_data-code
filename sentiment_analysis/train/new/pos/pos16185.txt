These are the cutest letter magnets I've found. The only downside is they are not sturdy wood or plastic or anything that would stand up to much abuse or baby chewing. They are closer to cardboard type material. I got them for my 14 month old daughter who is still in the "everything in the mouth" phase. That being said, I just make sure she's supervised when playing with them and I don't let her chew on them :)They don't seem to be the best quality as our "y" came apart after one play session. The colored top part separated from the magnet part. Not a huge deal. A little superglue fixed it. We didn't abuse them or anything. My daughter just likes to take them off the magnet board and move them around. We talk about the letters and group the ones that are the same. She absolutely loves them.The little storage box they come in is also handy. I stained it to match her playroom furniture and it's great to keep the magnets together when I can't closely supervise her playing with them.
