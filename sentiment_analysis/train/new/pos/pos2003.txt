This spoon is easy for my 12 month old to hold and the food does stick pretty well so he can get it to his mouth. It does make self-feeding much easier than other spoons we have tried. The curved handle makes it easy for him to grab and scoop. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the bowl of the spoon is a little too large (flat) for my son's mouth. He likes to flip it upside down in his mouth to get all the food off with his tongue, he has a hard time doing so with this spoon. Also the knobby handle is pretty distracting as a chewing toy, but that is a problem with pretty much anything right now. We are continuing to use it for self-feeding and I am sure he will get the hang of it soon enough.
