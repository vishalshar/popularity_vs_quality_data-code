I really love this bag. Several random people have complimented it when I was out. Keep in mind it's not very deep. I fit 2 Dr Brown wide neck bottles and maybe a thin ice pack if you're out for a while. Now we've moved on to sippy cups and I use this every day to transport the cup to day care. Overall a sturdy and well made bag.
