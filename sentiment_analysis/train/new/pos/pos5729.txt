My kids love to pull wipes out of the wipes box (what 16 month old doesn't?!), so I thought this would be a fun toy that could hold their attention. I was right! They love pulling the hankies out of Franky's head and they love to figure out how to get the hankies back in. They also like to shove anything else they can in Franky's mouth. Good thing he's a good sport and doesn't mind. They love to also toss the hankies in the air and watch them fall down, or they like to use them to play peek-a-boo. All in all, a great toy.
