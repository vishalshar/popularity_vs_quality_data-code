We were having so much trouble getting sleep while tending to our newborn's needs and this product really saved the day.  This has worked great for us because it attaches onto our bed and I can put him into it after he falls asleep with minimal effort.  I also feel better when I leave him laying next to me because the sleeper is there in case he all the sudden starts rolling.  Little guy is 10 weeks now and we haven't had any issues.You should know that you can't just slide baby over into this because the bottom is not level with your mattress.  You have to pick baby up and set him down, but at least you aren't getting up.  It comes with a sheet that fits tight with velcro and I really don't think there is any problem with this sheet... when I was looking at reviews I found a lot of negative comments about the sheets, but honestly your baby isn't going to know that it isn't 400 thread count.  I wish I would have bought an extra sheet because when we wash the sheet it's inconvenient to not have a spare.  I won't buy one now because the baby is almost outgrowing the sleeper.I really like having our little guy so close because I can check him out by just lifting my head.  It's very reassuring for me and my husband to have him close to us.The instructions for assembly aren't terribly detailed but it is pretty easy to assemble and disassemble.  There is a trick to it that you really have to kick those bottom bars to get them firmly locked.The price on this one is very affordable but it is not cheaply made.  It is a well constructed item.
