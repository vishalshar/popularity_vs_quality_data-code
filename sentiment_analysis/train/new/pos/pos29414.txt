We upgraded all beds in our household to non-toxic ones (in Europe you can't even sell mattresses that sell here because the fire retardant chemicals are much more controlled/outlawed), and the kids got two of the Naturepedics.  They are comfy, waterproof (food grade polyethylene cover), don't off-gas or smell at all, and very well made.  I couldn't be more pleased.  In case you don't know, fire retardants have been PROVEN in New Zealand to cause SIDS and if you co-sleep, please get an organic bed with no fire retardants!
