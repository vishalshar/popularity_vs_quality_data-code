This is perfect for toddlers who are careful enough to hold it without spilling but also interested in the novel design (about 2 yrs. old+)! My almost 3 yr. old has not tired of the fun design after using it for a year and loves to snack from it on walks and in the car.  I thinks it's the perfect size; not too small as others have commented -- it is a SNACK ball after all! It fits great in my diaper bag -- you can always grab it in an over-stuffed bag, and it never lets crumbs out! My 1 yr. old loves it, too, although I of course can't give it to her unattended (but even snack traps are no match for a determined baby!). I have 4 and am buying 2 more since I'm constantly using them. The added bonus of this container is that you have a spur-of-the-moment toy for when you're waiting with the kids somewhere and need a diversion... DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.
