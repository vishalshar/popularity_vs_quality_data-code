This is a great gate for the price.  I bought it for less then $30 although amazon loves to switch prices.  Even so, I really liked it.  I researched all the different gates that expanded to 60" and landed on this one.The Good:  It was easy to attach (this has hardware so be prepared to make holes in your walls)  I don't extend it all the way for my opening, probably only to 50 to 55 but it's  sturdy at that length  I like the top part that protects my little one from hurting himself if he tries to  crawl over (he hasn't yet)  Color is neutral, swings both ways, and can be opened from left or right side.  Easy to remove and put away from time to time if needed. Good investmentThe Bad:  The latch system is hard to use.  But I did read the reviews, so I bought this knowing  that. So it takes 8 second instead of 3 to properly close it, not a big deal.  I just  rest it on the floor and my baby doesn't mess with it when I'm not in the kitchen.Tips: I never measured, I just made sure that since it goes from floor to carpet it was high enough to open easy enough without dragging.I definitely recommend this product and would buy it again.  My sister did after she saw it at my house.
