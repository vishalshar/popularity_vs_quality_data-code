I don't have the words to say how much I loved this stroller.  It literally went with me everywhere.  Even to the beach.  The wheels made it possible to use on rocky roads and flat areas.  And it fit perfectly in the trunk of my car.  I cannot say any more.  I absolutely loved it and was sad to see it go.
