We tried the Halo sleep sack, Stage 1 SwaddleMe and Woombie, and this is our favorite now. Halo was great, but our baby quickly outgrew. Stage 1 SwaddleMe made it difficult to breastfeed and I didn't like how it falls off if you try to let your baby's arms out for a feeding. Our baby just didn't really like Woombie and it was hard to get him back in it in the middle of the night because one arm would fall out while trying to quickly get the other in and safely zip it.Only complaint on the SwaddleMe wrap sack is that the Velcro is a bit loud if you're trying to wrap while baby is sleeping.
