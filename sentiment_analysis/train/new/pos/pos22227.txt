It is a really nice and thick frame, measuring almost 1/2" thick. It is 7.5" tall and 5.5" wide. The sides are covered with a shiny reflective metal, along with the dress, while the face of the frame is a matte silver, with a somewhat shiny swirls. The lady's body and the word "Baby Bump" are done in a somewhat shiny black, that makes it stand out very nicely. The word "Baby Bump" is also indented which helps with the overall look. The back of the frame is covered with the typical black velvet, along with the leg stand (so you can prop it standing up) and with a mounted hook (if you'd rather hang it). All in all I am very pleased with this frame it looks really nice, and of good quality. I can't wait to put my little one's ultrasound picture in it asap.
