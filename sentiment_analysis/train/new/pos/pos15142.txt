This thing is a lifesaver.  I know, it's just a car adapter but I can't tell you how many times I have struggled with batteries which die quickly or a manual pump while traveling.  With this vehicle adapter my pumps works just as well as it does at home and I can quickly express milk on the go.  This is by far the best purchase I have made all year!  Even if you don't travel much this adapter will make life so convenient.  Now if I need to pump I can just do it, wherever whenever and I don't have to wait hours until I return home.  I have a Medela pump in style advanced.Please mark yes that you found my review helpful so that I know you enjoyed it.
