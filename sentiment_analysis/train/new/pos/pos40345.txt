I have owned this stroller for about a year now, and have used it to get through the airport at least 10 times with my now 16 month old and 3 year old.  It is a lifesaver.What I like about it:- Extremely easy to maneuver and can be steered with only one hand, which is important when I'm also pulling a suitcase.- Lightweight and compact.- Easy to fold/unfold (after some practice!)- Storage baskets.- Looks sharp.- Seats recline so kids can sleep.What I don't like about it:  Nothing, I love it, but here are some things to be aware of:- American Airlines doesn't allow gate checking of strollers over 20 lbs, and I've heard of people having problems gate checking this 22ish lb stroller.  I don't fly AA, but I've had no problems gate checking it with Delta, Southwest, or US Airways.- This is a great stroller for traveling and keeping in the car for errands, but I wouldn't recommend it for long walks or rougher terrain.
