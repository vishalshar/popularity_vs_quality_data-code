This set is the best utensil set for small hands. I've tried spoons that I used to feed my son (Munchkin and Oxo), and they are too long for him.Playtex is short with great ergonomics, and because it is easy to operate for my little guy he grabs it more often to eat by himself. Of course at the beginning he would take only 2-3 spoons of food, like yoghurt, and wanted me to feed him (faster way). Sometimes I use to show how to eat and it is very comfy even for me.I wish I could have it from when he was 1 year old or younger. I have to say though that I alway gave him a spoon just for him and with time he learn what to do with it, and now it's just easier.On the side note I have to say that fork is not very sharp, but enough to grab food. Also we use it several times every day and they still look like new.
