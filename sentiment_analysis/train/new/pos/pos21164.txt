This an an awesome little Booster for my Grandson.  He all of a sudden thought he was too big for a high chair and did not want to sit down to eat.  Now, he's a big boy and loves his big boy seat.  I love the straps, they are so easy to secure underneath and around the chair and the one to strap around him is strong enough to hold him but easy enough to buckle him in quick.  The non slip bottom keeps it exactly where I put it in the chair, it never slides.
