Shipped fast! I have the older version of this one which we love.so I bought this one for our other child's room because I couldn't find the older one anywhere. I love that I can hear everything from my child breathing and rolling over during the night or nap times.  Its very clear and love that the lights are on both sides (the older version only has lights on one side and has static but you can also still hear everything) fisher price is my favorite brand for the audio monitors!
