Our son is almost a year old and still loves it!Now he walks over, opens the tray and tries to climb in on his own. When he is getting cranky, I can just give him a bottle with his blanket, snap him in and he falls asleep with in minutes. It makes nap time so much easier.The motor does make a noise as the arm swings the seat back and forth but it isn't loud enough to disturb him, especially with Jack Johnson playing on it from my iPod.My husband's favorite feature is being able to snap his car seat in there when our son falls asleep in the car.When our son was just a few months old we were having difficulty getting him back to sleep in the middle of the night. My husband would take him for a quick ride in the car around the block to get him to sleep, then bring him in and sleep on the couch while our son continued to sleep in the swing. I'm sure it sounds silly, but after so many sleepless nights, you're very grateful for what you get!Overall, we recommend this swing to all of our newly expectant parents :-)
