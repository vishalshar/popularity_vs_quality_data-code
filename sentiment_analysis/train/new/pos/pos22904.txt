I purchased this stroller because my Maclaren Quest did not recline all the way.  I needed a stroller with added comfort when taking my son on vacation or trips to theme parks where he would have to be in his stroller for prolonged periods of time.  After much research, I decided upon the Si because it was lightweight with a big sun canopy and had an extended foot rest with a full reclining seat.For the most part I like this stroller because my Son Is able to take long naps in it when we are sight seeing or at amusement parks.  It is very easy to steer, fold and unfold.  the harness secures my son really well and the canopy can pull forward pretty far, shielding him from the sun on hot days. I also like that there is a cup holder provided and that the handle height is adjustable.The only things that I did not like are that the stroller when folded is not as compact as I thought, it is also a bit heavier that my Maclaren Quest.  The cup holder could also use improvement as it cannot hold a four ounce baby bottle securely.  It is perfect for adult beverages though.  The under cargo basket could also use improvement because it sometimes drags on the ground if too many items are placed in the basket.  Unlike that Maclaren basket which is very high off the ground and never has dragging issues.Inspite of these minor flaws, its still a very good/sturdy stroller overall and does its main duty which is to give my son a safe and comfortable ride.  It was a little on the pricier end though and very similar to the Chicco Light Way which is almost $100.00 cheaper.  I also have the Chicco Light Way which I had won in a raffle after I had purchased the Si and had I known of the light way any sooner, I probably would have saved the $100 and stuck with the Light Way instead as it virtually has a lot of the same features, with a more secure cup holder and also reclines as far as the Si.  The Light Way also folds more compactly than the Si.
