Some good friends of ours had a baby shower and had registered for this cheapy unbrella stroller that looked like it could fall apart at any time. So I went out on a limb and reserched unbrella strollers and found this one. I purchased it for them and had it sent to their house. They called us telling us how happy they were with the stroller. They actually took the one they registered for back saying that the jeep umbrella stroller was so much nicer to move, their baby preferred being in it, and it was a better height for both of them. Every time we are out there one of our friends are asking us about where we got it and that we can get them one when they have kids. It's going on my list for sure.
