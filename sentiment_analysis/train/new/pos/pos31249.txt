Awesome design. Great Quality.  Sorry to see some that have cracked (maybe a bad batch?).  I have two Bumbo Seats, and both have lasted through multiple baby uses, and passed down to us.  This toilet trainer is of the same high quality as the seats.  Maybe it is the type of cleaner used.  I use a very mild cleaner, non-toxic, organic and earthy!  Sometimes I just use plain water n a touch of soap, or just simply wipe the pee off.  My son started on the Bumbo TT at about 4 months old.  He is now 5 months old and sits by himself on the potty.  I put him there, of course.  To prevent the pee splatter, sit him back a little further, so that his "package" dangles.  Don't put him up close to the front of the seat.  Yes, pee may leak onto the seat, and the toilet seat, and yes, mom has to clean it up.  But my goodness!! --- we are training BABIES to pee and poop in the toilet.  Grown men can't even pee directly in the toilet, I know - I clean high dollar vacation rental homes and see the pee dribbles down every toilet, so it happens even without the Bumbo Toilet Trainer.  What is wonderful, since he poops in the toilet, I do not have to clean that nasty diaper mess that smashes all over his bottom and his "package".  I now use the tiniest bit of toilet paper and dab his back end.  That to me, is worth cleaning a little pee.  The greatest thing, my baby boy LOVES to go sit on the TT, and is giggly and happy when he is sitting on it.  It must be comfy, and he can touch his toes while he is using the potty.  Cute! :)  I highly recommend this for infants!! I highly recommend training your infant starting from 2 months old!!  Not sure how it will work for 1 yr or Toddler, as it seams small.
