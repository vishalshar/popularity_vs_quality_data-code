I bought this cup for my daughter (2).  In our brief experience, it was leakproof when the straw is closed, disassembles/reassembles easily for cleaning, and is easy to spot when dropped out of a wagon!  Handles are a plus since it doesn't roll far... It also keeps cool drinks cool for a little while which is great in summer.  It taught my daughter how to use a straw; she couldn't figure out with just a hard straw.Sounds great?The bad news is that my son (4, a borrower and a chewer) bit several holes in the straw after we had the cup only a few days.  He even bit off a small piece.  The cup is sold "everywhere" locally, but replacement straws are not.  Shipping/handling on a 2-pack of straws is exorbitant at online vendors I've checked.  We are retiring this cup for now and moving on to a popular "reuse/discard" style of cup with hard straws - they lack all of the above good features, but at least their straws are still usable after a chewer has been at them.Not recommended unless you have NO chewers in the family - or until replacement straws are available locally.
