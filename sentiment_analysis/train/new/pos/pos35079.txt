I bought this sort of out of desperation, as the one-size diapers we had from our son were still pretty stinky after stripping and washing multiple times, and our daughter was getting to the size where she should be wearing them instead of the newborn size ones. It took about 3 washes to get the stink out initially, but now it's gone and it's stayed gone! This detergent is absolutely necessary, in my opinion, and I'm sure we'll buy more once we use our current bottle up. I love that it rinses totally clean, is so easy to measure, and really doesn't take much to work.Edited to add: We've been using this detergent for about 9 months now. We use a regular laundry detergent for our first wash, and this for our second wash. It still works beautifully. I try not to buy it online as it is more expensive than in stores and I like to support local businesses (plus it is about $3-$4 cheaper to do that way), but it is really convenient to have it sent directly to me by Amazon.
