I've bought two of these crib sheets, but I use them unconventionally as covers for my dog's beds. This saves a lot of wear on the beds, and the crib sheets are easy to remove for washing. More importantly, they've held up well! The fabric has not ripped or shown significant signs of wear, even though they get substantial use and abuse. They are also very soft. If it holds up for my dog, then it will be more than satisfactory for your child. Yes, I know how that sounds, but you get the idea. What I'm saying is, these are good quality crib sheets!
