Our daughter just started crawling this week. Our 1987 original banister make me one nervous mommy! We received this quickly (2 days) and my husband installed it himself in less than 30 minutes. He did NOT have to drill any holes into the original wood banister. He did however drill a few holes into the wall to secure it at the end of the roll. He said it was "super easy" to use the hole punch that came with it and we don't mind the look of zip strips, so long as it keeps our babies safe these next few years!! I did not want to put up security netting as I've seen some come loose & sometimes more of a hazard with one in the home. The only unhappy resident is our cat as he can no longer jump through banister openings to run to his food bowl at meal time, lol too bad cat!
