This is a great umbrella stroller. I have owned it for about 10 months and use it several times week. It has held up well and been on several cross country flights. It folds up easily but does require two hands. It is lightweight and simple for me to lift. The basket underneath is small but adequate for snacks, diapers and a change of clothes. Overall, I am happy with this stroller and would highly recommend it to others.
