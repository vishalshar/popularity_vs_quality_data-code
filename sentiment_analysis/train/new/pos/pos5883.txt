I debated about getting this "toy" for over a year.  So glad I did, and will be getting another one once my 2nd son is a bit older.  It really is the perfect thing to put in a child's room for naps and bedtimes.  I got the Ladybug based on other reviews saying it was a newer model then the turtle.  I have no idea if the turtle is as good, but from what some reviews said the Turtle has a yellow setting which I guess you can't see reflected on the walls.  This ladybug has red, green and blue.  There is an option for rotating through each color, and that one is my favorite.  The red is a lower light level and would be best for if you are wanting a "night light" that wont over light the room.  The stars show up, but are dimmer in appearance.  The green and blue settings are brightest, but I find that the ladybug itself is also brighter, too bright for me to want as a night light in my son's room.  The alternating is great because it doesn't stay on either color that long.  It puts starts all over the room, not just on the ceiling.  I also love that it automatically turns off after 45 min.  There is no option to keep it on longer.  But for me, I like that.  I don't want it going all night.  Hope this review helps!!
