****UPDATE 8/27/08********  So we have had the seats for close to a year now and and still love them.  Both Gina and Jack are forward facing (14mo old now) and remain quite comfortable in them.  They are easy in, easy out and easy to adjust.  It took all of 10 minutes to unistall, move the shoulder straps to a new height and re-install the unit for my ever growing son.The twins went on a 6 hour drive and they did just fine (for the first 4) and started to get crabby the last 2.  I do not think that was due to the seats - any kid would get crabby after 4 hours in any carseat - they just wanted out to roam and stretch their lil' legs.The cup holders have not been replaced - kinda useless at their age (though I do see now why people prefer trays in fromt of the children.  They come in handy while sitting in a parking lot and all you have to keep the natives pacafied is cheerios and juice.  It is at that point I wish I had trays.  Oh well, still a great carseat for the money.  I would reccomend this to eveyone.***********oroiginal review below************This is a good seat for the money.  I was worried that the price would dictate functionality, but it has not.We have 9 month old twins, Jack and Gina.  My son is huge which is why we had to go "convertible" so soon.  I wanted to get the expensive car seats thinking that you get what you pay for, right?  Well at $250 to $300 a pop for twins and two cars (convertibles are not easy to move from one vehicle to another) we would be out $1,000 to $1,200 total.  OUCH!  So I saw previous reviews on this seat and thought for $69 each (I bought two for a total of $152 w/s+h) what do I have to loose.Fitting my child to the seat was quick and easy.  It was as simple as putting him in the seat, choosing the proper shoulder height slot and threading the straps accordingly.  It took all of five minutes to set up.Car installation itself was somewhat difficult due to the tight space between the plastic frame and seat fabric where you thread your seatbelt to secure the seat.  By somewhat difficult I mean the only comparison I have are the bases to car seats that are wide open and have ample access, so it may be a bit unfair to say difficult.  But none the less, not as easy.The seat fits fine in our little Saturn SL2 next to my daughters Graco car seat and base.  I am 6'3" and have to squeeze my knee under the steering wheel to get into the drivers seat, but once in it is comfortable enough for short trips (30 minutes or less).  I actually have more room with the convertible seat behind me that I do with the standard car seat.  In my full size pickup I have this seat along side a traditional car seat with base.  I have plenty of elbow room.In the few months we have been using this seat, my wife and I both enjoy how easy it is to use.  Our son straps in easily and quick.  The harness is snug and adjusts easily with one pull of the center adjusting strap.  Two clicks and my son is out of the seat and ready to be chauffeured (carried) to his destination.  He appears to be comfortable in the seat as he has not fussed on any trip we have taken to date (though he has not been in it longer than 1 hour).  So we are happy.I have come across some of the more expensive seats that other families use (and I see this one is priced at $180 now?  Is that right? Or did I get a smoking deal at $69?) and really do not see a difference worthy of the huge price gap.  I mean I thought a Beatrix would have been the way to go for safety and all, but after using this seat for a few months I am fully confident in its' ability to protect my son (and soon my daughter) just as well as the next one.  I honestly think for the price (if you can still get it at $69) it is a great seat.
