As far as I know, this only works with Baby Trend cars seats. It's not exactly the same as the one that came in the package deal with stroller and car seat but works just fine. It's been well worth the price for us  because the baby could travel in any one of 4 cars and strapping in a car seat takes a bit of work and time. The LATCH system in cars model year 2002 and newer (save a few European 2002 and 2003 models) makes install and removal of the base easier once you get the hang of it. The grandparents bought a couple of these too. Hopefully they have decent resale value...
