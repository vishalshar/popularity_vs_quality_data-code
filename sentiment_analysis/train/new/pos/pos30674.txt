It is a great mini co sleeper as it is easy for me to reach over and feel my little guy next to me in his own bed. BUT the version we got is pretty much exactly like a pack and play just skinnier and has a special side that is lower than the other. For easy parent access. The bed feels sturdy when set up, sometimes a little tricky to set up and take down as the locking mechanisms seem to stick a little sometimes. We even have the leg extensions & still have no worries about safety of the bed. The sheets for this bed are very particular and you must buy only the sheet designed for it. No other brands etc will fit.
