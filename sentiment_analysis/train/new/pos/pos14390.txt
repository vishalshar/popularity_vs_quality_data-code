This is my favorite blanket for my newborn daughter! When I had my son almost 4 years ago I got one of these Skip Hop plush blankets to go with his Treetop Friends crib bedding. I loved it so much that I got the giraffe print one when it came out. He is almost 4 years old now and still uses them because they are so soft and cozy. So when I found myself borrowing his blankets for my new baby girl I decided to get her one also. I was so disappointed to see that Skip Hop had discontinued them, but luckily I found a seller here on Amazon.com who still had some in stock, and it happened to be this adorable bird print. The velour side is so soft and cozy, and the knit side is pretty heavy so it provides a nice layer of warmth. The quality is great (our others have held up wonderfully and are still like new after almost 4 years) and it is the perfect size to wrap up a baby. It is a little small for a 3 or 4 year old but it's still snuggly enough that the size doesn't matter to my toddler. I'm sure my newest child will use hers for years as well.
