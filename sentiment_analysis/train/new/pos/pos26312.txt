Old fashioned diaper pins!  Booyah!  How cool is that?The only thing I could find wrong with them was that the locking mechanism was on the "wrong" side.  I mentioned this to my daughter and showed her the ones I used on her 23 years ago."Mom, the only difference is that the new diaper pins are left-handed.  I can actually =use= these particular pins much easier and not feel as though I was going to skewer myself."Well, whichever 'handed' they are, I just love them!  I gave these as a baby shower gift to someone who knows how to uses them....and who also knows that a diaper pin can hold together a ripped tent seam in a tornado.
