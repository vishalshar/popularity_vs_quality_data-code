Great stroller but even better customer service.We bought this a few months before the baby was born and didn't put it together.When baby was born we found the tires would not inflate right (bumps in the inner tube).Contacted the company and less than a week later I had two new inner tubes to put on.Worked like a charm and there was no hassle from the company about it at all.The car seat is easy to carry because of the awesome handle. The stroller is great for walking, jogging, or running.Great even off road on trails.The compartment on the underside is a little on the small side but still usable.
