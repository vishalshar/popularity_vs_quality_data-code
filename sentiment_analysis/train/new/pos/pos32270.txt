We bought this lamp for our son's playroom. We love the appearance and quality of the lamp. The lamp is well made and has quality materials. My only compliant is the lamp came with a High Efficiency light bulb. Personally, I don't like using HE light bulbs around my son since they contain small traces of mercury, and I've broken one before. I wish this lamp would come with an LED lightbulb, which do not contain mercury and aren't supposed to break as easily. I think that bulb choice would be safer to have in a children's lamp.
