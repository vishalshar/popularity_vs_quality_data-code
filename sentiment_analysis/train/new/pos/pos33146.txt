We used this chair with our son who is who is nearly 2 and 1/2 and likes to sit in a "big boy seat" now (but can still easily fit in this chair), but we now mainly use it for our nearly one year old daughter, but even our 3 year old uses this chair from time to time. I had a traditional high chair on wheels that folded up for 'out of the way' storage, but with so many little ones running around in our somewhat small house, I found I was picking that chair up off the floor more than anything. I bought this chair mostly because I needed something that wasn't pink for my son, but was surprised how much I love it. ~I love that it tilts back, so I could put my kids in it as infants to drink their bottles~I love that it is comfortable for a newborn infant or a 3 year old toddler~I love that it is portable (we take it outside and put in our lawn chairs or pop it in the car for trips to grandmas)~Cover is machine washable~Seat wipes cleanThe one MAJOR CON is that food OFTEN ends up beneath the chair, so it is between the chair and the seat, if you have upholstered chairs this could easily ruin them, so I recommend a seat protector of some sort or putting this on a wooden chair.I would buy this chair again, in a second, but it has held up so well I doubt I will ever need to
