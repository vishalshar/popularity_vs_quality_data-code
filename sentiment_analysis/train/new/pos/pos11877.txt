While cleaning the Graco carseat our toddler uses we lost a portion of the original Harness Tie. This affected our ability to buckle our little guy in safely, so we thought we would have to purchase a replacement part from Graco.However, before ordering, I decided to check Amazon.com, and to my surprise the exact Harness Tie was available for around $5, and actually was a little bit less than what Graco would have charged. Even the color matched.Since the Harness Tie qualified for Amazon Prime, I ordered right away, and within two days I had the tie in hand and on the carseat. It was a perfect match and I am a happy customer.
