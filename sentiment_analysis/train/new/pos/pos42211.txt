These have a ton of haters! I am surprised by how few people like them. Yes they are small in diameter and shallow, but surely people have a take and toss cup they can put in it. My kiddo is nearly 2. We don't use a traditional sippy as he is learning how to use a cup. We have lots of inexpensive plastic cups (think the crappy free ones from chucky cheese). I place some crackers in one and water in another. Suits our needs well. We do use a generic organizer on the back which holds adult sized cups and water bottles easily.
