This was perfect for winter.  We live in a very walkable area so we are outdoors a lot but stopping inside here and there.  This kept our daughter nice and warm but then you can unzip it a bit so they don't get overheated when you're inside a store.  It's very soft.  We used it on a Graco rear facing car seat but ONLY when the car seat was in the stroller.  We removed it when she was in the car.  Just like wearing a bulky winter coat while strapped into a car seat, I think it would be unsafe to have this on the seat while traveling in the car. We got the larger Bundle Me when she was a toddler and liked it as well.
