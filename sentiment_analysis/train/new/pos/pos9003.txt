I really like these and have been using them in our home for a couple years.I know they say they are flushable, but only if your lines to the sewer are in great, clean, smooth shape. Mine are a bit older, and I had some water issues recently ... turned out that when the plumber ran a line into the drain line to the sewer, he pulled back a clump of these wipes that had built up, not dissolved, and were blocking the line. Not wanting to quit using the wipes, however, I purchased a diaper pail to use for disposing of the wipes.They're great, but don't clog things up ...!
