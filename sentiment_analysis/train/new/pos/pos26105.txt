It's true this seat can go through batteries pretty quickly, but I think it's well worth it.  The Papasan Seat is built so that the baby is cradled perfectly and VERY well supported.  The gentle rocking and vibration calm her when she's fussy, and when she's happy this makes a very comfortable seat for her.I like that you can position the mobile where you want it too.  On many other seats the mobile or toy hangs too close to the baby's face and you can't move it.  It's also nice that it swings easily out of the way instead of having to remove it or work around it when putting baby in, taking her out or tending to her.The seat folds and sets up easily to take along with you too, so your baby always has her cozy seat to make her feel at ease wherever she goes.
