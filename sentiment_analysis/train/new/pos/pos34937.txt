I liked this diaper more than I initially thought I would.  For reference the BabyKicks Basic was my first experience with a side-snapping diaper and I've been cloth diapering for 5 years over 3 children.  First of all, this is a very trim diaper and I don't know any cloth diaper mom who doesn't appreciate that.  I also found it pretty absorbent, I mean I wouldn't use it for overnight but my daughter was in this for a nap for over 3 hours once and didn't leak.  The color I ordered (Meadow) was also nice and vibrant.The downside to this diaper are that it is a smaller one-size and I could see how this may not fit chubby baby legs as well.  I personally liked the fit I got on my daughter but all the same I could see where others might not.  Also it's a shame there aren't many color options or any prints period.Overall I really liked this diaper and if I didn't already have a full stash, I would definitely add more.  The price is very good, the quality was nice and it worked, to put it simply.  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable pocket diaper.
