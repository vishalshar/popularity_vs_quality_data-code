We purchased this changing pad after doing some research on our own.  We love the three-sided contoured edges, and the size fit our delta changing table with no problems.  The straps are a big plus also, though our table also has straps, so we will probably end up using those.  I also purchased a Basic Comfort Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover - Sage, and this cover fits just fine.  We were glad to see that a regular cover would fit this pad.  The pad is soft and comfortable, and had no smell when we removed it from the packaging.  We are going to purchase a second one for use downstairs.  I definitely recommend this product.ps. shipped quickly too!
