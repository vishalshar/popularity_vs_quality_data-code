In terms of size, I prefer these over A&A bibs.  The A&A bibs are way too big on my 5 month old.  I don't like seeing the bib cover his whole chest.  Btw, he is in the 50 percentile for length.  The tag states these are for 0 to 6 months.  I want to order more, but might not since the neck part is starting to look snug.  I still prefer these bibs over others.  I also want to mention that we have been using these for a month and notice that these don't stain like the carter's teething bibs.
