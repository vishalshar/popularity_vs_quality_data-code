Our son was 4 months old when we got this.  At the time, he was about 27.5 inches and 22 lbs, so we got a size 'M' for him according to the sizing chart.  It fit him perfectly! So I would say, definitely go by the baby's measurements so that you get the right size  as opposed to the 'month' sizing.Appearance wise, this is gender neutral being off white. It's cute, and also super soft to the touch - love it!  It's very lightweight, and warm for those cold winter nights! We keep our house around 71 deg, so with that, I usually dress my son in a long sleeved cotton bodysuit under this sack, and this keeps him warm at night.  Being an active infant, I'm really pleased with the fact that there is a lot of leg room at the bottom for him to move around in.In terms of washing, definitely follow the instructions.  After all the washes I've done, it still feels like how it was when we first bought it!I definitely would recommend this sleep sack for places with cold winter nights!
