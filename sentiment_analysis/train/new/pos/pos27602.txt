I bought this pump in 2008 and used it for 2 children (each breastfed for one year) and it is still going strong!With our first child, the pump was completely foreign to us. I did a lot of research and while my hospital supports the Medela, we selected this pump based off reviews.  As a full-time working mom, I needed a pump that would be efficient and quiet.  This pump exceeded my expectations.  It typically only took me 25 minutes (including cleaning the pump) before I was back to work.  My favorite part is the control on the bottle attachment.  I love that I can adjust the speed and length of suck easily.  The pump comes with some replacement part and honestly, even after 2 years of use, I have yet to need to replace anything!  I wasn't a huge fan of the gray bags (they fit a small and large bottle) but learned to transfer my milk into milk storage bags (love the gerber brand!) and then place those freezer bags in the gray bag and it worked fine.  The comfort breast shields make the pump comfortable too.  I can honestly say I never had any discomfort using the pump ( and trust me, I had some issues with getting comfortable nursing).The only down fall is if the bottles aren't completely full, they don't stand on their own.  I learned that the hard way as I had a few ounces of milk spill (which lead to many tears for a new mom), but now I ust made sure I don't leave the bottles unless they were completely stable.I love this pump.  It definitely gets 5 stars from this working mom!
