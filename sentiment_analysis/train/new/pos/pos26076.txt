every pregnant lady should get this great for pregnancy and for baby carrier down the road.This is a review for the combination of the Fleece layer and the panel zip in.I live in NY and Im due in March. With that said I needed a winter coat that would keep me warm and grow with me. I spent countless hours online and in maternity stores looking for quality winter coats. I found most store had nice looking jackets but they were not like my good quality jacket (currently a Columbia) I was almost at the point of going up on my search and buying a jacket a few sizes to big (ladies that is not a good look nor will it keep you warm as it will not fit properly)When a friend from Canada recommended this product I was immediately in Love and needed to have it.This panel and warmth layer allow you to continue to wear your favorite (read warm and cute) jacket from pre pregnancy days and wear it through your entire pregnancy. The best part is after you have the baby you can attach this back to your jacket and use it to cover the baby carrier if you plan on baby wearing. The only improvement I would make for the fit would be for the panel and fleece liner to come up about another inch to two inches higher near the neck- but that is not a deal breaker.I LOVE THIS product!
