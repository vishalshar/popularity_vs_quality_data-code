I am so impressed with this product I just can't say it enough. My 6 week old son, a very "active" baby was constantly kicking his blankets off (no swaddling for my little wrestler!) at night and getting up every 1 to 2 hours. He never acted really hungry so I finally drew the conclusion he must be uncomfortable. He can't stand Pj's with footies so I believed this would be a great solution to keep him ultra warm and snuggley.So, last night I stripped him down to his diaper and zipped him up! I can't believe how cute my little man looked. Well, I am happy to say for the first time he slept for 4 1/2 hours straight and woke up once to be nursed and then slept for 4 more hours! If you're breastfeeding you know this amount of time is like gold. I was astounded. Just goes to show you to trust your own parental instincts.  I firmly believe he slept so well because he stayed so warm and soft.If you have a baby that "What to Expect the First Year" calls an "ACTIVE Baby" then this product is a must!!! I'm happy to say we're both in a better mood today.
