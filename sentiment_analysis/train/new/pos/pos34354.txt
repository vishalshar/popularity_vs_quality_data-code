I am a first time expectant mother and like most excited moms-to-be, I read pretty much all of the reviews on every item I need to register for or buy for baby. However, the helpful hint I have to give comes from my other half who already has a son and has used a wipe warmer. He said the wipe warmers that heat from the bottom up (heat ALL of the wipes) are a waste of money because by the time you get to the bottom wipes....they are dried out from being continuously reheated. They basically lose their moisture which defeats the purpose of a wipe in the first place and you end up throwing a bunch of them out without the benefit of using them first. We opted to go with this one because it seems to be smaller (more convenient for travel which we will do a fair amount of) and it heats just the first few wipes which is usually all you need for a diaper change. Some mothers would say this is not really a necessary thing to have (after all, babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things were invented), but because our baby will be born during the winter, I thought this would have more use for us. I gave this product four stars because we haven't tried it yet....but just wanted to pass that helpful hint along to other mothers who are interested in practicality and saving money and hopefully not losing quality in the process.
