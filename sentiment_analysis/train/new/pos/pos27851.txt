This is Max's new blankie for the summer months, for the bottom of our bed!  We try and encourage him to stay on his own "blankie"; however, somehow, he seems to end up planted up against one of us several times in the night!!  The theory here is, his old blankie was too hot and heavy weight.  Now this one will encourage him to stay down on his section of the bed!!  We Shall see!!  LOL
