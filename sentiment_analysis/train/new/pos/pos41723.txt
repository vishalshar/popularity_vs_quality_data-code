I have lots of baby spoons.  I have to say, The Gerber Graduates Rest Easy Spoons in Assorted Colors, 5-count, Sold by: Amazon.com LLC., are my favorites.  These spoons are really great.  They have a "spoon rest" on the bottom of each spoon. This prevents the spoon from actually touching the surface below it.  I love not having to worry about picking up germs off the table.  It is also really great to not have to wipe baby food off the table. The spoons have a very soft flat tip.  This makes it easier to "swipe" the food off the little ones face.  They are  BPA-free.  They are also dishwasher safe.  The bright colors make them attractive.
