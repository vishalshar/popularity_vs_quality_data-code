We checked our Vista on an airplane trip, and arrived at the other end to find that one of the wheels had been smashed by the baggage handlers.  We ordered these with express shipping, and they saved our vacation. Since we only had one damaged wheel, we now have a spare. They exactly match the wheels that came with our 2012 red Vista.
