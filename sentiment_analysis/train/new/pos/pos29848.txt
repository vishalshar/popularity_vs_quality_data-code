I bought this crib 5 years ago. I love how easy it was to put together. I assembled it while 7 months pregnant and alone while my husband was on a business trip and I was in extreme nesting mode and thought the baby would come early. My daughter loved her crib from the first day! She used this crib everyday until she was 4 years old. She is a very petite little girl so she could have stayed in this crib until she was at least 6/7 years old. When she turned 3 we took the front panel off and she used it as a daybed of sorts. She loved her "cribbie" and I'm happy with my purchase. I used a rolling storage container underneath the crib to store extra blankets and bedding under. The dust ruffle covered the view of it and you would never know it was under there. It was very easy to drop the crib when baby gets bigger. Easy to place baby down without waking. I'm keeping it just in case we have another! Very comparable to those over expensive cribs. Looks stunning!
