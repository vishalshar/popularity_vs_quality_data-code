My baby sleeps with his blanket every night. He loves to cuddle, and I feel good about him cuddling up with this as I'm very paranoid about letting him have anything in his crib. It seems to be breathable, as I have tried to breathe through it to test it out and it was fine. He fusses all night if it's not next to him. He also holds it all day and likes to chew on the satin ribbon around the outside of the blanket. I think it feels good on his gums as he is teething like crazy. It gets washed all the time and holds up well, too. He is now 7 months, but has been using it since around 5 (would have tried it sooner had I known his love for it).The only thing is that fibers/strings come off on the ribbon part. Maybe the blanket part underneath the ribbon is fraying, but the fuzz/string/fibers keep coming thru. After pulling them out for some time, I feel like it's better now, but it was kinda annoying. However, the sleep and happiness these bring to my son is worth it, hence 5 stars. My daughter did not like hers, so it is not for everyone, but she also doesn't like blankets in general.
