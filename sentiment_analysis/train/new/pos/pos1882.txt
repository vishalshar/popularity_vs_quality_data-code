These travel pillowcases work very well with my new travel pillow I purchased. At first, I thought the cases were a little large until they were laundered and now they are a perfect fit.  The only thing I have to say is that it would be nice to be able to purchase these travel pillowcases in satin or silk--a different fabric would be nice.  Otherwise given the choices--these pillowcases work well!!
