I bought this potty for my 2 year old little girl for potty train. She is a little tall for her age and this potty was just about perfect. We bought the boy's version 6 years ago for my son. The cushion was soft so I don't have to worry about him hurting his little boy part accidentally. I did notice the problem some people complained about the cushion sucking in pees and water. We removed the potty cover totally and every time he used it I will clean the cushion and dry it with cloth. All in all it is easy to clean and after one year the cushion wears out but my son by then can easily use the adult toilet. We could not give it away due to the condition of the cushion. That is why I gave a 4 star. I ordered the pink one and surprised to find that they replaced the original cushion with the hard foam made material still the same shape. Not sure how long the cushion will last but for now everyone is happy.
