We bought this toy for our 4.5-month-old baby, thinking she would enjoy it when she was older - but she loved it from the moment she saw it. She's played with it constantly since then - one of the only toys we haven't had to rotate because she gets bored easily. Now at 8 months old, she still loves it. Each stuffed sea creature has a different (quiet) sound - a crinkle, a gentle rattle, a tinkling bell, a squeak - and my daughter loves exploring the sounds, trying to grasp each one, exploring different shapes, and putting them in and out of the soft aquarium. It's also a cute, small toy that isn't loud or ugly in your room. We love this toy. It's my favorite - and hers!
