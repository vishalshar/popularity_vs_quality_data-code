I had a feeling that this would be a purchase that would be worth the money and one that we wouldn't regret and at only a week old, it has proven itself to be invaluable! Where should I start? Well, upon arrival and putting it together, I found that the instructions were horrible and some of the "pre-assembled" parts were put together wrong which made the instructions make absolutely no sense. Once I figured out that the pre-assembled parts were put together backwards, it went together pretty smoothly. Both this item and our pack and play have a vibrating mechanism that is just too harsh and powerful for a little baby to find pleasing so we have never really used those features. Speaking of that, the swinging part runs off a power cord and the vibrating part runs off a battery and the process of getting to and changing that battery is actually quite difficult, and i'm pretty mechanically inclined. Overall, it looks super comfy and I wish there was a grown-up version of this thing. Our 1-week old loves it and I actually have to keep him out of it because he goes right to sleep in it and we need to keep him awake as much as possible during the day so he sleeps good at night. The volume on the music and nature sounds doesn't go low enough. I wish it could be a notch or two more quiet. It has several speeds but we keep it at 2-3. The fabric has a nice soft plush feel. There are straps to keep your baby secure but our little guy is so tiny that we haven't used them. Overall, this is an awesome product and everyone should have one. We were actually going to move it to the bedroom because at this point, it is one of the only places our little baby will sleep. Anyways, this is a great purchase at a great price and you won't be disappointed.
