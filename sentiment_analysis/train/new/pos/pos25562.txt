Yes, they are very, very small... The largest cutter is about 2 1/2" long and about 1 1/2" at the widest point... the smallest cutter is about 1 1/2"  long and about 1 1/4" at the widest point.  I plan to make some very small shortbread cookies, so I will use the largest one.  They would be very cute decorations tied onto baby shower gift.  Honestly, they probably are too small for cookie cutting, but I still believe they could be creatively useful.  Using them for cheese or thin sliced fruit would very "Springy"...
