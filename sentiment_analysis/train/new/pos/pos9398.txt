I live in a townhouse with a very small kitchen/dining area, and I was absolutely dreading getting a large, bulky high chair.  When I found this, I was excited because it appeared to have all the features I was looking for in a full-size chair, but would not take up extra space because it could fit onto one of my existing dining chairs.  This chair has lived up to every thing it claims to be.  My 5.5 month old sits very comfortably in it, and the recline feature is helpful since she is still relatively young.  The tray is dishwasher safe, which has proved to be a very useful feature.  I highly recommend this chair to anyone with limited space who is looking for a good, affordable high chair.
