We used these bags recently for a trip to Disney with our 1 and 3 year old.  I loved their size!  They held absolutely everything I needed with room to spare, including changes of clothes, rain gear, sunscreen, snacks, and a small lunch box.  In fact, some days I didn't take all of those things, and was able to use only one bag.The only annoying things about these bags is that they: 1)make the stroller wider than I am accustomed to, so I end up knocking things with the bags (my fault, then, more so than the bag), and 2) they are not easy to take on and off the stroller, as you have to thread little Velcro straps under the front seat onto the frame.  It would be nice if there was something you could semi-permanenly attach to the frame to allow for quickly attachment & removal of the bags. For our trip this turned out to be a pain as we were collapsing the stroller for tram rides and going through the bag check.All in all, I would totally recommend these if you are going to be using your Phil & Teds stroller for day trips.
