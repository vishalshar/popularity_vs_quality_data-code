We have had one "accident" on this pad and it worked great. It stopped the leak from getting through to the mattress. It can be a little tough to get it to stay in place while putting the sheet on top, but we expected that from a non-fitted pad.One tip - if you can, you should buy two of these. We have a layering approach. So on the mattress we have a pad, then sheet, then another pad, then another sheet. That way if there's a nighttime "accident" it's easy to remove the top sheet and pad. You don't have to spend time in the middle of the night trying to get another sheet on the bed - and you're all set in case there's another leak.
