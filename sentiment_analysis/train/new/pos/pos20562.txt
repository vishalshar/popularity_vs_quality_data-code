I bought this kit twice. Once in 2010 and now last Christmas 2014. My daughter has her 1st Christmas hand print and I was determined to have the same for my son. Thanks to Amazon and this seller I have the same kit as I got 4yrs ago! Its a bit tricky to use but I was also doing hand print of a 8month old. Pretty sure no matter what I used it would be difficult. After 8 tries we got a decent handprint.  It will live on our tree every year just like his sister's. I love this product and highly recommend it!
