You may be wondering that.Most of the other Medela pumps have little nubs that you attach the tubing to, and that's how the pumping action works.  The air is sucked through the tubes, into the shield, and there you go.The Symphony is a "hospital grade" breast pump, but what's more, it's also safe for sharing, which is why some workplaces have them.  Instead of having air sucked directly through the machine, it has these two pistons at the top, and those pistons, as they go up and down, are responsible for the suction.  But to convert an up and down piston motion into sucking, you need a special attachment.  THAT's what's specific to this kit vs the other medela kits that might  include tubing and shields and bottles.  If you don't have those attachments, you cannot connect to the symphony, end of story.So this is a good kit.  But you only need one like this since the Symphony specific parts do not get dirty and don't need to be washed really.  Once you have this, if you want more shields and bottles, you can buy one of many other medela kits that don't include the extra symphony parts.That said, this kit includes everything you need to pump with the symphony.  You don't need anything else.  But as an aside it does not include nipples for the bottles.  Not that it needs to - just saying if you are buying this kit to grab and go somewhere and then want to give the bottles for feeding, you need nipples for the bottles or you need other bottles.  Aside from that, this includes everything you need and you don't need anything more.If you are buying this to pump at work, I would highly recommend the medela quick clean wipes, which lets you clean all the pumping parts without a sink - just a quick wipe down, so you can toss them back into your bag and be good to go.  http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Clean-Breastpump-Accessory-Wipes/dp/B000CCXLNE
