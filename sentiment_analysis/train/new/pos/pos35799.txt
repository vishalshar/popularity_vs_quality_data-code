This mesh bumper is way better than I expected. I feel like the picture doesn't do it justice.We ordered this for our 4 month old son who has gotten very active while sleeping and for the past few weeks has been waking in the night upset with hands, feet, even his face in the crib slats. When I pulled this from the packaging, I expected a thin barrier to simply block him from getting stuck. But this also has a nice, soft layer of padding much thicker than I would have guessed from the picture.I thought a mesh bumper would look unattractive with his crib bedding, but it's actually pretty cute. Our sheets, bed skirt, and crib are all from Pottery Barn and I actually love how this all looks together. My son is now sleeping better at night and doesn't wake up with red marks on his head or lodged awkwardly in the slats. He looks so cozy in there too. Just love this product!
