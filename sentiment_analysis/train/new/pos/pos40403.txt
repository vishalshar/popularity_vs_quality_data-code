I regularly use these diapers.  They are my husband's favorite diapers, so we've purchased more.  We also use Bum Genius 3.0 as a one size cover with prefolds snappied inside.What sets these diapers apart from others is the material and construction.  I absolutely love the Aplix.  It is nice to touch and not scratchy.  I also like the elastic on the legs and back. It does a very good job of containing leaks without binding my baby's chubby legs.  The Bum Genius tend to leave marks.  The cover colors selection is limited, but I like the really saturated colors.  I'm not a pastel kind of person.  My least favorite part of the construction is the soaker pad.  I find that this pad tends to leak more than if you just placed a prefold inside and they cost a lot more than a prefold.  I only have to change the Bum Genius "cover" if my son has a particularly large *ahem* but the Gro Baby covers need to be changed regularly. Also, the doubler which is sewn on seems pointless and adds a lot of bulk and rough edges.  However, they still work well enough and I use them regularly.I think right now this system is as close to ideal for a one size diapering system that we have.  If they streamlined and improved the snap in soaker pad, I wouldn't use any other diaper.
