We reviewed a lot of changing tables prior to purchasing one for the main level of our home.  This seemed to really fit the bill.  It is nicely made and looks nice enough along with our other dark wood furniture, not to mention it was a great price!  The assembly was very easy and we have already loaded down the shelves with diapers and all the necessary diaper changing tools.  Also, worth mentioning: the changing pad that it comes with is pretty bad(as most other reviewers note) so we ended up tossing it.  We replaced it with a standard contoured changing pad that fit perfectly in the top section of the changer.  I know some changers have room at the end of the changing pad for a diaper caddy...but this one is perfectly made to fit only the changing pad.  For us, that is my preference.  So far, this has been a great purchase and I would recommend the product to others!
