I got this during my pregnancy after much research! I knew I wanted to breastfeed, but being my first pregnancy - I wasn't sure what to expect. I ended up bringing this pillow with me to the hospital when I delivered. Since the hospital was so pro-breastfeeding, the nurses were there to answer any questions. So my first question was, can I use my pillow? They were so impressed by the pillow and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread and after seeing me easily feed my twins at the same time - they were asking for details to refer other moms to it! My twins are now 4 months old and still use this pillow. The privacy cover came in handy when the family visited for Thanksgiving. So I could feed them in the living room with everyone and not have to go in the back room isolated. Also, as newborns, they were able to take their naps right on the pillow surrounding me. I loved that! The fabric is super soft and smooth, easy to wash, and cute! You can also use this one at a time for different breastfeeding holds. Overall, amazing pillow!
