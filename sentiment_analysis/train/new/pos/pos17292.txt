Around 10 months old, my son suddenly began to refuse his bottle.  He similarly screamed and pushed away anything resembling a bottle nipple, straw, or nozzle of a sippy cup.  We tried everything, concerned that he was getting dehydrated during the hot summer days.  Finally we found the Vital Baby cup.  While the stage 2 lid is designed for older toddlers, it was our salvation.  It was a bit messy at first, but over time he got the hang of it and transitioned from us helping him with it to using it independently.  It is so wonderful now that we have a toddler capable of using an open cup!  The design is excellent so the lid always screws on so that the handles are positioned correctly for the opening in the lid.  The Stage 2 lid reminds me of a disposable coffee cup, with two small open slots.  We actually tried these kind of cups with my son later when we were traveling, but found that the plastic lids were too flexible - he just bit down on them and basically closed off the holes.  This is a wonderful product for babies who don't respond well to sippy cups or older toddlers learning to use an open cup!
