I bought this sandbox kit about a month ago.  After reading the reviews, I was skeptical about the quality of the hardware.  Maybe the company has changed what they use, but the hinges we received are definitely sturdier than tin.  They seem to be very thin stainless steel.  I felt no need to replace them.  The kit was easy to build; everything fit together just as it was meant to.  I used hand tools to assemble everything, as the cedar is so soft that I was afraid my drill would strip out the screw holes easily.  My kids, ages 8 and 6, fit in the sandbox together with plenty of room to dig and play.  I appreciate that this sandbox has no bottom because my kids wanted the sand to be deep enough to dig tunnels.  I leveled the ground under the sandbox, left a large foundation around the edges, and dug out the ground in the center for 2.5 to 3 feet to make the sand very deep.  We have had a lot of rain over the last month and the sandbox is still in great shape.  The benches are a nice feature, and the cover keeps my cats out of the sand.  My kids absolutely love it!
