My daughter is bringing baby grandson to stay and she supplements his breast milk with bottles. I decided that rather than get a big stand upon which to dry the bottles that I would get this because it is not huge and it can fit into a microwave very easily. (not a small one though). I did not want him to be around new germs so sterilizing seems like a good way to do this. It is well made and instructions for use very easy. Bottles I ordered fit well
