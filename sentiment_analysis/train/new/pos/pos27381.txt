For those who complain about other Chewy Tubes falling apart, this is the one you want.  Made to stand up to adult chewing, it's soft enough to not hurt teeth but durable enough to last awhile.  You do have to replace them after awhile, but not nearly as quickly as the others.  We have a couple of users in our developmentally delayed classroom, and they just love them.  Calms them, soothes them, and they seem to have a lot of fun with it.  Perfect for use with sensory-motor therapy, speech therapy, autism, and those who just need to chew.
