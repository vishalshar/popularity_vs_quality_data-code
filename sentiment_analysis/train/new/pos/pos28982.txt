I've used a Moby since my son's birth (now two months old and 13 pounds). When he started fussing about being in it I started looking into other options (I really looked). I love the Boba wrap!The Boba is easier to put on and wear because of the stretch in the material that is not found in the Moby fabric (which I can anticipate that there will be wearing situations where less stretch might be preferred). Because you wrap it tight there is no wrapping and re-wrapping as in the Moby. The stretch allows me to bounce my colicky two month old without straining my back and arms. I can nestle his head without him protesting due to feeling restricted. The Boba is shorter, not as long, and not as heavy. When I take my son out the fabric retains its shape so I can easily place him back without re-wrapping. When I took my son out of the Moby I was left trying to manage my son with ropes of loose fabric sliding off my shoulders (plus it is just not very flattering). The Boba's stretch keeps the fabric nice and snug against me. Because the Boba is less and lighter fabric I can wear it under my winter coat while driving without feeling like the Michelin man. Even though the Boba is not as long as the Moby I am left with longer tails to tie the wrap in the front due to the stretch. With the Moby I barely had enough fabric to allow a front tie (I am a size 14) and I never liked the feeling of a knot against my back while sitting in a chair or driving. The Boba's knot is smaller and softer which I imagine is more comfortable for my son - the Moby knot was bulky and hard against my son's bottom. And as an added bonus - the Boba has a better price.With as this said, I plan on keeping my Moby in case there is a situation where I need fabric with less stretch (like summer hiking or as my son gets heavier). But as a first purchase, I highly recommend that you go for the Boba!
