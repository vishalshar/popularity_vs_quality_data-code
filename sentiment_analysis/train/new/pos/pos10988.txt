I bought a used contours stroller so it did not have this come with it so I ordered this to go with my brand new Safety 1st air support 35 infant car seat since it says that it is compatible with that car seat. The car seat fits into it great without any movement so I really am glad I bought this.However, it is a little hard to tighten the red belt and mine did not come with the little red pockets for the straps as shown in the photo. Other than that I am really happy with it.
