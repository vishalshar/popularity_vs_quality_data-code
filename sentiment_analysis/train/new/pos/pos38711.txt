We own several of the Medibag 117 Piece kits - I keep one in each vehicle, one in the house, and I've told many of my friends they need to get one for themselves. This is not one of those emergency type kits with a raincoat, solar blanket, etc...so keep that in mind. This is however fabulous for families. My kids know when they get a cut or scrape they need to grab the MediBag and head over to mom. When we use something, I replace it right away so the kit is always full. There is only one cold compress, and one burn cream, but there's plenty of room to add your own and make the kit "fuller". This is a great deal and it helps keep all the essentials in a central location.
