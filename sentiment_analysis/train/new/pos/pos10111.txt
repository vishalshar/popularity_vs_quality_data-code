I've searched high and low for the perfect straw cup. Countless options I've tried have leaked, and almost every single one seems to have the same problem: when it's taken out of the fridge, the temperature change causes pressure inside of the cup, forcing liquid out through the straw. That's physics for you. If the cup doesn't have a valve, forget about it - it WILL come out of the straw. Even with a valve, it seems like no one can get the design right because I've tried bottle after bottle, with valves and without valves, and the same thing happens in all of them.Except for these.These are the first straw bottles I've tried that DO NOT have that problem - the valve on them is great! And with the way the top of the straw is designed, there is little to no spillage when the bottle gets knocked over. Granted - it took a while for my little one to figure out how to drink from it, but it ended up being a piece of cake.I highly recommend these bottles. If, like me, you're searching for a cup that you don't have to be extra-careful around (don't want to accidentally snag the straw top and fling liquid everywhere!), look no further: this is The Cup.
