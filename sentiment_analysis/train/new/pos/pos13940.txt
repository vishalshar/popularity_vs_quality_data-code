This puzzle has been very effective in keeping our two year old's attention and in challenging her. This is a learning puzzle and should be done with an adult. She empties the puzzle, then I give her two connected parts, and she places them where they belong. It is small, however I do not leave her to do it on her own. She has had fun with it so far and I would buy again. Good price. Good learning tool. Also it shipped fairly quickly, about two weeks, and I believe it is coming from outside the United States.
