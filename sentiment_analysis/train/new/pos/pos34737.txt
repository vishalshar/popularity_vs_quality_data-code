I bought this gate for the bottom of my stairs, which has banisters on both sides.  I found it strange that the gate comes with 4 square banister adapters, but only 1 round adapter, however, I was able to install the gate pretty easily with just a little bit of improvisation.The gate opens and closes pretty easily, and I like that it can open up wider than a normal walk-through gate.
