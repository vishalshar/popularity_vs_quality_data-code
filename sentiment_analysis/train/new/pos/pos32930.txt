I have used these to clean bottles and kid cups for several years now. I started buying them on Amazon recently because the local stores changed to a different, wider model that doesn't seem to fit into anything properly.They are good brushes, the sponge works good enough as long as you remember it isn't a scour pad. Most importantly it fits into a good variety of bottles correctly so that it actually cleans them. This is helped by the sponge being square topped rather than rounded so that it can get into the bottom rim edges well (the rounded topped bottle brushes are useless in that respect).The negative part of the brush is that the foam of the sponge dries out over time. Because of this I replace the brush at least every three months if not sooner. This really isn't that much of a negative though, since sponges can harbor germs and mold it kind of acts as a gauge to measure the brushes "freshness". Besides for the price I think it is worth the safety factor of buying four a year.
