This is an excellent crib mattress.  It's vinyl covering makes keeping it clean very easy.  Being 2 sided, it offers different support for your baby as he/she grows.  My daughter has always been comfortable when she sleeps.  Excellent investment based on durability...you won't have to buy another for your next child.
