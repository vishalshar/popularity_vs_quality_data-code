Bought it for the case so that I can put other utensils for traveling with a 2yr old and a 6m old.  The actual utensils were nice and sturdy, the design was cute but I thought the travel case was too big for carrying just the spoon and fork but too small to carry 2 sets of utensils for each of my kids.  I wish I could have picked what color I wanted, that would have been an added bonus.
