I have only had this carrier for a couple of days and I am in love with it.  I will update this post in another month and write about durability, etc.  but for now lets just say that I will be spreading the word to all the moms in my community about this family owned business and hope I can help them grow.  I have owned many different types of carriers, and would have to say this is most comparable to an Ergo.  The material however is much softer.  It is not made of canvas, but rather cotton and mesh.  Regardless this does not compromise the sturdiness or functionality of the carrier.  LOVE the pockets and the fact that the pockets zip down to reveal breathable mesh fabric for hot summer days.  I have been looking and looking for something like this and thrilled to find it.  Very easy to put on and take off.  Love the hood and the fact that it snaps off.  Also very pleased to discover that I can already put my four and a half month old in this carrier quite comfortably without having to use any inserts, whereas with the ergo I really could not have done this until she was a bit older (six to seven months).  Highly recommend.
