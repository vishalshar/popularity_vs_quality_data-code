LOVE these HALO SleepSack wearable blankets!  We started using them when my son was three months old, as he decided he was done with swaddling.  We got him a a micro-fleece and cotton version.  It was winter, so mostly the micro-fleece (plus he was so tiny!).  That was size small.  Now, I just got our third size, the large, as my baby is a year old!  And yes, we LOVE these.  A couple of reasons: obviously, that he can safely wear a blanket.  But also because it keeps a blanket on his toes!  Also, the zipper starts at the top, so you zip it closed by pulling the zipper to the toe-area.  My mom asked if we've woken up to poo-flinging yet: nope! Not with the SleepSack!  He can't really get into his diaper, yet he can stand in his crib (though we don't like that!) and get around easily enough to turn over, stretch out, etc.  These really do leave them mobile.  For our second set, we also purchased the muslin cotton version.  It is much lighter- think pillowy burp-cloth material, and thin.  It was perfect for summer.  Love, love, LOVE.  And we'll be getting the next size up when it is time!Wash is super-easy: flip inside out, toss in with the rest of the laundry!  I do recommend having two on hand, as you'll need to wash one from time-to-time (spit up, etc.).  We use a set of thin pajamas underneath this, without socks in the summer (or when we use the thicker one) and with socks if we use the thinner material.  These are great, a great gift (because sizing is pretty easy). Highly recommend.
