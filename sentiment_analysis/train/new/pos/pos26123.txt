Love this! Much cuter for a girl than the traditional "baby on board" sign. But I had to buy a 2nd one, in less than a year, due to the plastic breaking and pulling apart from the suction cup. This is probably not a product flaw but I wanted to share anyway. When my daughter is not in the car I take the sign down off my window. I did that several times a week for about 6+ months and it finally broke. I may have pulled on it too hard but still...I expected it to hold up better. But, for the price and the overall cuteness I had to buy it again. Although if it breaks again I will probably not purchase another one.
