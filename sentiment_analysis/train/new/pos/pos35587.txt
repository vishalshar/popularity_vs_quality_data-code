Sippy Cup technology hasn't changed since the 50's and it hasn't needed to.  I searched these out amidst a sea of "fancy" cups and we've since bought over a dozen of them--we use at least 4-5 a day with our two kids.  They get dropped on the floor, food smeared all over them, etc.  We just throw them in the dishwasher (top rack--and an enclosed basket for the lids) and use them again and again.  And when they graduate from sippies, these work great as regular cups (handy since by then, several of your lids will probably have a crack in them).They won't last forever, and they don't have straws or flip-tops or negative vacuum pressure anti-spill technology, etc, etc...  but they're easy to use and more important, easy to clean!  Get one of those fancy cups if you need one.  But then get 20 of these.
