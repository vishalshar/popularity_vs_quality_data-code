I bought this with the hope that my son would get interested in the potty because it had Elmo on it.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well it is made.  This is the third potty chair I have purchased (I returned the other two).  Iis heavier plastic than the others.  It is easy to put together and take apart for cleaning.  The potty opening is larger than the others, so I am hoping there will be fewer times that I have to clean the entire chair after use.  The removable seat does fit the big toilet, so I don't have to purchase a second seat when he is ready to try the big toilet.  Lastly, Elmo is cute and says positive remarks when the kids push his hands.  This is worth the extra $10 over many of the others.
