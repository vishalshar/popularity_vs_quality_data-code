I love this lotion!  It smells wonderful, very sweet smelling, but not at all overpowering.  I love that it is all natural and organic too. It nourishes and moisturizes your skin without being greasy. It soaks into skin pretty quickly as well! I am a 26 year old woman and I love this lotion! Shipping was very fast, which is always a plus! I would recommend this lotion to friends w/o babies, friends and family with babies, it is that good! This would be a great gift for yourself or someone you know that likes cotton candy, or sweet smelling scents like the perfume "Pink Sugar" by: Aqualina for example, then give this lotion a try!
