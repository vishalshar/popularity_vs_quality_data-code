An innovative product! We found this product after my daughter's surgery.. I searched everywhere on the internet market for a product that accommodates for leaks from a Ureterostomy. I finally came across this, called the company from the hospital and the product was sent out right away!It is amazing how it keeps her dry all day around the stoma and incision protecting her skin. It lays on top of the diaper and Velcro's low on her waist behind her back. I often Velcro it while she is standing after positioning the soaker stopper and tab on the front of the diaper as it's a little difficult for me to Velcro while she is laying flat.When wearing the soaker stopper, her onesie stays dry and it means less changes of clothing throughout the day! Less changes of clothing=less laundry=happy mommy :)Not only is it an excellent product, but Melanie is also extremely helpful to speak to and genuinely cares that you are satisfied with the product.My only complaint is that the tab that is supposed to stick to the front of the diaper ripped off with the second wear. But with excellent, timely customer service, Melanie reassured me that this is a manufacturers defect and is sending us another one free of charge!!  Thank you Melaine! I will definitely be purchasing more soaker stoppers!
