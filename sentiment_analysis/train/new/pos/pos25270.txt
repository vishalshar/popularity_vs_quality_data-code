Item was received on time and in excellent condition!These are nice containers.  I got these because I got tired of paying for the snack packs of applesauce and fruit to pack in my lunch.  The snack packs are four ounces and expensive.  These are four and a half ounces and I can pack a weekâ€™s worth of applesauce and fruit at once and save a lot of money.  They fit in my lunch box fine and are easy to clean and reuse.  This was definitely a good purchase.  So go ahead and click the order button now, you will be glad you did.  Note: I purchased two packages of these to get a full week of both applesauce and fruit.As a consumer like you, I rely on honest reviews when I purchase items and only offer my genuine interpretation.
