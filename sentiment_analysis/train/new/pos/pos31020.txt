I love this clutch, except that the snap for the strap tends to unsnap frequently depending on how much you have in there. If I have a newer package of wipes, 3-4 size four diapers, and diaper cream in the inside and my (small) wallet and iPhone (in an otter box) in the pocket, I need to be careful how I hold the purse or it will unsnap and fall to the ground. Will it stop me from using it?  No!  I still love the small size and how easy it is to use to change diapers.  Also, despite the snap issue, it is really well made of nice quality materials (stain resistant outside, soft corduroy on the inside) and well stitched.
