Baby boy loves his ball-balls!I bought these for my nearly 2 year old boy. I like him having access to his milk throughout the day so I always buy insulated cups. These work great.The football cup likes to keep moisture inside between the two layers. I keep an eye out for anything weird going on in there but it seems to dry out if I leave it on the counter. It comes out of the dishwasher with beads of water inside though. The other two are perfect.Little man did have some training to do to learn how to sip from these differently styled rim. It was the perfect transition from hard spout to eventually a regular cup.The insert to prevent leaking is great. Easy to insert, easy to remove, can be hard to clean if the cup is left unattended (with milk!) but otherwise a breeze to clean.Overall I highly recommend these.
