Best baby wrap ever!  Goes on in two quick motions, not wrapping and tie and wrapping some more.  Drop that baby in and you're good to go.  Easy to breastfeed or just take a nap next to mom or dad.  Seems to reduce pressure on the legs that some carriers seem to create while you have a child in the carrier "dangling".  Clean up is easy, machine wash, easy peasy.  Easy to just wear and be ready for baby, even under a heavy coat in winter.
