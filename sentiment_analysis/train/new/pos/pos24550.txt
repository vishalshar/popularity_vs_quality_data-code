This works well for what it's intended for, which is occasional use. I use it when one of my breasts still feels to full after the baby eats.It's also good for short travel (a couple nights max). I wouldn't recommend this if you plan to use the pump multiple  times a day (e.g., at work). For that, a double electric breast pump is much more efficient. I took 1 star off because the little green thing that connects the pump and the breastshield is loose and will fall when you wash it. The product comes with an extra one in case you lose it, which I did within a week of buying it.
