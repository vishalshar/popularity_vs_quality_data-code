This cart cover is the best! I previously had bought another sort and was very difficult to use and didn't cover the sides of the cart.Love the color and super washable fabric. It is sewn together very well and Covers all sides of the cart.  It is large enough to fit large sizes cart as well. Nice safety harness both around the cart and on the inside for baby. It also has little pockets to hold toys,snacks, etc. for you or baby. Very pleased with this purchase. Only wished it had come with a carrying bag, but I use a cloth shopping bag for it.
