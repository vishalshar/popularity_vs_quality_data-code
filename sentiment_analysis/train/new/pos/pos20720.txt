I had been wanting to try side snaps, and I really wanted a RED diaper for my son!  This one fit the bill.  It was a little pricier than I wanted to spend, but I finally just gave in.It is so cute on him.  I love the inside being so very soft also!  I prepped it by washing three times, and then I put it on my son.  He wore it for around 3 hours, no leaks (which is what I normally change at).  I would like to try it at nighttime to see how good it REALLY is, but I will have to get a little braver before trying that.  Currently I always just use Kissa fitteds and Disana wool at night.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is how long it takes to stuff the pocket!  I would not want to own more than 2 or 3 of these for that reason.  The insert took forever to get flat and in place.  As another person mentioned it takes longer than other pockets to dry, but that is not a big deal to me really.The snaps are a little odd, but I am using it for a child about to turn 1.  From all I have read, that would be for if I was using it for a newborn, so I don't need to worry about that extra row of outward snaps!Try this dipe; I think you will like it!  Just don't make your whole stash up of them, as you will NOT like stuffing them!
