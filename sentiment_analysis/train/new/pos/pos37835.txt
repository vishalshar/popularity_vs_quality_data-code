I purchased these bowls because I wanted BPA-free products that I can use to transport food when we travel or eat out.  The bowls hold 8oz and the lids snap on with a click and are not flimsy at all.  I put them on the top shelf of the dishwasher and so far neither the lids or the bowls have changed form.  I make most of my own baby food.  I have two Boon Spoons which are great for purees but I use these bowls for thicker foods that I can't squeeze out of.  When my baby gets older, these will also be great to hold dry snacks in too.  Great product for the price, considering the Munchkin bowls are the same price without lids.  Highly recommend.Update:  After a few months these bowls continue to hold up well after being dropped many times by my 13mo old and washed many time in the dishwasher (upper rack.)  The lids still fit perfect and the seal is so tight you can put liquid foods in them or keep dry foods (like cheerios, crackers) from getting stale.  Great value!
