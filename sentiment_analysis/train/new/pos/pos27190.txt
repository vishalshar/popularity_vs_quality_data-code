I looked at lots of other walkers and read countless reviews before purchasing this one. It's great because it prevents your child from falling down the stairs or even leaving one room to go to another if you have a step up or down. So many other walkers had reviews that talked about the babies heels getting caught and ripped up, this walker was great and had no place for baby to get hurt. Easy to open & close and so convenient to take the piano top off so baby could have snacks or other toys on the tray. The adjustable volume was very nice also.
