I have tried 4-5 gates for use at the "Top of the stairs" and many of the failed miserably. If you have baseboards, or a railing, they just won't fit due to the insane mounting mechanisms they have come up for these. Many are flimsy, or (in the case of pressure gates) they have a bar that goes across the bottom which is an excellent way to trip and fall down the stairs.So, to the negative reviews. Simply put, They are doing it wrong.-- If you use the lock nuts properly, the bolts are not easily removed. At all.-- If you install the gate straight and level -- and use proper anchors for your specific installation, it is an EXCELLENT STURDY RELIABLE gate.-- Yes. You might need to spend a few bucks at a home improvement store to get better anchors. My Install was into Drywall with no studs. I used these: [...]-- The latch is complicated and high to make it hard for toddler to operate. If you think it is complicated. Good! That means it'll be a darn rubix cube for your kids.-- It's not hard to install. If you are not handy, that is fine. Find someone who is. No gate that is too easy to install is safe for use at the top of stairs.-- No, it doesn't auto-lock if you try to just slam it shut like many others. To me, this is a safety feature since I know my gate that does do this doen't always lock even tho it 'sounds like it does' .. This gate I have to consciously lock it, and it is obvios when it is, or isn't locked.Anyways, I don't care if you buy this gate or not. Just know the facts.
