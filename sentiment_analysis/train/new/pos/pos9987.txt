My son had this double sided toy in his crib all the way up until he started using it as a step to climb out of his crib...word to the wise! But for the non-climbing kids, this is a great toy that can either be used as a crib toy or for tummy time on the floor. It has several tags that they can pull on and explore, the mirror is great (reflection isn't too morphed) and the lullaby light up feature on the reverse side was also an unexpected bonus. I definitely plan to use this again for my newborn daughter when she transfers to the crib. Very versatile, cute looking animals and I love that it's gender neutral.
