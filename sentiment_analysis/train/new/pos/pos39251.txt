I love this hat for my daughter. Much warmer than a knit stocking cap. I wanted a matching hat/mittens/booties combo, but the matching jj cole booties don't look like they would be very cute or stay on very well. So I got the magnificent baby magnetic booties and mittens in the cream color and they match almost perfectly. I will say the hat fits more snug than I thought, and although someone in a previous review said that they cut out the elastic, I tried to cut it out but it's sewn in all the way around. I'll probably go ahead and purchase the next size up for this winter.
