After finally deciding to use cloth diapers we started to do some research. Alva Baby seemed to be the highest rated and reasonably priced pocket diaper on the market. We placed an order directly through the website, but got a little impatient. I found these on Amazon and chose to pay a little more to get them sooner. We are SO PLEASED with these diapers. They're cute, comfy for my little guys tush, and easy on the wallet! Since these come with extra inserts, i suggest using two in each diaper if your child is a heavy wetter like mine. Just make sure to wash them before use with a good amount of detergent (don't buy into the cloth diaper/cloth safe detergent, just make sure your regular detergent doesn't have fabric softener) And dry them on hot. (inserts take at least an hour) We will definitely be buying plenty more of these! I highly suggest joining Fluff Love & CD Science on facebook. They are a huge help when learning about cloth!
