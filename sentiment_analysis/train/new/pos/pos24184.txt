I researched a number of products and saw a few other products in action at the homes of friends. I purchased this product on the strength of the reviews on Amazon. Other reviewers have done an excellent job covering the product. I will focus this review on a few things that I did not readily find from the others:- The product is made of excellent quality tubular metal. This not makes it incredibly strong but light. This was important to me since our kids have been known to be rough on plastic items and bend or break them with ease- The few plastic components that are there are also excellent quality. They open easily and lock with a satisfying click!- The blue colored cover is high quality. Some other reviewers had noted that the cover was a bit thin. That is indeed true - it is thin. However it is made of strong material similar to that used to make luggage. The zipper fit easily and I was able to zip it up without trouble- The blue is much lighter than the photograph indicates on this site. However we wanted a lighter color to fit with the overall pastel and flower theme of our kids bedroom and this fits perfectly.- The packaging claims that you can fit this in 5 minutes. That is not true. A more realistic estimate is around 15 minutes. However it is true that absolutely no tools were required to assemble this and make it taut with the bed.By the way we have an IKEA Malm bed. To make this work on that bed, we purchased some plywood from Home Depot that I laid down on top of the slats. That gave it the flat base to easily place this product and have it be taut with the mattress. The downside to the Malm bed is that we cannot fold this down since the mechanism that allows it to fold is deep within the side well and inaccessible. However we are just glad to find something that worked.
