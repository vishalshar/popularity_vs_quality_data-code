My wife picked the Daniella line of nursery decor out a few months ago before our daughter was born, and originally only needed one of these, as the nursery only had a single window. However, shortly after completing the nursery, we decided to move. The new nursery had a double window, hence this second valence. Unnecessary story short, we liked the first one so much that we bought a second.
