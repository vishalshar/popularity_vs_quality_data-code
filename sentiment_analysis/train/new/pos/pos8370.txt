I live in Australia and upon finding out I was pregnant with my secound child, I was very annoyed at the range of double (tandom) prams we have a available. I looked online and found great reviews and decided this was the pram/stroller for me and my family.I LOVE IT!!! I had it shipped to Australia at a great price and after getting the pram itself for a great price from Amazon it actually worked out cheaper to buy it and have it shipped here then what I would have paid for one here, unbelievable. It is a bus and it does have some weight, but come on people we are talking about a double (tandom) pram/stroller here, of course it will be bigger and heavier than the average single. Im so in love with my pram/stroller I just love going out and using it! My toddler loves sitting in the front seat, he has not liked sitting in a pram since he could walk and I have struggled with either chasing him round the shops or having him in the stroller and being very distraught, since having this pram/stroller he loves it, he thinks he is so special (which he is) sitting at the front with his own little storage pocket, cup holder and snack holder, what more could he ask for? The hood over the back is great, awesome size and keeps Bubs well covered from the elements. I just can't say enough about this pram, its practical, stylish, and so easy to push, fold etc... LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT... I definately reccommend this product!
