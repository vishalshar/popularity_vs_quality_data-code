I think the price of $27 is excellent for this gate, which retails much higher at other stores.  The quality of the gate is excellent and it is very sturdy.  We use the gate at home at the bottom of the stairs and are very happy with it.  We remove the gate completely when we need to use the stairs (or climb over it).We can remove the gate easily with one hand, and it is quick to put back in place when we need it again.However, when we take it to visit the grandparents, it takes a few minutes to adjust the width to their doorframes.  There is a little button on the top and bottom of the gate that you have to push in to adjust the width, and on our gate I have to jiggle the buttons a bit to get them to push in, which is annoying, but tolerable for the small amount we use this gate for travel.The gate collapses very easily.  The sides fold in half inwards, with a similar type of action to the rails of a pack-n-play.  So the gate could be easily collapsed and put in a closet to get it out of the way if needed (and this wouldn't affect any width adjustments).All in all, I'm very happy with this gate.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's advertised as a travel gate, but is not so quick to adjust the width for different sized doorways.
