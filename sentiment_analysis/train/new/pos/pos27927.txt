Some things to consider...The packaging indicates that this is a 2-pack. Two straps are required to secure each piece of furniture and there are two straps in the package, so you're really getting 1 set. A little misleading, so I thought I'd share this with my fellow Amazon shoppers.As far as the installation goes, the instructions tell you to attach one end of the strap to the wall and the other to the furniture, and then connect them. It's not necessary to line up the brackets on the wall and the furniture; the important part is that you either locate a stud or use anchor/toggle bolts if you cannot locate a stud in the vicinity of where you're positioning the furniture. (The straps don't come with anchor bolts or instructions regarding their use, but this is a commonly used option that will secure almost anything to a wall.)One of the issues many people might run into is that most furniture items these days have a bead-board or other composite type backing that will not accommodate a 1.5 inch screw. To get around this, you like need to position the brackets on the top corners of the furniture (the "casing"), which will likely be either solid wood or something compressed that can accommodate the screw. There are four screw holes on the bracket; instructions say you must use at least two. In order to position the bracket so that you can securely use two screws, you may have part of the bracket showing. This didn't bother me, but I thought it'd be worth a mention if you're looking for perfect. In my case, I just want to know that my sometimes rowdy son can't topple the furniture onto himself and get hurt.I'm happy with this purchase, recommend it, and am buying again.
