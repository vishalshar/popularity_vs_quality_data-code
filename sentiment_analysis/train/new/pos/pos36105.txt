Before I received this pillow I hadn't been sleeping well. The first night I used it I slept great and woke up refreshed. The second and third nights my shoulders hurt so bad I thought about giving up on it.. But I did spend $75 on it and I couldn't send it back so I decided to keep trying different positions. I learned that it takes pressure off my shoulder if the curve of the pillow is right up against my neck. I also figured out that I like sleeping with it on one side better than the other. The last two nights I once again slept well and didn't wake up stiff. So if it doesn't work the first couple times keep trying it with different positions cause it does have a learning curve. Also the manufacturer measures this product at 77 inches total length. I've measured from curve to curve and it is 72 inches long. I am 5'10" and it works perfectly for me. We have a king sized bed and the size doesn't bother us. We have also slept in a queen with it and it wasn't that much of a issue. The pillow itself it a little rough and I don't like the way it feels but with the cover (which is included) its very comfortable. I have washed the cover two times already and haven't had a problem getting the pillow in and out of the case. I don't dry it because I am not sure if it will shrink and I don't want to take that risk. Overall I am happy with this pillow.
