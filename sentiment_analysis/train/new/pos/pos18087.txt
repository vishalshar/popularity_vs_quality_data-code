One day last year, my 5 year old grandson rushed into the room as I sat working on my laptop. Emergency, emergency, he announced loudly as a danced his old familiar gotta-go-potty dance. I calmly told him to go potty, meaning go to the bathroom like we always do. He informed me that he couldnâ€™t, someone was in both bathrooms.I hurriedly got the potty chair from our spare room and put it down for him to use. Wheew, that was close. Thank goodness we had not put the potty chair in storage like we intended to do many times. The potty chair saved the day. I bought this potty chair when he was 2 years old to help with his potty training. It did a great job then and, now it serves us well in case both bathrooms are occupied. Grandson has a place to go without having to try to wait until the bathrooms are available.This potty chair makes a handy back-up for older kids in case of emergency.I highly recommend it.
