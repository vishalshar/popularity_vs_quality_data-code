My baby peed EVERY SINGLE DIAPER CHANGE for almost 2 months and it was driving me crazy.  These teepees made me feel like I could do something about it, and contain the pee somewhat.  It didn't stop the pee from happening, but it helped keep it from shooting a foot in the air.  You still get pee everywhere, but it just gave me a sense of security and helped me stay sane.
