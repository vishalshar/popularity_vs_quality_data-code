Great bassinet at a great price. We had doubts that it might not work in our B Agile stroller, but it clicks right in, provided you recline the stroller the whole way first. Now, we no longer have anxiety about keeping baby in the car seat for to long. My only regret is not buying it sooner, since it can only be used until about 4 months. Do yourselves a favour and pick up this bassinet as soon as you've picked out your Britax stroller system. You won't regret it.
