I thought I would teach my 1 year old how to sleep with a blanket... Worst month of my life. I couldn't figure out why she was waking up at night since she has always been a good sleeper. She's been in SleepSacks since the day she came home (starting with the swaddle versions). She's a big kid and outgrew the bag style blankets very quickly. I thought the early walker was going to be too big, so that's why I decided to try the blanket. It finally dawned on me that she needed her sleepsack. I tried it for the first time 3 nights ago. The first 2 nights she woke up, but put herself back to sleep and last night she slept through the night. Hallelujah. I just ordered the light weight version for warmer nights.My daughter is 14 months. She wears 18mo clothes and my guess, she's 27lbs and 34" tall. The large fits fine. The blanket touches the floor when she's standing, but she can walk without tripping.
