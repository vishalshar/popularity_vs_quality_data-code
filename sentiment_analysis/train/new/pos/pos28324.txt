These are small cups perfect for kids.  My 6 and my 3 year old use them at dinner time.  I love that they are glass but have the silicone to protect them.  I have recently replaced all plastic cups and plates for my kids and switched to glass. The silicone cover does separate from the glass which makes it super easy to clean.  The silicone has raised dots and shapes on them for easy gripping.  This is a set of 2 for $12.95, definitely worth the price.  I actually want to buy another set but it is temporarily out of stock right now.
