I researched a number of bouncers and swings before buying the Magic Moments Learning Seat because my daughter is in a brace for hip dysplasia. This keeps her legs pointed out at an unusual angle, and she is also a large baby (over 16 pounds at 4 months). Because she cannot sit easily with the brace, I wanted something that could keep her entertained and would allow her to use her hands and play. This toy is excellent for her on all counts. The seat is wider and at an excellent angle for her, and because the activity board is removable, I don't have to worry about hitting her head like I do with the aquarium swing. Other bouncers I have looked at sit up too high and are too narrow. This one is at a good angle for play and for feeding. She also loves the vibration. I can also keep her seated in the chair for other types of play, such as propping her cloth books on her lap.The different settings for play are also great and allow for many variations. She loves to pull her blue fish and red bird - and I hit the foot pad for her occasionally, as she can't really use that feature.I highly recommend this product - it is well made, durable, and lots of fun. I can even get my head next to hers so she can see me in the mirror! It is not too loud - and the vibration factor isn't so high you can see her shaking! A nicely made toy. Thank you Leap Frog!
