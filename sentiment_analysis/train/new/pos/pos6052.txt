I got this blanket for my 18month old daughter, zebra print is out thing lol. And she loves it! She can't sleep without it or leave the house without it, it has become her security blanket or "super blankie" as it sounds when she says it! It held up great when washed, (and as any mom will understand with a security blanket that follows the child everywhere.. it has to be washed a lot!!) I am very happy with the product. And have already recomended it to friends.
