Bought the 3-pack of 6oz bottles. First off I'm a seasoned mom with 4 kids. Going to glass bottles was the best decision I've ever made. Of course evenflo was my go to as it was the only glass bottle sold in stores. Loved them but they are really heavy and I wanted something lighter. These bottles are much lighter and the nipple is wider than even flo but not as wide as avent-- somewhere inbetween there. I was surprised the 6oz bottles have the X hole in the nipples vs the standard single hole I'm accustomed to. I see they sell those though so I'll be buying some as the X is too quick of a flow for my 8 week old. Oh but did I mention how excited I was to see the even offer a 6oz bottle? So cute!
