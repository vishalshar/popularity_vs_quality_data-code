I had no idea that I would love this baby monitor set as much as I do.  I absolutely love that I can talk to my kids through the parent monitor.  The monitors themselves are fairly small and compact so they don't take up a lot of space.  I don't get a lot of feedback or static through the monitor and the sound is very clear.  This is the only problem I have with this set: the parent monitor can only be used with either rechargeable AAA batteries or the AC adaptor -- I haven't been able to use the batteries because I haven't found a charger for the batteries (the one I have says it charges AAA but they don't fit).  So, I just keep the monitor plugged in.
