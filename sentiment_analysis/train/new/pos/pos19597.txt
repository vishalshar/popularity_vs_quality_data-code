I would give this 5 stars but they don't have enough product description. There are actually three different liners from this company and this one is actually for a bigger car seat, like a convertible/toddler car seat. I didn't know and I ordered it for my infant car seat and it is too big. I made it work some how because I didn't want to hassle with returning and I know I will be using this for a toddler car seat in a couple of months anyways so I just kept it. It does the job and helps my baby say cool. I just hope someone who is going to buy this reads my review and get the right one.
