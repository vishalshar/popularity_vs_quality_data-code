As a mother of 3 kids, ranging in age from 4 to 15, I have gone through my share of the snot suckers, starting with the basic bulb which seemed to be the only product available when my 15 year old was a baby and then moving on to the Little Noses syringe bulb which seemed to be a bit better, then Graco battery-operated aspirator, and Nose Frida.  The bulb and the syringe were a complete nightmare where I literally had to sit on top of my kids to administer the procedure.  The Graco was fine to a certain point, when the nose is very little, and then, it does not have enough suction.  Nose Frida did the job, however, it took forever and made me feel like I was smoking hookah each time I had to do it, once, I did it in the very morning on an empty stomach and I think I literally cut off the oxygen supply to my brain, I became so dizzy, almost passed out, this thing requires a parent to have a serious set of lungs.  Finally, I overcame my fears and the feeling of weirdness of using vacuum for my baby's nose and bought the Baby Vac.  OMG, what a world of difference.  No more chasing the kid around the house, it's as simple as him sitting and watching cartoons while I do the procedure.  No more snot going down his throat, making him cough and wake up thousand times a night.  This thing is seriously amazing, and what a simple idea, how come it was not invented in America?  Why is this country so great at developing various drugs and drugging our kids with various decongestants, cough suppressants, fever reducers, don't even get me started on antibiotics when a simple thing like keeping their nose free of mucus does wonders?
