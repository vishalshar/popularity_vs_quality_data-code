I purchased these to go with the train set we already have. I love these "amazing animals" brand of toys. My suggestion is to purchase several of these when they are on mega sale and give as gifts. We now own the train set with extras, the barn set, the farming truck set and the ark, All are extremely durable and fun to play with.
