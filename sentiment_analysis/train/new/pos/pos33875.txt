Love love boogie wipes. At first my husband claimed that 'there is a wipe for everything' and I seem to find the most ridiculous thing to purchase. However, after a few snotty noses, he's convienced. I don't know why or how, boogie wipes seem to snag the snot and make it easier to wipe than tissues or baby wipes.Also the grape scent (much better than unscented or clean scent) seems to be a favorite. I think the interesting scent makes the boogie wiping tolerable for toddlers.
