It looks just like the pictures and is good quality.  Like mentioned before the sheet is a bit course and has gotten slightly better after washing.  There are several pieces to the set, but a few items will probably go unused such as the bumpers.  There are a few items included that are great decorations, but not necessarily useful, such as pillows.  Even if you only use a few items from the set the cost is still great compared to other crib bedding sets.  Very cute and you get a lot of items for the cost.  Worth it!
