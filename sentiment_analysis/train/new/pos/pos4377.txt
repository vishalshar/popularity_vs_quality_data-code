These mitts are super cute, colorful, but most of all practical. I've been using washcloths to bathe my 1 yr old and it was so difficult to wash his face due to his squirming. These mitts allowed me to wash quickly and effectively with ease...without him squirming. I didn't give it 5 stars b/c the suction cups don't stick which leaves me to find another place to dry the mitts. I bought two different kinds and also use them as puppets.
