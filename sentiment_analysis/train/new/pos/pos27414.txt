I purchased this electric mobile motor because I wanted my baby to enjoy falling asleep to his mobile without me disturbing him by cranking it every few minutes (the crank that came with my mobile is HORRIBLY loud and annoying). This motor is excellent! It's quiet and will run until turned off, so I can easily sneak into his room and turn it off after he's asleep. My only problem with this motor is the music box. I'm not a fan of a lot of the music boxes that come with baby gear, this one included. Please note, there is NOTHING wrong with the internal music box, I simply don't like it. So, I opened the box and clipped the wire that connected the music box to the speaker and now it's silent. My son's mobile is airplanes, and now they quietly fly around as he falls asleep - exactly what I wanted.
