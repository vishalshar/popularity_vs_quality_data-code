My girl loves Dora, she's 2.5, and has been very reluctant to sit on the other potty we bought for her. When we received this, she was excited to see Dora, and played around with it for a while. Now she is using it regularly, and I haven't had any real problems with it. The only improvement I would like to see is a better way for the rim to snap on to the trunk. It fits neatly over it, but my girl likes to take the whole thing apart and I wish she wouldn't. Other than that, it's been a success! I used it with the potty training stickers, and that has worked great.
