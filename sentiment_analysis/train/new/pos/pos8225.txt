I received this quickly (thanks, Amazon!) and it is soft and fits the Graco Pack-n-Play great. Adds a good amount of cushion to the thin little mattress. This will be great for when it begins to cool down in the autumn and baby wants to be cozy. However, I noticed a strong chemical smell coming from this item out of the bag. I washed it with several other baby bedding items and the smell seems to have transferred. I have let it drip dry per instructions and the odor seems to have abated somewhat. However, I will be washing it again before it goes anywhere near baby girl. I am a little disconcernted by a chemical smell coming off of baby bedding. The Graco Pack-n-Play itself had such a strong chemical smell that I set it up two months before my daughter was born to let it off gas. Is it because these items are being manufactured in China?? Anyone else have this problem?
