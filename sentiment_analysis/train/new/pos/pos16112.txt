After 2 months of 3 baths/showers per day it is like new. Our faucet has a pull-thing to turn shower on, near the wall end of the faucet. It slips easily over. To run the faucet for a bath I sometimes have to pull the cover upward, or the water runs down the tub wall. No big deal. I haven't had to reinflate. After 2 mos use I removed it and found a small amount of mildew in the inside creases. It washed easily with shower spray cleaner. I can deal with doing that every month or 2. Most important, my really active tub swimming son doesn't get hurt on the faucet.
