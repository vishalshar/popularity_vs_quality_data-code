I was a bit hesitant about buying this due to the price, but I am so glad I did. Absolutely NO regrets. I love that it connects to my carrier and is also a super comfy back pack. I was planning to use this only for when we go hiking or long zoo trips etc, but once I got it, I instantly switched to this from my old diaper bag. It holds so much and has lots of giant pockets. We cloth diaper which takes up quite a bit of space in the diaper bag and it holds everything we need. It's made from the same material as my ergo carrier. My carrier is ancient and heavily used and is holding up perfectly so I will assume/hope this will as well.
