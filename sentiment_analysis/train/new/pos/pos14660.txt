I was given this gift set at my baby shower. While my son has not taken to the rest of the gift basket, he loves the owl plush toy.  My niece came to visit and also enjoyed playing with her cousin's owl.  So much so that she brought it everywhere she went the whole weekend of her visit!! I think it is easy for little hands to grab and is very soft.  I just ordered my little niece her very own gift set for Christmas and I know she will love to have her own owl to play with! I just wish there was a way to order just the owl since the other items have not proven interesting to the babies!
