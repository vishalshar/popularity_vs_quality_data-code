Love these. They are going on close to 2 yrs and the backing is a little worse for wear since we've put them through a few hot dryer cycles and change out the two we have about 2-3 times a week. Unlike some other mattress pad, the back didn't melt, it just got rips/holes. Because it is thick terry, though, the rips have not affected the absorbency and we haven't had any leakage onto the mattress... though we dealt with leaked through diapers a few times a week which is why they have such frequent wear. It did take about half a year to have any wear and tear- and again, we did NOT do our best to treat them nicely.I bought them b/c I wanted the mattress to feel softer for our then baby and it was exactly what i got. I will be ordering more even though we no longer need the waterproof, i haven't found a review of a soft toddler bed mattress pad that doesn't have a backing that won't melt in the drier.
