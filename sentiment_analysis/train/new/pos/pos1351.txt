I really wanted another aquarium soother for my second child (my oldest loved using the Fisher-Price aquarium soother with real water, but the water evaporated after about a year, so we got rid of it), I but couldn't find one I liked.  So I decided to try this soother.  So far, so good.  We've used it the last few nights.  I like all the options.  It's on the lowest volume setting, which isn't exactly soft soft, but it's not too loud.  The colors, music, and lighting are soothing.  Pretty easy to attach to our crib - we have a convertible crib from the Metro collection by Bonavita, and the attachment apparatus fit fine.  I have no idea how long the music or light lasts, as I've only used this when the baby is really ready to go to sleep and so I haven't been back and forth to the nursery a lot.  The only negative so far is when on the motion function, the motion of the little bear rocking makes a slight creaking sound.  Maybe this will stop with more use.  In addition, when we received this from Amazon, the switches on the soother were turned on and the batteries were dead.  Luckily they weren't too hard to change.March 2013:  Just wanted to add that the music lasts a LONG time.  I haven't timed it, but it's got to be at least 15-20 minutes or more.  We are still very happy with this soother.
