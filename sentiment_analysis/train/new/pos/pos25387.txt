These were purchased as a gift. Fortunately the recipient wasn't to concerned about the packaging. Two out of the three boxes were damaged. If someone wanted to save them as a collectable, they would have lost value due to the original packaging being damaged.Despite the outer packaging/display box, the items were secured and protected.Individual items were functional and quality was better than expected. They felt sturdy and had a little weight to them.I was expecting cheap lightweight plastic figurines, with distorted voices.Overall Good stuff, I would've rated them as great if the boxes they came in were in better shape.
