I got this frame to give as gifts to some new moms in our church who were celebrating all their babies 1st birthdays. Let me just start with the price on this frame is amazing! Probably the selling point for me. The only thing that some might consider a drawback (it didn't bother me) is that it is plastic...not metal or ceramic like some of the more expensive frames. That being said...it came really well packaged and it really is a stylish frame for the occasion. It fits a 4x6 picture in it just for those who wanted to know. I would recommend this to anyone needing a simple, inexpensive, sweet gift to give for a 1st birthday.
