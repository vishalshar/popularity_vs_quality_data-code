I bought two of these - one 52x12 & 52x 6.  I posted a picture of the difference.  I like them both for different reasons.  One seems too small (it fits ok, it's just tight), and the other is too big (although it works just fine).  My son loves untying both of them (sigh).  He chews on both of them and they both do their job of protecting my crib.
