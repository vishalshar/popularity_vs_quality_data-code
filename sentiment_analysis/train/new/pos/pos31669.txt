My fiance and I were trying to find something tiny that our newborn daughter could hold onto and was the theme of a giraffe. I looked online and found this item, for once I found something that was cute and adorable made of a great soft fabric as well, that was not an elephant or puppy dog. lol Needless to say our daughter loves this item and needs to have it in her hands at all times when we go out. I would definitely recommend this item to any parent who wants something soft and different for their daughter.
