We initially registered for the Lambs & Ivy Zoofari bedding collection, but found this for more than half the price. While the materials aren't quite as soft, the pattern is still really cute and it meets our needs. It doesn't have as many matching accessories, but I've found the Zoofari pattern is close enough to be used with this one. For instance, I have the Zoofari rug, mobile and night light and it would take close inspection to know they weren't all from the same collection.Others have mentioned that the sheet isn't very soft and I'll agree with that. I have the sheet on the bed because it looks cute, but I use an Ultimate Crib Sheet on top of it anyway, so the softness isn't that much of an issue. For the price, this crib set is a great value and I would definitely recommend it.
