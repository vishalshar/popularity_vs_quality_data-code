So, I have checked the exact model number to substitute the adapter I have accidentally destroyed, and got this one.It works perfectly.Yep, it is not marked as Medela, but Medela makes pumps, not adapters. The original one was not marked as Medela either.And yes, you need to check the model number before getting the adapter, but what's so new about that??!!To sum up- does exactly what it is supposed to do. Great purchase!
