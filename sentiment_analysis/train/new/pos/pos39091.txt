Can't say enough good things about the pack in play. Set up was easy, and for the first couple weeks I was on the couch (due to a c-section) so we just left it in the living room and would wheel it right next to me. But when I started sleeping in the bedroom at night, we would move it from one room to another. It was sooo easy to break it down and set it right back up. Only thing my husband would complain about is it was wider then our doorway to the bedroom, so if he didn't get it through just right, he'd knock it against the wall. Didn't have a problem though after he got the hang of it. It's so great to cause it's a lot easier to use as a bassinet, and not have to purchase one. Looking forward to getting lots of use out it! Very highly recommended!
