I am so glad I read all the reviews before purchasing. I LOVE this stroller. I tried out a MacLaren at BRU and it is obvious people only buy them for the name.This stroller is much more than just the umbrella stroller I was looking for. It's sturdy enough I would've used it as my main stroller when my baby was smaller.The only flaw I can mention is that it doesn't just flop open. You can still manage to set it up with one hand{i.e. if you are holding baby with the other and don't HAVE two hands to set it up}, just not seamlessly.I think this stroller is worth every penny and I would recommend it to anyone. I have three boys and have been through as many strollers. This one is the best yet!
