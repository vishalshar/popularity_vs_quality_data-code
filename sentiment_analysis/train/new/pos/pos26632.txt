I ordered this just because it was coming from the same supplier that the suction thingy was from.  The suction thing is okay, but these tweezers are used all the time.  It does get those hard buggies out, and usually ends up dragging out a long gooey one with it!  I know, I know TMIThe only thing that could improve is the width.  There's no hinge or anything so the tweezers are set at about 1/4" apart, sometimes there is need for it to be wider so I have to use my pinky to spread them apart, slightly awkward especially holding a baby.
