I was surprised when these showed up today after reading some pretty happy reviews on here... These are single sided terry cloth. Just squares of fabric cut out and roughly (and badly) serged around the edges. Yeah, they are soft, but they are also tiny and feel like they won't hold up very long. And again, only fuzzy on one side!Very unhappy with this purchase, they look like something you'd pick up at the dollar store.Edit: After using these for 7 months I am surprisingly editing my review. These have held up and work very well, staying soft and the serging is not coming undone. My 4 yr old is using them too because she likes them better than our other cloths!
