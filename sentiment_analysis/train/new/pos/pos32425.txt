This is absolutely the best shaped potty out there for girls or boys. The saddle shape that the product description mentions enables little ones to feel very safe and secure. Unlike other potties it doesn't in any way leave indentations on their skin. I personally think that the all singing all dancing potties distract toddlers from what they are really meant to be doing, and confuse the message of potty training. Unless you have left potty training until very late, i.e. 3+, when they have the control but they just need incentive, anything other than a plain potty is just going to confuse the issue.I've had many friends really struggle with potty training because the potty they initially tried in was uncomfortable/felt unstable (particularly the Fisher Price frog potty - that potty is very high off the ground, very difficult for toddlers to feel balanced and relaxed on). I was lucky enough to be given one of these potties by a friend whose child had already potty trained. As soon as I put one of my twin girls onto this potty I could see why my friend and her little girl had loved it so much, they feel super safe and secure on it. To my surprise they both immediately did a wee in the potty! Had to then hide the one potty and await for this one to arrive from Amazon so we could start really potty training. The biggest help you can have in the potty training experience is if you can find a potty that your little one actually likes to sit on. This one may not look very exciting, but it is super comfy, so they will happily sit until something happens.The only other potty that I consider a sensible choice if you want your child to potty train smoothly is the Baby Bjorn potty chair, and I still think this potty has the edge on being a more comfortable to sit on since it is more curved, and comes in a little cheaper too, which adds up if your buying multiple potties.
