Due to crib mattresses being mostly firm this is a great addition to the baby's bed. I wouldn't use it until baby can hold his head up and roll over though. My baby didn't want to sleep in the crib and preferred the bed in a spare bedroom with a nice plush mattress. It made a difference to the crib mattress and solved the problem. Great quality. Perfect sizing , fits over the mattress without the need to stretch it.Definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a mattress pad for your little one.
