The wipes case is removable and slightly bigger than most portable cases. It does tear huggies wipes when dispensing...but lets face it...huggies wipes suck anyway! Works well with Kirkland wipes(Costco brand) or Pampers wipes. Everything else about the bag is great. I had a nice little mishap where one of my crumb snatchers popped a taco bell sauce packet and it splattered all over my brand new diaperbag...I wiped it off with a wipe and was suprised, it didn't leave a stain! I also love the large insulated "bottle" pocket. I breastfeed so I usually use this spot for a water bottle (it fits a full size 17oz bottle of water!) Lots of pockets and room inside. I have 5 kids so this bag is big enough for an extra set of summer clothes for the 2 little ones, a light blanket, a heavy blanket, 8 diapers, a changing pad (comes with bag), and pleanty of other small items like paci's and what not...there's room to spare.
