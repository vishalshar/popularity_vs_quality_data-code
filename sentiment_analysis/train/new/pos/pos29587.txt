I have been on a mission to replace my daughter's squirting duckies with bath toys that don't take in water. Frankly, I was tired of spending several minutes after her baths squeezing the ever-lovin' life out of them to keep the dreaded old water rot from growing inside. She doesn't even use the squirt function; they just take on water.So, the Boon duck: No squirting, no holes. It's a heavy BPA-free plastic that's somewhat soft. The texture is strangely tacky or sticky outside of the tub, making it seem perpetually dirty. Maybe this is a feature to encourage kids to bathe, since ducky is dirty?The duck is pretty large and heavy, which is fine for my 3-year old, but might be awkward for younger kids. While we haven't had issues with the paint smearing or coming off, but it seems like it might happen at any time. Colors integrated into the plastic would seem a better choice, but I know zilch about duckie manufacturing. The duck is already pricey, so changing its production method might push the price into the stratosphere.It floats nicely, and is a fun addition to the tub. My daughter likes playing with it out of the tub, too, so the duck is truly amphibious. I would buy the sets, because opening the Amazon box and finding a duckie is like Christmas for my daughter. She loves 'em. I just don't like the price.
