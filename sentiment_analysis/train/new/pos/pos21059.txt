I love love love this swing. My son used this swing every single day for at least his first year of life. Great for him to gently calm and fall asleep in!The bird is awesome! The lights are awesome! The music is awesome!My son was a big-boned baby so I can tell you it will hold a good amount of weight as well.My complaints: The one I got did not have a plug-in option. We went through a lot of batteries and batteries aren't cheap!I ended up giving this swing to a friend of mine when I was done with it. I actually miss it. They don't make them like this anymore! :-(
