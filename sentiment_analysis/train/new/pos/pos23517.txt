Great value for the price!! I bought this silky blanket for my one year old who absolutely loves it. He had several blankets with satin edges but didn't care for it much. He loves this one because one side is completely satin and much softer than the ones he had in the past (which were more expensive). The size is pretty big I was pleasantly surprised how big it was! Covers him completely it's the only blanket he needs at night during the warmer months. It's light material so not too heavy and hot either.The color is cute baby blue. It washes well, I have had it over 6 months and it's been through many washes and there is no sign of wear and tear or distressing. I would highly recommend this silky blanket for new mommies, both my boys sleep with their satin blankets every night!This would make a great baby shower gift or just to comfort your little one in the night!
