Love this little bag. We don't use it for diapers though. We use it to bring my son's bottles, snacks and food for the road when we go out of town. Super convenient. The only thing is that if liquid spills inside, clean it well right away. if you don't; with time wet corners will turn into mold and it will not come out. Learned the hard way. We had to purchased this one because that happened with the one we had before. It stank and it looked disgusting after a while. It was our fault because probably it wasn't made to be used for liquids and food.
