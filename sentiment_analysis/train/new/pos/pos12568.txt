Awesome alternative to a wubbanub! I love it because I can change out the pacifier regularly and keep it fresh without replacing the lovey too and upsetting my little one. The plushy is great quality too and super cute. I use it with the Avent Soothies and it's just like a Wubbanub only far more economical and convenient. A+
