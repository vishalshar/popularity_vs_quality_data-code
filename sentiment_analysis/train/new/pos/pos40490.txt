one shield...I somehow missed that when searching for it. I was looking for those compatible ones that come with an entire kit of 2 shields and all attachments - but I put these in my cart instead. I thought I was ordering 2 sets, but got 2 boxes of 1 shield. My fault totally. I opened it bc it was sealed all around with no option but to tear it open...one shield. Sigh. I kept them, but next time...
