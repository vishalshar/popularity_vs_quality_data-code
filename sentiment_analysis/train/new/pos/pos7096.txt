Just got this yesterday and boy do we love it. My 8 month old daughter LOVES the spoon, she eats better with it than any other one.I haven't tried yet to transport it in her diaper bag with food, but I always put it in a zip lock as well, so I don't imagine it will be a problem. Love it so much we are buying 3 more- 2 for us and one for a gift!
