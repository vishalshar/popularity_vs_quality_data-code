My son is formula-fed and has had poopie diapers that would put a chili-snarfing grown man to shame, and the diaper genie has handled them fine.  Although I will say I have to empty it twice a week or the smell does get to me.  But let's face it, we're talking about 8-10 wet or dirty diapers a day; if you only flushed your toilet twice a week with that much waste your bathroom would reek too.  I put a stick-up deodorizer in mine and that helps a little too when you open it to empty it.  We have a 4-story house (we live in Germany) and we have 2 of these, one on the first floor and one in the baby's room.  And the refill price doesn't bother me; my son is almost 3 months old and I just had to put in the first refill last week.
