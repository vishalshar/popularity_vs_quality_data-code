I highly recommend this carrier!! It is perfect for my 7 week old whom I've tried many carriers with! I have an Ergobaby that will be great for long trips when he is older, but this one isn't so bulky and fits him better as an infant. I've also tried many slings and they just seem SO uncomfortable with his poor little head squished and as a pediatric nurse I worry about his airway (neck) being closed off. It helps so much for my needy little man who wants to be held 24/7! I have actually been able to get some housework done because this carrier is easy to use and light enough to wear around home, but also supportive enough that Christmas shopping all day at the mall was a breeze! They were even nice enough to add a cute little toy that Jaxon wil love when he's a little older :)
