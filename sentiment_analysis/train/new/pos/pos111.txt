Our car was rear-ended yesterday.  Thankfully, as always, my two young daughters were safely strapped into their car seats, which happened to be a Britax Wizard and a Britax Boulevard.  My 1.5 year old actually slept through the crash, which was a miracle, and shows how securely the seat held her.  My 3.5 year old was startled, but in a few minutes was asking when the police officer would come so she could say hello.  She said that nothing hurt and she was fine.  I, on the other hand, who was only wearing the standard 3-point adult seatbelt, am now having neck and back pain.  My point is that the Britax seats are well worth the money.  They are expensive, heavy, and can be a pain to install rear-facing, but they are SAFE.  I am writing this because I am about to purchase two new seats to replace the ones that were in the crash.  Oh, and if you get into a crash, be sure to ask the insurance company about replacing the car seats.  They'll reimburse you - and if they don't, Britax will exchange the seats if the vehicle has frame damage.  You'll need to take pictures of the vehicle pre-repair, though.
