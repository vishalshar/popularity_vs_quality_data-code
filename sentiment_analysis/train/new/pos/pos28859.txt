I purchased the blue and silver version of this bag with my first child--a girl--in April of 2000.  I carried it for 4 years and then passed it along to my sister for her son and she carried it for 4 years.  At the birth of my son in May of 2009, I pulled the bag back out and began carring it again.  The bag has great storage, comfortable on the back, and has literally all the room you would need for a day trip to anywhere (it went to Disney World for a total of 18 days and countless trips to the zoo, beach, Baltimore and New York).  It has a great insulated pocket on the side that can hold 2 8-10oz playtex nursers.  The insulated compartment just ripped today--the bag is almost 10 years old!!!!  I am going to Babies-r-Us to purchase the lastest model of this bag tomorrow.  I think I originally paid $40 dollars for this bag so it cost me about $4 a year!!!  I think I more than got my money out of it!  (FYI, I purchased other bags thinking I might find something I liked better--some costing upwards of $100 and I ALWAYS came back to this one!)
