OK, so my 3 month old won't settle for anything in his mouth besides the breast, and when that's not available for non-nutritive sucking, he wants my index finger.  It started within hours of his birth.  OK, so it was my own fault.We've been on the quest for an acceptable replacement for my finger since we decided thatA: my finger goes to workB: my finger isn't always so cleanC: my finger is indeed attached to my arm and I am no contortionist for little babies who would love to fall asleep with it remaining firmly lodged in his mouth.Plus, who wants a pruney finger all the time?Anyway, we went through all the mainstream brands and he gagged and balked and screamed at almost all of them.  Then we started getting more exotic.  When we saw these beauties we were very hopeful, because they seemed to have a substantial sized nipple on them (he hates the small ones).These pacifiers are exceedingly well made.  I've now had the pleasure of handling more than my fair share of them since I've been on this quest.  The pacifier nipple is air filled and has some give to it, but a little springier than most others.  The rubber is very soft and pliable.  There is no odor to it.  It is easy for the baby to hold.So I have nothing but good things to say about this binky.  Too bad it isn't very high up on my son's list, but what does he know anyway.  We're not too upset about him not wanting a pacifier, and now that he found his hands he can give mine a break.Oh, and in case you see this same review twice, it is because we bought both sizes hoping one would be more pleasing to the boy.  So far he's had more interest in the smaller of the two.  This larger size is quite a bit larger, and while I know he will grow into it, it is a little overwhelming for now.
