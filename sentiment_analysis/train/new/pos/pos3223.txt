We bought our daughter a big-girl bed to graduate to after a crib.  This is perfect to go with a natural-colored wood bed, blending in so it looks like it belongs.  It's sturdy and doesn't bend out when my daughter leans on it.  We keep it pushed up against the headboard, leaving a gap at the foot of the bed for her to exit on her own with a step stool.  It's easy to move in and out when I have to change bedding.This bed rail can last through multiple kids.  Our younger daughter is now using it, after a couple years on our older daughter's bed.  I think it's excellent quality, and when used for more than one child, the cost doesn't seem exorbitant.
