I thought these would be a lot trickier, but once my husband and I tried them a few times and got the hang of it, we could take them off and put them on without thinking. The picture doesn't show it but one of the rounded edges has a piece of retractable light grey plastic on the inside of the curve that when pushed in (like against the cabinet knob), will NOT allow this to be unlocked, even when you're pushing in the little button on the bottom. I'm guessing some people weren't able to slide it open quite as easily because they were inadvertently pushing in that piece of plastic. I found that by pulling the lock a little so that the plastic wasn't being pressed in by the knob, it would unlock easily.We got these since our cats were always trying to get into the trash and make little messes, but we didn't want to have to install anything on the cabinet doors to prevent this. Within minutes after putting these on, we could hear our cats kind of pulling at the cabinets, but they weren't able to slide more then a little paw in the door. Problem 100% solved. Would recommend.
