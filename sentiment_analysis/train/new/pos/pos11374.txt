Oct 11, 2009:Don't buy this bag!!! (Note--I couldn't change the star rating) While the diapers are physically contained, this bag sweats and is damp on the exterior from the diapers after one day. I don't know if its just humidity or if it is urine that is soaking through, but this is not good enough! As I noted earlier, the PUL layer is very thin, so it just didn't do the job. I would like to return this, but I doubt they would refund after 1 month of use.Sept 8 2009:I like having a cloth liner for my pail instead of plastic garbage bags. I wash it with diapers (and let it airdry), so care is easy. So far, no leaks, although the PUL seems much thinner than on my diapers and on some other wetbags that i own, so i wonder how long it will hold out. So far (about 3 weeks) it works well as a pail liner (we have two to alternate while one is in the wash)--and the price was great!However, this bag isn't useful for travel. On a short weekend trip we needed a big wet bag to hold all the diapers till we got back--this bag was stinky by the end and you could smell it throughout the car. the other small wet bags I have hold in the diaper smell better--but those bags have zippers and a thicker PUL lining.
