I have been looking at the different elmo bedding sets for the past month and really didnt want to spend$70- $90 on toddler size bedding. However, last week I saw this set drop down to $27 and I am so thankful it did! Got it today, and the sheets were super soft even before I washed them. The colors are bright and I know my son is going to be ecstatic when he sees I am putting Elmo on his bed! I love how the fitted sheet (which is a vibrant green) has the end fitted so it will stay tucked in! Also the comforter is huge! When I bought the last bedding set for my son the comforter was about the same size as the toddler blankets he likes to carry around with him, this one I am confident will keep him completely covered!If you have a little one who loves Elmo (literally I am fixing to redo his room in all Elmo and Sesame Street he is so in love with it), this is a perfect bedding set!!
