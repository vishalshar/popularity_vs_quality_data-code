I love this little device!!! I like that it has different modes.  Since my week old boy is sleeping next to me in a co-sleeper bed for bi-hourly nursing through the night, the normal setting where the green light blinks with each breath is good for now.  But when his nightly nursings stretches out he will be sleeping in his crib in a separate bedroom. When that happens, I will use the other mode where each breath signals a little beep in addition to the green light (since I will be using an auditable monitor and not be able to see the light).  Of course it's not necessary to have a constant beep for breathing since an alarm will go off if he stops breathing for any reason. For some parents, the alarm may be comforting enough. But I like that this offers a little extra security for parents paranoid about SIDS and would just like that additional peace of mind that their baby is continuously breathing instead of just waiting for the main alarm after little one has already gone without breathing for many seconds. Each parent has their own comfort level.  This is the best device I know of for those extra anxious parents because of the multiple modes offered to actually know for sure your baby is breathing. It's so easy to use once accustomed to the settings (read manual fully) and portable. Make sure diaper is nice and snug after putting on so that it gets good contact with the baby's belly.  I clean it with a tiny dab of rubbing alcohol on a q-tip.  Will update if I start having any issues with this device. But so far, it's baby's new accessory that will go with him everywhere, even the carseat (prevents me from needing to look in the rear view mirror constantly to make sure his head didn't drop, suffocating his little windpipe).
