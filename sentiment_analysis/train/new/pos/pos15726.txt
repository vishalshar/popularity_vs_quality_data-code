I bought this as a baby shower gift for my nephew and his wife.  I bought early and was so happy with the set I couldn't wait until the shower to give it to them.  They absolutely love it and it really is a wonderful set for their nursery.  The quality is very good.  The valance wasn't quite wide enough but I was able to buy a valance separately right here on Amazon.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
