I've been using this monitor set for 10 weeks.  Mine look a little different; the parent monitors are round and have a rounded loop antenna instead of the kind that stick up. (See picture)  The monitors themselves work very well.  I was disappointed to discover that even though I had the parent unit plugged in, the batteries were still drained.  It wouldn't be a problem to just add the batteries when I needed the unit to be mobile if it weren't for the fact that you need a very small flat head screwdriver to open the battery compartment.  The inclusion of the AC adapters is very handy.  I leave one plugged in next to the bed at all times, so if I go for a nap I don't have to worry about it not being there or the batteries being dead.The only times I have heard interference was a few times when the microwave was on.  (The baby unit and parent units were at least 2 rooms away from the kitchen)  I like that the red lights on top light up according to how loud baby is being.  My son is very vocal, so I know if all the lights are on he is actually crying and not just playing.  The lights are very handy if you're watching tv, so you don't have to have the monitor on loud.  At night when everything is very quiet, I can hear a low hissing static noise from the parent unit no matter how low the setting is.  It's not a problem, just an observation (my mommy ears are probably too sensitive!)  I would order more for the grandparent's house, but with all the different styles shown in the pictures, I don't know what I would get.The baby unit doubles as a night light just by pushing on the front. Not enough to change a diaper by, but handy nonetheless.Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of this monitor.
