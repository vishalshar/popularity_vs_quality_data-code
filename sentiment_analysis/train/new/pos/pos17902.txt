Best baby carrier I've ever used. Still going strong after 2 kids. Our baby is very heavy (26 lbs at 14 months) and I can still carry him in this for extended periods of time with no pain. It's the only way to get him to sleep when we're not home, so we still use it regularly. Can't say enough good things about it. I recommend it for anyone having a baby.We actually used it for our newborn without any insert, just had him have his legs folded up like a froggy position because he liked being that way and it was easy for us. I also bought the teether covers and they were nice, but not necessary.
