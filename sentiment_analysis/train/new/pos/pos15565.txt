To be honest, I bought these solely based on how popular they are on Amazon and having no idea what to do with them.  First, I strung a bunch of them together into two strands and hung them from her bouncer's toy bar.  She loved the sound they would make as they hit together.  Then I noticed how handy they are at attaching things to other things, or in making items on the toy bars just a little more accessible until she could reach them on her own.  It's great for hanging something from her car seat handle to play with.  You can also use it to attach toys and teethers to belts, harnesses, trays, and other places where you want to give them toys, but don't want the toys ending up on the floor. Unlike toy straps, you can toss these in the dishwasher and they're nice and clean.  She also loves to just hold and chew on some of these rings, and is perfectly happy holding even just one. I'd say that as a mom to an infant, this is probably the greatest thing you didn't know you needed.
