the cups are great for the toddlers they do not spill at all and was a great way of transiting from bottle to cup. the texture of this cup made the going from bottle to cup so much easier.  they are very easy to clean and are dishwasher safe. I loved that there are many different colors to pick from and finding replacement nipples for these cups were easy. would definitely recommend to those parent's that are transiting there children from  bottle to cup or trying to find a great cup for there kids these munckin cups are the way to go
