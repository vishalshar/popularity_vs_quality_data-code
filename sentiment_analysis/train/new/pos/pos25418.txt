Crystal clear reception! We can almost hear the baby breathing! This was a steal for the price. The batteries wear out pretty quick on the parent adapter, but its not too much of an issue because you can also plug it in. The vibration function is a great addition if your outside mowing the lawn and can't hear, then the device vibrates when the baby makes a peep.
