I was very happy with this item. I love nursing covers for 1st time moms who aren't comfortable or proficient with nursing in public yet. This one is so pretty and gender neutral. You can peek down the top and have a clear view of baby nursing without anyone else seeing! I had been looking for one ever since my daughter got pregnant, but they were price prohibitive. This is a special you cannot miss if they still have any. TOP Quality by Eddie Bauer...
