If you don't want to watch the video but would still like to know what I have to say, here is what I covered in my video review:I have used this sling for 2 1/2 months, starting when my second child was three months old. I have washed it without any problems and my baby and I both love it!Pros:1. The adjustable "tail" stays neatly tucked into a loop.2. Adjustable sling fits both me (5'7") and my husband (6'4").3. Can be used by either left-handed and right-handed people (my husband and I are also opposite handed).4. My hands are free! I can take care of my 3-year-old and baby at the same time.5. Evenly distributes weight across shoulder and back.6. Comfortable for me and my baby. My baby has slept for 2 hours in this sling.7. You can fit in areas where a stroller can't.8. Great to wear while shopping and you can leave the carseat in the car.9. Small pocket on both sides of sling, so you have access to a pocket whether wearing the sling on your left or right shoulder.10. Though not recommended by the manufacturer, it can also hold other items where baby's legs are (i.e., burp cloth).11. Depending on size of child, sides can provide protection from the wind and sun.Cons:1. Baby can get really warm (not a con if it is cold, though).2. Can be difficult to pick items up from the ground, but not impossible (just bend at your knees).3. Can be tricky getting baby in and out of the sling until you get the hang of it.4. Can't see my feet very well (only an issue if uneven ground or stairs).
