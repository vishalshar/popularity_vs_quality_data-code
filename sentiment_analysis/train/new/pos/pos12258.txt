For nature loving, eco-friendly mamas like me this is a perfect, chemical free (for the most part) addition to your son or daughter's toy collection! It was smaller than I thought which is a good thing and has a very easy to grip trunk to hold on to. I haven't yet had a child shake it and hit themselves in the head with the leaves, but I would say that would be a definite possibility as the leaves are very large (almost the size of the trunk) and could hurt if a child were to hit themselves with it, but then again most toys would when shaken).Great toy overall, would buy again. There are a lot of places to suck on or chew, and it is very cute and sends a great message early on! Protecting nature but getting wooden toys, loving birds and trees :)
