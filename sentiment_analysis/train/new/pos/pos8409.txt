I've being using Fuzzibunz One Size since 2011 on my boy since he was 6 weeks old until 36 months when I started potty trainning and even though I didn't like that the button to regulate the elastic will leave marks on his legs, I thought they were good diapers...not crazy about it, I had to leave them a little loose because of the button so they would leak. Then my girl was born in 2013, so I decided to get another set for her and to my surprise they upgraded the diaper to the One Size Elite which I absolutely LOVE!. At the same time I contacted customer service to get more elastics for the first set of 18 that I purchased in 2011 (they were free thanks to the lifetime warranty), they also replaced 5 of the 18 diapers because the had loose snaps (thanks to my sons teeth). So then I had 18 one size, 5 NEW one size elite (replacement) and I purchased another 9 one size elite. The first great improvement of the One size Elite was the buttons situated now on the inside of the diaper not hurting my baby's legs anymore, the second one is that this diaper is so trim, definitely not as bulkier even using both inserts. I've being using it for 18 months and they look like new don't even need to change the elastics yet, Although I don't use the elastic in the back, just the ones on the legs. I use the dryer in low and I just started hanging them on this http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0001E839U?pc_redir=1404321797&robot_redir=1, I want to keep them nice.I have tried other diapers: bumgenious, softbums echo, softbums omni and they either leave marks, are bulkier or they just don't fit right. They all are very absorbent, with 2 babies on CD I've learned to size the diaper to not have leak problems, which I used to have. In my honest opinion this are great diapers and the lifetime warranty is great!.
