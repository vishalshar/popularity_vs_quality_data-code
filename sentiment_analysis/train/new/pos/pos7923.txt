Been using Gerber bottles for years, this is my third baby I'll be using the same brand. The bottles and nipples are a great alternative to the other pricier brands. The nipples don't leak unless squeezed and are easy to keep clean so long as you don't leave rancid milk bottles laying around. I do buy extra nipples because accidents happen and when baby gets in teeth, they get chewed on a lot. Highly recommend.
