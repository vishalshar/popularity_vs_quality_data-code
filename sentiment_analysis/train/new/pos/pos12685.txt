I love that these nesting cups are a thick plastic, perfectly sized for older infants and toddlers, and that the bottom bucket is also a small pail. They are beautiful, so I have no problem leaving them out in the living room, and my 20 month old is able to stack and nest them with ease. One of her favorite games is to hide a cup under another while creating a tower. These cups see a lot of action (daily play for over a year) in my house, but they are still in excellent condition. The yellow and blue cups have holes in the bottom to allow for sand and/or water play. Made in Germany. I am an early childhood educator and an extremely picky mother of two with a tendency toward minimalism, and as such I would highly recommend this toy.
