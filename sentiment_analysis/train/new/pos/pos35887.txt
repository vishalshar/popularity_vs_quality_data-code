For the price, you can't beat this little potty. I bought it for a vacation and had it shipped to my mom's house for my 3 year old. She is small and this little potty is perfect for her. It's low to the ground and easy for her to sit on but also sturdy enough that it's stable when she's on it. The inside comes out for easy cleaning. This is a great potty. Much better than some other cheapy ones I have from Ikea. This would especially be good for EC or for someone doing early potty learning because it's small. We had issues early on with my daughter actually falling into some other potty chairs when she was 18 months old. I wish I had this one then.
