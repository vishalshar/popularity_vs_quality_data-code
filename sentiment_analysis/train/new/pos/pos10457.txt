We are very happy with hot his seat. It may look funny, and too "toyish", but it is a very good seat for out very wiggly 1.5 year old.We bought before that another seat, made from fabric which we used only once, as it couldn't hold steady our baby. So we went and bought this one, and it was a success. It is easy to install, compact to deliver, and the most important, it holds the baby firmly.The food tray is also very good, as it is very stable and hold the food in place. We put it in the car, folded, and use it when we go to friends house for dinner/lunch. Before that we had to disassemble the high chair, take it in the car, install it, etc. This one just folds down to a very small package, so we leave in the car.Great product.
