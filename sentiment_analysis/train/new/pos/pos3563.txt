I have been cloth diapering my son ( 3mths) since he was 2 weeks old. I use the Osocozy indian prefolds, and i used the Thirsties diaper covers. Then my son outgrew the first size ( yes i know he's only 3 mnths, he's a moose) and while I really like the Thirsties, I do, I was curious about other diaper covers, so I thought I would give one of these a try. I absolutely love them, more than Thirsties I would say. The material stays dryer longer, and i thought all the snaps would be daunting, but they're not. The material seems to wash a lot better than the Thirsties too. I've ordered more and I'm a big fan.
