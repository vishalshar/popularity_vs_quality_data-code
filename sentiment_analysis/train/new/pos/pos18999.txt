When I was pregnant, I didn't think I would need a glider. I thought they were insanely ugly and didn't want to have it cluttering up my baby's room. But then my son was born, and he just had to be constantly held and moved or else he would cry.I was desperate to get a glider to make putting him to sleep easily. I found this one on Amazon, and the price was right. I was worried about the quality, as I had heard that the cheaper gliders we junk.But this glider is anything but junk. We've had it for 6 months now, and it silently glides for hours every day, nursing and putting my son to sleep. It is comfortable for me despite being on the tall side (5'10"). The microsuede fabric has held up well, and doesn't show milk or spitup stains.I love this chair!
