These hooks are great for the stroller (& really, a cart or anything where you can hang stuff for extra storage). They swivel a full 360 degrees and move up and down so that you can really adjust how you want something hung. The only tiny thing i don't like is that I can't get the straps to be wrapped as tight around the handle of the stroller as I want. But, it's probably the way that i'm fastening the velcro. I bought these for my best friend that just had her baby and she said it's one of the best gifts to get as a new mom.I also have the OXO stroller hook which is a bit more pricey. But, it has a rubber "base" between the hook and the velcro that help keep the hook in place on the stroller handle. The hook doesn't swivel around, it's pretty stationary, so I use this hook for anything that's a bit heavy (like my big mom purse, lol) and I use the Jeep hooks for smaller things like groceries and what not.
