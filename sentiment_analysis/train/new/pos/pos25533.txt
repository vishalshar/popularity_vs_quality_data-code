My husband thought I was nuts when I registered for this item, but 6 weeks after our baby was born, he is its biggest fan!  It attaches easily to the side of our bassinet and is easy to use.  The light is great...just bright enough so you can get a look at your baby in the middle of the night, but not too bright to wake the sleeping infant.  The sounds are soothing, ranging from heart beats to nursery tunes.  My baby loves the music the best and it always works to settle her down.  The heart beat sound works great to put her to sleep.  I also like that the music and light can be put on a time so that it will shut off after baby has had time to fall asleep and it can also be put on "noise" setting, to turn on when the baby makes noise.  The music does get alittle old (I swear I can hear it in my head when its not even on now) but the baby likes it, so that is all that matters.I absolutely love ths lullaby player.
