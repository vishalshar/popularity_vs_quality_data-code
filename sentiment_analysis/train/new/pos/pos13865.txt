My 15 month old son enjoys this toy very much when he takes a bath. I can't believe i was not about to buy it because of the reviews. But when i carefully read them I realized how ridiculous they were! For those who don't like it because there is no "hoop hole" must lack some common sense. Hello! get some scissors and cut a freakin hole! Anyway my son likes it withOUT the hole because it teaches him to put all his bath toys away in the basket. He loves putting them in and taking them out. And if he's happy, I'm happy! I rate this toy FIVE stars because it's simple, fun, and your child can enjoy their intire bath playing with that. So don't listen to the bad reviews because most of them talk about that silly hole! LMAO!
