I bought these sheets over a year and a half ago and have used them regularly ever since (I rotate them with the sheets that came with my toddler's bedroom set - when one set needs washing the other goes on his bed).  I have absolutely no complaints.  Up until recently my son was a pretty heavy wetter and would frequently soak through his diaper at night, so I've washed these sheets many, many times.  They still look like they did the day I got them and the stitching and elastic is holding up great.Yes, they do come out of the dryer a bit wrinkled (to be expected with cotton).  However, the fitted sheet fits tightly enough that most of the wrinkles are stretched out of it when it's put on the bed, and my toddler is completely and totally unconcerned that there are some wrinkles in the flat sheet and pillowcase.  If I really want his room to look nice for whatever reason, I pull his blanket up over the sheets and no one can tell the difference.No, they aren't 700 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets, but I find them reasonably soft.  They're as soft as the sheets that came with his bedding set (which cost far more than these did) and that's good enough for us.  I don't think that they're scratchy at all.I also appreciate that the flat sheet is fitted at the bottom.  We've had zero issues with his sheet getting tangled up and/or sliding off the bed.Overall, I'd highly recommend these sheets if you're looking for a simple but functional set of toddler bed sheets.  Five stars!
