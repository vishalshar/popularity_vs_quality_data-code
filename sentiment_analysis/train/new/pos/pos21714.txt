We got this to replace the Enfamil D-Vi-Sol product that is the standard you get at a pharmacy and it is perfect.  The Enfamil stuff is junk, just read the ingredient list and ask yourself why a newborn cares what color it is, what flavor it has and why the number one ingredient is glycerol, basically fake sugar.  Now the Ddops just has one thing other than the vitamin D, it uses refined coconut oil as the solution to put the vitamin in instead of glycerol. Nothing else, no fake color or flavoring, no ploysorbate 80 whatever that is, just coconut oil and Vitamin D.  And you just need one drop, not a huge eye dropper full to the brim.And for the size of the bottle, yes it does not come full.  If it did you would have a several year supply!  Remember the dose is one drop, not one ml like the others.  The packaging in several places states that this should not be full and just the bottom 1/4 or so should be, so as long as it is sealed you did not get a dud.And finally, if you are looking at this you are most likely doing it because you just want the vitamin, not the extra junk that just makes it look like you are giving a full dose, give this product a try.
