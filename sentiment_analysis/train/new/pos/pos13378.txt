I am an RN and a Nationally Certified Child Passenger Safety Technician (I work at Childrens' Hospital in OK) and want to point out that these are WONDERFUL booster seats.However, this is NOT an appropriate seat for any child below the age of 5-6 regardless of their weight/height.I realize on the product description that they say this item is approved for children as young as three. They need to change this immediately! Children as young as three are not physically or developmentally ready for a booster. They are likely to climb out, or unbuckle themselves, or move the shoulder strap behind their back which is very dangerous. (You will notice that all new cars that are manufactured now no longer have lap belts only as they are so unsafe)Children that are less than 5-6 can be seriously injured if riding in any kind of booster seat. They need to be in a five point harness still. Their skeletons are too fragile for a the "three point harness" of an adult seatbelt- a five point harness spreads crash forces over a larger, stronger portions of the body (shoulders, hips, crotch- where there are strong bones) and an adult seatbelt, even when the child is in a booster, crosses their abdomen too much instead of their hips. If you were to get into a crash, many of their internal organs in their abdomen could be lacerated (cut into internally) and they could bleed to death inside in a matter of minutes.I really hope you will consider keeping your young children, who I am sure you adore and love very much, in a five point harness. There are many on the market that have higher weight limits (All that I have listed here go up to 50, 60, 65, 70, or even 80 pounds)these days... Britax Frontier, Diono Radian, Graco MyRide, Graco Size4Me, Britax Marathon, Evenflo Maestro just to name a few.
