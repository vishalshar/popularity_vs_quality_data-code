This product is not 100% perfect. For a reason that I don't understand the temperature is not constant, so I have to check it everytime (although I would do that even if that wasn't an issue) and sometimes I have to adjust (mix with cold milk if hot or warm again if cold).This is my second bottle warmer. With my first baby I used the Dr. Browns one. The temperature on that one was always perfect BUT it developed some mold and deposits that were impossible to clean. So I ended up tossing it.This warmer needs some adjusting but it is a breeze to clean.I just pour some white vinegar, wait a few minutes and wipe off with a kitchen towel. It gets perfectly clean everytime. I rather check the temperature and adjust than worriying about stuff growing up inside.
