The mirror has really cute upbeat melodies that you can set to play continously or let baby activate the music by rolling the little wheel on the bottom of the mirror..which is pretty easy for my 4mo old to do if he really wants to. There are two sound settings that are nice. It was a BREEZE tying it to the crib, unlike his soother. And the mirror itself is about an 8 out 10 for baby mirrors i have shopped around for that don't look like those cheap carnival mirrors. The only downsides..the mirror is a little too big for my son's crib so the toys don't dangle down but lay on the mattress instead and the mirror is not angled enough for him to see himself lying down yet..hopefully when he gets a little older.
