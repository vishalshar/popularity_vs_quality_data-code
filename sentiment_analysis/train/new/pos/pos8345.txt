This pillow is great.  My daughter loves Yo Gabba Gabba, and after seeing a similar one in the store, I thought maybe I could find it cheaper on Amazon (which I did), and ordered it for her.  She is 2, and uses it in her bed as her pillow. When she is feeling bad or tired, she will pull this guy right out of her bed and drag him around everywhere.  She will sit with him in her little chair and watch Yo Gabba Gabba.Honestly, this is probably one of the best items I have purchased for my daughter. It's soft, comfortable, looks like it was made well, and travels well, too :) I've gotten a little sick of seeing the thing, myself, but, my daughter continues to be attached to it. We bought her another Yo Gabba Gabba character beanie baby, and while she liked it, this one still remains her favorite. :)If your kid loves Yo Gabba Gabba, they'll love this.
