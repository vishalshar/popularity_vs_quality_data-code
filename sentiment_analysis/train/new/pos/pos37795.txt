I already had two of the flannel versions of these, and wanted two lighter weight ones because I live in sunny Florida. I also love that these are made in America, I try very hard not to buy things made in China because you just do not know what you are really getting. The weight of these are perfect, if it's a bit cooler I layer another blanket on inside  of this before swaddling the baby in it. My little one loves to be swaddled. These are quite a bit bigger than the flannel version, but works in just the same manner. It's kind of a muslin/linen feeling to it, and it washes and dries perfectly. The swaddler is also a great cover up for when you are breast feeding in public, keeps you covered without over heating the baby. I bought two of these and would buy them again and again.ADDED A FEW WEEKS LATER: I assumed incorrectly that these are made in the USA like the flannel ones. They ARE NOT. They are made in China which greatly disappointed me. I took a star away for that reason. I really wish Amazon would start listing what country things are made in.
