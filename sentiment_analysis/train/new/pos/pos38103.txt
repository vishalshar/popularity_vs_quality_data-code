This might be my best Amazon purchase, and I have been a longstanding Amazoner. My 5 month old grandson was coming to spend the weekend at our condo. He has a similar "jumper" at home so I thought I would get one too. When I searched Amazon and the Jolly Jumper came up it was a walk down memory lane because my own kids had one a quarter century ago on another continent and loved it. I ordered the Jolly Jumper immediately with expedited delivery. It arrived on time, in time, I put it together in less than 10 minutes and the video will tell the rest of the story......well the Jolly Jumper went home with the kids, gotta get another one for future visits.
