My baby boy really enjoys feeding himself from pouch feeders. However, these can get pretty pricey in stores, so I was on a mission to find a good, reusable pouch to put homemade baby food or store bought jar baby food in to minimize the price. This is a pretty good product overall!The Pros:*This product is really easy to fill. The whole left side opens up with a ziplock type seal, and opens nice and wide so that you can spoon in food quite easily.*Since the pouch opens up so easily, it is very easy to clean!*These were very affordable! You earn your money back quite quickly when you consider that one pouch is around $1.50 at the store.The Cons:*The pouch is a bit wide for a baby to hold--I don't think it would be a problem for a toddler or older child, but my guy is nine months and it can be a little tough for him to manuever.*The top of the pouch (where they suck out the food) is also a bit wide, so he would sometimes suck out too much food at once and choke or spit it out. We didn't have this problem with the pouches that are smaller and marketed directly for babies, so I believe it is related to this particular pouch's size.*It is a cheaper looking product. This didn't bother me, but the product looks like it is made out of the same material as a disposable pouch, which just means it gets beat up looking rather quickly!Overall, a good bang for your buck and it certainly works. There just may be better products on the market for an infant.
