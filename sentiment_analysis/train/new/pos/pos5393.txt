I've been looking for a way to organize my toddler's closet and found this set online. The reviews were great and the price was dicounted. I really like the color and the little hangers. The boxes are not huge, but I wouldn't say they're that small. I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers expected. You could probably fit a soccer ball or a basketball into the large boxes. That's perfect size for me to keep small things that otherwise would be all over the place. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don't have much use for the dividers. It's not like I can't see what's in the closet and need directions to look for stuff. I'm not into labeling things though. Also, the smaller boxes are a little tight in the shelves, and I find it annoying trying to pull one out when I need to quickly get something out.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase and would recommend it to friends and family. I will probably be purchasing more from Delta.
