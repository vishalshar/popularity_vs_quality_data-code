Great mattress.  I chose to get a good quality matters because let's face it;  things involving babies and toddlers get used.  And used heavily. These mattresses were firm but not hard.  They offer good quality support.  They do have a plastic coating which ensures it's waterproof.  They lasted through 2 1/2 years of rough sleeping and acrobatic habits. I'd recommend if its anything for the kid, spend a little more money to get a better quality product that will last.  If you pay 29.99 for a cheap mattress at a store that starts with "W", you'll be spending money money another cheap mattress a few months down the road.
