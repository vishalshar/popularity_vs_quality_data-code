I love this product!I bought it after seeing this from the woombie main site. I didn't want to get the original woombie as my baby would be around 5 months old in winter and she didn't like being totally wrapped so this sleeper with sleeves was very helpful for bigger babies.This kept warm so well that sometimes the baby was perspiring at night, as she also had a blanket over her. I bought 2 sleepers of different designs so that I could have one on hand while the other was in the wash.The only complaint would  be that this could be made longer. It got quite tight for the baby when she was 7.5 months old. I'm sure boy babies might outgrow this even earlier. I would love to let the baby wear this until age 1 even  in spring as the night are still quite cold but there's no bigger size.
