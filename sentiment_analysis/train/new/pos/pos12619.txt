As an exclusive pumper, i buy all the gadgets. I cannot be left unable to pump. That is painful and detrimental to my milk supply! I read some reviews that said that batteries only last one or 2 pumping sessions or that the power isn't as good. I disagree. I mean, the best power you can get is from your wall adapter. But, my batteries last at least 4 sessions before I start to notice them losing juice. And, just like the car adapter (which by the way is the same with any car adapter for anything.. Phones, etc ) the power may be a bit less, but you just crank the pump up a little and it's good to go. No complaints here. I keep mine in my pumping bag at all times and it has saved me when I forgot my wall adapter.
