I wish I'd known about these when my own kids were babies; my daughter especially would have practically lived in it. It works pretty well for an active 7 month old grandson too -- he sits in it and loves getting walked around (and chewing on the fabric, of course), and has fallen asleep in it a couple of times. I haven't used the pocket yet, but have been told by others that it can replace a diaper bag. It seems roomy enough for that, anyway. If you're new to slings, try a couple different positions to see what works best for you & the kid, and give it a day or so to get used to it.The only quibble I have is with the documentation. The written instructions were *too* sketchy, they didn't make it clear that the labels should be facing out when initially threading it through the rings. The included DVD was better, it showed what to do, although I paused and backed up several times to make sure I had it right.
