When I had my son two years ago, while breastfeeding him, we gave him a bottle to soon, and he would not latch on again, I tried pumping, but couldn't keep up with him for long.  I just had another baby, and we tried these and they really do work!  After 3 weeks we gave my daughter her first bottle of breast milk (getting her ready for my return to work) and prayed she would still latch on afterwards.  She went back and forth with no problems and never refused the breast.  Matter of fact she still prefers the breast, and will fumble a little with the bottle before she starts eating.  She is six weeks now, taking three bottles a day at daycare and still nursing through the night and before and after daycare.  These nipples really do make the baby work for the milk as they would at the breast.  The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I feel like the nipple is too long and should be shortened up a bit.  I think that's why my daughter fumbles with the nipple before eating.  But it got the job done, and done well!
