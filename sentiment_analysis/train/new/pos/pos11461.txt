After much searching I found wording that all accessories made for phil&teds explorer will fit the newer model P&T's navigator. So I took the plunge and bought this accessory for my Phil&Teds Navigator. I was also unsure if i had a "snugride" or not, but I do have a seemingly standard Graco infant Carseat bought within the last 2 years. I have only used this once, as we are not due with second child for 4 more weeks, I set it up just to see how it worked with carseat on top and my son in the back. car seat clicked right in, seemed very stable, had some wiggle room but not enough to be bothersome, and surely wasn't coming off. I did have to adjust the main seat back a little bit by loosening the strap in back of main seat. ( the strap that makes the seat recline when unhooked). I assumed that was why it is adjustable because it isn't a long adjustment and it let out to the perfect length. I did not fold stroller while this attachment was connected, but it does seem like it would fold without removing as suggested. It was a little tough to remove attachment to replace with belly bar, maybe after a few times it will break in and transfer easier. however I plan to leave it set up in this style for a while, so no big deal for us. There was plenty of room for second child in doubles seat with graco seat on top. very happy with product.
