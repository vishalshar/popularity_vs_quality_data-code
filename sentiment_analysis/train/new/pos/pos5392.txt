I've had to edit my original review because over time this diaper has become one of my favorites.Originally I gave this diaper 3 stars because, while I found it generally to be a good diaper and very easy to use, there were some aspects about it that didn't thrill me. First off I disliked the brushed polyester that edges around the bamboo liner, but after months of use I've found it to be great at keeping in leaks- it's a non-wicking fabric. I also originally found the surged elastic a little rough, but it has softened up with washings. So my two critiques really don't exist anymore, and I find myself always reaching for it. It's very absorbant without being bulky, I love the cute prints, and the tongue-style insert makes for easy washing and very fast drying (even on a line). I actually think the tongue-style design is the best, I don't know why so few cloth diaper brands use it.I also don't usually like velcro but I can't deny that it makes it SO easy, and I get a better fit than with snaps. This also seems to be the one style of velcro my baby doesn't try to get off. And I love the prints.Babble listed this diaper as one of the all-around best cloth diapers and although it's taken a while I would have to agree now. I've actually sold some other diapers so that I can order more of these!
