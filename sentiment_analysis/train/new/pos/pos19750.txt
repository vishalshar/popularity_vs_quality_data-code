This has to be the best sippy cup on the market for so many reasons. i have tried two other bands nuk and playtex. my son would start to drink and then get frustrated and either throw it or whine for his bottle. i then tried to drink from the cups myself and could barely get a drop of liquid out. the spill proof aspect overtook the functionality aspect of the cups. this cup allows free flowing liquid with little effort. the spill proof valve comes out easily so when the child becomes older and dont need it it can be left out. this valve is not the easiest to clean but i have a straw cleaner and that works wonders also a traditional pipe cleaner that can be gotten from any craft store also works great to clean it. the valves can also be replaced if they get really gross. sometimes some liquid is stuck between the valve and the spout but it is normally very little and does not spill out unless the cup is completely upside down. the only down fall with this cup is when the vavle is n the last ounce or so cant be sucked out of the cup. but that doesnt really create much of a problem. i have recommended this cup to all my friends with babies.
