I have a nice collection of silver jewelry and I like to keep it clean.  I have heard from various jewelers that you shouldn't use the liquid dip-type cleaners because they pit the metal over time, and that using a polishing cloth is best. I have found this to be true. Over the years, I have bought many different brands of polishing cloths.  Some work really well, some you have to do all the work.  These are ones that work really well. I will be purchasing more of these in the future!
