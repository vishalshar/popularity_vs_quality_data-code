Bought these to reduce gas and throw up happening from standard Medela bottles. She even has an easier time burping after drinking from these. These bottles pretty much fixed all issues we were having. We're still on Level 1 nipples even though she's 6 months old.We got the 8 oz bottles since she'll grow into them anyways.Cleaning these bottles is not as bad as it seems. Definitely worth the price. Hands down.
