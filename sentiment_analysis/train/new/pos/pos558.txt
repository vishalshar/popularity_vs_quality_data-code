My daughter is a chewer.  She is in an endless cycle of teething, and was always chewing on my hair or clothes, which got old really fast.  This necklace solved that problem.  It gives her something to chew on and play with when I'm carrying her around, when she's sitting in a shopping cart, or even when I'm changing her diaper.  And the best part is, she can't play the "let's drop the toy on the ground" game.  I never leave home without a teething necklace of some sort on anymore.I've read some reviews with people saying that others compliment them on how beautiful it is and that people think it's real stone.  I have to be honest, that's probably not going to happen to most people.  It does look nice enough to wear with clothes and not look like you have a chew toy around your neck, but let's get real.  It's a chewy circle on a black string.  It's not super fancy, and it doesn't look like stone.  But, again, it's not ugly by any means, and only other mothers will realize what it really is and that it's not meant to be a fashion statement.  Plus, it looks a lot more like real jewelry than another teething necklace product that I own, and your hair doesn't get stuck in this one.The reason I knocked off a star is that my daughter sometimes ends up shoving the whole thing into her mouth, which makes her gag.  I'm not worried about it being a choking hazard, but do wish it was just a bit bigger to prevent this.  Overall, it's a great product.
