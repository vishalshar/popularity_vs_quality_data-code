Really love this light for my son.  Only concern I would watch for is the light bulb getting hot.  It is not a big deal if your child understands but it could be a problem for the younger ones.  It doesn't get too hot but just enough to probably surprise a little one.  Other than that, a good light.  Pretty bright for those little ones that like a good strong night light.  For those that do not want a lot of light in the room, I would not get this product.
