I hesitated to buy this based on the high cost and my unfamiliarity with the brand.  I really wish I didn't wait so long!  I could have been using this since my son was born!  He has some colicky digestive issues that come and go.  When nothing else will soothe him, I can slip him into the sling and take him (and my dog now that my hands are free) for a short walk around the neighborhood.  It does the trick every time--and nothing else consistently soothes him.The sling is very easy to setup, easy to put on/take off, feels secure, and I can put my son in by myself with ease.  It is way more comfortable than holding him and faster than pulling out the stroller.  While having the baby so close to your stomach does raise your body temp, I didn't feel like the areas where the sling rests on my skin were suffocated by the material.My son is already 12 pounds and around 24 inches long, so I don't know how much longer he will be comfortable in the laying poses, but the sling came with instructions to have him sit more upright, too, like a moby or katan.In short, this exceeded all of my expectations and does everything it claims to--an amazing rarity!
