I got this gate system to keep my dog confined after her spinal surgery.  I got several gates and extensions for various door openings.  One of the openings I have is extra large and it is often difficult to find a nice gate for that.  This system is high quality heavy metal construction with a very nice closing mechanism.  And has a nice look.  It was relatively easy to put together and has held up to regular traffic.That being said, I was under the impression when it says it will fit an opening "up to" a certain size, that meant the up to size was the maximum and there was room give or take.  In reality it is the exact size with only centimeters of give on the screw fasteners.  Also, I was also under the impression it would not require drilling.  This is probably my fault for not reading the fine print.  So, just to let you all know, it does require drilling and the parts that drill into the walls will decrease the size of your opening so measure carefully and precisely.  The gate I got for my smaller opening just barely fit but when I put the hardware in, it did not fit no matter how much I squeezed.  You wouldn't think a tiny thickness such as a washer would make or break the fit - in my case it did.As well - on my wider opening, I put the extensions in and having the 5 bar was too big but having 2 bar was too small.  I put two of the 2 bar together but it is a bit less sturdy with so many put together.  A 3 or 4 bar option would be helpful for more choices.I also felt it was a bit overpriced but there weren't a lot of choices as I wanted metal construction with a decorated touch.It would be nice to have a setting to allow you to keep the gate part open.  It would also be nice to have a bit more leeway in sizing and not have to be so exact.  And finally, no drilling required would be an added bonus.Overall, as long as you take those things into consideration, I do recommend the product.
