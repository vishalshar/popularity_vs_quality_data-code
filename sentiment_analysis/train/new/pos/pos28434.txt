Comparison:Green Sprouts version (available on Amazon) is thick and very sticky.  Doesn't travel well.CONs- difficult to fold (only in half) or even roll.  Compound that with it's very sticky surface and I find it difficult to travel with because it is bulky and hard to get in and out of the diaper bag (it sticks!!).PROs- It sticks like glue to our metal kitchen table and also sticks okay just aout anywhere we go, including most wood tables.  Since it is thick, I can put food on it and carry it to the table.  I use this one at home for every meal.NUK Gerber version is thin and flimsy and not very sticky.  Travels well.PROs- It folds up really small (in quarters) and since it has less stick it easily moves in and out of the diaper bag.  I have decided this one is so much easier to travel with, it lives in my diaper bag.CONs- too thin to move with food on it.  It also doesn't stick as well.  My daughter had the GS version first, so doesn't even bother to try to lift this one, but you may have a problem if you child likes to pick up her plate.Otherwise they are the same.  Both clean easy, are healthy silicone, are of a similar size, have a nice ridge to prevent spills, etc.
