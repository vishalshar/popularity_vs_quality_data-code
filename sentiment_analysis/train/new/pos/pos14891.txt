This was larger than I expected but it is ok.  It is nice and sturdy and sits on a dresser just fine.  I do wish that there was a timer on it so it didn't have to go all night.  I don't use it much now because of that but my baby is only 12 months.  I am guessing as she gets older we will start with the light on and turn it off once she is asleep.  The lights are LED and the color changing is cool.  That said, the lights seem too bright for a nightlight though.  I do like that it changes color, but I wish you could stop it on one color.  Otherwise the lights keep changing and I could see that would be distracting for baby (especially since some of the colors are so bright)...So- I like this, but I guess I am not completely sold on it as our definite nightlight moving forward...
