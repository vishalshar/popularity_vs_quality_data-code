This is a great thing for drooping baby heads. It gets a little sweaty after awhile so make sure the area has good air to your infant. This is really soft and I wish I had one as an adult. It's easy to slip behind their heads even while they are strapped in and sleeping. Overall I'm happy with this product just beware of too much sweating.
