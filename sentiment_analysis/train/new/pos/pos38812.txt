The point of this review is to let others know THIS BASE FITS THE GRACO INFANT SAFESEAT MODEL. I watch a 6 month old M-Th every week and was looking for a base that I could keep secured in my van. I really hate buckling and unbuckling the car seats. I also feel that a base makes securing the child safer and more reliable. Since Graco doesn't seem to make bases specific to every car seat it was a pain to figure out which base worked with the SafeSeat model. I think this is a HUGE oversight on Graco's part. Car seats should NEVER be difficult to use. This base DOES NOT have a level on it for correctly securing it to the vehicle, as another reviewer has mentioned. However, the car seat itself should have a level. You will simply need to attach the car seat to the base to ensure it is leveled correctly.
