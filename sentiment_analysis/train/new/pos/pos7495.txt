According to the book, Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Marc Weissbluth, it is necessary to teach your baby to fall back to sleep on their own.  The Dreamscape Soother was invaluable!My oldest daughter learned to turn her Dreamscape Soother on by herself at night at six months and my second at 9 months.  I rarely had to get up and get them in the middle of the night after using this Soother and following Marc Weissbluth's tips.  My girls are now 1 1/2 & 2 1/2 and are healthier with good sleep habits.Downside - Soother's moving parts lasted a little less than 2 years, then we had to replace.
