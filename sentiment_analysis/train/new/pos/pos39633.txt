My 23-month-old grandson was using his Binky as a teething tool, biting through each one in a few days and worrying all of us about him choking on pieces. Found this on Amazon and ordered two; and after two days of getting used to it, he now asks for his "chew fa" (he named his Binky "fa" months ago) during the day when his teeth bother him. We are so grateful that there is an alternative and can highly recommend this for teething issues.
