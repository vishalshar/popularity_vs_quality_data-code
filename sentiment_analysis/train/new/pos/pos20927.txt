We love the Halo Sleepsacks. We own 4 of them from Halo and they all look very cute and are a great safe way of keeping your baby warm at night. As far as the sizing information, I find the length to be more appropriate than the weight on this item. Our baby is long and lean, and she does not fit in the small size anymore (up to 18 lbs - she only weighs 15 Lbs). I would say the small size fits up to 26 inches long (regardless of weight), then it's time to move to the medium size (which would seem to fit a baby up to 30 inches long).
