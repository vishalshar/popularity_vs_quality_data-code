I'm happy to chose one cup food maker with no additional parts like other food makes. It's easy to use, easy to clean. Today it took 5 or 7 minutes for me to cook puree for my son including dicing-cooking-washing and 20 minutes for the food maker to cook while I was playing with my son. Perfect. And it was delivered faster than expected.
