I bought this charger for my medulla symphony pump.  My child is now 15 months and I use this charger daily for 10 to 15 minutes at a time with no issues of over heating or shortages.  This adapter plugs into a standard car cigarette lighter or small volt outlet.  The adapter is not heavy and is made of plastic a bright indicatir light makes it obvious when it's plugged in completely.  I have used the charger for more than six months without any issues.
