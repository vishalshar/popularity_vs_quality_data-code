Hey, all. I originally bought a Serta changing pad, but that sucker was too big for the Ikea Hemnes Changing Table Top we have. I didn't even think to measure the top before buying the changing pad (pregnancy brain!). Thank God for reviews on Amazon, as I saw from other consumers that this 4-sided changing pad by LA Baby is a perfect fit! It fits snugly on the sides of the top (no room for sliding side-to-side), AND in all the covers I bought at Baby's R Us. I am including some photos for you guys to check out.My Carter's Changing Pad Cover in Jungle Jill (16in x 32in) and my Koala Baby Deluxe Changing Pad Cover in lavender (16"x 34") fit great with the LA Baby 4-Sided Changing Pad (30"). The straps on the changing pad also fit perfectly through the covers with no problems.In regards to how baby likes it...well, we have a few weeks to find out!
