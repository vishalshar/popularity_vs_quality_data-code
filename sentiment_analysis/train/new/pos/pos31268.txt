I was looking for a unisex chair that had wheels.  So I chose this one. It's very nicely padded.  Tray comes on and off easily.  Also hangs off the back (very convenient when your home is cluttered with so much baby stuff!).  The design is pretty.  It looks like an expensive chair but we got it at a bargain.  It moves around the house very smoothly. The height seems a little low (even at its highest) for a highchair, but it's a good height if you're sitting down and feeding baby.  the height adjustment and recline all work very smoothly and easily (not jerky and difficult like some other baby products).  Baby is 4 months old so the tray is way too high for her.  I removed it since she will be eating from my hand anyway.  I think once she's bigger it will be okay (maybe only slightly high).  Sometimes I just let her sit in it or recline. She's comfortable enough to fall asleep!  I'm very very pleased overall.
