I read a lot of reviews trying to find a cup holder for our uppababy vista. I have the soft skip hop one that works fine but not ideal for anything but a bottled drink because it had little structure. I saw mixed reviews for this bugaboo one but decided to try it. So far it fits perfectly with the number 2 adapter. The cup is steady and doesn't move around.  For our needs it works great. I haven't tried it with an open liquid like a can of pop or something with out a lid. And like I've seen noted on here the number 2 adapter fit on the smaller part closer to the handle grip and I have the handle extended all the way. So if you did need to adjust the handle often for different users it may not be ideal. But it did also seem to me that the number 3 adapter might fit the larger bar but I didn't want to force it and try since we didn't need to.  And yes it will make going through some doorways tighter but I've found I can just take it off. We mostly use the stroller outside and in large areas so for us this has worked well. Glad to have finally found something.
