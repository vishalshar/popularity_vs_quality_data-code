My baby outgrew the newborn head support that came with our Chicco Keyfit carseat around 2 months but his neck didn't seem strong enough to go completely without head support. So I did some quick research and I'm so glad I found this one! I wish I would have used it from day one with the smaller insert because it seems much cozier than what came with our carseat. It would be nice if it stayed in place on its own because it does need to be slightly adjusted every time I put baby back in but at the same time it's nice how quickly it can be inserted or removed. Overall I am very happy with this product and would highly recommend it to give you peace of mind for extra head/neck support for baby. It fit our baby all the way up to at least 6 months which we would sometimes use for sleeping in the car to make him more comfortable.
