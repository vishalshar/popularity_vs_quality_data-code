I spent a ton of time researching bags and chose this one. It's very cute and stylish looking, holds everything I need for my 9 month old and myself to go out for the day, and stays nicely on my shoulder. I also especially love the stroller straps. I have three children and being able to be hands free when we are out and about is wonderful! I also love to clip my keys to the straps and drop them down inside the bag, it makes finding my keys so much easier!
