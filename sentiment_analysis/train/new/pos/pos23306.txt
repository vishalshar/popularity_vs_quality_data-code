We just finished putting together our Graco Stanton crib and are very impressed with the quality, especially for the low price. The cherry finish is very nice - almost no flaws and a nice rich color, not too red. It took two of us one hour to put together and the instructions were very clear. I'm especially impressed by how sturdy it is. We looked at some $500+ cribs that seemed rather flimsy. The front bar keeps this crib nice and stable.I had my eye on the Baby Europa Geneva crib - also by LaJobi, who makes the Graco brand - and was sad to find that it was discontinued, but this one appears to be a new product with very similar styling. Coincidence or re-branding? Either way, the styling of this crib is very nice. It is lacking a few of the nice details on the Geneva, but has new details of it's own. And it costs even less!Overall, it looks like it costs a LOT more than it did. I would recommend it to anyone.
