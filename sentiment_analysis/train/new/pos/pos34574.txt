So far, no issues with this battery.  Now that my son is 3, I'm not married to the monitor as I once was, so can't compare to the nights where I left it on all the time.  I charge it about once/week and use it sparingly just to check on him during naps.  I'll also take it outside and leave on the whole time if I'm doing yard work.  No issues.
