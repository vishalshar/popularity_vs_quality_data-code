These are good quality bumpers that are well padded to protect the baby from bumping against the crib sides.  They are also good for blocking out drought  to keep the baby warm.  The ties are well made and once you tie a knot it is not easy to undo, so they are pretty secure.  It washes well in the washing machine.  This bumper comes in four pieces (two short, two long), which was information that wasn't very obvious in the description.
