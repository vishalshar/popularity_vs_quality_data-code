Once I cut them down to size to fit the medela bottles my wife uses they (along with the other Dr. Brown bottle parts) provide the Dr. Brown performance that we like in the medela bottle size which she prefers.This was a result of my wife complaining that she like the way the Dr. Brown bottles worked but really didn't like the size of the bottles as the medela size she had was best. I simply looked at the two bottles and the way the parts functioned and said to myself: "Self you could just cut the blue middle portion so that it fits in the smaller bottle." So, I ordered these, cut them and presented the wife with a solution!Both my wife and my now almost 4 month old daughter have offered no complaints about the end results!
