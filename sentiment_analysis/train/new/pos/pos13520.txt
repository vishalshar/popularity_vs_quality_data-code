I bought the Manhattan Toy Dress Up Pirate for my son when he was about 18 months old.  I saw it in a local toy store and thought it was a really cool, age appropriate toy.  I really liked all of the learning aspects- the shoe tie, the shoe zipper, the buttons that can be undone, the buckle, the belly button.  I also liked that it was fun- a soft toy, with a rattle in the bird and a little sword (non-removable).  What's not to like about an adorable toy pirate??!  However, my son was not at all interested in playing with the pirate.  I regularly put the pirate in his crib or on his play mat, but he never played with it.  He is now 2 years and 8 months old and he has played with it maybe 2 or 3 times.  It just sits on his bookshelf, looking adorable and collecting dust.I gave it 4 stars because I still think it's really cute and I think it has fun features for little ones to play with.  For some reason though my son has never shown any interest in this toy.
