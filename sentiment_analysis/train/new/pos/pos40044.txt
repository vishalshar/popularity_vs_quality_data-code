This was the second type of bottle we tried for our daughter who is primarily breastfeed.  The bottles work great because the nipple base is nice and wide and the nipple is very soft to touch, both things that are great for a breastfed baby.  She took to these immediatly and we have never had a problem.  It is nice not having to clean the bottle base everytime you feed her, just pitch the liner and wash the nipple and ring.  The flow on the nipple is nice and slow so they do have to actively suck and milk isnt just free flowing down their throat, again great for a breastfed baby.  The only down side is the liners do get expensive after a while, so if you were exclusively bottle feeding these could get expensive pretty fast.  Since we only give 3-4 bottles a day at daycare and 1 or 2 on the weekends it isn't such an expense, so much more reasonable if you are still breastfeeding when you are at home.
