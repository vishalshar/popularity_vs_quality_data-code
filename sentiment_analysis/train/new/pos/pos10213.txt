These do the job, I bought them to use with the diaper changing station attached to my baby's pack n' play. They are soft and hold in pee or poo well. If theres pee on it it is dry by the next diaper change. They hold up pretty good in the wash, I use stain remover for any stains (oxy clean) and they come out.For the price they are definitely worth buying.
