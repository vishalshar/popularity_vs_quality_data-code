We purchased this laundry bag to serve as a pail liner (we removed the elastic drawstring that cinches the top closed) for cloth diapering our son, born in May 2012.  It's now February 2014, little brother is due in March, and we're getting ready to order another one to use with baby brother's cloth diapers.This laundry bag has been washed 2-3 times per week for the past year and a half, in hot water with Ecos detergent, and line dried. I'm most impressed because it still looks absolutely brand new- the pattern is still bright and crisp, and no pilling or other signs of wear on the fabric- whatsoever.  We normally toss it in with every other load of dirty diapers, and it has never retained any smell or stain.  It has never leaked, and does a great job of retaining any diaper pail smell.  We use a recycling bin from Ikea (FILUR 11 gallon bin with lid) as our diaper pail, and with this liner inside it no diaper or potty smell ever escapes into our son's room.  Great for busting that myth that cloth diapers are stinky!We originally bought this to replace the G Diapers brand wet bag we got at Babies R Us.  After 2-3 washes, the waterproof lining on the G Diapers bag actually started to separate and peel off from the fabric part of the bag, rendering it unusable.  For about the same price, this bag has been infinitely better.Absolutely no complaints.  I definitely recommend this bag to anyone who doesn't want to have to fool with replacing it or worry about leaks or smell.
