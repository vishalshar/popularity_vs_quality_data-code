If you have and use the Zoli cups that these straws are for, you will know that there are needed and well worth it. Part of why the cups work so well is due to the flexibility of the soft straw. With a softer straw comes the inevitable breakage, etc. I suggest buying backup straws and having them on hand so you have them when you need them. A few times, these have been hard to find so stock up now.Removal and installation of the straws isn't super easy, but is definitely manageable. You CAN do it with your hands, but the softness of the straws (especially if they are wet) make them hard to get a good grip on. I typically just use some pliers for the added grip. That might sound like overkill...and it is, but it makes replace the straws a 30-second affair for me. Just be careful when pulling the new straw into place to NOT pull too hard and risk breaking the straw.These straws fit both the regular and XL sizes of the Zoli Cups.
