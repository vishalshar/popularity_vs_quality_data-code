This bag has held up perfectly over the past 6 months with daily use and frequent washing.  Smelly messes stay well inside the bag, and I've never had a problem with leaking or odor.  It's big enough for about 6 clean BumGenius diapers (to fit comfortably), and you could fit more in there when they're dirty (because I usually roll them up tightly).  The print (we have the cow print and the animal print) is fun, and I don't feel too conspicuous carrying it in and out of school (daycare).  We even took it on vacation to act as our impromptu diaper pail, and we used the loop to hang on a dresser pull in the hotel - there was no smell discernible from the bag!If I had a complaint, it's that the loop is a little small to use as a carrying strap.  It fits over my hand, but is just small enough to be awkward while holding a baby and other bags.  And it's not comfortable on the wrist, so I just throw it in a larger catch-all bag with her baby food and other stuff.  This bag would be perfect with a better carry strap, but I still give it 5 stars for durability, wetness and odor control (after all, that's what it's for!)Update: We've now been using these for 15 months, and they're still going strong - many, many washes later!
