I currently have a 4 yo, 2 yo, 1 yo, and another due any day now. As a result, we have 12 car seats! I bought two of these as my 4 yo was outgrowing the Britax Marathon (which we have several of). They serve us well but they are so bulky.I wanted something safe like the Marathons but my 4 yo is not quite ready for a no back booster seat. So as soon as he reached the requirements, I bought these for him. He loves them! I mean, what kid wouldn't want a Recaro racing style seat?First of all, he feels like a big boy since he uses a regular seat belt and not the five point lock down belts. I even gave him a Wii steering wheel to use so he can pretend he's driving too. More importantly, here's why we love it also:A. He can now buckle and unbuckle himself, a savior when dealing with multiple kids.B. I have to play musical chairs with all the seats in the minivan from time to time (and sometimes between vehicles). This allows me to simply pick up and place wherever I want without having the need to install. These also work with off-center seats in the second row of our minivan.C. Not sure what other reviewers are used to but these are actually pretty light. Then again, I'm comparing to my Britax Marathons. I "clean" these in 5 seconds flat: pick up, turn upside down, shake, and put back on seat.D. The headrests on the sides allow him to sleep better when he dozes off.In short, if you care about safety, convenience, and value, this seat is the perfect upgrade to your convertible seat. Your kid will love it, too! My younger ones can't wait to graduate to these one day.
