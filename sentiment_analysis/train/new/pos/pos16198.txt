I was pretty doubtful about the Pet Detection since I am extremely careful not to let the dog upstaires where the nursery is, but I was surprised at what else it "detects"!  I have a 4 yr old who is very curious about his new baby sister and often wants to play with her even though I try to explain that babies can't play.  It's cute because sometime he just stares at her in awe but I get worried that he might sneak into the baby's room and try to "play" with her when I'm not watching.  Since I got this monitor, twice the pet detection alarm and light went off.  I ran to the nursery and saw my son climbing onto the crib wanting to get a better peek at his sister!  It was innocent enough but who knows what could have happened if he tried to pick her up or hurt her unintentionally.  This Pet Detection alone was worth the money but it's got other handy and easy to use functions too.  It reminds me of my regular phone because of the rechargeable batteries and parent unit finder (push a button and the parent unit beeps until you find it).  It has other functions too like lights that flash to tell you if the baby is crying and low battery indicator, although I haven't had to use it since I leave it plugged in most of the time.  If you are a worry wart about pets and siblings and want total peace of mind, then this monitor is for you.
