I'm very happy with this purchase. We used Summer Infant SwaddleMe swaddles for the first 4 months...and I LOVE them and recommend them to everyone because my little girl has been sleeping through the night since she was a month and a half old and I give all the credit to those amazing swaddles.But...at 4 months old she rolled over in her crib for the first time so it was no longer safe to swaddle her. I wanted to keep up the bed time routine though and thought these would be a great option. I had some carters fleece sleep bags which I like...but my little girl is a heat box and those were far too warm for her.I'm very happy with this product. The cotton is a great thickness for right now in spring and I have a muslin one for summer when it gets warmer. Baby girl has continued to sleep through the night in her HALO 10-12 hours and she knows it's bedtime when we put her in her sack in the crib.Quality on this one and the muslin one is great. Our baby girl has no trouble rolling around and moving around in the crib as much as she wants with this on. It's very easy to put this on. I wasnt sure how long she would still fit in the small size since even though she's skinny...she's long...so I bought one small and one medium. I think she will be in the small for a month or two yet...the medium looks GIGANTIC! That's okay though...she will grow into it and at least we will get our money's worth of use out of the size small.Great product and I highly recommend for once you need to transition out of the swaddle or if swaddling doesn't work for your little one.
