Cute little bibs.  Some shrinkage in the wash, but they are cotton so I still give it 5 stars.  They are more absorbent and softer than the other terry and cotton bibs I've tried. I've been very happy with stuff from this company.What I couldn't figure out without going to a store was the difference between these and the Aden & Anais "Snappy" bibs.  These are a little bit smaller and snap in the back.  The Snappy bibs snap to the side, and have three snaps in a row making them size adjustable. I prefer the side snap to pull off a baby in a seat or swing because you don't have to get your hand behind their head after they fall asleep, but these are a better size for a little baby. Overall I like these but the snappy bibs are a better value.
