Sooooo plush, adorable and easy to throw in the washer and dryer. Our daughter originally received a Jellycat animal as a gift when she was a baby. She loved it (and we loved it) so much that we bought her another one. We have bought a few for friends, plan on buying one for our other daughter ... and then we will probably continue buying them in various animals for our daughters and for friends and family when they have babies. Highly recommend!
