A relative of mine has macular degeneration, but loves to play cards.  They had basically quit playing- because of the difficulty in seeing the cards.  Back in Summer of 2008, I bought them a deck of these, along with a couple of other varieties, to see which would work best for them.They liked these the most because of the bold, clear numbers.  They continue to play with these: we have bought them several decks since.  Their vision has continued to degrade- but they're still able to play.  They use them for solitaire, and also, at times, with others in group games.More recently, in January, 2012, another relative of mine reached the point where they found card-playing difficult- because of eye problems.  We tried these decks with them, and they also like them- I'm currently ordering more.So, in my experience, two of two people have liked these cards.  Apparently A. Feinberg (see 7/2010 review, below) has had a less-positive experience.  So, as they point out, the usefulness of these cards to a given person / in a particular situation / depends on the severity of vision loss, and the preferences of the people involved.Try several kinds- see what you find works best for your target audience.
