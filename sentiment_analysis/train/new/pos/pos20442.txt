I wish I would have discovered Flensted mobiles years ago.  These mobiles are not just for your nursery. When I made my first purchase I figured it would be a 'one and done' deal and I had a hard time choosing between this Shoal of Fish and the Sparrows. I bought the sparrows a few weeks ago and I was so impressed that I returned to by this Shoal of Fish mobile.  Both are absolutely mesmerizing!  My 2 month old daughter and I both can spend hours staring at these mobiles.  The slightest draft makes the fish 'swim' and it somehow looks completely natural!Let me address a few complaints by other reviewers.  It is true that the fish in the mobile are made of cardboards.  That said, this is not cheap construction.  You can tell when you see this in person that it was hand made by someone that took time to make sure everything balanced.  It isn't meant to be handled or grabbed.  It is delicate but should last a very long time.  It is a piece of art for your nursery (or any room in your home).  You wouldn't be disappointed in the quality of a painting if you gave it to your toddler to play and found that the painting didn't stand up to the slobbering.  This mobile is art.Yes, it is true that the fish hook in the middle of the mobile is a real hook, but, as said above, this isn't meant to be played with.  You will hang this mobile from the ceiling (as per the instructions) and no one will ever be able to touch the hook.The Danes are notorious for their attention to detail and this mobile is no different.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
