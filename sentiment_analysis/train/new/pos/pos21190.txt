This fits just fine and our son cannot push it over or anything. We have this mounted between our dining room and kitchen with one end being against the wall and the other on the edge of the cupboard and its held just fine. I also love that it can be wiped down easily as my son is always pushing his face up against it. Our opening is just under 60" and this fits just fine, I was a little worried about that when I ordered it. Also the fabric is not overly stretched either.
