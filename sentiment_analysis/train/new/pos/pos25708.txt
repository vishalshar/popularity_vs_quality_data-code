I purchased these sheets for a Moses basket a friend loaned me. I was looking for something that was inexpensive, yet fit my needs. These sheets were perfect. They fit well and washed up nicely. They are much thinner than jersey knit sheets, but I was expecting that. For the price and the short amount of time they will be used, I am happy with this product.
