Has kept her bottles cold for longest of any coolers or insulated that we have in our household.  Have had bottles still cold 5-6 hours later when the bottle and cooler were first chilled in the fridge. Ive been able to get longer when adding a small cold pack (finding the right size to fit under bottle in this bag can be a challenge. . We were lucky and already had a perfect sized one). A little pricer than some other coolers,  but so far has performed much better so I guess in this case your paying for performance.  Have been able to use this with 4oz Avent bottles.  The 9oz ones are a little bit more of a squeeze with cold pack, but able to fit fine if I didnt use cold pack and bottle was on its own.
