Perfect transition from breast to bottle feeding. As a stay at home mom, I had always nursed my daughter. She gave up drinking expressed breast milk from a bottle around 6 months of age. Instead of training her to take the bottle, I gave up and just nursed her instead. But when it was time to quit nursing and start whole milk, I began to worry how she would handle it. At first, she was very fussy but I think that was solely because it was whole milk instead of breast milk. She had no problem drinking water out of this bottle. And after two weeks of trying, she finally drank milk from it. I had tried two other brands before this one. Both brands promised to make the transition from breast to bottle easier but those were horrible, nightmare experiences for me.This bottle is lightweight and the wide neck makes it super easy to clean. The top latches on in one shot and there are no leaks from the bottle. I don't have to double check the bottle for leaks before I give it to my daughter. It looks large but my daughter has no problem grasping/holding it while drinking. And the cover stops leaks while this is being tossed around in my bag.
