Perfect for taller door frames and molding on old houses, and keeps my son occupied so that I can cook dinner. A total win!My son has been a jumper since months before he was born. My internal organs were regularly beaten by his activity, as my heartburn attested. Sure enough, his habits didn't change outside the womb - he's been an active kicker every day of his life, and he's now nearly 6 months old! The first time we put him in a friend's bouncy seat, he bounced himself asleep, and we knew we had to get one for ourselves.Unfortunately, our house was built in the 1930s, and the original trim is about 5.25" tall... and the depth of the door frame is about 7" thick! That's a pretty big clearance for a bouncy seat. We tried several different kinds, but none had a large enough clamp to fit around such a big door frame. This Sassy Seat, however, has a very deep clamp, and the belt across the bottom further secures it around the frame. It's the only one we've found that has worked for us. We even tried it with my 2-year-old toddler to really test its limits (see video) - while the clamp sways a little bit when she swings, where it's secured doesn't budge at all. Definite win!(Sorry about the lack of audio on the first part of the video - my cell phone glitched. Audio starts about halfway through!)The bonus toys that came with it are adorable. I love the cord cover things that come with it, too. The crackly one, especially, will entertain my son for a good while as he tries to crackle it into his mouth. The swing seat itself is secured on to the metal frame of the swing by a combination of zipper and Velcro, so it's nice and easy to remove and wash.I now want a swing for upstairs and one for downstairs, so we'll be buying another of these for sure!
