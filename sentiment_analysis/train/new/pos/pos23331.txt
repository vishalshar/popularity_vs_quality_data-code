Great thermos. Had bought one previously for my daughter's lunches. Keeps mac n cheese, spaghetti os, pizza rolls, chicken nuggets and pretty much anything you can think of warm until lunch time. You can also send cold items and they will stay cold until lunchtime.  I liked it so much that I had to find the exact same one.
