Everything was easy to use and just as described.  I had our kids each make a handprint for Father's Day and they came out perfectly.  The paint was non-staining and easily washable (and since my infant definitely managed to get some in his mouth and was perfectly fine, I would say it's non-toxic).  There was plenty of paint included, along with a plastic tray to dip their hands in the paint.  I loved that it came with a little paintbrush, too, so we could write We Love You Dad on the canvases under each hand.  The canvases are exactly the color they appear online--no surprises.  We were very happy with this product.
