When I first put the kick mats in the car (we have a 2014 Explorer, and they fit great!), one of the straps almost immediately ripped at the attachment. I was very frustrated at the prospect of dealing with having to send them back. Before I even got around to doing anything about returning them, I received an email from the company explaining that there was a manufacturing issue with that batch, and that they would like to send me a replacement set!  I was very impressed with how proactive they were, and that they followed up with me after as well to make sure we received them and that we were satisfied with them, which we are!  They are well made, do a great job of covering the seats, the bottom strap doesn't get in the way for the person sitting in the front seat, and dirt wipes off easily. Very satisfied!
