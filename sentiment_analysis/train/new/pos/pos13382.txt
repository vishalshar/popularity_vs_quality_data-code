Super nice car seat, this was the last car seat my son had to use, very confortable, adjustable, nice bright colors, sporty looking. I had it for 3 years in my 2 door Honda civic, my son grew it up and is in my garage right now in a very good conditions. I personally recommend this. We had a lot of fun with it.
