Didn't fit well on my stupid square closet rods, but still managed to get the job done. Feel like they are kind of overpriced for being little pieces of plastic, but I needed them for the tiny humans vast array of clothes. I'm sure Pinterest has seven billion ways you could make them out of peanut butter lids, but I had zero desire to slice up my hands trying to exacto artwork for an infants closet. These work fine.
