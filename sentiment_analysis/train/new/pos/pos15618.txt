These seem to work in our diaper genie elite just as well as the OEM inserts with one tiny issue. That issue being that there's no marker towards the end of the bags. The DG liners have a black line to warn you that you are near the end. This is helpful so that you can gauge when to cut the liner and form another bag (if you can) or to just tie it off and toss the remaining end.Other than that they contain the smell (we have three in diapers) and allow the jaws and lid to close just as the original liners do. Not sure why another review mentioned that the lid didn't go down - sometimes that happens with the originals as well. I am buying again as long as they remain a deal and we have little people in diapers.A tip to those complaining about the bag pulling all the way out or too fast - keep the plastic ring that you are supposed to remove ON - this helps slow the bag usage excess.
