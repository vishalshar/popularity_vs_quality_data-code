Great looking baby gate. Make sure you get the extra pieces for your banisters if you don't want to create holes in them.As for the latch that people are saying is difficult, make sure the smaller end of the hinge piece that screws to the banister/wall is facing upwards. If upside-down, makes the latch very difficult to use. When done properly, pretty simple to use one-handed.It's also nice you can put them on up to a 30 degree angle to screw into studs.Instructions should be easier to understand.
