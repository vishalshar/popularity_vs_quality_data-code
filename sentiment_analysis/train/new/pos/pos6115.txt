My little girl has slept fine with no nightlight until recently when she started having bad dreams. When I went shopping for a nightlight for her a lot of them were battery operated or had timers that shut off or were just lame. This lamp is way cooler, plugs into the wall and with a 25 watt LED bulb in gives off just the right amount of light and costs next to nothing to leave on all night.***I would never use this, or any other lamp, as an all-night light with a lightbulb that gives off any heat or that could be dangerous. If you're going to have it running for prolonged periods get an LED soft white bulb. They're a little more expensive but last forever, are far safer and use very little energy.***
