I LOVE this carseat! my son out grew his rear facing car seat at 6 months! and this was the perfect solution. it is still a rear facing car seat and when he is big enough for a forward facing one this will transform into a forward facing carseat! its not super expensive but very nice. it is easy to install, and the adjustments are way easy to! no complicated unthreading and re-threading the straps! and it lays far enough back that even a new born would be comfy in it! its not all that big either. given it takes up a bit more of the back seat than the normal rear facing car seats but not too much. we originally put it behind the passenger seat and I was still able to slide my seat back and sit comfortably. (we have a chevy cobalt) the cup holder is a bit stupid but that being the only bad thing it deserves five stars in my book and I do suggest it to anyone not wanting to buy a billion different carseats!
