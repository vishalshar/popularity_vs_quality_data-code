I love this product. First time user and it worked great. I don't understand why some of the reviews say it didn't work. You have to use a microfiber cloth to rub it in. I bought it for laundry, as the normal kind I use is not as non toxic as this one. This product is the BEST and SAFEST one on Ewg.org. Took a coffee stain out of my dress shirt. Also, a little of a two month old set in stain on my sons shirt that I have been meaning to get out for some time. I am impressed!! If only they made laundry detergent.
