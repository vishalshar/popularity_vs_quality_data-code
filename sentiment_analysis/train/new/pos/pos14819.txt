I bought these while they were on sale because I thought they would be a great way to pack food for on-the-go.  I'm glad I did!  We've had these for about two months, we use them almost every day, and they're still in great shape!  A jar of baby food fits perfectly into the bigger Squooshi.  I have also made homemade baby food and frozen them to keep fresh.  I just take the Squooshi out the night before, and it is thawed and ready to go the next day.  I also really, really like the Sip'n soft tops that come with this starter set.  Without them, our baby squeezes the Squooshi and gets food all over the place.  The Sip'n soft tops requires the baby to actually suck, so there aren't accidental spills.  Our older child enjoys the Squooshi without the soft top.  These are such a great alternative to the more pricey pre-made food pouches you can buy at the grocery store-- less waste, you can put in your own homemade pureed food, and definitely cheaper in the long run!
