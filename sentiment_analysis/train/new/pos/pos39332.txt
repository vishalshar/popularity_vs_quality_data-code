I was hesitant to buy this at first, since it was brand new and there were no reviews out on it yet.  But, let me tell you - it was worth every penny!  This mobile is made by the same company as the popular 'symphony in motion' mobile, so the quality and durability is there.  For us, we loved the princess theme of the mobile and of course the cute pink colors.  Just like the symphony in motion mobile, the top part of the mobile can be detached from the music box base part.  There is a night lite option as well, and you can select either loud music or soft.  The classical songs that this mobile plays are perfect for soothing a tired baby or just as background music.  Another perk for us is the included remote control.  We hang it near our bed, so that we can operate it from across the room (baby's crib is in our bedroom).  If you are considering this mobile for your baby girl, we highly recommend it.
