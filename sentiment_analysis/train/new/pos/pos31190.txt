Very happy with the design, robustness, and build quality, but I wish the liner/cover would stay on the car seat a little better. I have three Britax Car seats/booster seats and they all rely on an elastic trim to secure it to the seat, and with time they stretch out, and no longer stay put. Very annoying to have the windows down, and the seat cover blow around/ However, if I ever needed another car seat, Britax would be the first one I look at!
