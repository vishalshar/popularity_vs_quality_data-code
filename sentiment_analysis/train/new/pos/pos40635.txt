My boys love these little stacking boats! They were a huge hit at bath time (they hold a good amount of water for scooping and dumping and float well, even stacked.) And my toddler loves to carry them around the house, stacking and unstacking them. I, personally, love that there's no where for water to be trapped and get all nasty like bath squirters, etc can with use. Wish I had found them sooner.
