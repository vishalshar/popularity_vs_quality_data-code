We never had a "Whoozit" toy before this, but we bought it for our second child since it played music and was very colorful. He LOVES this toy and uses it to soothe himself back to sleep during nap and nighttime. We're averaging about 1 every 2 months but it's SO worth it since he soothes himself back to sleep with it. It's the only thing we have in his crib and when we traveled over Christmas, it made it a lot easier for him to sleep in a different crib because he had this with him. The velcro strap wasn't strong enough so we now use a zip tie and attach it to the crib through the plastic blue star on it and that has help up perfectly.My husband cannot understand how our son likes hearing the same clip of Twinkle Twinkle over and over again, but our son likes that apparently. He also LOVES that it vibrates when you pull on it AND the little yellow stars have tiny little lights in them so they blink while the music is playing. Very nice! I'm not sure how long the battery lasts in this, but our son uses it constantly during 2 naps and throughout a 12-hour night and it's lasted about 2 months for us. We definitely recommend this toy!
