Its good buy for the price. The material isn't the best but is much better than the Malm we all buy from Ikea.It is much sturdy (very important if you are keeping heavy items and if you have kids). It has a nice look and feel to it. Its very well finished so looks great in the room.The directions that come along with the unit are great and assembly is straight forward. It just is not a single man's job. Also there were some spare nuts and bolts packaged with it which is always nice.If you follow the instructions (which are easy), the drawer gets assembled just perfectly, with no loose ends.The only drawback are the round knobs that are attached to the drawer. Though they look good once on, but screwing them was a big pain. They are very tight and hard to put on. At the end of screwing all 8 knobs, I ended up having blisters on my hand.
