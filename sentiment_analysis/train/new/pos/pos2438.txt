This plug cover is so simple and small and easy to use. We have several plugs in our home that we needed to keep plugged in and still child safe. The only other option we found was large box that we had to screw to the wall, big and ugly. This plug cover accommodated the thick power strip cord with no problem and is so minimal you hardly notice it is a child safety feature, unlike so many eye sore child safety products on the market. I highly recommend this, particularly for outlets that are in plain sight.
