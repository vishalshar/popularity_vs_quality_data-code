This is a great product for children!  We bought this weight bench for my 2 year old son's birthday, and he loves it!!! My other two boys who are 4 and 7 years old have used it and love it too! It is very sturdy and well made. Putting it together was easy for the most part. My husband had an issue with too much plastic being in the area under the seat where you put one of the screws in, but it was easily bypassed. The bench seems as comfortable as a normal adult sized weight bench. Overall.. I would definitely recommend this item!
