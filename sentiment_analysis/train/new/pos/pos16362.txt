We got Haba's "Max" for our 5 month old for Easter. We have a couple other Haba toys as well and this one is our favorite! I have it clipped on to the car seat handle with one of those little plastic chain links. Bringing me to the only thing I don't like about this toy is that I got it to attach to stroller/ car seat because of the loop that is on top, but it isn't quite big enough. Hooking it on to one of those link though made it the prefect height for him to reach, bat at and tug on the ring. I have even had another baby [1yr] that loved it so much he just sat there beside the car seat messing with it! It feels very nice and is some-what heavy so for now I think we will keep it on the car seat to avoid it getting thrown since I think it has the potential to hurt if it gets swung at you. The colors are vibrant and playful. Makes a very nice clacking sound when moved about. Aside from shaking it side to side, slightly tugging on the ring makes noise too since the inner string is elastic. Overall, we LOVE it!
