My almost 4 year old boy had gone through everything, and things just weren't clicking for him.  We used this doll with a "Potty Training in Less than a Day" book and it worked like a charm.  We used the doll for just a couple of hours so, I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a fancy doll like those we saw in major toy stores.  So, the price is awesome, and the doll was just what we needed!Now about the actual doll's roll and performance.  I like that the anatomy was generic.  It's just a fluffy pillow doll with a hole in the bottom.  You stick the little bottle pointing down through a back pocket and the tip of the water bottle sticks down between the legs.  It was a sinch!  The anatomy didn't need to be a topic of discussion/distraction.  I just needed "pee" to come out to show my boy.  You squeeze the tummy and the water comes out.  It's a tiny, tiny stream, but you can hear it and see it if you pay attention, which we did, and my boy was excited to recognize that the doll was peeing.The underwear got wet before we started our training because I filled the bottle too full to start with.  It was like a juice box when you first put the straw in, you know what I mean?  You pick it up and juice comes out.  Anyway, I grabbed a pair of my sons training pants and we put that on the doll for the training, and it worked fine.  A little loose, but that made it easier for my son to take on and off as he needed to.I LOVE that it's machine washable!!!  I plan on using the same doll with my girl when it's her time.  It has a blue tinted skin tone, but who cares!  My girl won't care!  If you care you can stitch on bow or hair on it's head to make it a girl, but really it's so neutral!
