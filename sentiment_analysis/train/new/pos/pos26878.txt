This swing has so many reviews, I feel like I shouldn't even review it anymore, but it's so unbelievable I just have to do it...My baby is now 9 weeks old and has been using this swing every day and several times a day since we brought him back from the hospital. He loves to be held and this swing saves me from going completely insane. There are several speeds and melodies you can choose from, but he loves the very first speed (lowest) and he likes to listen to the crickets. Now that he can interact more with us, he can also look in the mirror above and loves it when it rotates...He can follow it for at least 15 minutes and most of the time that is all he needs to fall asleep as well. This is truly a God sent gift to new parents. You cannot live without this if you have no help with your newborn. I want to keep it for my second one, too...I am so happy w/ the purchase!
