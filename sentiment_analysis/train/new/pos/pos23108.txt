Fairly easy to put together, I did it by myself in about 15-20min. Looks great, and the features included compare to others at a much higher price point. I do kinda wish I had gotten the one that had a seat that could be removed to use the stand part. It no longer is an issue as my oldest is 4, but when I bought it a year and a half ago, it would have been better to have him in a seat still. Keeping for larger events like Disneyland and the zoo.
