This doesn't work well with the small, fat 6 oz. max Tommee Tippee Bottles, but works great with the 9 oz. bottles. I can see it working wonders with the long, skinny bottles of other brands, but I don't use those.  However, my son is about 6 months old and a little on the chubby side, and I can barely get the pillow on him.  He will outgrow it quickly.  I wish I had found out about this product 6 months ago!
