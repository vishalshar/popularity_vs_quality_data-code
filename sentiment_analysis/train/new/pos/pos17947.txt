Bought this set for my daughter's room when she was born.  It is a little pricey, but cute and unique!  When I was pregnant with my daughter everything we saw was pink or purple, and I wanted something a little different.  The Cotton Tail Designs Lizzie pattern is perfect for what we were looking for; it is girly without being monotone!!  We ended up buying two valances to fit the length of the window, as the window we had was long.  I highly encourage anyone to purchase this!
