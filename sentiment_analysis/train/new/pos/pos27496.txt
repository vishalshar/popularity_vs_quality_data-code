I like it. It works great it was easy to install and use. The only thing we dont like is that out 3 yr old can still fit his hands thru the crack. They need to make it so they can close a bit more because if a little hand can still fit its still not perfect. The picture I included is of our tightest drawer  when locked w the guard. Too big a gap!!
