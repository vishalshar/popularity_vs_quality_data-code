We bought the Crescent Mini-Crib Mattress, which is 6" thick, and we had trouble finding fitted sheets for it.  Fortunately, we found these Gerber sheets, which are actually designed to be a full-size crib sheet, but all the reviews complain that they are way too small for a full-size crib mattress.So we took a chance, bought a couple of them, washed them in hot water, and they fit perfectly on our mini-crib mattress!I'm only giving them four stars because we are not using them for their intended purpose, but if you are looking for a fitted sheet for a thick mini-crib mattress, these do the trick nicely, plus they are made from organic cotton.  We love them.
