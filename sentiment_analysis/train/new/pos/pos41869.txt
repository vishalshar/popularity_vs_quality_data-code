I bought these for my three year old great grandson. He is thrilled to have his own special mug while I am thrilled with the way they close tightly, eliminating spills. The mugs keep his milk cold from bedtime to breakfast and we always have a second mug fixed and placed on a shelf in the refrigerator that the boy can reach. The built-in straw works great.
