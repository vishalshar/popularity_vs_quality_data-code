These teethers are wonderful. They're the perfect size for a baby's little grabby hands, and the different textures keep them interesting. My 6-month-old son chews on these things constantly and they're still in perfect condition. The colors are in the silicone and not painted on, so he isn't chewing dyes off like he does with some of the squeak-toy type teethers.They're sturdy and well-made and there's no chance he'll be able to bite pieces out of them. Some of his other teething toys (Sophie) are made of thinner material and I worry that once he has more teeth he'll bite through them. The silicone these are made of is smooth and bendable enough that he doesn't hurt himself (or me!) when he's flailing them around. They do collect a lot of fluff and pet hair when they hit the floor, but I think anything covered in baby drool is likely to have that problem. I just tied a pacifier clip to one of them and clipped it to his bib so I wouldn't need to retrieve and rinse it as often.I just can't recommend these enough. I've bought some for three baby showers since I discovered how great they are!
