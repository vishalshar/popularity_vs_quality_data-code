This has become a staple in my bag.... I have used it all summer. It is lightweight, easy to set up and take down, and big enough for my daughter to have some room and holds the bugs out. It is also strong enough to drape a beach towel over it for additional sun protection. This has made life great for my new baby while my 2 year old plays at the park. LOVE THIS THING!!!
