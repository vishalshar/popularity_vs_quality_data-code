I bought this toothbrush as soon as my baby got a mouthful of teeth.  It's great in the beginning to get your baby used to brushing teeth and to maneuver around the mouth and get the teeth clean.  If you have bigger fingers it might not fit.  My husband did use it as well, but it was more snug on his finger.  The downside is if you have a biter, you WILL feel your baby's teeth through this!  I have pretty much stopped using this brush and moved onto a baby brush with a handle because of the biting issue.  However, for overnight trips and travel we still take this one along because it's so compact and travel-ready.
