We've had the "Diaper Dekor" system for 6 months now and it's the best invention because 1) it keeps odors in, 2) it's very user friendly, and 3) it can be easily used for other things after the kids grow out of the diaper stage.I had a "diaper genie" for 4 years and finally got so fed up with how difficult it was to change the bags that I finally gave up and threw it away.  But I was still stuck with smelly diapers, so I had to find something ASAP.  And off I went on an internet search.  I'm so glad that I chose the "Diaper Dekor" for all the reasons I mentioned above.  In addition it has a handy foot pedal so you don't even need to have your hands free to use it.  And it has a real neutral look so you can easily continue to use it as a bathroom trashcan... or whatever.Actually, we're planning on getting cats and I'm thinking this will be a real easy way to dispose of the litter box contents if for some reason we run into problems flushing the clumping litter.  Kinda like a diaper pail for kitties!In case you're trying to decide between this and the "Diaper Genie", I'd say don't bother with that Genie!!  Over time the round disk that the refill bag fits around gets all messed up on the bottom... the easiest way to describe it is 'chewed up' so it doesn't sit well (or eventually AT ALL) on the diaper genie.On the other hand, the design of the Diaper Dekor is so simple that it doesn't pose a problem with use or refills.  It takes literally seconds to remove the contents or put a new refill in.I scanned some reviews and noticed one from someone complaining about having trouble finding refills.  I haven't looked in local stores, but came on back to amazon.com and there it was.  If I find something that works so well, it's worth it to me to purchase it on the net.  But then again, I buy frequently on the net, so this doesn't phase me.
