My toddler was going through a stage where bath time was SO much drama.  She didn't like to even hear the words "bath time", let alone come within a foot of the bathtub!  I was trying everything from lavender scented products (to supposedly calm her!), different bubble baths, bath "paints", tons of different bath toys.  When I saw these, I figured, heck what's one (well...3) more toys?  My daughter is just in love with Winnie-the-Pooh right now.  I figured it was worth a shot.  Oh thank heaven, something finally worked!  I sat in the bathtub playing with the toys and she showed interest.  So her daddy asked her if she wanted to get in the bath so she could play with them too, and she said "YES!"  Ahhhhh.  I felt they were a little pricey, but ultimately, it's been worth it!  Still her favorite toys in a sea full of bath toys.
