I love it. Perfect for busy moms and taller parents . Extended handle bars make it perfect. It came with so many new cool features. Extra seat pad/liner one side baby blue the other navy blue. Cool reflectors on all wheels and on hood.and an item I was not aware that was included was the boot for the stroller to keep your child's feet warm in winter comes with the stroller. Also has neck pads and head cushion and rain cover and a neat travel tag .I would recommend this stroller to any one looking for a good stroller it's perfect .
