I love how bright the colors are. My daughter loves liking at them. My favorite part is the ability to fold the mat flat (including the arches)! It's perfect for travel and storage. The toys are a big hit, the only complaint is the sun: it has to be hit pretty hard in order for the sound to come on (and it's not great sound) so we just took out the battery box. This is easily washed (I put in my front-loader frequently and air dry) as well as the toys (just throw them in a laundry bag). Many friends have other brands and designs but they all comment on mine! Worth the purchase.
