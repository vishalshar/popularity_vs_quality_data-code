How do you know if your infant is growing in a consistent manner? Are you feeding him or her enough?This scale answered these questions for my wife and I. We would check the progress chart on our iPhone's daily as we weighed our daughter before bath time each night.She is on the small side, but we are confident she's trending consistently in the right direction for weight (and height) thanks to this scale and the charting app. This is the best item we have ever bought for our new born.When she got sick and vomited for a week off and on, her weight dropped significantly and this is confirmed by the chart. Without this scale we would not have been able to confidently know how well our child was or was not doing in regards to growth.
