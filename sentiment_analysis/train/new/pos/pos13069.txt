I searched all over for weeks for a diaper table that had room to have the wipes next to the changing pad. This is it. The cherry color matched our crib from babies r us. The price was excellent compared to baby furniture stores.It took a couple of hours to assemble. I like having 3 drawers plus a cabinet. I thought the diaper genie would fit in the cabinet drawer but it was a little too tall. This holds all her clothes, blankets, and medicine, lotions,etc.
