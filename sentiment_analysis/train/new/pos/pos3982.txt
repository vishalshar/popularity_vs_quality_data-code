UPDATE: I purchased this when my daughter was still in my belly...now that she is in her toddler age, we wanted to convert it in to a bed for her to sleep...apparently this DOES NOT CONVERT IN TO A TODDLER BED...This is slightly disappointing as we were under the impression that it did when it was bought (since the description says it does).  I still think this was a good purchase for the cost though!  The crib has held up very nicely.  One of the drawers on the changing table is not aligned anymore, but still functions.I am sure if you are looking at this, you already know how expensive the nursery sets are for your little bundle of joy...I am not paying thousands of dollars for furniture that will be replaced when my daughter needs a toddler bed and is potty trained!  The furniture looks so cute.  To be honest, the crib never really gets used since my daughter sleeps in our bed, but it looks really cute in the room and works great when she does go in it for naps.  I use the changing table probably about 10 times a day, and it is perfect for storage.  I use the two cubbies for burp rags, blankets, and some of her toys.  I use the bottom drawer for extra sheets and things for her, and the top drawer stores the extra diapers and wipes.  I would recommend this to anyone that needs an inexpensive, adorable, and easy to assemble nursery set.The shipment was quick and nothing got damaged.  The box was huge and since I received it when I was 8 months pregnant, I could not lift it on my own.  I did assemble most of it on my own as it was pretty easy.  It comes with everything that you need!  In addition to the furniture, I even got a safety strap to attach the changing table to the wall to prevent from tipping over.Thank you for reading my review, please let me know if you found this to be helpful.
