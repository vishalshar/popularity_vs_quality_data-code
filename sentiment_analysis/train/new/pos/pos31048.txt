I purchased 3 of these cups for my 2 year old twins and I love them!  I haven't had any problems with them leaking and my boys can drink from them easily.  They are a bit picky to clean as most straw cups are,  but reasonable.  If you hold the straws up to the light you can make sure they are clean inside.  I recommend using a bottle nipple brush to really get in there and scrub them.  You can also buy replacement straws which is great!  The only "negative" I have found is that after only a month of use the Spongebob decals are already scratched up and starting to fade.  Not sure why as I hand wash them, but it doesn't really matter to me anyway.  Great for every day use and for travel!
