Out of the box, this set is cute, but not overly impressive -- UNTIL! -- it is laundered. The planes on these sheets are well-transferred and will not fray or pick. The only quibble a perfectionist might have is that there is a bit of a crinkle in the fabric around each embroidered plane right out of the dryer. Big deal. It would come out if ironed, but why bother? The colors are deep and rich. The fabric is luxurious. The edging is well-done and not at all shoddy. And the microsuede is the softest thing you'll ever snuggle up with. *I* want one.The sheets are nothing to write home about. Plain white, kinda' thin. Meh. The real investment is the comforter and the sham. My son ADORES it. I was a tad worried he would not react well to his new Big Boy decor, but he was stoked about it from the moment I got it in the nursery. I also ordered the window valances, but skipped the bed skirt -- seemed costly for something so small. Very smart looking and crisp. My husband was even impressed and he's NEVER impressed!Highly recommended.
