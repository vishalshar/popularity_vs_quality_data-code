My 1 year old son loves this ball and I wish we would have gotten it earlier. Such a simple thing, but he can find so many ways to play with it.As for not being able to choose the color--who freaking cares? It's a ball. A boy can have a pink ball. Get over it. It's not like it's a sweater (which, if my son wanted a pink sweater, again, who cares).Strongly recommend this!
