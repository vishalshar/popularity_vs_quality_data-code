Great little suspenders in function. I didn't have any problem adjusting them, and they're holding tight to my two-year-old's active self. Color is good. I dinged them a star for the fact that "clips n grips" is imprinted on the back of the suspenders in a way that can't be hidden if not wearing a jacket. (It's on the little faux leather piece that holds the three pieces together.) In the case of our grey suspenders, it's the same grey color as the material itself so it's not terribly obvious. However I would have liked to have seen that in a photo before buying (I would have gone with another company). Or I would have been fine with that imprint on the inside of the suspenders.
