I read a lot of reviews about this product when I was considering ordering it and was really concerned about whether it was "completely safe."  I am very sensitive to smells- especially chemical ones.  And I tend to think that if something does have a chemical smell that it is most likely off-gassing something that I really don't want around my daughter.So I contacted Boon to ask them about it.  They replied to my email within less than a day and this is the entire reply, copied and pasted:**************************************************Angie,Thank you for emailing us directly.  We enjoy hearing from our customers.To answer your question about the Boon Bath Goods, the shapes and the scrubbies in the Bath Goods are BpA-free, Phthalate-free, and PVC-free.The following details the materials that our Bath Goods are made of:~ The Bath Goods shapes are made of EVA foam.~ The scrubbies are made of polyethylene.~ The original Bath Goods bath balls are BpA-free and Phthalate-free. They're made out of a type of PVC which has been tested for all of the dangerous phthalates as called out by California and other state laws. Because of consumer concerns about PVC in general, we are now including a different type of bath ball in our new Bath Goods sets.  The new bath ball is BpA-free, Phthalate-free, and PVC-free.  Again, the original bath ball does not contain any phthalates that have been identified as being harmful. The new bath balls included in the Bath Goods sets have a shiny finish, compared to the original Bath Goods balls which have more of a matte finish.If you have the Bath Good set that contains the original bath balls and would like to have the newer version, please email us a photo of your Bath Goods set to verify purchase. We will then send you a set of the new bath balls.Best Regards,Erica***************************************************I was really impressed with this reply and went ahead and ordered the bath set.  My set had absolutely no bad odor whatsoever and I am VERY sensitive to smell.That being said, besides being safe, this is just an excellent product.  We got it because a month ago (at 8 months old) my baby was suddenly terrified of the bath.  We tried bathing her in every conceivable way but she still screamed bloody murder and lifted her feet away from the water like it was filled with sharks.  We decided to try some California Baby bubble bath (another product which i highly recommend) and this bath set at the same time.  It worked perfectly.  Now bath time is my baby's favorite time of the day (and often, mine too because she's so happy!).  She loves to hold a foam shape in each hand and use them to pop the bubbles, hit the balls and splash the water.  She also loves the balls- we've reserved one as a non-bath toy and it's one of her favorite toys- sometimes it's the simplest things!!  And I love that the set comes with 2 scrubbies that are non-toxic.  We use one to wash her up (and it's the perfect size) and she loves to play with the other one and watch the water drip off of it when she hold it up.  I like that I don't have to worry about her putting any of the things in her mouth (and she puts them all in her mouth) because they are safe and non-toxic.I cannot recommend this bath set or this company enough!!
