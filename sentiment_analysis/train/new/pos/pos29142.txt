I retuned my previous Summer Infant changing pad because it had an awful burnt chemical smell that got worse everyday. It actually stunk up our entire upstairs, which is 5 rooms. I couldn't  imagine keeping that locked up in our poor baby's room. This Colgate pad has absolutely no odor, and it didn't even fresh out of the box. Our changing pad cover fits over it great. Looking forward to using it for baby.
