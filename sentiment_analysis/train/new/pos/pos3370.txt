Philips Avent BPA Free Breast Milk Storage Starter Set, Clear, 6 Ounce, 10 Count (Discontinued by Manufacturer)Yes yes and more yes I thought these were ok for milk storage but it turns out great for lots of other things, too, I have used these for homemade babyfoods , they are great little snack holders for diaper bags.  I used a pack to store homemade playdo even.  Of course they are firdge and freeezer safe, bpa free.  I only used these for milk a couple times but trust me I have found another hundred uses for this product.  It really is a great multi use container.I like to write reviews I wrote this review without a discount and I paid full price for this item!I like to purchase through amazon because I often find the best prices around.All my opinions are my own,  please feel free to ask any questions you may have.
