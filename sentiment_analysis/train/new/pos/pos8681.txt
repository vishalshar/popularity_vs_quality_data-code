I bought this when my baby grew out of her medium Workhorse fitted diapers and the fit is perfect for my 21lb, 26" tall, chunky 7 month old with much room to grow.  The diaper fits under a Flip snap cover just fine.  I have only used it a couple of times, so I might have to come back and update this review, but as for this first few times using it, I am not disappointed.  I'm not ready to tell you that this diaper is going to put other companies out of business, because my kid is not necessarily a "heavy wetter," but for our regular nighttime solution, this did the trick and wasn't completely sopping wet in the morning, which I always hated about the cotton fitteds.  It's pretty soft for right now.  Usually hemp stiffens and gets scratchy over time though so we shall see.  I was hesitant to spend twice what I would on the cotton Workhorse diapers, but I truly feel as though I'm getting twice the value with this diaper.
