The songs are a little fast - it would be nice to be able to sing along - but I love how the main melody is started with the big main button, and the child can add harmony and percussion. Yes, it's loud and there is no volume control. Fortunately, our grandson loves music and so do we, so we don't mind. Not sure how many songs there are. At least ten.
