Absolutely loved this kit. Of course it takes some work but it came out great. My mom did my shoulders all the way down to my thighs and I still have enough to put an extra layer in back to strengthen it some. I still have to sand it but I can't wait to decorate it. Shipping was right on time as well so even if you didn't order way ahead of time like me you should be fine.
