This is the most amazing pillow ever.  I had one when I was pregnant and used it for years afterwards, but it got ruined (my fault).  I bought a cheaper maternity pillow last year in hopes that it would be as comfy and no way!  Finally got this one again and I am in heaven!  I am not pregnant, but I am very overweight.  This pillow helps me sleep comfortably in several different positions and I wake up with no lower back pain.  I do get pretty warm and often sweaty sleeping with it, but I sleep so comfortably during the night that I don't notice till the next morning.
