This mirror was much bigger than I expected but for me that is a good thing. I can see the car seat very well (I'm sure I'll see baby when he comes), however it was hard to install on my car. I was kind of anticipating this because I live in Japan and have an older japanesse car (very similar to a 4 runner). It was super easy to SAFELY "jimmy rig" it. To me this is a great mirror, just not made for all cars (especially SUVs).
