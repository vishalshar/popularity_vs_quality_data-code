**photos of two kits.I have sensitive skin and I did get a little red on removal but no big deal. You get gritty stuff all over too so prepare to shower after.Super messy! Comes with a floor cover which is amazing. Precut the strips!! You'll hate yourself if you dont. Lube up with the lotion (says its natural but smells like baby powder so I'm not so sure.) Get a bowl of warm water, wet strips; theyll drip like crazy and slap em on. Some will roll up and you'll have to learn when it's a goner.Some of my strips were faulty with little to no plaster powder on them.This really is not a job for one person (which I kind of figured but thought I'd try.)I'm not pregnant but rather have boobs pointing to the east and west of the nations and needed to create a bra form for sewing '.It took about 30 minutes for a thin layered chest and tummy form.Good luck!!
