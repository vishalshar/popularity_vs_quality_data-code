Out of desperation after weeks of standing by our 9 month old baby's crib until he fell asleep, because all he wanted to do was stand and cry, we finally bit the bullet and bought this item.  It's definitely overpriced!  On the other hand, it's hard to imagine not having this anymore.  I'm very thankful to know that my baby is safely lying down in his crib and not crammed in some corner or standing.  It also worked great in his pack-n-play on our recent roadtrip.  It does get dirty pretty quickly since it's white.  The only reasons why I didn't give this 5 stars was due to the price and it would be nice to have another color choice. Would I buy again?  Definitely!!!
