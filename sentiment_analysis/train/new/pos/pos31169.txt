I have both Balboa Baby and Bebe au Lait nursing covers. Balboa Baby provides way better coverage due to its curved lateral and bottom portion which helps to protect the naked sides bilaterally. Bebe Au Lait does not have such curved sides and I was always trying to pull the sides down, due to exposure. Get this one!!
