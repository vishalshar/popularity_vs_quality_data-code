I give this product 4 stars because they are called burp cloths. They are way to small for that - I need a whole swaddling blanket myself! But these are GREAT all-purpose wipes. Very durable and strong, super soft, amazingly absorbent even though they are super thin; they can be crumpled up and stuffed in a pocket. They are very expensive but they last, so it's worth it to me. I don't like thick and bulky wipes or cloths. I have even used these as makeshift drool catchers when I'm out and without a bib and can't believe how much they absorb considering they're almost tissue thin. Also my baby has eczema so I love the softness for wiping his skin.
