Not sure why the previous reviewer said this car seat protector was hard to install???  I have a 2010 Toyota 4Runner and installed it in less than 5 minutes.  Can of corn.  Works perfectly and protects the leather seats from the kids spills, accidents, etc.  I highly recommend this product if you have kids but make sure to measure your back seat first to ensure it fits.  Very few out there to choose from.  I looked high and low for something like this and this seems to best product out there.  I gave it 5 stars b/c I haven't found anything wrong with it.
