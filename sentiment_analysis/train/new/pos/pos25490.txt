If your child has never played a game, this would make a good introduction to board games. The game comes with four toddlers card board tokes for markers. Two girls, two boys, with happy faces and each its own color, (red, purple, yellow, & green). The board has a roll of toilet paper starting the beginning and leading to the end where a child is on the potty, you move along the roll of paper. There are only three options, move to the next star, rolly (roll of toilet paper character), or no move. Simple, not overwhelming for little ones. Example of card: "You didn't need any help, you pulled your pants up all by yourself" "Move to the next star". The sturdy cardboard cards are nice size for toddlers hands. The cards will have a picture, but children still will need help to know where to move, some of the cards have a picture of stars or rolly which are helpful, wish all were like that for the little ones to know when they draw their own card. Example of a Stay here card, "Uh-oh. Your pants look droopy next time use the potty to make a poopie".I like the game. It geared towards learning about potty and little rhymes seem to help, even when my child doesn't seem to be listening but excited about moving or drawning cards. It teaches taking turns and stop and listen. Until your little one gets use to how to play, like training, you need to repeat and be patient. The game doesn't take long to play, which is perfect for this age, but it hasn't changed anything with our struggles of using the potty.It wasn't the answer for us, but its still a great first game that's well made. Would recommend because your still going to have a happy child who wants to play, don't have any expectations,  that way you won't be let down, just have fun
