These cups are fantastic. I had started my 6 month old on the Nuk Learner cup with a soft nipple so that he easily transitioned from bottle to sippy. However, as he got older and the teething got worse, he chewed on them so much that he ripped slits in the nipples. In come the Playtex Insulator! Around a year old I switched him to these and because he was already used to having to suck harder to get liquid out of the Nuk, he took to these very well.I wouldn't recommend as the first sippy you try with your baby because it does take a lot of sucking power, however they are great for older babies and toddlers! The video I saw when purchasing of kids throwing them on the ground upside down really works! As long as you empty the valves between fills and make sure you screw the lid to the "Twist and Click" indicator, THEY DON'T SPILL!! :-D  <---Perfect solution to the problem of bottles being spilt in the crib. No more bottles for my boy! These cups are fantastic.
