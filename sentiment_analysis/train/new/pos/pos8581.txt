I purchased this item for my almost 3 month old. I love these rattles. My son hasn't gotten to play with them yet since he's still learning to play. But  they seem sturdy enough. I washed them off with a sponge and mild dish soap and they didn't hold any water after being left to dry overnight. I also love the variety. The items i received were almost exact to the picture.The bottle we received was pink. I don't know if they have blue bottles as well or not, but i don't mind, i just sat it in the kitchen to use for spare change. I mostly purchased for the rattles anyways.
