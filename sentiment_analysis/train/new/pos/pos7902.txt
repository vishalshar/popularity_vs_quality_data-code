Excellent little monitors. I've had no problem with static despite the number of electrical appliances running in and around my house. The sound is very clear and I rarely have to turn the volume up higher than the minimum. The light meter is very accurate and defines between baby noise and other noise (radio, fan etc.) well. I've read complaints about this model that you can't mute the sound completely which is true, but I don't know why you'd want to do that anyway, you might as well not bother having a monitor if you're not going to listen to it. Amazingly for such quality it's one of the lowest priced monitor sets on the market even at full price, and can often be found on sale so you really can't beat it.Edited to add: Units seem very durable. I have dropped one of the units several times while using it as a portable and it still works fine, the battery cover has stayed in place and the casing hasn't chipped or cracked. Note: I've seen these priced at anything up to $100 from independent retailers. Be careful and shop around as they should sell for around $30.
