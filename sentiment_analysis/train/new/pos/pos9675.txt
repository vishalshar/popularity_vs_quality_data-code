We received several sleep sacks as gifts and hand me downs for our summer baby, including Halo and Carters. The T shirt like material of most sacks was good for summer, but when our boy outgrew the fleece sacks and started getting cold when the temperature dropped, I looked for a new option. I knew I was looking for:- a side zip for easier entry of a sleeping baby and night time diaper access- snaps rather than velcro at the shoulders to prevent scratches to his face and laundry mangling- a mid to heavy weight for sleeping in a 65F room in New England- generous sizing for long use with my big babyafter looking over several options, the Grobags hit all the marks. They're not cheap but well worth the price. The 6-18 month easily fit my big boy at about 5 months and 17 pounds and he will be able to use it all winter. It's January now, and he is 27" with room to grow. He is able to roll around in bed and sit up in his crib while the bag is on, but has not stood up while wearing it.The 2.5tog weight is like a light quilt, and the outer material is a nice smooth cotton (much more breathable than fleece in my experience).There are few minor things I dislike about the design:- the liner is plain white, which means stains are a possibility. I would prefer a bright color like orange to coordinate with the prints.- I find the snap above the zipper to be a bit fiddly to use, which is fine because the zipper pull tucks into a little pocket to keep it from poking baby- I had to hunt for Grobags with the side zipper rather than a front zipper - make sure you are buying the design you want!All in all this is a comfortable and easy to use sack, which I will likely be giving as a gift long after my boy has grown out of them himself!
