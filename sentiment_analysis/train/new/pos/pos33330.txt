Well, I don't know what the other reviews are talking about, this booster was perfect! The strap was perfectly fine for my 15 month old. Frankly, I have no idea why you would need a strap for a 2+ year old. My 2 year old son doesn't even sit in a booster anymore, and when he does he doesn't use the strap. But, even then, I am sure it would still fit him. When I bought this, I figured if the strap really was TOO short, I would just cut the middle strap off and keep the clip clipped into one side of the waist strap and just click it in the other side when I needed it. for this price, I was willing to do that! BUT, didn't need to. It worked just fine. i also LOVE how it has TWO straps for attaching it to the chair! One to go around the back and one to go around the seat. It doesnt budge an inch! Also, the height is perfect. This is a great booster and the cheapest price you'll find. Cute muted color too. I am wondering if maybe they have changed the strap since all the other reviews were written?
