These little trays are so snazzy!  I have 2- a red and a blue for my 6-year old and my 3-year old.  They are small, so be aware that a full-size coloring book or piece of letter-sized paper will not fit on the tray vertically, but kids can still color easily with those items sitting on top with the border (the part that is in color) folded down.  The border is flexible but still holds in goldfish and cheerios.  The tray perfectly sits between the sides of a standard full-back booster seat and the belt can go around either the child or the car seat so that it doesn't fall forward and off the child's lap.  The drink holder holds a normal sized sippy cup or water bottle, and the material can be wiped with water, dishwater, or even sprayed with a basic cleaner- it's super easy to clean.  The whole thing is a dense foam, so it's soft but still a good color/play/snack surface.  The side pockets are quite small (think a 10 count pack of skinny markers or deck of flash cards).  They detach, so you can throw them/their contents into a bag for when you hit a rest stop and want to take in things for your kids to do.
