These are improved over the previous version. The dividers extend all the way up to the lid so that small food stays separated.  My only complaint about the previous version was that food would fall from one compartment to another, but I ordered more even without knowing they had fixed this issue.  They are the perfect size and shape for my kids' school lunches. Actually, they are big enough for my husband to use for his lunches, as well.  I can fit this box plus a thermos brand kids' water bottle in the typical child's soft, rectangular lunch box.  It looks like they are still selling the old ones on here, so I recommend checking to be sure you're getting the new version.  FYI, the lids are NOT interchangeable between the old and new versions.
