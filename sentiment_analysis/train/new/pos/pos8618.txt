Our five year old daughter chews on EVERYTHING.It was driving me nuts... Now, I just have to nag her to not suck on it, once every couple of days.  And she LOVES the pink owl.About the only thing that didn't work out great is that it has one of those nifty easy-pull-apart clasps.Guess what she chewed up?  The cord is long enough to tie a bow and for her to still put it on at will, anyways.
