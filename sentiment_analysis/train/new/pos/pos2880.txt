As others noted this is one clip with a different design on each side. I also purchased an Ulubulu clip and between the two this one is shorter, which I like because my baby is only 2 months old. The Bella Tunno clip is easier to open and close (but not so much that the baby can do it) and has a cute design on it. The only reason I took off a star is because the label with the company's name is huge and unappealing, so I spent a couple of minutes cutting it off carefully with tiny scissors.
