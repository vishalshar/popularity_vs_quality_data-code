Took me a bit to realize you have to push the button on the side to roll the shade back up as opposed to pulling it all the way down like traditional shades, but otherwise I think they'll work out great. They seem very sturdy and it will be easy to roll up and/or remove when we don't need them.My only critique is that it seems like once the car heats up and the "white hot sensor" shows that the car is "HOT", it stays that way and doesn't go back to the original red, even after the car has been in a cool garage all night and then had the AC running for 30 minutes...
