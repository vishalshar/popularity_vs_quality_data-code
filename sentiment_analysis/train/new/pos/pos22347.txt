This makes bath time pretty fun(for my daughter and myself). She loves to play in the waterfall of water as it comes out, for me personally i just love how peaceful it makes my a bath. i had originally bought this as a faucet cover to protect my daughter during bath time but its really so much more than that. it makes bath time into an almost spa like experience.Its easy to get on and off and very easy to clean. i just throw it in the dishwasher
