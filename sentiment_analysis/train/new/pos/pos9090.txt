I got the VentAire bottles used, so I just bought new nipples and replacement disks for the bottoms.  The Playtex VentAire bottles work just like the Playtex drop ins, and they even take the same nipples.  But, with the VentAire bottles you don't have to buy replacement liners every 30 days.  The vent disk at the bottom lets air in while the baby eats, and doesn't let milk out when the bottle is upright.  For the momma that needs to be frugal, but doesn't want to sacrifice quality, the VentAire bottles work the same as the drop ins keeping air out of baby's belly and money in your wallet!
