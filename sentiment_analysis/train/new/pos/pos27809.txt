Very happy with this product. I am a Speech-Language Pathologist and work with individuals with feeding/swallowing disorders. Purchased this for my children and prefer it to similar products. Both of my kids were able to drink from straws and from this cup independently by 6 months old. The design of the cup helps them create a good lip seal and control the amount of liquid. The angle of the cup allows the infant/toddler to see around the cup as well as into the cup and does not require them to extend their neck or tip the cup too far in order to get a drink, so they don't end up dumping it all over themselves and drowning in it. It's a heavy plastic which was nice to see because many of the nosey cups are out of very thin, flimsy plastic and people tend to do better with a more solid cup and steady pressure to their lower lip/jaw. Initially I thought the handles were too small and they may be for kids with fine motor issues, but was surprised to see both children did better with these handles over bulkier ones. It's difficult to find good cups for young children that are developmentally appropriate. The plastic is nice and durable and overall design of the cup is aesthetically pleasing. It is also easy to clean. I frequently put smoothies in it. This one is a keeper!
