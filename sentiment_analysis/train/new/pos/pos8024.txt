I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT ORDERING AN ITEM LIKE THIS ONLINE W/OUT TRYING IT OUT FIRST BUT I WAS PLEASANTLY SUPRISED. THE PROBLEM I HAD WHEN LOOKING IN STORES FOR A GLIDER WAS THAT EVERYTHING I SAW WAS INCREDIBLY CHEAP AND UGLY OR INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE ($600+) I LOOKED ONLINE AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT SITES FOR QUITE AWHILE AND DID NOT FIND ANYTHING I FELL IN LOVE WITH AS MUCH AS THIS GLIDER. I WAS ORIGINALLY HOPING TO GET A GLIDER AND OTTOMAN FOR $300 OR LESS AND WITH TAX, S/H I SPENT ABOUT $400 FOR THE GLIDER AND THE MATCHING OTTOMAN BUT IT WAS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY! IT IS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL IN PERSON THAN IT IS ON THE WEBSITE. THE FABRIC IS THICK, SOFT AND PLUSH, IT IS VERY ROOMY AND THE CUSHIONING ON THE ARMS FASTENS SECURELY TO THE CHAIR SO IT DOESN'T ROLL AROUND.THE MAGAZINE HOLDERS ON BOTH SIDES ARE VERY HANDY. THE ITEM SHIPPED PROMPTLY WITH ALL THE PIECES INTACT AND WAS EASY TO ASSEMBLE, EVEN FOR MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF WHO ARE NOT AT ALL HANDY. NOW MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS GLIDER IS THAT I CAN'T GET MY HUSBAND OUT OF IT SO I CAN SIT IN IT :) -HE LOVES IT AS MUCH AS I DO, I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT OUT WHEN OUR BABY COMES. I CAN'T SEE HOW ANYONE WHO ORDERS THIS ITEM COULD BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL. THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS A VERY PLESANT ONE, I WOULD DEFINETLY ORDER FROM BABIES R US AGAIN!
