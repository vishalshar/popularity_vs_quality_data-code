We have a Britax B safe infant car seat in the middle seat: there's no head rest to hang a mirror to so we can see our baby. I bought this hoping we could attach it to the car seat handle and see her, and it works! She also loves the fact she can see us and the little toys attached make a little rattle that calms her in fussy moments. I also like that this is not a huge entertainment thing, it's pretty discreet compared to other play arches.On the other hand I'm not sure it's really possible to set it so baby can see herself because of the orientation of the car seat handle. We don't use it for that so we didn't really check (you'd have to put your head in the seat to do that).
