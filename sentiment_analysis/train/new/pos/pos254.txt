This is the best toy that I have purchased for my granddaughter. I watched her three days a week during her first two years. I bought it for her when she was around 8 months or so. She is now two and a half plus and is still playing with this set...she (we) never tire of it. When she first got it she held it, squeezed the crinkle croissant, looked in the muffin mirror and listened to the teapot music ( I'm a little tea pot....).  Eventually she started to pretend to eat, serve tea and squeeze the spout herself and sing the nursery song. It is still one of the first toys she goes to when she comes over. The teapot still plays...it is so well made. The tea cups fall over sometimes but it never mattered. I love the soft toys!I bought this as a gift for my nieces baby girl. This is the first toy review I have written and I highly recommend this set.
