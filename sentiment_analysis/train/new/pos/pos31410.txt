I have a 23 month old and a 6 week old and initially thought the Joovy Caboose would be the stroller for us. Thank goodness we had the opportunity to try one out before we bought it!  With the Joovy, if you have an infant carrier in the front seat, there is no room at all for the older child to sit on the jump seat.  Also, for some strange reason, the jump seat slides back and forth which seems very unsafe.  So if you have an infant in a carrier and your older child wants to sit, the older child is out of luck.  What's the point of that?With this stroller, the older child has 3 options - sit in the back seat, sit on the jump seat or stand on the platform.  The back seat can be removed fairly easily and stored in the basket underneath and my little girl (who is tall for her age) has plenty of room.  She sometimes dangles her feet over the foot rest but this is not an issue.  Our infant carrier easily slides into the front seat and is secured with a belt.This stroller opens and closes easily and is very easy to control as it steers beautifully - it's not nearly as long as I thought it would be but both children have plenty of room. Since it has the footprint of a single stroller, it fits through doors and entranceways with no problem. It is a little heavy when folded but I don't think I would find a stroller with these features that's not.  The basket is nearly impossible to get to but I can live with it.  Overall, I'm thrilled with this purchase and every single time I use it, someone stops me to ask about it.  One woman even said, "That's the most practical double stroller I've ever seen."  I have to agree.
