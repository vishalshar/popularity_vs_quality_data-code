I love this little seat. We used it to start feeding out 5 month old solids until she was big enough for the big highchair. Now we use it for her to sit with us on the couch. Of course you must watch them at all times while they are in the chair as she is 9 months now and can tip it over on the couch pretty easily. But it helps her stay in one place so we don't have to make sure she's not crawling right off the couch cusions. We did get more use out of it when she was younger, but she has a baby brother on the way that will get more use out of it. I do wish I would have gotten the one with the tray though so she could have had easier access to her toys before she could sit up by herself. We also used this as a seat on the floor for her to situp and play with toys before she could do it on her own. All in all I am very glad we got this!
