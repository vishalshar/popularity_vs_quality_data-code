I bought this almost 7 years ago and we still use it.  The cushion did not survive after my oldest was done with it so we've been using a little pillow or dish towels for our 2nd and 3rd child until they are stable sitters.  This chair has lasted and it's heavy enough that I don't worry about our kids tipping it over.  After my youngest is done with it we'll be passing it along to friends.  It's worth the investment.
