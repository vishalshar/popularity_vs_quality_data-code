I love this warmer. I haven't had any problems with it at all. I use cottontails brand wipes which work great and pop-up. I think the issue people are having overall is with the brand of wipes (ones that are too wet) not the warmer. Cottontails is a generic brand but I love them because they are not overly soaking wet (like more expensive Huggies). So if you just get the right wipe you will be fine. The wipes don't stay warm for a tremendous amount of time but they take that initial icy-ness off and that is what I wanted.
