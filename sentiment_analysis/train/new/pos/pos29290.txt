I am a kid-proofing pro, as I have an autistic 17 year old boy in the house.  Problem is, typical kid-proofing pieces are all plastic and he can just rip those babies off.  My refrigerator is a constant problem, and I searched a long time.  Bicycle cable locks are way too long, and although I found a keyed padlock with a hasp just long enough to go over the french door handles, I was terrified of losing the key.  This combo cable is adjustable and strong, and no key to lose.  I can change the combination if ever I need to as well!
