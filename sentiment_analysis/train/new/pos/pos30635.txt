The concept was great and I have no issues with the seller themselves.  What I do have an issue with is the product.  I was hoping to be able to use this to keep our lil ones out of the closet.  Each one seems to change clothes numerous times throughout the day.  Not sure why.  Either way, Toddlers have no issues ripping the door open and that thing just fly's off without much pulling on the doors.  If you're wanting to keep infants, small pets or the door just opening on it's own because the door track is not level, this will work fine.  For toddlers, I found the cheap $1.50 hook and loop did the job.  If they really yank on it, I'm pretty sure the bi-fold doors are coming down or the hook and loop will be pulled out of the door but they haven't figured that out yet.  I put it right at the top so the grooves really had some wood to bite into.  Good luck.
