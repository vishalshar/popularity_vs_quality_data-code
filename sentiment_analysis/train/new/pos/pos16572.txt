we love our quinny buzz! Heavy but its a full size stroller, the push and unfold features are really great! The only reason I am giving a 4 stars is because the back tires are coming flat. But overall really satisfied and this seller is an authorize seller from quinny (I have check through quinny's web and customer service).On the picture, my wife has upgrade the canopy to the xtra large one (didn't like the canopy with peek-a-boo windows).
