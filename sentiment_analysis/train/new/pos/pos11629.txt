This blanket was a favorite of mine for both my kids.  The marquisette for my daughter (born in summer) and the flannel for my son (born in winter).  Great size for swaddling, holds up well in the wash.  The blanket is large and can be used for a play blanket or nursing cover in a pinch.  I've given it several friends and all of them have loved it!
