Excellent construction. There are tons of kids aprons on Amazon, and I would not recommend cheaping out. This is legit canvas. It also has a magnet neck strap, which is amazing and I didn't realize from the product description that it was there.My 2 year old loves to "help" with cooking and doing dishes and she loves wearing this. I'm very happy I got this for her.
