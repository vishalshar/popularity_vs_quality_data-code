I like this bag a lot!  It is, by far, my favorite diaper bag and I've owned three in my 2.5 years as a parent.  A Skip Hop that claimed to be waterproof but was not, and a Petunia Picklebottom that is too small and too flowery.  I ordered this bag before a plane trip I planned to take with my young daughter because I needed a bag that could hold a fair amount of stuff without weighing me down.  This bag was affordable and had a reserved style I prefer.  The interior pockets have been great and the stroller straps very convenient.  The ONLY downside:  it is made so cheaply but that's what you get for 20 bucks I guess.  I still carry it even though the stroller straps have long ago come off of the bag, the interior pockets have ripped away from the lining, and the faux leather strap is separating.  I think I  may order another because for 20 bucks, why not.  If I could suggest one thing to change: make a $50 bag that would last longer with real leather straps and I'd be a life long customer.
