I had the infant towels from the big box baby store and after a few washes it started getting crunchy and they were way to thin. I searched everywhere for a thick, soft and larger bath towel for my 22lb 15 month old. There are some great ones out there but they were more than $50! I just think that's insane for a toddlers towel. I have only washed this about 3 times, but so far it's still soft and very absorbent! It keeps him nice and warm too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because they could have made it slightly longer than wider. No toddler needs it to be that wide! But I would still highly recommend it. We use Molly's Suds to wash it and no fabric softener either. So with that being said I'm happy how it's holding up so far! Great price too. You can't beat it!
