I ordered these for my nephew, and I ended up ordering three more packs.My sister adores them, she says they are much softer than the hooded towels she bought at Babies R' Us and BuyBuy Baby - and cuter too!My nephew is a big boy - he was born at almost nine pounds. He is five months old and wears 12 month old clothes... I feared that these would not fit him as they are intended. The size was not an issue, especially since he is incredibly tall for his age.The packaging is adorable, it looks just like the picture. They wash quite well too, no fading or loss of softness.One of my friends is pregnant and I already bought her a pack of these for her baby shower. Everybody I buy them for adores them.Highly recommend!!
