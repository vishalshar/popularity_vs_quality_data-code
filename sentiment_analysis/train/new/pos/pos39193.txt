I've been using this pump for about 6 weeks.  I chose it over the Medela because I like the Avent bottles and wanted to stick to one product and be able to pump directly into the bottles I'd be using.  I think it works great - when I had my daughter 4 years ago I tried the Avent manual pump and liked the design, but found the manaul pumping a little tedious.  This has the same design, but does the pumping for you.  I have found the motor strong using both electricity and the battery pack.  The only drawback is that the motor is attached to suction cup, so you're holding both while pumping and it gets a bit heavy - but I'm fine with it and like the overall simplicty of the design better than the Medela.
