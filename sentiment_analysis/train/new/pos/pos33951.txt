We are (were:)  think baby bottle users until I discovered these....what a value! They are made well, the nipple is great and even has the most unique nipple I have seen. The no spill cap is built in and does not get lost! Easy to clean and my son loves it. For this price I can replace them often even though they seem to hold up very well and I just like the idea of having a few extra on hand. I have the handles from the think baby cups and they fit them too.
