My baby boy loves this toy bar and so I'm glad we have it. It's been a lifesaver on vacations when he's in his carseat a long time. He didn't start actually playing with it until he was 4 months old but still liked looking at it earlier on.  However, it's a bit of a pain when you have to pull the shade over the carseat to have to remove first (although removing is easy). Also, you aren't supposed to drive with the handle up (carseat guidelines/law) so this really isn't a 'good idea' although we still do (bad parent!!).
