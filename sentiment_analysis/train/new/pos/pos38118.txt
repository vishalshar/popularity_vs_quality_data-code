I think the bag is cute lots of space I myself have a different bag cuz I'm not that big on bigger bags but it looks great and I wanted to see how much I could put in it and trust me when I say I got 2 baby blankets 4 different size drinking cups cuz I have a 1 year old 10 diapers 5 on each side a big 100 cont. diaper wips wallet first ad kit my 13 inch Mac Pro and steal had room. And I didn't really like the stroller straps but my sister doesn't care cuz she doesn't have a stroller.But if you don't like this brand try the bumble bag it's my fav I have the Jessica messenger/ backpack bag it the best hold almost as much but I only have 1 child so it works but they are priceOk it has been 3 months from when i got the bag for my sister and she is steal using it and not like what others have said that it falls apart my sister loves the color and its a very big bag inside even though it looks small from outside. i would say to get this i have gotta another for another family member and i will so get it again for family.
