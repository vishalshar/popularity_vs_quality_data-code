I have been using these pail liners for my cloth diapers for nearly 2 months now... they have exceeded my expectations and performed flawlessly!  They do a great job (coupled with a good pail/can) at keeping stinky diaper odors contained and the nursery smelling fresh.  Just a side note:  I spent a lot of time researching what diaper pail would work the best (for cloth diapers) and discovered a high number of complaints for nearly everything I found.  The best advice I received was to purchase a $40 stainless steel step-can (regular 30 liter trash can) from Target.  It works great with these liners and like I said before, does a terrific job of containing diaper odor and mess!  I am very pleased with the arrangement.
