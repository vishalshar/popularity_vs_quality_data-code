I was kind of skepticle after reading some of the reviews on this but decided to take a chance.  So glad I did!  We took a 20 hour road trip and used this for my 4 year old daughter.  It worked great! It was easy to assemble, and even though some of the other reviews said that it was weakly made, we had no problem.  Yes, it is all plastic so if you force it it will break.  But for us it was easy to put together and take apart, and very sturdy while in use.  The footrest is fully adjustable to fit any height without being obtrusive.  Great product!
