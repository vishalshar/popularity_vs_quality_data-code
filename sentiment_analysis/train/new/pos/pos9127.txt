tl;dr: Made for lazy people. Made for smart people. Made for those of us that fall into both categories.I can't say that this always fits the water bottle that I'm using, but a mini market is never too far away for the purchase of another.Carrying a sippy-cup around when I'm babysitting my niece is a hassle. A diaper bag isn't always provided to me, and frankly, I have enough crud in my purse taking up space.This is a (nearly) guaranteed meltdown stopper and all it takes is a teeny bit of space in my bag.My favorite part? The prevention of major spillage.While she can drink from a cup, the chances of more ending up ON her than IN her are in the ballpark of 99%.This way I don't need a change of clothes, have to explain to my sister why her kid is sticky and (place color here), and I don't have to clean anything up.Oh, and it's BPA free and all that good stuff.
