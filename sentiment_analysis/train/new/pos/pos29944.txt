My baby loves this, we bought a few days ago and she watches it for the full 15 minutes and more.  She is 7 weeks old and is mesmerized.  I didn't realize it but the dolls have counterweight balls that help it rotate under it's cone while it rotates around the tilted axis.  Plus the sliding shapes on top give more for her to watch.  It makes even more interesting to watch. It does not appear to have a silent feature as said in reviews, but we love the music and can't complain.update Feb. 12, 2011I knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars.  We still love it but it is not impressive to me as the v-tech dream & play mobile which is hard to find in the USA from what I can tell.  The features that the v-tech has which tiny love does not is very good volume control which can be adjusted from loud to very faint or no sound.  The other feature I'd love to see is motion control feature that plays soft music and has a soft light that comes on.
