I absolutely love these matte finish screen covers! They resist finger prints SO much better than clear ones do, and fingers seem to move easier across the screen cover when it is matte finish. The matte finish does detract a little bit from the clarity of the image, but I would rather have a "soft looking" image than finger prints and smudges all over my screen. Highly recommended! They are easy to work bubbles out of also, which is great when working with a screen the size of an Ipad.
