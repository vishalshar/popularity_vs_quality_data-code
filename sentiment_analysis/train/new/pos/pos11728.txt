I thought i could use this tub from the very beginning with my son, but even though it came with a hammock insert, i was unable to manage the baby, the water, and the soap all at once with this. I dont think i could have done that with any other tub either though...i ended up using the kitchen or bathroom sink.But once my child was able to hold himself up a bit, this tub was very nice. I fill it with water using the bathtub in my bathroom, then transfer it over to the counter, with the drain of the baby tub over the sink. I then sit my baby in it, wash him up...and when he is all done, i release the drain, so the water drains into the sink. I then use a watering pot to rinse him off with non soapy water. It a wonderful tub and he enjoys playing with the kittle toys it comes with. The seat inside the tub is perfect for him to recline in.
