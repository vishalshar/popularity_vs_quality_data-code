I did a bunch of research before buying this and decided I wanted a jumper as well as a play station.It was a little tedious to put together.  Not difficult mind you just the angles for screwing some of the stuff in was cumbersome.  It is very sturdy and safe.  No little corners etc for him to get his fingers pinched in.The jumper itself is great.  There are 5 height settings so your kid can really grow with it.  You can hang stuff off the bars which gives them stuff at a distance to focus on and grab at.  The batteries are easy to change for the piano (not that I have needed to yet).  The play stations keep my son entertained.  My only complaint is that the piano songs don't play long enough so you have to keep restarting the music.  You can change the mode on the piano to just play notes.My kid loves this jumper and spends ages in it although he still wants an audience so that doesn't help free me up too much!
