I honestly didn't care about the cost, but my baby just didn't like the hard plastic seats that are in all the fancy bouncers nowadays! This was the closest thing I could find to the super simple one my 17 year old son had when he was a baby that he LOVED! Our new baby girl was super needy the first 10 weeks or so & never let me put her down anywhere more than a few minutes.  She stayed about 5 minutes in this the first time so we knew it was a winner! It's lightweight enough so that she moves it herself every time she wiggles around & the soft back is more comforting than the other hard plastic backed ones. Also lightweight enough to move around house with me & she stays happy while I'm cleaning. Cover is easy to remove & clean. Toy bar is easy to remove / replace.Reasons I didn't give it 5 stars: I tend to try to find baby items not made in China that use more natural materials and dyes. Since I didn't want to pay $500 for a bouncer, though, I made myself happy with this one!One other thing...she is 6 months old now & has started being able to sit upright in it - once or twice now she has sat up & then sort of drooped / fallen / bent forward over the buckle area (when the toybar was not attached) & been stuck! So, it seems they may start to outgrow when they start sitting up independently!BTW- just read some other reviews...I do wish the toys came off like another reviewer said..that is sort of weird that they don't! Lion is kind of long...I often wrap it around once!  Also, we have used this a lot over the past 6 months  & she has never kicked the battery / switch area & it is in just as good condition as when we bought it. She is also pretty short, though - 25% for height...so maybe that is why.
