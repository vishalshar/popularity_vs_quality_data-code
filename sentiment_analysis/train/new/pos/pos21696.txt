This is an AWESOME dresser!Time to assemble - around 2hours (this includes un-packing and some cleaning-up).When it first arrived the box had a HUGE dent and I was worried about the contents inside. But you can see from the photo it was VERY well packed. Everything was in great shape!PROS -- Easy to put together!The directions were simple, all the parts where there and labeled VERY well (picture of the nuts / bolts, etc with labels)- Sturdy and beautifulOur plan is to use this for our baby and then as she grows, it will be her dresser! From the look and feel, this will last a VERY long time.- Awesome PriceFor what you get, the price is awesome. (note, we got this for ~230)CONS - (had to be VERY nit-picky. And NONE of these were bad enough to lose a star, hence it keeping the 5star rating)- Alan wrenchThe it comes with an alan wrench. I felt at a few times they could of sized it differently to make it slightly nicer to use- Hand screw driverYeah, so directions said to NOT use an electric screw driver. I quickly threw that idea out the window and grabbed my electric drill. My drill has a torque limiter on it, so I set it really low and adjusted as needed. This would of been painful to do w/o a drill. But I understand why they wanted you to do it that way. If you go full boar with a drill you'll probably split wood, etc.- Uneven drawersSo this might just be how I put it together. But you'll notice the drawers are perfectly straight / aligned. I tried REALLY hard to put it together perfectly. This is just more of an OCD thing. It works perfectly and there are no problems.
