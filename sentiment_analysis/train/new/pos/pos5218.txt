This is one of baby's favorite toys.  Nice music, colors, textures, and patterns.  Very interactive.No five star rating for four reasons:(1) Too few songs and too short segments of songs.(2) Too short record time.(3) Notes on trunk are quite difficult to press.(4) Tricky to press the spot that must be pressed to initiate music.These issues mean that someone other than baby must constantly press different parts of the elephant in lieu of baby for quite some time until baby learns to do it alone.
