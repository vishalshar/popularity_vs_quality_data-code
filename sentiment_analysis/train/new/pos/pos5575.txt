LOVE!!!  This is such a fantastic concept.  My 21 month old loves putting on her monkey and going for a walk in our backyard (3.5 acres) with her grandparents.  It really serves a dual purpose for us- our property slopes gently, but just enough that a toddler who pulls her hand free from yours and gains momentum could easily fall and get hurt, AND it allows the grandparents to enjoy a walk with a curious toddler who moves way faster than they do :)I know some folks are so offended by the thought of a child on a 'leash', but I could really care less what they think.  This gives my little one enough independence to be able to run around and look at things in highly populated areas.  I am not sure about other folks 21 month olds, but mine is extremely active and will hold onto my hand for awhile, but than will always want to pull free!!  This worked great in the airport :)
