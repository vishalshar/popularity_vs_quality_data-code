Purchased this set for my 28 month old son who loves Lightning McQueen.  He was thrilled when he saw the new blankets in his crib.  I was worried the sheets would be too big for a crib mattress but they fit perfectly.  It is also nice that the top sheet has elastic at the bottom to get tucked under the mattress.  The quality is great for the price - soft enough for a child.  Also purchased the valances and wall decals separately and they match perfectly.
