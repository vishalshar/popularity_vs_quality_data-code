I bought this as a gift for my nephew. He is only two and my thought was that his parents did not need another toy to add to the mountain already in the toy room (he has a 4 year old sister). This could still be "toy like" and yet be a little something different. He loves it and carries it around. It was sturdy and soft......great buy!
