we loved our first Baby Jogger stroller the City Versa. Now that we are expecting our second child this stroller is perfect as it adjusts to so many different seating positions. We haven't used it with the second seat yet. I will say that it is a heavy stroller, but I don't think there is much that can be helped, given that it is meant to support the weight of two children. It moves great through snow and easy to push, even with one hand. The compartment on the bottom fits a lot. we love this stroller!
