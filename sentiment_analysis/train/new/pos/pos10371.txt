The product is sturdy.The drawer is a little sticky, but that can be easily fixed with the addition of a little bee's wax.Space Saver.I use disposable diapers so I don't know how well it would work with cloth diapering.  I no longer own a changing table on account of making room for all of the other "stuff" (mainly toys, shoes, and clothes) that I accumulate with each new "addition" to the family.  A caddy is so much more compact.Well, it's not a new piece of furniture...I don't know if a first time mommy would appreciate as much I as I do with a third little one.  (Personally I'm not sure that I could have been torn away from the idea of having a changing table.  When you're a first time mommy, you have time to read a lot of mommy mags and get your head "turned" by all of the grand "stuff" and furniture that you mistakenly think that you need.)Awesome.Honestly though, for the money that I spent on buying my one fall-apart cheap changing table - I could have easily bought two of these caddies.  This is what I ended up doing.  I have one in the living room and one in my bedroom, because when I'm chasing down baby while also managing my other little ones, I can use every short-cut and break that is afforded me.Simple. Elegant. Single Hand use.It fits 10 diapers in the diaper section, leaving room for a nice big tub of Boudreaux's Butt Paste.  I really don't use the drawer much, because my butt paste is in the tub form (LUV ALSO).  So I can pretty much handle everything involved with the caddy with a single hand (grab pad and layout, hold down baby -other hand, grab diaper, open and apply wipes - stash used wipes in used dipe, open and apply butt paste.).Thank you to whoever designed this.This is probably the first positive review that I have ever written on Amazon, because this little caddy is THAT inspiring.
