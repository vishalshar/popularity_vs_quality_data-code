We use this product every day on our son's car seat. It is great for public use since it keeps germy strangers from curiously checking out the baby. It also keeps it dark when the baby is napping. I love that it velcros around the handle because it stays put so much better than a blanket. It is also warm weather friendly.(I spent a ridiculous amount of time reviewing products before adding them to our baby registry, as well as buying them afterwards.)
