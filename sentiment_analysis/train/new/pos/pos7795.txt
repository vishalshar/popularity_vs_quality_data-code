I am not a mom who favors the fantasy potties being sold today. I believe a child potty training should be taught how to really use the bathroom. The fantasy potties have become toys to my son. This seat he loves. It stimulates his  development because he recognizes his favorite characters plus it fits right on the toilet. He reaches for it puts it in place and has an interest in toilet training. I have paired this with some potty training videos and books. He loves to copy the videos. He brings a book to read while sitting on the potty. This seat has generated the most interest I've seen yet in my son and seriously potty training.
