As a mother of 5 under 6, I can safely say these are the BOMB of all bibs!  With a water-proof front and easy to wipe back, it keeps most spills off our children's shirts.  The crumb-catcher is ideal and I have not been able to find another bib who's crumb-catcher is designed this well: it completely unsnaps and, thus, easily wipes off, yet can hold liquids until you dump them off.  Cute designsMy only complaint is that washing them in a machine definitely shortens their life. Mine usually last around a year, but the plastic front starts to melt and the pictures rub off.  It can be difficult to remove nasty smells without machine-washing from time-to-time, though I try to get it super clean with a cloth each time to prevent the need for machine-washing.  I have had a friend have better luck with boiling it in a pot on the stove.
