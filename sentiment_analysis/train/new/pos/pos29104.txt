I purchased this bidet to help with personal hygiene for my disabled mother. I was able to install it in less than 10  minutes. it works beautifully. This product is ideal for helping people who have difficulty in cleaning themselve. It is more hygenic than toilet paper and leaves the person feeling fresh and clean and odor-free. It also eases the pain and flare-ups of hemorrhoids. And it reduces genital itching and the spread of bacteria. The only issue for my mother was that the water spray was strong and too uncomfortable for her in the beginning. I turned down the water pressure for her and it helped. She has since learned to angle the nozzle so that is cleans without being a strong, sudden burst of cold water directly on sensitive areas. Since using it, she has not had any problems with going to the bathroom. She also uses the bidet to spray water into a bucket to soak her feet and this helps reduce inflammation and promotes good foot care for her as a diabetic. I highly recommend this product.
