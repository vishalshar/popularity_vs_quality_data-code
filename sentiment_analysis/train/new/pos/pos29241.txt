Bought this for my two, almost three year old. She finally wants to sleep in her own bed now that we have this mattress! I read all the reviews and shopped around on like 5 different mattresses but decided to go with this one because it is organic and I love the double sided feature. She used the covered side because she is not potty trained yet and I use and extra cover to protect the mattress but it doesn't make noise like some people said in other reviews. Very pricey yes but since I have other smaller children that will be able to use it some day as well I figure it was worth it in the long run! Also mine didn't smell like other people said so I guess I just lucked out - if it did I would have just sent it back and requested a new one.
