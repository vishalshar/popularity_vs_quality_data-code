We have very small closets in our old house, and with our first child on the way, utilizing our space as efficiently as possible is important to us.  This organizer is already helping so much, and our child isn't even here yet.  With the clothing rod dividers/labels and the multiple shelves, I'm able to organize her clothes by month so that we aren't fumbling around in her first year trying to find things that will fit her.The material seems durable enough for our use (we aren't too hard on our things, though), and is easy to hang.  The drawers will be really handy for things we just need to throw in and have contained (not too much in those just yet).  The hangers are quite nice in that they are velvet covered and her little baby clothes stay put on them.I would highly recommend this product to anyone who also has limited closet space, or those who just find organization to be an important part of life.
