We purchased exactly the same mobile for our then 4-month old baby when we came to visit the grandparents in the US for 2 months. This toy made our little one stop crying up until recently and now - at 5 months of age - it keeps her entertained when she lies in the crib on her own. The music is soothing and I turn on one particular tune to wind down the baby for her nap.The downsides (that I ignore):- Out of 5 tunes I usually play only 2.- I understand this product has been discontinued and only two retailers were offering this mobile on Amazon when we purchased it last February. The mobile we received has got a defect making a mechanical noise when the lights are switched off (that deteriorates with the battery life). We decided not to bother with the exchange always leaving the lower light on which is good for attracting the baby's attention anyway.- The batteries are being consumed pretty fast especially if you always keep all the lights on.The baby is not bothered by the downsides though and keeps enjoying her mobile!
