I'm not ashamed to say I totally bought this for myself because I wanted the comforter to use as a blanket on my sofa.I'm beyond impressed with the whole set. The sheets and pillow case are SUPER soft! As for the comforter... if any of you reading this have ever bought a cheap comforter before you know how they're made out of the stiff kinda scratchy cheap fabric and the crappy polyester stuffing shifts about. This isn't ANYTHING like that!What you CAN'T see in the picture:a.) Rainbow Dash flying above and to the right of Pinkie Pieb.) Each pony has a stitched outline which is just a nice detail and helps keep stuffing in placec.) SUPER soft and the insides don't feel shifty and lameI'm damn impressed with this set. Totally worth the cost even tho I'm not using anything but the comforter. It's a shame I can't get this in queen size. :3
