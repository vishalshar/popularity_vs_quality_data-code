I was looking for a versatile stroller that would be good for traveling as well as for every day use for errands.  We decided on the G-Luxe and are really glad we did.  The stroller is really light, reclines to a nice sleeping position (you can even do it while your little one is sleeping) and the sunshade on the 2010 model pops out much further than other umbrella strollers.  We used it on a week long trip to Hawaii and thought it was great.  It was easy to push up and down hills, easy to store and the stand up feature was useful in the airport, etc. My husband likes it so much he keeps sneaking it out of my trunk to use at home rather than our Bugaboo... The stroller has a good recline, so I think you could use it from 3-4 months up, but it isn't for newborn use as there's no attachment.I have no reservations recommending this, but try to get the 2010 model rather than the 2009 if you live in a sunny climate as the shade was improved.
