The other posts said that this case looked cheap, but I think this case is great.  It ~is~ a plastic case covered in cloth, but you could mistake it from a small distance for a large, trendy wallet.  For a case that is just going to be holding some baby wipes, I think the quality is appropriate (unless you really wanted a designer label all-leather baby wipe case or something ridiculous like that).  I use it to hold moist towelettes for my hands when I am traveling and feel like no one would ever know it is a case for baby wipes, except for the label.
