They are as described.  Beyond that, these are great cups.  If you like the Munchkin ones, these are almost exactly the same style, color, texture.  The only real difference is the size.  The difference is listed as munchkin 8oz vs Nuby 9oz ,  but it looks like a 2oz difference.  The size difference, although small to an adult, is actually a big difference to their little hands.  If I had noticed it was only listed as a 1oz difference, I would not have purchased these, but now that I can actually see the difference, I am so happy I did!  My 7yr old really loves the upgrade, and now only asks once for a drink.  (In the past, he asked for a refill and never finished the second cup).  No more wasted Milk or Juice!  Also, I wouldn't want to go bigger, and think it is the biggest size for his hands without feeling like he's holding a large tumbler.  I only bought one pack, to test them out, but I wish I had bought more!1.  Great Quality2.  Great Value  (at least at the price I got them for)3.  Wish I could pick the colors but kids love the colors anyway4.  Compares to the Munchkin ones which have been priceless for my household5.  Longevity.  The size is a bonus because large enough that they can use these until they move on to actual glassware.  Yet, small enough to use now without worries of awkward feel /breakage / broken glass.6.  Less time spent on refilling drinks7.  Less money spent from wasted Milk or Juice8.  I would recommend this product to all with elementary school age kids.9.  I will be buying again
