My grandson usually wants those small goldfish crackers to snack on at my house.  It gets kind of messy, though, when he drops them and then steps on them.  This bowl handles that problem handily!  It's pretty close to impossible for him to spill when I put them in this bowl. Thanks for coming up with this product!
