These bibs are hands-down our favorite bibs for our 11-month-old.  Our son has always disliked having scratchy plastic bibs around his neck, and we've always had a problem with food seeping down around his neck and under the bib.  This bib solves both of these problems.  The material is so soft and fits snugly and comfortably around his neck. We also like that the bib is on the small side since our son is small for his age.  Some other  bibs are so large that he can't move his arms freely in front of his body.  He may outgrow this bib eventually, but for now, it is amazing.
