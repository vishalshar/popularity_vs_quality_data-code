I bought this for my 2 month old daughter as a Christmas gift (she will be 3 months on 12/28). Unfortunately, it was left on the coffee table and our new puppy got a hold of it. Needless to say - I will be purchasing another one. This, IMP, is one of the best toys I have seen for infants in a long time. It is thick enough for her to grab (though still a bit heavy for her to keep her grasp) - the wood is nice, I love that it is non toxic and that she can teeth/gum it without my worrying about the possible chemicals she could be ingesting (like with plastic). Not only that, it is vibrant and it reminds me of good old well made toys - like maybe what I or my mother would have had and as most parents know it is classic toys that always do the trick. I love all Sassy products but I really think that these stand out and at the price I am considering buying 2 of each (as my husband and I do plan on trying for another child - not yet though!). As a mother of 2 ( 2 mths and 7 yrs) and a puppy - maybe I should buy 3 as even my 7 year old son seems fascinated by it (and the pup loves to chew on them) and his main thing is his Nintendo DS so I am shocked! Though his fascination was brief it does show that there is something about this toy that is attractive and trust me, it is a beautiful and useful toy. A+ HIGHLY recommended!
