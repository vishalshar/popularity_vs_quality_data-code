I bought a set of these chalks as part of a gift set I put together for a friend's daughter, and it was seriously the only thing she was really excited about. The colors are great and show well on the sidewalk, and the chalk is thick and should last a while. All pieces were intact when delivered, which I think reflects the quality of this product.
