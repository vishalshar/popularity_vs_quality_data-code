I like this seat and it works well for our very small dining area.  I like that we don't have to find a place to store it and it is not clunky.  We used it daily.  My son is comfortable in it and we have been using it since he was 6 months old.  (We used a towel for extra support when he was that young.). It does not recline.  My son loves being at the table with us and is much more content in it than he was in the chicco polly.  I do not like the penguin rubber parts that cling to the top of the table.  My son gets interested in them then bangs his gums on the beak portion of it.  It would have been much better and easier to clean if they were just smooth and round.  We also have to remove the entire seat to clean it.  Ugh.  We drape a cloth napkin on the sides and front so we can just at change those and wash the seat weekly or as huge messes occur.  We do baby led weaning and most of the food is easy to clean up.  The bottom release that is getting stuck for some people has not been a problem for us.  You have to crank it to the unlock position.  We have had this for 4 months and love it, just wish the cloth portion was easier to remove and the rubber Penguins were just smooth u shapes pieces.
