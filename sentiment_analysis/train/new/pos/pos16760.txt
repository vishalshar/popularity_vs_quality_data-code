This set is very pretty.  I purchased the Fisher Price Zen Collection Swing and Bassinet and they look so great.  My husband was very impressed and when it comes to the baby items his response is usually, "Whatever you like honey".  You can not beat the price on this set (that's what my husband liked the most).  So far the quality of the products seem just as great as any other set.  I haven't washed any of the items yet, because we bought this bedding when I was around 5 months into the pregnancy and we still have around 2 more months.  Although I did purchased another 13pcs crib bedding set from the same company for my son. I have washed his and the colors are still rich.  No fading or bleeding that I could tell.`  I will say that we lucked out that we are having a girl this time because I purchased the Autumn crib set before we found out the gender of our baby. I thought that one of the colors in the collection were red, but like one of the reviewers cautioned it is actually dark pink.  For a girl it is great, but it is not all that neutral unless you do not mind the pink.  I love that this collection stands out and is something different from a lot of the baby items that are on the market.  I also bought the mobile and lamp shade.  Everything included still came out less then the 4pcs bedding set that comes with the original Zen Collection.
