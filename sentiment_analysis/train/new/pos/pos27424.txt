I love the whole line of infantino squeeze fresh!!!  It's super easy to make and cheap compared to commercially available squeeze pouches.  I always know what my kids are eating and can customize according to their taste. Also when you freeze the pouches they are great as ice packs without taking up extra room. With 4 kids from 15 months to 9 years, those are great!  It's in my top 10 baby purchases that I would definitely recommend.
