I bought this to cover up some old discolored wall outlets.  This worked perfectly. Not having to worry about a toddler shoving a fork into the outlet is just a bonus.======I always read the negative reviews.  Here are the complaints and my thoughts.1.  "Two prong plugs fall out."  My plugs are just fine. I had to loosen the mounting screws on a couple of outlets.  Those are the two screws that hold the outlet in the wall.  That allowed the outlet to move forward nice and close to the cover.  This was a problem from the outlet install.  The outlet was recessed too far into the wall.2.  "Not enough gaskets."  The foam gaskets are only for outside walls.  If the old cover didn't have a gasket you can use one of the supplied gaskets or cut a little insulation.  Honestly it is just a little bit of insulation for outside walls so the inside wall outlets don't need it.  Actually none "need" the gasket.  But why waste heating and cooling when you can seal it up?3.  "They stop closing."  The ones I got seem pretty good.  I normally don't plug and unplug my appliances thousand of times. I have a power strip by my bed for my phone.
