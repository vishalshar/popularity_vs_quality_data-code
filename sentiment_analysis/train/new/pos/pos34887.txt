We love this stroller! We have used it since birth and have loved it every step of the way. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the stroller is very large. It is wide and heavy and big. Other than that, we love that this seat transforms into a bed and lays down flat. I also wish the umbrella had more notches in it so it can be in different positions. The basket is nice and sturdy. We have a Toyota Corolla and it fits in the trunk but takes up most of the room. We also had a Honda Civic hybrid and it also fit in that trunk. I love that the tires are all terrain and they won't pop or need to be replaced. We bought this stroller for hiking and just going out, not exercising. When I have used it for jogging, it does wobble like other people have commented, which can be annoying. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get a very nice stroller for a reasonable price.
