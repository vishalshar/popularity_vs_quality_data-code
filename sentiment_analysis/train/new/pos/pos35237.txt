Great product! My 2-year-old daughter stopped using her diaper when we got this in addition to her little free-standing Thomas the Tank Engine potty. She really preferred to use the big potty with this seat! It's easy to clean and disinfect, and the handles are handy. We use the plain white plastic step stool from IKEA with this seat and it's been the perfect solution!
