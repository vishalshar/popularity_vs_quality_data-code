These are my absolute favorite teething ring!  I love the vanilla smell.  They work great for really small ones.  My daughter got her first teeth at 4 months then kept getting them all regularly after that, so this was nice as it was small enough and she was able to actually hold it at that age where many other teething rings are too bit for really little babies.  I buy these for every new parent!
