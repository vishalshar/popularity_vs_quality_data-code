Beautiful!  Very well made, lovely finish, super sturdy and stable (my daughter climbs all over it constantly) , great price, and great value.  My child is able to seat herself in this chair by climbing up the front rungs like a ladder and she loves the chair just as much as we do.  Matches my medium cherry finished wood perfectly.  Now our daughter gets to eat off a plate on the table just like the rest of the family instead of a separate tray attached to her high chair.  I did not attach the middle strap for between the legs to the bar as shown in picture and directed in instructions.  Left it hanging so as to create a secure three point belt across her lap that our daughter is unable to crawl out of  which seems to me to be much more secure than the manufacturer's recommendation.  (We had problems with her wiggling out the pictured one at restaurants which prompted us to go this route.  Worked like a charm.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
