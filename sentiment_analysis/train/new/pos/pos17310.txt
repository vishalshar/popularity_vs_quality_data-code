As soon as I wear the Ergo, or even while I'm putting it on, my baby immediately goes for the straps and starts chewing. So this teething pad is invaluable.4 stars because my baby also likes to turn her head and chew on the front of the Ergo and this product doesn't extend to the front. I drape a fresh burpy cloth over the front for baby to chew on but that's not an ideal solution as it gets wet quickly, and also doesn't look great, even with a pretty burpy.
