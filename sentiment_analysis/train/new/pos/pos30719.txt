I rarely write a review, but I was so impressed! Here is why I am so glad that I forked over the extra $$$ for this product: Smell, smell, smell! I'm not consciously aware of just how much poopy smell my pail successfully contains until I open it up to toss another diaper in, and whew! The pail is metal, which is fabulous at containing odors, and the seal for the opening works wonders. It's easy to use, the door opens one-handedly and I can use the back of my hand to open it--one hand on baby, one hand holding the loaded nappy. I use generic 13-gallon kitchen bags. Plus, it's cute (as cute as a diaper pail can be). Not too big, not too small. Pretty color, stylish shape, modern look. The one drawback is that the hinge for the lid isn't quite rounded enough and protrudes quite a bit into the container itself, as noted on other reviews. To avoid the bag from ripping I gently remove a bag when its 2/3rds full; haven't had a bag rip in the 5 months since I bought it. A full bag removed in haste would likely rip.
