For the price I expected something cute and mostly decorative. The material is a nice, thick canvas and the bag is larger than expected. The shoulder strap is easily adjustable and wide enough so it doesn't dig into my shoulder. I'm going to buy a separate changing pad to throw in and it will be perfect. It'll be nice to be able to wash this occasionally in the washing machine as opposed to other bags I've seen that are lined with plastic and can only be spot cleaned. Very happy with this bag. ( My husband likes it too and thought it was just for him )
