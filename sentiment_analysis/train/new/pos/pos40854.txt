People are pretty critical of this things life-span. Mine has held up well over the last three months with my 2.5 year old daughter (~30lbs) but I decided to write a review because I just noticed one of the hinges is about to come off, and was looking at ordering another product.However, I'm buying another one. All of the other products either don't fold, cost substantially more, weigh more or aren't padded. Since it lasted well over 3 months and still works, with semi daily use and bordering the end of potty training, it's simply worth $10 bucks.Could it be made better? Sure. It loses a star for that. I mean, it's $10 bucks and the best featured product available. And as another post mentioned, the designed lifespan (quality) is probably intentionally implemented for sanitary reasons. This is not antimicrobial plastic, the cushion padding is filled with foam and there are lots of crevices and joints (hinges) where bacteria will grow that simply can't be adequately cleaned. Then throw in this is a toddler training seat and...yeah, I don't know if I WANT it to last a long time.
