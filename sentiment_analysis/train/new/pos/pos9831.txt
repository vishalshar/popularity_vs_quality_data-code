These bibs are a really good size for my 2 month old who has been spitting up a good bit lately.  The fronts are absorbent so the spit-up doesn't just run down to his cloths and the backs are lined with a plastic material that keeps his shirt completely dry. They are machine washable and dryer safe; however, make sure the dryer isn't too hot.  Our dryer malfunctioned and ran on hot and melted the plastic on the back so they each came out all balled up.  We liked the bibs so much that we purchased them again.
