We really like these cups but I can understand the divided opinions in other reviews.  Here's my take on things...We didn't go the route of a sippy cup as it didn't feel any different to giving our LO a baby bottle, but instead we started with a plain open plastic cup at around 9 months for lunchtime water and breakfast formula.  After some practice our LO took to it really well.  However, we always had to hold the open cup with her and it wasn't giving her the independence we would want.  So we looked around for a cup that was like an open cup but that would spill less, and we ended up trying this Philips cup.It took a while for her to get used to it, and even now after using it for a few weeks she doesn't drink as much from it as she does an open cup.  I do feel that if she had not already been used to drinking from an open cup, and was moving on straight from a bottle or sippy this would be a hard cup to drink from.  So I can understand others who say that their babies/toddlers couldn't get it to work.It isn't completely spill-proof, and does need some supervision.  Any extra unsipped liquid that is already past the interior valve will spill out if it is turned upside down.  Just a small amount, and in my experience this is no different than most sippy cups.  Our LO also tends to press or chew the top while it's upside down and in that case liquid pours out - that's how the valve is meant to work for drinking.  However, we have not had any problems with the cup actually leaking, and I wonder if those who have experienced this are actually putting the valve together properly.  We now have 6 of these and none of them actually leak.It washes really well in the dishwasher and is easy to put together and pull apart.  We have used it with both milk and water, and I think it would work with any liquid as long as there are no bits in it to get caught in the valve.
