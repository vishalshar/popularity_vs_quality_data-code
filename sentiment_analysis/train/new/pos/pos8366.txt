Okay, so we borrowed one of these from a friend to try before we bought. We found that its the perfect height right now for our 4 month but as he gets older, we won't be able to adjust it anymore do to our shorter door frame height. Well, I put my brain to work and found the perfect solution and all it takes is 3 tennis balls. What I did was I pulled the straps from underneath the 3 pronged plastic hanger and tucked a tennis ball between the plastic and the strap. What that does is takes more slack out of the top portion of the strap which raises it up several inches. Now my son has plenty of room to grow and use this product safely.And if you think its unsafe, the strap rests in a channel and the ball tucks right into that really well. Once the strap is against the ball and you put weight on the swing, it will only get tighter. There is no way for the balls to come out with you trying to get them out. Check the pictures posted with the product for an example of how it looks.
