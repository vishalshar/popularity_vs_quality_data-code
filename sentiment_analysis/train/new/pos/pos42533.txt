My daughter appears to be mesmorized when I turn this mobile on while she is in her car seat. The music and the images calms her down when she starts to fuss. The dual images on the kid-safe blades are great since she is only 4 months, the black and white images on one side help her with her early vision. When she is a few months older, flipping the blades over display a colored side. I also like the feature of turning off the music while still allowing the mobile to slowly spin is a great feature while she's in her stroller.
