I read tons if Amazon reviews before i bought this suppory pillow, and im glad i settled on thia one. I've had this for a week. I bought it because I'm in my first trimester but I'm already struggling with finding a comfortable position. This is extremely versatile, but is compact enough to not trouble your partner. It seems like the upper curve is firmer than the lower, so I found that I prefer to sleep with it upside-down. This product definitely exceeds my expectations in presentation, price, and function.
