Having been a builder for 30+ years, I’m a stickler for good materials and craftsmanship.  I was impressed to find that this wooden ruler is made of Baltic birch plywood.  Baltic birch is most often used in high end cabinet construction and is a really nice alternative to using a board that would most likely cup or curl over time.  I also appreciated that it is not a laminate (laminate is actually plastic glued to wood).  The use of inks to create this piece is ingenious, I think.  It appears that the inks sink in much like a wood stain, and I imagine that the colors will stay true and will still look crisp many years down the road.  And lastly, I was very happy with the clear satin finish they used on the growth chart. I am actually going to look into it as a green option for some of my clients that would probably be thrilled to find such a safe polyurethane for use in their homes. So…. kudos to you  Growth Chart Art for figuring out how to make something that looks good, will last and make it here in the USA.
