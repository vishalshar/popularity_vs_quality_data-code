To use this product, you place the underside of the duck in water for a few seconds and then remove it to see if the word "HOT" appears in bold pink letters on the bottom.  If it does, you can adjust the water temperature and try again.  It is a very simple tool to use.  It does not tell you if the water is too cold for a baby, so you might be better off to start warmer and then adjust down to lower temperatures.  I personally don't think it is necessary to buy the more expensive bath thermometers because this does the job just fine.  It is also fun to use as a floating bath toy!
