This is the perfect combination of bags even if you have twins. Plus they matched our Graco Snugride Car Seats.When my girls were eating several bottles a day, if we dropped the girls off at their Grandparents or we went to visit people for the day we would pack both bags. We used the small bag to pre-make all of their bottles, I think we could fit at least 8 in there(8-10oz) The bag was small enough it would fit in the fridge. The bigger bag we used for diapers, wipes, several changes of clothes, changing pad, 2 blankets, (health items, tylenol, thermometer, etc) and we had extra room. Also, the bigger bag has a plastic zipper bag that we've used several times when we were out and one of my girls diapers leaked & we had to change their soilded clothes.If we were just running to the store, Dr or somewhere quick, we'd use the small bag. This would fit bottles, bibs, diapers, wipes, 2 changes of clothes, etc.This combination of bags is PERFECT! You can use both, the big one or the small one depending on what you will be doing. We've had ours for about a year now and neither of them show any signs of wear. The lining is all in tact, the shell is in tact. They are easy to wash as well. I filled the sink with hot water & Dreft and hand washed them. I hang them upside down to dry. Be sure to open the plastic pockets to air them out or they wont dry. You can use a hair dryer to dry out the pockets once the shell is dry if you are in a hurry.I don't know that they make this exact bag anymore(at least on Amazon) but I believe they have a new version, hopefully it is just as good or maybe even better!
