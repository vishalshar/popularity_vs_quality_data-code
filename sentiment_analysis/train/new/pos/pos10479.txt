When we first got this in the mail for our son, we loved it!  We loved the color, the chunky weight of the monkey, his cute little smile.  It was the first toy our son got attached to and it sleeps in his bed.  Then -- our dog ate the tail off the monkey and we ordered a second one to replace the damaged one.  I was expecting some variation between the monkeys because they are organic, family friendly -- you expect it to not be a cookie cutter toy like stuff made by Fisher Price, etc.  Still, the second one came and the color was faded like an old t-shirt, it was lumpy in all the wrong places, and the head and limbs seemed to be attached strangely -- the monkey is permanently and awkwardly twisted.  The first monkey was cute, the second was rather deformed.  Our son still loves them both, so I can't really complain, but in the end, I was not very impressed with the quality control.
