We purchased this bouncer/entertainer because we needed an extra one that we could use upstairs, and also easily take with us when going to friends/grandma's house. This one is easy to move and our daughter really likes it.  I like that you can put your own toys on the toy bars so we can change them and she will not get bored.  This item was a great price and it does not take up lots of room.  Though there are others out there that are better, but more expensive, and you can not move them easily and they take up more space.Though we do really like this item,  our daughter has a much better jumping/bouncing/playing time with her Fisher Price jumperoo. If you are looking for a second entertainer or need one that does not take up much space, this is great.  Also, if your little one really wants to jump and use their little legs, go with the jumperoo.This is a great toy for the price, our daughter likes it, it travels easily, and it fits nicely in the bedrooms upstairs while we take care of our older boys.
