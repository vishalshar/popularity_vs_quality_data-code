This is my 3rd child, and my first organic Boppy cover. I had been eyeing this for years but didn't want to spend the extra money. I am so glad that I finally did! I have been using this cover for 4 months now and refuse to use any of my old ones while it is in the wash (I suggest buying two, because I know you will feel the same way). This cover is so soft and down right beautiful! The construction is superb and shows promise of holding up for many years to come. It does not stain easily. It has been pooped on via baby blowouts several times, my toddler has gotten fruit juice and raspberries on it. I've splattered coffee on it (no, not with the baby in it), and it remains stain free. I DID NOT pre-treat it or take any special precautions, I do treat it as a delicate and throw it in with the cloth diapers and hang to dry, but I don't think this is all that necessary. Every time I've pulled it out of the wash it has been completely stain free. Yes, I was pretty amazed myself.For a nursing mother, a Boppy is one of the best purchases you will make; protect it, love it, treat it with respect, buy it a 100% organic, soft, beautiful cover. You won't regret it!
