They are beautiful and excelent quality so the baby will use it for years. The blankets can be:- put on the bed or crib so the newborn can sleep over them,-they can also be used to cover-protect the baby from a windy or rainy day,-in your shoulder to cover your clothes when you take out his/her gasses,-on the stroller to prevent it from getting durty in case of a pupu accident or when the baby gets older any food spill.-Some kids like these blankets to sleep with or to play with the dolls or on the floorThis was an excelent bought for me. I always find new uses for the blankets. And the quality makes them last for years...I love them
