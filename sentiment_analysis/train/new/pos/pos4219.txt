I'm not quite sure why I zeroed in on Vital Baby products during my search for baby feeding tools, but I'm sure glad I did.I've been making my daughter's food fresh and initially bought the Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce, 8 Pack & Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Freezer Pots, Orange, 3 Ounce, 4 Pack as freezing/storage containers, but I liked those so much that I thought I'd try some other Vital Baby products.The main thing I like about Vital Baby food containers is the tight fit between the container and the lid.  When considering a to-go dish like this one, that seems like the most important feature.  This is such a great dish not only because of the tight fit of the lid, but because it holds a good amount of food (way more than my 7 month old needs with room to grow) and the spoon locks away nicely in the lid without creating any bulk.  The whole thing is pretty sleek, so it fits nicely in our diaper bag or in my purse.On top of all that, the spoon is AWESOME!  I never thought I'd get really excited about a baby spoon, but, here I am:  I am very excited about this baby spoon.  The spoon is silicon-tipped and shaped in such a way that it doubles as a little tiny spatula.  Food is super super easy to scrape from the sides of the dish -- and from my daughter's face!  I love love love this spoon and plan on buying more (I actually logged into Amazon just now to buy Vital Baby Soft Tip Baby's 1st Spoons, Pink, 5 Pack.  (The only things I don't like about the spoon (that do not override its awesomeness) is the obvious brand name placement (I don't really like name placement on things) on the spoon handle and the fact that the spoon tip stains ... but, who cares?  It's not like I'm wearing this as an accessory to the prom or anything!).Anyway.  I really like this :)
