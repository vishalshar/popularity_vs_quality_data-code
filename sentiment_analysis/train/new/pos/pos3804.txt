This highchair folds up really small and stays standing while folded, which makes it great to just keep against the wall, when not in use and easy to throw in the minivan (or even the sedan's trunk) if you're going out to a family member's but don't want to invest too much in a travel chair.A caveat: the tray insert is supposed to be dishwasher safe, but on the first run through it warped pretty badly. We were able to bend it back mostly, but decided to call graco who sent out another one really fast.  We've decided just to hand wash from now on.A few other things that aren't "cons" as much as "be aware"--When folding the leg separator sometimes doesn't fold up quite right into the chair, all you have to do is tug at the fabric a bit to line it up with the hole it goes in.--On that note, the snack tray is not removable.  We put our friend's 23 month old in the chair at one point and he was a lot harder to get in than our little girl.  So as your kid ages be aware they'll be harder to get their legs under the tray.
