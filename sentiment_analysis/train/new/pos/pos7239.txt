This was so amazing when I used it for my 3mo old! It was such a relief for my arms to not have to hold the baby the whole flight, and I was able to attend to my 3yr old with baby sound asleep in the sling. I was instructed by the flight attendants that I had to hold baby in my arms during take off and landing but then hooked the sling onto the tray for the rest of the flight. I have recommended to a friend that flew from the states to Italy with a 2mo old and they absolutely loved it as well! Great product, highly recommend!
