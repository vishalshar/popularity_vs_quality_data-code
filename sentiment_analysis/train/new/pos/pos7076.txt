I have two inquisitive and somewhat clumsy daughters. The latter is mostly my wife's fault...genetically speaking. But still, I hope she never reads this. Anyway, these foam corners are easy to put on and are very sturdy. However, I have two minor complaints that may or may not affect any parent looking for foam corners:1. The adhesive is not very sticky. Now, in defense if KidCo, this is probably because they don't want to leave a mark on furniture. However, my eldest (about 3 years old) find its relatively easy to rip these covers off and hide them throughout our house. This exposes my youngest who just started walking (about 8 months) to, well, corners. I'm not sure if there is a good solution here, but this isn't the reason I gave the product 4 stars.2. Now here's the reason I gave the product 4 stars. While the foam feels solid, my youngest with only two teeth has taken a chunk out of it. Luckily we as parents caught it. I would prefer foam that is more sturdy or that has some type of covering over it  or a more solid foam to prevent bites because, I don't know if KidCo is aware, but children love to stick everything in their mouths. However, again, the price is low and other foams may be more expensive. I simply don't know because I am not a materials engineer (nor do i want to be).I hope this helped. I believe after a great deal of research (because apparently I have nothing else better to do), these foam corner protectors are probably the best at least on Amazon. They are also relatively cheap and ship for free on Amazon Prime. So I'm not really complaining.
