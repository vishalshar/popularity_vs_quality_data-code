These fit my 3 month old and they will for her for a long time...probably until she's 2 or longer. I keep her in a onsie and these leg warmers which makes diaper changes super fast. They keep her legs warm *and* they stay on!! If her feet get cold, I keep little socks on her. If she gets hot, I push them down to her lower legs and take the socks off. So much easier than baby pants. Everywhere I go, moms and dads ask me where I got these. They love how easy it makes changing diapers when they're out and about. I've washed them several times and they still look great. I do turn them inside out and wash in cold and dry on med/low heat.
