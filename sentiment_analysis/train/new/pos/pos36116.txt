We have purchased this mat quite a few times as it has generally worked out pretty good for us and our twins.  It's flexible and thin, easy to put in place and take off.We recently have been using this mat less often because of a few reasons- it starts getting 'waterlogged' after maybe 2 weeks of use (hard to shake out some of the liquid which seems to 'absorb' more into the material- it starts showing mildew after about 6 to 8 weeks of use- small pieces start coming off after about 6 weeks of use- started to become more expensive since we started using itWe've found a reasonable alternative from a local retailer for about 8 bucks.  It's slightly stiffer, but has better resistance to water logging and mildew.  Plus, it's less than half the best price we can normally get the Clevamama for, so it's a better value.
