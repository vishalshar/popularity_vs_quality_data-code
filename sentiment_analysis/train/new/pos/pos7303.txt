We bought this stroller and wore it into the ground with daily sidewalk trips, many many planerides and gate-checks, folding and unfolding it constantly...it went for a year and a half before it broke. Then we went cheap with a Graco (big mistake...with our heavy use that lasted maybe a month). Next I tried to save a LITTLE money with a side-by-side Peg Perego, but the basket on that thing is useless, and though it lasted about a year, that's still 6 months less than the Inglesina. Now I have to buy a side-by-side yet again, and I'm going back to the Inglesina. (Though it's horrifying, how much time and money I've put into stroller-buying over the years!)
