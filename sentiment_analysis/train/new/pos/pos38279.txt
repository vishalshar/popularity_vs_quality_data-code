This bottle is great for on the go- especially at the airport where liquids are a pain.  I add the powder to the bottom, add room temp water when we are through security.  It requires a bit of soaking go mix everything, but then is great.  When I purchased this, I took it apart to wash it.  I did not realize here was a small rubber ring that needs to go back in where the bottom screws on.  The bottle leaked.  I found that part, now it works great!
