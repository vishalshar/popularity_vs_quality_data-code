I had a cheaper diaper bag before this one and it was terrible. decided to spend the extra $ on a new one. It was SO worth it! I absolutely love all the different pockets. Its amazing how much you can fit inside here. my son is 1 so we have to carry food and drinks as well. i had no issues with the shoulder strap. never had to adjust it, maybe because i am so short. it wipes clean nicely. i also love the attachment straps for the stroller. it saves space under the stroller and makes it so convenient to grab items quickly.
