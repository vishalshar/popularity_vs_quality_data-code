Accept that this is a $20+ dog toy. At some point a Vulli founder made a deal with the devil to have the most perfect squeaky dog toy for your baby, and this is the result.The neck is just the right size for a range of baby hands to grip.The legs are squishy enough they don't poke a baby's eye out when they bash them in to their head, or the head of another baby.The head is close enough to a pacifier head that it will do in a pinch.The spots make hit hard to tell that it is covered in dried baby food so people won't judge you that it is filthy.The squeak sounds like little happy baby cooing and won't drive you insane.The shape makes it impossible for it to roll away so it gets out of reach less.So accept that this is hugely expensive for what should be a $3 dog toy at PetCo. If this is on your friend's registry this is the item you buy. Their child will love it. Make sure you write in permanent non-toxic ink. "To <Baby name> with Love <your name>" on the actual toy so you get credit, because for the next 18 months this toy is going to be the only thing that makes baby stop crying, go to sleep, and cause tears to flow when it is more than 9 inches from baby's mouth.You buy this and you are a hero. All other squeaky toys are inferior.The stuffed toy is cute, and better for a little older. I don't know if it is confusing to have your best friend come in two flavors, rubber and fuzzy. I guess it is like having someone to cuddle, and someone to chew on, so that's not that weird... :-)
