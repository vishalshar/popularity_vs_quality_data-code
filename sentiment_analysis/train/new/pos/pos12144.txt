We have been using this at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day for about 6 months now. It works well and fits our Dr. Brown's 8 oz bottles (it was hard to find one that did!) My only complaints are that the corner of the top plastic tray started to melt after a couple months. It is still usable, but I found that really odd. How do you create a product that can't even withstand its own heat? Also, somehow the heating element in the bottom gets dirty. I don't understand how this happens, when we only use distilled water, and all the items we put in have already been thoroughly washed either by hand or in the dishwasher. Regardless, it does need to be washed out inside every so often or else it gets this weird brown residue, almost like rust?? Not a huge deal if you keep up with it. It does the job.
