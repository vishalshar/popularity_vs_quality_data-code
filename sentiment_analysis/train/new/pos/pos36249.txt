My fussy 3.5 year old fell asleep in it! We always use a convertible car seat on planes so this was our first time without. It went wonderfully. So light and easy breasy. The flights were great. I practiced it once at home with my toddler on a chair to get him used to it and got him very excited about it and not afraid. We made a big deal about it, tracked it coming in the mail and got it out of the mailbox together to build it up as something fun. Since my toddler can be afraid of new things. Especially entrapment devices ;-)I also practiced for my own knowledge to do it quickly and pre-size it.I used it on Southwest Airlines and the tray tables allowed it to go under perfectly. I had read some airlines have recessed tray tables where the strap ties to table down, so be aware that may happen and the person behind you may not be okay with that.Con: My toddler kept sliding a bit down his chair. Thankfully he didn't seem to get too upset about it. I think I had to adjust him every 15-20 minutes. If you put your child in shorts this might not happen, but we wore pants for cleanliness reasons.The stewardesses didn't ask me about it, however I was sure to include the card that came with it; which lists the FAA approval details. It's also presented on the strap, but you can't hand the device to the stewardesses when your child is strapped in; so have it handy ;-).
