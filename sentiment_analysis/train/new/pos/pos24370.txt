I had the original Baby Bjorn carrier with my first son, but was experiencing a lot of back problems when I used the original carrier with my second son.  A friend of mine recommended the active carrier because of the lumbar support and I am very happy.  My son was over 13lbs at his two month check up and the active carrier feels so much better and I don't feel the strain in my back at all.  My son is now three months and my oldest is 21 month so I need to be able to chase him around at the park.  It's definitely worth the extra money.  I use it almost every day, especially for doing errands, it's very convenient and my son is so happy when I'm holding him like that.
