It's larger than any other snack cups we have, which is a plus in my mind, it's very durable, stainless steal, silicone lid, nice handles, light weight, and has a cute design.  The silicone lid does come off relatively easily if you pull on it from the outside edges, but it's secure enough when you are pulling snacks out of it, as intended. Our toddler does not remove the lid while he is snacking, so it's not a big issue for us. It does not come off when putting your hand in and taking it out to reach in for snacks. However, if you are looking for a spill proof snack cup that your toddler can't get the top off of, this one is not it. It would be prefect in all ways if the lid fit more tightly, but then again it may be a pain to refill and clean if the lid were too hard to remove. Anyway, for us the pros outweigh this one con. This brand also makes a nice insulated sippy cup. This review is 100% independent and non-compensated for in any way.
