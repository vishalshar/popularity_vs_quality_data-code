I bought these size 1 diapers to use as burp cloths, so I can't comment on their performance for their actual purpose.  I originally bought the OsoCozy Size 2 diapers, which are also great.  I thought those were slightly on the large side as burp cloths, so I decided to try these.  These ended up being quite small for their intended purpose.  I'd say after washing they shrunk to slightly under 11x14.  They still work and are super thick and absorbent, but I'd probably prefer the Size 2 diapers for greater coverage, even though those seem gigantic in comparison.  They are much better than the Gerber 6 ply premium cloth diapers, since the layers are thick on each third of the diaper and not just down the middle.  The only issue I have is that they take quite a long time to dry.  Even after 70 minutes in the dryer on low heat, they tend to still be a little damp.  Other than that, they have served their purpose as burp cloths very well, and other than the size of these, I have no complaints about their construction, quality, or the brand in general.
