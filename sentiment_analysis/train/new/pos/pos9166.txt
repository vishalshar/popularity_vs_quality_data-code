I love this stroller. My baby is now 3 months old and I love this stroller/ bassinet more than I did when I first bought it. The bassinet is perfect fort little girl to sleep in and easy to move around. The stroller is really smooth and its so easy to attach the car seat adapter or the bassinet to it if I want a bassinet stroller. It comes with so many features, I'm so happy I bought it. The bassinet comes with a foam pad for baby to sleep on and it's pretty comfy, a normal bassinet sheet fits on it. Also the stroller sets up and breaks down really quickly:)
