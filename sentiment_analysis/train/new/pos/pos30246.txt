This glider is VERY nice. Comfy, durable to me (5'6, 200 pounds) and great for neck and back support. I got this when i was still pregnant but didn't get a chance to sit in it before my son arrived. I was in the hospital and my grandparents (both in their late 70's) put it together in less then 30 minutes. Within the first week of using it (i got the espresso/beige), my son pooped and peed on it. It was an easy clean, soapy hot water and the ottoman is clean and the seat as well. The only thing i DIDN'T like about it was the beige is quite bright meaning you can see stains more easily. And the cushions aren't machine washable so you really gatta get on your hands and knees and take time out to scrub, which is almost impossible with a new born. If you dont wanna do that, get a darker color.I haven't experienced any creaking yet as most people have stated, but then again, i don't sit in the chair ALL day, maybe a few hours at a time to feed my son and relax; but what ive been reading and realizing is most to ALL gliders after a year or so WILL creak and squeak. I suppose wear and tear. I don't know. But my glider is lovely. It REALLY helped with the swelling in my feed because of the ottoman and when i couldn't move too well after giving birth, it helped me stay calm and relaxed. This is a great buy and a great price for a beautiful chair. I recommend it completely!
