These are great bibs for eating.  Easy cleanup and durable.  We've had ours for a few months and they are still holding up just great.  The only reason I'm not at 5 stars is due to the velcro that clasps the bib around the neck.  It doesn't keep very long and after a few weeks our little guy was tearing this bib off left and right.  However, quick fix.  We bought snaps Dritz Snap Fastener Attacher Kit - "Easy Attacher" and installed them in place of the velcro.  Now this bib isn't going anywhere.
