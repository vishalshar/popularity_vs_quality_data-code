After having my fourth child finally a gate I like.  It is hard for guests to figure out how to open it, and does shift around every so often so my walls have marks where the paints gone and streaked, but it's heavy duty and made to last.  Fits uneven spaces great with molding because you can adjust all four corners differently if needed.  Ordered a second one right after receiving the first I liked it so much.  Had them a year now and still operate like new.  I also like that it's a taller, but not too tall gate.  Worth the money after going through quite a few wooden ones ( $12 ones everyone buys and the $30 ones with diamond pattern that slide to the side). Don't waste you money on anything else.
