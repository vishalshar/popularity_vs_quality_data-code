I bought this for my 1 year old.  It works pretty well considering it is battery operated and waterproof.  It comes with some bubble stuff, but I can just use some shampoo mixed with water and it works well enough.  It works by blowing small amounts of air out at the top of the wands so only 1 bubble can be formed at a time, but it moves fast enough to make several bubbles quickly.  The suction cup won't work on my tub wall because it is bumpy so I will probably velcro it on so I can still remove when I want to.
