I purchased this body pillow as a gift for a loved one who had back/spinal surgery. Her words: " It's like sleeping on clouds". Before receiving this pillow, she had sleepless nights/days, she was very uncomfortable and constantly complained of pain. When she received this pillow, she was able to receive the proper rest without the nagging pain she experienced post surgery. Finally! She was able to rest!!! She loves her gift!  Comfort wasn't an issue. She is 5'1, 130lbs, so this also makes for a nice cuddle but most importantly, it was very useful when aligning her spine. Note: it's a huge pillow, especially for a queen size bed, so, it would be a little uncomfortable for 2 people, perfect for solo sleepers. This pillow has served it's purpose. Thank you Leachco! The seller did a remarkable job at shipping this product to her, which was much earlier than expected.
