I LOVE this pillow! This is the most comfy pillow in the whole world and I want to use it even after I have the baby.  (Warning: it is super large and squeezes my hubby out, even though we have a king).As for the case, I initially thought this pillow did not have a case, so I ordered the case so the pillow woudln't get dirty. When I later looked closer at the pillow, I realized it already has a case on it!  It just is white, so it looks like it is just the pillow.  So you don't really need an extra case, you can just wash the one that it comes with.  Regardless, it's more convenient to have an extra case.  It fits the pillow pefectly, but it is hard work to put it on.  I wish there were like little snap buttons all long that made it easier to take on/ off, instead of having to pull the pillow case like a snake skin all the way around.
