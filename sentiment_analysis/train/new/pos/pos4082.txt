I really like the idea of this seat protector and I would really like to give it 5 stars, but it does have an issue with staying in place.  It works perfect when you are actually placing the child straight into the seat, but if there is any type of play, or if the child is getting themselves into the seat it tends to slide around.  If it had some type of rubber strips on the bottom, or maybe a kind of velcro material to connect it a little bit more to the car seat I think it would fix it.  Loved it when my daughter was an infant, but now that she's moved into the toddler stage I think it's become more trouble than it's worth.
