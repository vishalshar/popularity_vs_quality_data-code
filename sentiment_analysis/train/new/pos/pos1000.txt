I started using these bags when I was getting ready to go back to work.  I thought of Medela and Lansinoh, but wanted to try the green option first.When I opened the box, I could not believe the top-notch quality of these bags!  They're thick, immediately instilling confidence.  Breastmilk is precious so the trust factor is important.Then, the double zipper...  Unlike Lansinoh (which I had to buy from CVS at work after forgetting my bottles and Green Sprout bags at home), both layers are incredibly wide and secure.  You can feel the strength when opening the bag.  Lansinoh's bottom zipper is just like any sandwich bag's zipper, which comes undone very easily.  So I would not trust Lansinoh if I were laying the bags flat whereas I am absolutely confident with Green Sprouts.These bags also stay up even if you have only 2oz in them!Also, I would like to point out that none of these breastmilk storage bags should be trusted with oz measurements.  You should always take the measurement after pumping into the collection bottle.I would highly recommend these bags to any mom who has to store breastmilk.  They are expensive (Amazon, please include them in Subscribe & Save!), but absolutely worth every penny!
