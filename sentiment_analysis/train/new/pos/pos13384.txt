IT WORKED JUST AS I HAD HOPED! I bought this product just in time.  We were able to get a reading when we first suspected a slight temperature. Therefore we were able to start an acetaminophen regiment until we knew we couldn't control it. Emergency room and hospitalization followed.I even used it to monitor me 10 month old grandbaby's temp until Mom could get here from work. When her temperature started to rise it played a little tune. Even though Mom did inform me that it was not intended to be used that way and that it had become cloudy/wet inside, this product continued to work just fine. It was a comfort to baby, parents and grand parents during a VERY scary period this winter.I would absolutely recommend this to all parents, grandparents and/or baby setters.
