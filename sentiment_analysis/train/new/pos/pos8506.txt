I found one of these Built products by accident. I bought a diaper bag; in it, was a thermal bottle holder. It wasnt  Built product, but I lost that holder and went on a search for something similar and that was when I came across the Built products. This time I was smart, i bought Two.I drink water and cant stand it when my water gets warm, and I am super picky about the water I drink, and HAVE YOU SEEN THE PRICE OF WATER LATELY? So for those long days out, all I had to do was freeze my drinks and then take a couple of bottles with me.And to find them on Amazon for half the price... SCORE!Thanks Amazon!
