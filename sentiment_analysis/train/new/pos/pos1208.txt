I received these as a baby shower present and just now got around to using them now that my little one is on the move.  I was a little nervous because I saw all the bad reviews on them, but since it was a gift from a friend Amazon wouldn't let me return them for credit.  Being a stay at home Mom I get a little bored sometimes, so I figured it would be fun to make a video on the product and see how it turned out.  Luckily these latches ended up working out great for me.  I've been using them for about a week now on my cabinets (which get opened alot) and haven't had any issues.  The adhesive seems to be sticking well and I like the fact that the lock is on the inside... those that go on the outside seem to gawdy to me.I noticed alot of the reviews for this was that the adhesive didn't stick and came right off.  One thing I want to mention is that the instructions say it's really important to wash and dry the area and then let the locks alone for 24 hours for the glue to set in... hint hint, make sure you take anything out of your cabinets that you might need for the next day!  Anyway, hopefully this video review will help some others with their decisions.
