I just received this today and I am excited it did come much quicker then I expected coming from England. Its adorable and reversible, the back is just as cute. My one complaint is that its not thick just the two pieces of fabric sewn together, and that's my lacking the knowledge of the difference between duvet cover and comforter. I consider myself pretty crafty and intend on taking it apart and adding some batting or something. It is nice and big, not small like others have posted, definitely the right size for a twin bed. Overall I am very happy with this purchase but in the end its not my opinion that matters, I am sure my six year old batman crazy son will love this for his birthday.
