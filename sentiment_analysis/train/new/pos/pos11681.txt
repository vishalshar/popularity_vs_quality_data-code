This is my 4th carrier. My son is 3 months old, 17 pounds. I have a sling, a hip sling and a snuggli-the stripped down model. I got this one because I needed something that I could wear for extended periods with my baby facing out that would not restrict my movement too much. I bought it used, without instructions. I had no trouble figuring out how to use it. There are a number of adjustments to be made, but you only have to do it once, until your baby grows enough to move to the next setting. I made all the adjustments myself, with my baby in the carrier. It is a lot easier to get him in and out of than the the regular inward facing snugli. there are little buckles and velcro on the sides that you can undo to get baby in and out. I like that I didn't have to force my baby's feet into the holes, there is plenty of room for even big chunky thighs. A lot of people have complained about how hard it was to get baby in and out, but I don't know what they are comparing it to. I love that I could adjust everything to fit my baby perfectly. The carrier is soft and cozy. My baby felt safe and secure. My only complaint is that there is no waist strap, so I did feel a little strain in my back, and I felt a bit front heavy. Aside from that I think this is a really great carrier for the price. The only comparable brands cost more than 3 times as much. I think it's a really good deal.
