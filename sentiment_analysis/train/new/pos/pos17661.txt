FYI, comes as one piece, no assemblyPros:Looks nice dark cherry, doesn't look cheapSmaller than most dresser make sure you understand the dimensionsAmazon free delivery of a big item was nice (I spotted the guys some extra money to get it upstairs as they are only allowed to drop it in the front door)Cons:List price is too high, get it on saleLots of packaging (I guess this is a good thing as it kept it in good condition)
