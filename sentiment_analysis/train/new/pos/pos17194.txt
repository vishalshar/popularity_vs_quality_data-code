We bought this when our little one was just about a year old.  She was walking/crawling over to the fireplace all the time and opening the glass bi-fold doors.  I was worried she'd pinch herself or break a door and get cut.  But, I couldn't figure out a way to child-proof the fireplace...I even tried to redneck engineer a solution with some zip-ties through the handles, but that didn't work at all!We were thinking we'd have to pay big money for a tall screen that would screw into the walls and wrap around, when we found this item!It was definitely a moment of "It's so simple! Why didn't I think of that!" when I opened the box.  It's two bars that you put on top and bottom of your fireplace door handles, and then bolt together through the handles.  When snugged up, it effectively keeps the doors closed and in place.Our baby worked on this thing for about a week, trying to get it off and get at the doors, but it wouldn't budge!  She finally forgot about it and went on to finding trouble in other areas of our house.If you're looking for an inexpensive way to child-proof your fireplace doors, give this a try!  It's easy, quick, and effective!
