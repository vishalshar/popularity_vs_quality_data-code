Got this for a friend for shower gift. It is so nice. I thought the price was great also! She just loved it. We will see how it holds up, but if looks matter it gets 5 stars for that!!!Also, I noticed on the package that "Bright Starts" supports breast cancer research. Very impressed and thankful that purchased something that some of proceeds goes to such a good cause.
