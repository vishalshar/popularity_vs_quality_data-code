I use this to keep an eye on my toddler now that he is forward facing. We did have a problem in our vehicle finding a place the suction cup would work, and the clip also didn't work on our visor, but we ended up clipping it by our sun roof. The passenger sometimes knocks it a little out of place, but that doesn't happen very often. I like how it doesn't shake when we drive on the freeway, it works amazingly well and is easy to adjust.
