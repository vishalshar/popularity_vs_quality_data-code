I love these for the diaper bag.  The bags are sturdier and a little large than doggie bags.  I tried the pet version because they are cheaper but the bags have always been thinner, more prone to tearing, and smaller.  These are the perfect thing to throw in a terrible diaper, twist and secure.  Great on the go when you may not have a trash can nearby or when you are a guest and don't want to stink up someone's house.  Compared to other similar products, this is a winner.
