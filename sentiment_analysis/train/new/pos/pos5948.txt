I currently live in Germany and had my son during the winter months ordering the cover was the best thing ever.  I had major issues keeping his feet warm until I got the cover.  Once we had the cover on and went out everything was nice and toasty.  The only down side was the buttons to snap it on were not *that* easy to do one handed and impossible to get your other arm around the baby to snap. My baby spends more time in the Ergo than any other stroller/seat/carrier and if you live in a cold weather area this is a must in my opinion ! Happy Walking !
