We've tried to avoid products with licensed characters which is so hard to do. My daughter started using this toothpaste when she first started getting teeth and I felt good about it after checking in with a family member who is a dental hygienist. The toothpaste has a sweet flavor to it and we love that since my daughter hates all things minty. She claims it's "too spicy." Now that she is a little older we use this toothpaste in combination with a tiny bit of Tom's of Maine Strawberry that has fluoride in it as well. I love that it's natural and organic knowing that little ones aren't great at spitting out after brushing always. We've purchased four tubes of this and will continue to since she loves it so much and it makes brushing easier. The tube has a cute design, is BPA free and recyclable too. I've suggested it to other friends as well.
