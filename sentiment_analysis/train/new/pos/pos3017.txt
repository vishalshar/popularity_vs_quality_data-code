This was a fairly decent carseat.  I enjoyed the fact that I was able to find a highly rated carseat that can in colors for boys, besides just plain black.  While it kept my child safe and I'm able to use it for quite some time,  I had one major issue with it.  The cover is quite difficult to remove.  After a serious diaper blow out, it took me far too long just to take the whole thing apart to get everything wiped down and washed.  He also couldn't quite reach the cupholder, which isn't much of a problem. With all that aside, a child's safety always triumphs convenience.  It has a great crash test rating and my boy can use it for quite some time to come!
