We got this car seat to replace a larger (up to 65 pound) car seat after a car accident.  This seat is SO MUCH SMALLER than our old one that we are LOVING it!  It takes up less space (and thus is easier to squeeze past when getting to the back seat of the van), buckles easily, and the bonus is that it will convert to a booster when we need it. Have never tried to take the cover off to wash it, but it doesn't seem like it would be too hard to do, if needed.Cons: (very minor in my opinion)The straps "fold" a little easier than the straps on our old seat, and I am a stickler for straps to lay flat.The recline option sounds nice, but in practice we never use it because of the way the seat fits into the car's chair.
