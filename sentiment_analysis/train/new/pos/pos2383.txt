We're renting, so I didn't want to mount anything on the doorframes.  And we bought this gate because we have a son (12 months, 24lbs, early walker), not dogs.Though I would have desired better graphics in the instructions, setup was easy enough for the pressure mounting.  When you're setting the tabs, you have to meticulously adjust the width of the gate to be appropriate for your doorway.  I set it as large as possible, which means that I have to put pressure on the springed surface (and depress them) which contact my doorframe, even with the latch in the open (up) position.  Closing the latch adds even more pressure, and the indicators on the springed doo-hickeys turn from red to green.  If you see any red, you're a wus, and you need to adjust the gate to a slightly larger size; otherwise, your kid will go "crashing through" the gate.If I were to recommend a change, it would be that the springs had more room to spring, even if that meant more pressure to depress them.  Or perhaps that the pressure-adding latch extended the gate (and added pressure) to a greater extent than it does now.  That would make the daily up/down routine a little faster.  My wife complains that the gate is hard for her to take down/put up.But seriously, despite all this about the difficulty in putting up/taking down, the only way any of these pressure mounted gates are going to work is with lots of pressure.  If you don't think you can muscle up a little bit each time you manuver the gate, you need a wall-mounted product.I am considering buying a second gate for another area in the house, and I'll probably purchase the same product.
