We have several of these plates, and they are pretty much the only plates we use.  We have them in green, orange, and blue Tommee Tippee BPA Free Section Plates - 2 Pack (BLUE).  I saw the 3 star review and thought I'd better chime in.  The reviewer said they purchased them for a 7 month old (that they are still spoon feeding) and they were bigger than expected - that doesn't warrant a 3 star review.  The product description recommends 9m+ and says it has deeper sections & angled feature for easy (self) feeding.  We started using them when our son was beginning to feed himself, and they work especially well with the silicone easi-mat (couldn't find them on Amazon).  The mat is made of silicone; the smooth side sticks to the table or high chair tray very well, and the top side has a suction cup that will attached to the bottom of these plates, or the bowls Tommee Tippee 4-Pack Explora Weaning Bowls - Boy or Tommee Tippee Explora Weaning Bowls 2-pack with Lid & Weaning Spoon - Orange.  The suction cup is pretty strong.  Our son was probably about 18 months old before he could pull it up.  Our son is now 28 months old, and these are still the plates and bowls we use almost exclusively.  If you are looking for something that works well for spoon feeding, especially if you don't use a full jar of baby food at a feeding, the Tommee Tippee food pots work well.  I didn't find them on Amazon either, but Babies 'R Us carries a wide selection of Tommee Tippee products both online and in stores.
