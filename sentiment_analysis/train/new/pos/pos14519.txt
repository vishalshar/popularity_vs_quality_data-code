The product came folded a bit sloppy, which created extra wrinkles, but if you're patient, you can work them out. We bought a set 2 years ago for our first child, and they are holding up great on one side of the car. Just bought a second set and installed on the other side of the car without any issues.Here's what you do...1. Clean the window to remove any dust and lint.2. Remove the cling from package and avoid too many finger prints on it. Also, try not to place it on your car seats or anywhere that it can pick up dust/lint.3. Spray a light mist of glass cleaner on your window.4. "Float" the cling on the wet surface until you get it where you want it.5. Using an old credit card, work any bubbles/liquid out from the center of the cling towards the edges. Be careful to do this gently and slowly so that the card doesn't catch on the plastic and make a kink.6. Use paper towels to soak up glass cleaner as it seeps out from the edges.7. If you have any stubborn areas, life the cling away from the glass, spray more cleaner, and repeat steps 5-6.There may be some bubbles that linger, but they tend to disappear after a few days of exposure to warm sun.Hope this helps!
