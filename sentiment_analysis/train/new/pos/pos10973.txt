Love this! Been using it with my daughter since she was around 8 months old. She's now 2. One tip that helps; After each bath the warm water warms the cap repeatedly so it can over time not fit as snug on the baby head allowing water through on there little eyes. But we had a little bucket we just snuggly fit it in after  done using so it dries inside and is snug fitting for each use. Hope that's not confusing. Will attach picture.
