We have the Britax Marathon 70 but wanted to get a carseat for our 2nd car. This Britax Roundabout seems to be comparable to the Marathon 70, but is almost $100 less expensive. When I compared the two on the Britax website, it seems they have all the same "safety" features. The main differences are those of convenience and are easy to do without, like the quick adjust harness, easy to remove cover, chest pads, etc. In short, we have the more expensive version of this carseat (Marathon 70) and we are just as happy with this one!
