We purchased the Combi Travel Solutions Play Yard back in 2008 when my first daughter was born.  We still use it today (2011) for my second daughter who is now 16 months old.  Here are all the things I love about this play yard: - separate pedestal for the bassinet that can be stationary or rolled - this feature made it perfect for use in two places, namely, pedestal in our bed room and play yard in the family room/kitchen.  And the rolling feature made it even more convenient for taking the bassinet to different rooms like the family room, kitchen and dining room. - changing table can be stowed away leaving a safe place to put down the baby - hanging toys were a wonder for both my daughters - easily folds up for travel - we have used the play yard as a crib for my 16 month old daughter on numerous occasions.  she loves it as if it is her usual cribThere really isn't anything bad I can say about this play yard.  The construction is sound and after 3 long years of use, it is still in perfect condition (no exaggeration).  There is no fabric fraying and no torn netting.  We don't even have any stains on the changing table.  All accidents were easily cleaned with soap and water.  This play yard has served us well and continues to do so!
