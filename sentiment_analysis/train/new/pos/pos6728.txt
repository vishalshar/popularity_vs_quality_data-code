Like the others, our sleeve came loose but before we let it fall apart I just popped the bottom off, tightened the bolt and put some super glue on it to lock the screw in place. Is that lame? Sure, but we've had no leaking with it, the flip top is a must, and it insulates super well. Is it the perfect solution for an insulated sippy? no, but it's the best we've found and our daughter loves it.
