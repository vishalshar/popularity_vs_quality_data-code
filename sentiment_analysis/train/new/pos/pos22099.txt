This product is an absolute must if using the high chair with an infant, especially when the baby still needs a little bit of support to sit.  The plastic seems durable, yet fragile at the same time.  It does its job well, but you don't want to add extra stress to it.  It's important to make the adjustments to the chair, as the instructions indicate, to keep from over-stressing the plastic.  (Adjust the seat to extend out at 3/4" but no more than 2" from the frame.)  The plastic is easy to wipe clean and keeps my baby secure in the chair.
