I always considered this as an item that I did not need. I spent the first three months of my baby's life with just the changing pad and longed for the cute covers.Then I got this one and realized that it is waterproof. We all know that babies will sometimes have accidents on the changing table WHILE you are changing that diaper. You need to be quick those first few weeks or you end up being peed on/pooped on.This cover makes it nice, warm and cozy so that baby doesn't wake up in those middle of the night diaper changes, and easily wipes away the mess/is machine washable. I just wish I would have got this sooner to prevent my baby from waking up because of the cold changing pad.
