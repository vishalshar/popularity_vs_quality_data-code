It's pretty much a big paper sticker to stick on a child's clothes. Would've preferred something that is sewn into the fabric of clothes itself but this is the next best alternative. Since it's paper(ish), it doesn't quite fit neatly on the clothes, but the baby won't be wearing it for too long anyway (just long enough for a photo-op).
