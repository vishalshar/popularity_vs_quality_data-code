If you like to freeze your teethers I highly recommend these. My daughter likes the cold on her gums, but doesn't like the ones where you freeze the entire piece because they make her little hands cold. With these, you can pop off the bottom piece, freeze the gel, and then re-attach the bottom when giving it to your child, making the part they hold room temperature, while the teether is cold. Great purchase!
