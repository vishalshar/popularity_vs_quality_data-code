My son really liked this gym.  At 2 months he would lay on his back and look up at the canopy and toys.  He kept playing with it as he grew and it kept him busy while I folded laundry.  :)  I love that the fabric on the mat is a soft cotton!  It is easy to wash and all but the rhino toys are washable.  The rhino does make tinny, funky music that nobody in this house liked, including baby.  He loves all of the other toys and still, at almost 10 months, plays with the turtle, alligator and bird.  It is not as flashy as some other gyms, but baby was always interested in the toys and never got frustrated or overstimulated.  Happy coos every time.
