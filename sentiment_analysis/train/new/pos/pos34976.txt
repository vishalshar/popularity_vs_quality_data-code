I bought two of these for my daughters to use at their kindergarten. They find it easy to open and close and unique color makes it less likely that another kid will confuse it as their. Not sure but I believe that as this is an opaque container the water are not getting smelly (sometimes we forget to take the bottles home during the weekend) even after several days, even at summer. The opening is wide enough to allow easy cleaning of the inside of the bottles.Cons: the paint comes off when bottles are getting hits and dents, not so bad but you should expect it.Also, the mouth piece will need replacement after some use (~6+ months), it's still usable but gets quite worn out.All and all, I love this product, have bought bottles for everyone in the family in various sizes.
