The reviewers were right on this one! Its an awesome retro kinda feel like an elegant old school throw back that at a vintage store would be way more money. It turns and twists with just the tiniest of wind. I often come into the room and find it gently turning on its own. If you get it started it will turn for quite some time. I used the reviewers suggestions and hung it from the ceiling with a srew/hook with anchor of course(1.89) and fishwire (1.00)... I did have a tough time getting the fishwire to stay in a sturdy knot so I used a glue gun to stick it to the hook. I can wrap the wire around the hook as he grows to make it go higher and higher to insure its not within his grip. Just Gorgeous. Matched my animal theme perfectly! Wonderful price too! I have an overhead fan that makes this thing move far more than any battery operated one! Cant wait for the baby to see it!!!
