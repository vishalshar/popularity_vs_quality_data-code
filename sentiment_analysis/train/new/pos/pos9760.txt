My daughter had "graduated" to a full size bed and was a little wary of sleeping in such a big bed so we purchased this clock for her since a big girl needs to have her own clock beside her bed.Of course the pink (one of her favorite colors) clock was very welcome beside her bed. She is just learning to tell time so the combination of the minute and hour hands along with a digital clock is very helpful for her. My daughter said that her favorite part of the clock is the day/night light on the side of the clock. She can sometimes tell the time but is it 8 o'clock in the morning or is it 8 o'clock in the evening? AM and PM does not make sense to her yet. She can see the light and know if the 8 o'clock means "morning or evening".I do like that the alarm, day/night light are on separate on/off switches and then a master switch can turn all off and on. The alarm has a tweeting bird, a cuckoo clock and a train for the alarms sounds. The bird is the least 'scary" sound for her but the best alarm is still mom or dad getting her out of bed. The top of the clock also has a large button that turns the light on for the clock face for a few seconds and she also makes use of that if a scary dream or sound wakes her up. It's enough light to reassure her but not enough to wake her all the way up.So far both the regular and digital clocks are staying accurate within a minute or two and I have not had to reset the time.The paint on the inside of the day/night light is a little scratched but does not look that bad. All in all it was a good purchase for my little angel.
