I travel weekly on airplanes.  I am constantly at airports going through security etc and I wear sneakers/running shoes with appropriate business attire.  I had been using safety pins to pin up the hems of my pants but they are difficult and puncture the fabric.  I have my pants tailored to the length of the appropriate heels.  I am not about to have all my pants redone for running shoes only to know that I can't wear any of my heels. I bought two sets and have airport tested them...I love these clips (big plastic paper like clips).  They held up the cuff of my pants perfectly.  I am quickly able to take the clips off and put on the shoes that go with the pants once I have arrived at my destination.  Anyone who is a frequent traveler knows that heels set off the metal detectors (metal shanks in heels) so sneakers/running shoes are perfect. I can't believe these clips held up me hauling through the airport, on the plane, off the plane, back through another airport etc.  I bet these are great for kids.  Thanks to all the mom's for posting the reviews.  Who knew these would be the best option for a business traveling female. (P.s. The flower is adorable)
