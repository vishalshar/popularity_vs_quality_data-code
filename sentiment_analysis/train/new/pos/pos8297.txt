A teething baby is an unhappy baby. An unhappy usually makes for tired parents who are searching for answers. While the "The First Year Massaging Action Teether" does not solve the problem it does see to offer our daughter a little relief.The pros-- Inexpensive - really, how much do you stand to lose if this does not work?- Our daughter seems to enjoy the massaging action, although she rarely uses it for more than a minute.- The massaging section is shaped so that it can be "bitten" in a variety of directions. This helps make it effective for the front/back and left/right sides of the mouth.- The little spinner on the end always seems to catch my daughters eye.- It is pretty quietOther things to consider- While it is not a "negative" it is impossible to access the batteries. Once the batteries die the whole thing goes into the garbage. While this seems to be a negative - I really don't mind that my daughter mouth does NOT have any type of access to batteris. Call me old-fashioned like that ;o)Final Verdict - I would not consider this a "must-have" but for the price it is well worth the investment of a few dollars.4 stars
