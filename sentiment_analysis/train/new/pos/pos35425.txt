This monitor for us has worked like a charm, the sound is very clear, has no interference at all, the night light is great to check on baby, the range is good too, I like the controls on the monitor, the price is good too, I have never used the sounds on it, cause my baby does not need sounds to go to sleep, but is an extra feature for someone who might need it, is great that everything can be controlled from your room without having to get up.
