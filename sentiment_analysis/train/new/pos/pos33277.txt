We used this diaper wallet for about 2 years with my first child and are a few months into using it with the second. I have thrown in it the washing machine to clean, and despite all it has held up well. No rips or tears.We keep a dedicated diaper bag in our car with extra wipes, diapers, trash bags, and a change of clothes. This diaper wallet I throw in the stroller. It has a velcro loop to attach anywhere but I don't use that much.In the wallet I usually am able to fit 3-4 diapers. I think I was able to fit 6 size 1s, but baby outgrew that size quickly. In the diaper pocket I also keep a tube of diaper cream. Then the baby wipes. I use their plastic container and refill from the set of wipes in the car. Or I'll buy a travel pack and stick it in there. I can fit two travel packs (40 wipes) in the wipe pocket. I usually only fit about 20 wipes in the plastic wipe holder that comes with it. The plastic wipe holder will allow your wipes to dry out if left unused too long. Huggies sells a plastic holder I feel was a bit better at keeping the moisture in.My daughter was tall and outgrew the wallet's changing mat before she outgrew diapers. I just kept using it but would put her head on another part of the wallet.We traveled so much when my daughter was young and this was a great thing to have. All the items you need together in one place. Mat built in so you can even change your kid on the floor - which I've had to do numerous times when changing stations weren't available. No stigma of a diaper bag, so even the husband will change a diaper (no guarantees though). And it keeps my purse free to be a purse. I love not having to carry diaper paraphernalia in my bag. I need room for all the other kid stuff.The pattern I was sent is light blue with green and pink polka sot swirls. It's a good neutral pattern. I've never used the diaper wallet as a fashion accessory, so I was OK with any color they sent.
