We recently purchased this to go with a Peg Perego car seat that we were given for our second child.  We had used a full-blown travel system for our oldest.  We rarely used the stroller because it was bulky (heavy to remove and took up most of the trunk) as well as hard to maneuver.  I switched to a lightweight, umbrella stroller as soon as my oldest was able to sit up.For our second child, we wanted something less bulky and easy to use.  This stroller fits perfectly with what we wanted.  I had a c-section, and at 2 weeks after surgery was easily able to remove it from the trunk, open it one handed and put the car seat in.  It takes up very little space.  It closes and opens smoothly.  It also handles extremely well- very easy to turn and move through small spaces.My husband did say that it was difficult to remove the pieces required to adapt it for the Perego car seat.  It took him awhile to find the alleged directions (I had to keep insisting that they were there- men and directions)-- to his credit, it was simply a small footnote on the instructions and it was difficult to follow. We had thought of sending it back, but are very glad we didn't.The Perego seat doesn't "snap" in- it sits in and there is a strap that goes over the car seat.  It's actually easier to use.  You don't have to worry about snapping something in and out.The only downside that I've found- and we had the same problem with our last stroller- is that you can't reach into the basket underneath once the car seat is in place.  There are great holders on the handles, however, for drinks, keys, cell phone, etc, so it hasn't been a problem.I love this and would highly recommend it for someone who wants something lightweight, easy to use and that doesn't fill up your trunk.
