We love these cups and plan to purchase them again for our next little one.They never leak unless the top is screwed on wrong(of course!) and even when dropped, they don't send off that spurt of milk/juice that other sippy cups do.We've tried several different "off brands" from Target and Walmart and they just didn't work for us. Even though they were cheaper, they always leaked and our son didn't like them as much as these.I will say that our son wore a hole in the soft spout from teething. Not a big deal but we were worried about him biting off a piece, so we had to replace them. But that was after about a year of use which I think is pretty darn good for a sippy cup life span.At any rate, awesome cup and we will definitely be buying more.***EDIT: I do want to say that the picture on this particular item is misleading. You will not get the "water bottle" style sippy cups.
