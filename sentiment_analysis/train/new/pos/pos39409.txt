It really is a cute toy; press one of the three buttons and a song plays and lights start flashing. I bought it for my niece, though I have yet to give it to her, but I know she'll love it. The only flaw, which I guess isn't much to complain about, is that the music is definitely out of tune. The one I bought is specifically very flat. I know she won't know the difference, but I can't help but wonder if her listening to it will affect her ability to determine if something is out of tune when she is older. My brother would surely be disappointed if I were the reason his daughter were tone deaf.
