I read several reviews that said this mattress was too firm and was hesitant to order it.  We ordered it anyway since we have a Graco pack n play and it is suppose to fit that brand nicely.  It is NOT too firm.  It is just about right.  It has just enough give that I think it will be way more comfortable than the board and pad that come with the pack n play.  But it isn't so soft that it would be a hazard for SIDS.  It is just a little bit firmer than our crib mattress.  It also fits nice and snug in the Graco Pack N Play.  I think it was a good buy and Amazon had the best price!
