I bought this lamp to match the carter's forest friend themed nursery. When i first received the product, i noticed that the fox had broken off the base during shipment. I contacted Amazon and exchanged it for a new one and it was received within days.  After setting it up, (it comes with a light bulb) it's just enough light so that when i first turn on the light in the nursery, it's not too bright but just enough to do what you have to do (check on your baby, grab something, etc...) w/out disturbing the baby. It's very cute and I'm glad I bought it.
