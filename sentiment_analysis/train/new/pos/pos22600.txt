As stated in the title, I find these good for around the house but not for extended trips out. If you're like me, you're looking to stop or minimize leaking but want to do so in a natural way. Because they are straight cotton with no moisture barrier or PUL layer, they will absorb but will not prevent it from soaking through to your clothes. So if you have a heavy let down, frequent leaking or deal with engorgement, I would not suggest these. For around the house & when I'm able to quickly change them out in the event of let down, they're perfect.Another reviewer complained of shrinkage, but when you're dealing with organic cotton, or cotton in general, that's to be expected. I'm including pictures showcasing the shrink I experienced & also comparing the two against another popular disposable nursing pad. I didn't find it to be an issue, but will say that I've not put mine in the dryer. I wash in a lingerie bag, stretch & reshape them & lay flat to dry. I think these are a bit like cloth diapers & will require a vinegar rinse every few washes in order to clean out the extra detergent & make sure they keep their absorbancy. Overall I am pleased with my purchase.
