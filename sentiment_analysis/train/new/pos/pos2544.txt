I just recieved this yesterday and WOW i'm so very impressed.  I have been looking hi and low for bedding that has a high quality quilt, without the high quality price like those specialty websites.  This is gonna be my last baby so i wanted something reasonably priced that looked expensive.  It's so sweet, the butterflies are embroideried into the blanket, the blue ones have a micro fiber fleece thats really soft, and the green ones have a sweater like material.  The pinks on this bedding are so pretty...not that candy cotton pink like all other bedding.  I absolutly love the colors of this bedding....this is my third girl so all pink was out of the question!!! I also ordered the matching valance, and to my suprise once out of the package was very nicely made.  It is lined with a solid white material whcih when hung up allows it to be more opaque...not thin like some others.  All in all this bedding is priced better than other websites carrying the same thing....some have this bedding possted at $200. Trust me you wont be dissapointed!
