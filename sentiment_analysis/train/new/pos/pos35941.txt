If I had known that purchasing a new battery would restore my monitor to nearly brand new, I would have done it so much sooner! After using our monitor for two years, it would last about five minutes when separated from the charging cord. After replacing the battery, it probably lasts five hours running. That is amazing. It works for when I want to spend time in the garden or at the other end of my house making dinner. I no longer feel like I need to stay within earshot of my sleeping children. I highly recommend buying this!
