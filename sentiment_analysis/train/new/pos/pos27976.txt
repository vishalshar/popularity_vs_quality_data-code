I bought a variety of different kinds of cloth diapers in preparation for my newborn. I had all in ones (which are great for being in the diaper bag or left with grandparents because of their ease), hybrids, wool, prefolds with PUL covers etc etc. I really wanted to try it all! Rumparooz were definitely my favorite PUL cover.Advantages:1. Really great fit. I tried other covers as well and none fit as well as these.2. Love the prints - they look even cuter in person!3. Although doing the pre-fold and cover option can seem daunting, it really isn't. It actually is really easy, and funny enough is the one my husband prefers (even over the all in ones). Don't even worry about doing fancy folds and using pins or stretchy clips to keep them in place. Just open the cover, lay a tri-folded pre-fold in it, velcro and go!4. They fit longer than other newborn covers. I had a chunky baby that decided to start to outgrown her newborn diapers at around 6 weeks. But these lasted until she was about 10 weeks.Disadvantages:1. My only issue is the velcro. I'm really not a fan, and it mostly has to do with washing. Even if I stick them to the tabs before I wash, they still sometimes came undone and grabbed on to other things in the wash. And also I probably sometimes forgot to stick them to the tabs as well...because who can remember that at 3 a.m? :)
