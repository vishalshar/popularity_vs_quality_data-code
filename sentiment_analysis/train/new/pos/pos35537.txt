This thing saved our sanity. We have a very active two year-old and this kept him in his seat for a 12-hour international flight. Easy to install. For safety reasons, it doesn't strap them in around the crotch area, so they can slide themselves out through the bottom if they work at it. We put a sheet of padded cupboard liner (search: Con-Tact Brand Grip Premium Non-Adhesive Non-Slip Shelf and Drawer Liner, 12-Inches by 4-Feet, Black) on the seat under him and it did the trick. If he really wanted out, he could have done it, but he would've had to work at it a lot harder. We just kept the liner mat in the bag provided with the harness. I took off a star for price-gouging...Apparently this is the only FAA-approved belt, and they charge accordingly.
