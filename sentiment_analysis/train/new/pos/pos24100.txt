Setting up the stroller was pretty straight forward, just follow the instrucitons in the booklet and it was all done in about 10 minutes. The stroller is reasonably compact when folded and would have to problem fitting into the boot of any mid-sized sedans.Quality wise, everything looks of reasonable quality, did not notice any parts that looks cheap or flimsy. However, I do hope that the latch that you pull to close and open the stroller is built to last. So far, it looks strong but that strap is going to have to withstand countless pulls and it is also the 'handle' which you hold on to when u carry the folded stroller around. Please note that you shouldn't be carrying the stroller using the child tray (this is stated in the user manual). The child tray is easily removable and able to pivot on either side for easy handling of baby.Manouvering the stroller is a breeze and the wheels are very smooth. Folding is pretty easy, just pull the strap, but you will have to give an extra push once is folded to make it as flat as possible. Unfolding will need both hands and some practicing but is pretty straightforward.The hood is huge as it is expandable to cover about 90% of the "passenger". There is also a peekaboo window but I wonder why Graco did not add a velcro to hold the peekaboo flap in place, although it stay pretty much stays in place already, but not sure when it is outdoors and the wind gets strong, the flaps may start flapping around.The height of the stroller is good, I am 1.88 meters tall (6ft 1in) and I no problems pushing the stroller around, no need to bend over.Overall I am please with the stroller, although the final call would have to be my newborn due only in June. So we shall see.
