OK so I read other reviews before I got mine about the fish sticking.  Sure enough when I got mine, even before filling it with water they were all stuck together, like tightly stuck together.  What I did (and it worked so do this!!) was took all the little plastic fish out first thing.  I poured some olive oil on my hands and I rubbed each fish lightly through my hands and got them all a little oily.  I then put all the fish back in, poured a tiny amount of vinegar in the whale then filled with water.  None of my fish stick together and the water has not mucked up or molded at all.  Do this before filling and it's perfect!  I've taken this to restaurants with me to put on the tables in front of my baby and she loves it.  Also loves it at home too.  Great product at a great price, just don't forget to oil up the little toys first.
