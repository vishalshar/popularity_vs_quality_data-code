before my baby was born i wasn't sure that i would need the infant support, but after trying to use the flexibath for my baby's very first bath i realized quickly how useful it could be. now that my baby is 6 months old, i have to say that this piece has been indispensable for use with the flexibath as we are still using it for each and every bath. since we use the flexibath in our tub it's too hard to try and have more than one person bathe her (our tub is only accessible on one side as it is a standard built-in shower/tub combo) so having this insert to cradle and support her body in the bathtub is super helpful as i work on lathering and rinsing her.my baby loves baths and since her very first bath she has always loved to froggy kick constantly throughout the bath so i still usually need to keep one hand on her to keep her from inadvertently sliding off the support and into the water but not having to use both arms to hold her head above water and support the rest of her body still makes a huge difference. while i do wish that the shape of the insert was a little bit more molded - partly because it seems like it would be more comfortable for her and partly because it would probably make it less likely that she could slip off of it with all the froggy kicking she does - i have to admit that my baby has never seemed uncomfortable in it and as strong a kicker as she is maybe the molding wouldn't have helped anyways!the one thing i do that helps to reduce the slipperiness is lay a hand towel over the insert as a cushy layer between the insert and my baby - it means having an extra item to wash after every bath (along with the washcloth i use during her bath) but babies don't need baths all that often so it hasn't been an issue at all. i think the company should create a specially fitted terrycloth piece as an option but until then, the hand towel works just great.
