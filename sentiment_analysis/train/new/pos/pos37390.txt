This gadet will change your life FOREVER! I always scoffed at people for having the pacifier clip - looked borderline like you were leashing your kid. We always just had the Soothie and remembered to take it with us, or had mutiple spares in the diaper bag. When someone in our playgroup said it was one of the best purchases she ever made, I decided to give it a whirl. BOY OH BOY am I glad I did!  My gosh - I can't imaging life without it!It clips SO easily to everything  - his clothes, the straps of his car seat, Jackets!  Back peddling just a bit - my son only takes the soothie, but he constantly pops it out of his mouth, and I have taken to carrying around pacifier wipes everywhere. Fast forward and enter in the pacifier clip - he can spit out the paci all he wants now, and I don't have a care in the world, because it never drops!  I feel like only a parent would know what I mean when it is so liberating knowing that I can let him be and I don't have to worry about it!Anyone who's baby uses a pacifier should get one of these. And not to forget that this brand has super adorable prints. We absolutely love his orange and blue striped one - it looks like a cute little tie on our little man!
