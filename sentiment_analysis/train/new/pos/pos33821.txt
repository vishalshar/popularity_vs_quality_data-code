Pros: battery power lasted for up to two weeks, stabilizing hook kept the car seat from moving all over the place, and ac input saved battery power when not going out.Cons: the noise the rocker would make was annoying to us, but it helped put baby to sleep, so that's  probably a pro; when using the ac  adapter, the rocker would go at Super sonic speeds and there was no way to adjust the speed,  so we used quite a bit of batteries and then we finally bought rechargeable  batteries and had no problem.All in all ,this is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone. If you have your baby in a car seat, always monitor them to make sure they are in the correct reclined position to breathe properly.
