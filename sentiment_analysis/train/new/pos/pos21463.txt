I read the reviews before I bought this and all the reviews stated that it wasn't a very good sticker because it didn't stick to the walls.  However, it looks adorable in my daughters bathroom.  I put parts of it on the mirror, in the shower, and on the toilet lid.  Very cute!  Just don't stick it on the wall.  I matched it with http://www.amazon.com/Splash-Shower-Curtain-72-Inch-Grass/dp/B008ROE9OO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423286143&sr=8-1&keywords=grass+shower+curtain this grass shower curtain to stick to the woodlands theme.  :)
