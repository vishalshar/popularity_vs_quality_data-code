I spent HOURS researching car seats...this one is amazing!  We also own Sunshine Kids Radian 65 which is a good seat as well, but the Apex 65 is MUCH MORE COMFY.  My daughter is 5.5, above average height for her age and still has TONS of room to grow!  Would definitely recommend this seat...this is coming from a Mom of 3 kids who has done a lot of car seat research.
