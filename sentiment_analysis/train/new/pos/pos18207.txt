We have found this toy most enjoyable to use to interact with hour six-month-old daughter. She has loved this item since receiving it at 4 months.  The colorful designs, varied textures and sounds capture her attention and hold it for long stretches of time.  She has a number of other highly-rated toys for grabbing/mouthing/rattling, but this one is definitely her favorite.
