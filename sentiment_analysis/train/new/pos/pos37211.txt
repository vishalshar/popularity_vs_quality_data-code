We received this as a gift for our baby before she arrived... I loved it so much, I bought one for my future niece!!  I have used this almost everyday (our baby is now 6 months old).  When she was really small, I liked how it allowed her to lay more flat than the bouncers (but can also be adjusted for more incline).  I could put her in it and rock her with my foot (so I could eat dinner and she would be comforted).  The vibration is soothing for her, but she doesn't always require it.  It travels well as we took it with us during our holiday travels --it can compact down (which is important because there wasn't that much room in the car with everything else) and it's VERY light (so we can move it from room to room, and house to house with ease)! I really like the convertibility of the product --that it can be a rocker OR a chair, AND has different levels of incline.  I am also excited that it has such a high poundage capacity (many of her baby items only go to 15 or 25 pounds, whereas this one goes to 35 or 40, I believe), so she will be able to use it for a couple years (instead of just a few months)!  The arm swivels out of the way and can be removed and attached easily. She likes the toys (and started to 'sit up' to reach for them at 4 1/2 months).  I've already washed and dried the seat a few times, and it's held up well thus far.  So grateful for a product that can go in the washer and dryer vs. spot clean only!  I did hear of one baby that didn't care for it, but I would not want to be without this item!!  We have used it more than her swing, bouncer, AND nap nanny (all of which she has now outgrown)!
