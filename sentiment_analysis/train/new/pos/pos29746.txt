I ordered this for my little girls pack n play mattress. I'm using the Graco pack n play little hoot and the Dream on Me 3" inner spring Carina Collection Pack N Play Mattress and it fits it just right. I have 2 sheets that I cycle through every week so this sheet will me the third. Compared to my 2 other sheets in terms of design this is quite different as this doesn't have elastics that wraps around the mattress. This sheets kind of wrap on the mattress itself with it's deep pockets. It's a very simple no nonsense design that's somehow similar to pillow cases so it's more like a mattress case then.The sheet is made from 100% soft jersey knit cotton. It's not as soft when I first open it but after washing the sheet it has gotten softer. Still not as soft as my bamboo sheet though. But just as comfortable and breathable.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
