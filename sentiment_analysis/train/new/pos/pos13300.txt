We bought this because we read that microwaving milk for your infant is not a good idea (possibility for toxins from the bottle; can easily overheat the milk), and warming milk on the stove (boiling water) is time intensive - if you have a crying baby on your hands, every second counts.Pros: Easy to use, has settings for frozen, refrigerated & room temperature. You can operate it one handed!Cons: While you can operate it one handed - the circumference of the warmer and the circular shape make it a little hard to grip. I found the recommended settings to be a little off (didn't warm the milk enough).Tips: This is just my personal experience - so take it for what it's worth. I only used it  with refrigerated or room temp milk. I set number of ounces one number higher than the amount of milk I had in the baby bottle. Don't try to use it to thaw milk in a frozen plastic bag (big mess - and the reason I only used it for room temp & refrig. milk) Make sure the water level is just even with the removable screen in the bottom of the warmer. If you leave the just warmed bottle in the warmer for very long after it's done, it will overheat the milk. I always swirled the bottle after I took it out of the warmer to ensure even warmth. This is a "No Brainer", but.. ALWAYS TEST THE MILK BEFORE GIVING IT TO YOUR CHILD.Recommended to friends: Yes.
