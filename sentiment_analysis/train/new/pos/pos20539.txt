My wife is a Peanuts crazy woman... It is getting hard to find anything that she doesn't already have. I found this blanket and now I need to purchase two more for one grandson born in February and one for another grandchild to be born December 1st. They are so soft and well stitched and colors are very vivid! Highly recommended!
