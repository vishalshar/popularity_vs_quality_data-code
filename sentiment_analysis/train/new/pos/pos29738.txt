Chicago winter.  Car travel and long stroller trips.  Had this for two years and plan on using it for two more.We had a September baby and bought the Medium size.  That first winter, we used it on her car seat, both in the car and snapped into her stroller.  I loved that it felt safer for car travel (since there is nothing bulky between baby and car seat) and that we didn't have to wrangle her into a heavy coat everytime we went out.  In fact, she never needed more than a light fleece or blanky to keep her shoulders warm.  I wouldn't say that it stays on our carseat flawlessly (Graco Snugride 35), but it worked well enough.By getting the Medium,we were able to use it a second season as a stroller bag.  For that is was great!  I look with pity on anyone trying to get an infant/toddler into a snowsuit every.time.they.go.outside.  And then of course, the poor kid gets hot when you pop into the store.  With the Sac Igloo, you can just pull it back to let some air in.  The zippered hood also gives you some warmth adjustment.At the end of the second winter (kid about 18 months old) she was starting to grow out of it (75th-90th height) though we could have fudged it a bit if necessary.  We plan on using this with our new baby and sizing up to a large for kid #1.Other brags:- outside material resists stains well.- because the inside is not fuzzy, it's easier to get a wiggly kid in and out of it than with a JJ Cole, IMO.7am enfant also makes a larger one (Blanket Evolution) that grows with the kid.  I don't know if that one goes onto a car seat.  In any case, it costs more and if you're planning on having a later child, that might not be such a big advantage anyway.
