In a way, this bag was an unexpected surprise. I read some of the ratings and thought that for $25, this bag was worth a try. I honestly was just looking for a cheaper replacement bag, so with this price in mind, I know I wasn't expecting something grandiosely sturdy or high-quality brand made. Needless to say, when I first got it in the mail, it looked like it could've been a classier brand-named bag!There were some minor loose threads here and there, but it wasn't anything worth complaining about. If there was something to complain about, the heavy stench of leather wreaked all over the bag - but that's nothing too big to worry if you just spray it with some perfume, etc.The bag was unexpected because it *LOOKS* small. Like this bag could carry hold anything. But truthfully, when you open it, there's so much more depth inside the bag that I can easily carry a thick notebook, clutch wallet, glasses case, perfume, sunglasses, pens, and bulky cellphone all inside. Pretty impressive huh? Especially when on the outside, it looks so deceivingly small!However, after a few days of wearing and using the bag, I could clearly see why it was a $25 bag. The strap across my shoulder started to slowly fall apart, loose threads hanging out here and there; threads inside the bag and small signs of wear and tear was present. I'm still using it now, and I plan on sticking to this bag until it falls apart completely. It's a wonderfully put together, cheaper bag that can be used in so many ways that is still worthwhile the money. You just have to keep in mind on the fact that this bag isn't a high-class brand-named bag, and that consideration should be in mind.Overall, I gave this bag a 4/5 because the presentation of it, which is a cheap bag that looks classy and brand-named, the depth of it, which is deceiving because it looks small but carries so much, and the material: the leather was pretty smooth. The only thing to be very wary of is the threading.
