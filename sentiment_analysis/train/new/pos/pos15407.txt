AMAZING, TOTALLY NECESSARY PRODUCT if you have a baby who breaks out of swaddles easily but needs them desperately to sleep.My 2-month old (approx. 15 lb) starting breaking out of the SwaddleMe velcro swaddles every single time we put him down, and was waking up still 2x/night, but when we tried the MB, he slept 12 hours and did so every night onward...The only problem is that the MB doesn't come in bigger/longer sizes, so if your baby is long, they can be uncomfortable or kick one of their legs out.  By the time my baby was 3 months, he was kicking his left leg out of the swaddle, and that allowed him to wriggle his arms free.  He still desperately needed the swaddle to sleep, so I did my own little DIY and installed some velcro on the arm flaps (so they attach underneath his back), so even when his legs get out, his arms don't wake him up.  Once he grows a little bit more, I'll probably cut a hole in the leg pouch, but until then, the velcro works great! MB really is the only way to go for babies like mine who are really strong and squirmy in their sleep.
