This couch is very cute and FUN.We bought two of them (A MUST when you have toddlers!):one for our 2-yr-old, one for our 3-yr-old.The couch option is great. Perfect size. Two children could sit together, if they didn't bug each other!Unfold it and it becomes a cute little "bed". Ideal for overnight at Nana's house!May not work for tall toddlers or children over the age of 4. Our oldest is 3, and it's the perfect size for him now.
