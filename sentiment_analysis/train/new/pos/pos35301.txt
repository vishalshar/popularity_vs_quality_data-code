This is the least expensive I found and which has the complete set (13)I did not want to buy mix and match. I wanted a set with everything on it.This is a complete set with additional wall hangings. Looks great, feels great for the baby.Most sets out there do not have a complete collection. If you are very creative and have time for going thru all products and reviews. Go ahead and browse.If not you can stop here for your baby girl. The quality is good. No regrets
