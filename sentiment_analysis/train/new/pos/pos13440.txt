I normally don't write any reviews but since after having my baby and having to shop through amazon quite a bit, I decided to post some reviews for the best products I've bought.  I rely on reviews when I buy and trust them as well, so I figured I'll post it too for others to read.  I absolutely love these trays when it comes to freezing baby food.  I make mine at home, and it works great when you make extras to store to use later.  7 sections work great for me because I don't overstock my LO's food.  I make it for one week at a time with a variety of foods and use one tray for each kind of food I make.  I just ordered another set because they're flexible, durable, AND the food pops out really easy. I empty the trays and pop the cubes out in a zip lock once they're frozen.  I've stored carrots, squash, green beans, peas, and nothing so far has left any strains or marks behind! They stack right on top of each other so takes less space in the freezer! LOVE THEM!
