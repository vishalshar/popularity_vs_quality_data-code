This is my first baby but I knew I wanted a stroller with a bassinet option. I just hate the idea of using a car seat ALL the time like I see done so very often. For very young babies who cannot sit alone, the car seat attached to a stroller is the only option I saw in stores (granted I live in the rural south with few shopping in-store options) and the only thing I ever see used by other moms. I had seen a few bassinet style strollers online and loved the idea. However they were very costly (several coat $300-500!!! Way too much). I came across this one for $120 and decided to give it a try. The price was comparable to the "car seat attachment" strollers I had been seeing. So I considered this a fair price. Folded it is still a little on the large size. But I drive a SUV so that's not a big issue for me; but I could see it being a problem if you have a really small car/trunk. It is very easy to fold - simply push a button. In folding it is just as easy, unlock and lift. My daughter has not quite mastered sitting alone yet so we've only used it in the bassinet position so far. But we both love it! The canopy is large enough to keep her shaded and can be positioned to the front or back, which ever way we need it. It is easy and comfortable to push. Being tall (5'9") I was a little concerned it would be "too short" and an uncomfortable height to easily push, but it works great. It has a basket under the seat that is quite large. Plus has 2 cup holders and a small compartment on the handle bar. There is a small tray and a cup holder for the child too. As I stated, I live in a rural area so most of our walks have been in grass, dirt and gravel. But this stroller has performed well. I would recommend this stroller.
