I've bought tons of stuff on Amazon but never felt compelled to write a review until now. With the description "generic," I was very hesitant about this sprayer. I took a chance on it though because I've had another of the popular sprayers & was none too happy with it. The major difference: this sprayer does not have to be turned on and off with every use. This is extremely convenient considering what you have your hands already full with! Also, I've accidentally forgotten to turn off the old sprayer a few times, which of course flooded the bathroom with toilet water. Charming. Also, this thing has yet to leak from the tubing like the other brand. I've been cloth diapering for a year & highly recommend this sprayer!
