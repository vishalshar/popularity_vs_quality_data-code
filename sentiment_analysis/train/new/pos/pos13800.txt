The Baby Buddy serves a dual purpose:  to soothe your baby's aching gums while teething, and to introduce your baby to the world of teeth brushing! See my images and notes. Your baby can easily grip the teether as early as three months.  As your baby grows and teething intensifies, he/she is able to control the position of the teether more easily.  The soft, flexible texture is wonderful for nursing babies, and the design is flawless. Brilliant idea. I seriously have one of these in every room of the house, one in the car, and one in the diaper bag.  I have six children and this is the best teether I've come across in 13 years worth of teethers (:
