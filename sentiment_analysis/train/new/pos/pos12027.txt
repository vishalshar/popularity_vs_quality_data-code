I am rating this 4 stars because it is a great little cot. I bought two for my 2 1/2 year old boy girl twins. I takes less than a minute to set up, and it is a nice gender neutral color. It is not as bright as the picture, but I was glad to see that it wasn't. It is a little shorter than other similar products, but only by about 2 inches, so not a big deal for us. I love that they allow my kids to lay pretty flat. I have seen and tried the regalo cot and it had a ridge in the middle, so that is why I ultimately chose this cot. The first time my children used these they slept great, so in my book these are winners.I do have one very major issue though, and that is the smell. The other review wasn't kidding, These smell really bad right out of the box. They smell like walking into a tire factory. I had to throw these out in the garage to air out because they made the whole house smell like a tire factory. I mean the smell was bad. Even after airing out a bit, the smell lingers. I am going to try to wipe them down a bit to see if that helps the smell. Otherwise, still a great buy.
