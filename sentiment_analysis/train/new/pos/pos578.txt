I have had this thing for over 6 years now. It's still working great. Used for 2 babies, and now for friend's babies when they are at our house. I loved the recline feature. It allowed me to use this high chair from about 2 months on. My babies liked that they could sit up and see things while I was folding laundry or doing dishes. The portability is nice. When it's not in use it takes up very minimal space in the garage. This would work to take camping or to visit family if you needed to. It's easy to wash, except for the straps. After my babies got older I just took the straps out. They get filthy every time, even with a bib. But it is nice to have the harness. I would purchase again.
