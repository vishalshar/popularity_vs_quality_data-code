I have a mazda RX-8, which has no headrest in the back seat. However, it has a safety latch/ tether behind where the headrest would be, for a carseat. I used the clip on the mirror, clipped it to the plastic cover over the tether and it is perfect. I turn the mirror and get a perfect view of baby's face. My car is a bumpy ride (horribly close to the ground) and the mirror has yet to move even over the worst potholes.
