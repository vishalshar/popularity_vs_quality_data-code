I bought this cam in order to see my son while I was working during the day.  He is medically dependent and there is a nurse home with him all day and night.  His father works overseas and I also wanted to give him the opportunity to see his son as he worked too. Honestly this camera was difficult to set up... especially if you arent a computer genius.  I had to email the company in order to get someone to help me figure out how to operate the camera.  Thats why I rated this 4 stars. Once I got it up and running....It is great that I can actually see my little one at home while I was at work.
