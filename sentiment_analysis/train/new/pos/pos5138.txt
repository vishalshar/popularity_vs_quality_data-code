These bottles are PERFECT!! I am not one to sit there and buy 400 bottles to let my child find one that is right for them. After doing a million tons of research and reading reviews until I think I could write one with my eyes closed (look at me now) I decided on these as my choice. I chose these bottles for the following reasons:1. These bottles (and accessories) are widely available. If I go on a trip and I need something extra I can go to the local store and buy the piece; or a new bottle. I don't see some of the other bottles around in stores which could potentially cause havoc on my life which I don't need.2. These bottles have air vents in the top of the nipple rather than the bottom of the bottle. I used to ventair bottles with my daughter and while they were okay, I just didn't like the curve of the bottle and how awkward they were to use and fill. These bottles do not leak at the vents and are very convenient when it comes to air sensitive tummies.3. Have you seen these bottles?! They are chubby and cute! Just like the babies who are using them :)I chose this pack because the bottles are necessary, the bottle brush will come in handy, I loved the idea of the formula holder, and while I will not use the pacifier (because I think they're creepy when the baby has it in his/her mouth), it came with one which I can regift!This set is the best thing I bought my entire pregnancy and I will be purchasing more as I go along in my family planning!!
