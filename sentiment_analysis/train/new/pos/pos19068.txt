I had received 2 changing pads at my baby showers but had to return both because to our dismay after assembling our Hensvik shelf/changer from Ikea we realized that the average changing pad was way too long I sort of panicked because it was time for baby to arrive but we had no changer :(. I started researching online and learned that this is a problem many people had came across when purchasing the piece of furniture from Ikea (they do not offer a changing mat/pads???!) After finding one from the UK that was back ordered and $50 plus shipping, it was looking hopeless. But once again Amazon represented with this perfect sized mat in very complimenting colors and to top it all it just had to ship from NC (where its made...awesome) there is no gap, it fits beautifully. I would compare the material to that of a Bumbo. Its high quality and thick.
