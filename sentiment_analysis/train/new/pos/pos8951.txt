Kidkusion 30 ft Non Retractable driveway fence.I purchased this fence because we live on a hill and basketballs were constantly rolling down the street. Retrieving them was exhausting.-The fencing is an orange mesh with slots on the end to put metal poles through.-It comes with two pieces of PVC pipe to hammer into the ground.-I had to use a hand saw to trim the PVC pipe because it wouldn't hammer all the way into the ground. Southern California has very rocky terrain. This did not create a problem with the install. The PVC needs to be level with the ground so that the fence touches the ground, and shorter PVC still creates the desired effect.-Once the PVC is secured and level with the ground, the poles are inserted into the PVC.-We tested it and if the net is taut the balls go right under it. So, we installed it with a bit of a drag so that the balls wouldn't roll under.-The down side of the drag is: It makes the net shorter which means if there is an airborne ball it goes right over and down the street. Which also means, even if the ball hits the upper half of the net with enough force, the ball launches over it and rolls down the street.-That being said, it catches the ball about 85% of the time, which makes it totally worth the purchase.-Taking it down is a cinch. It rolls right up and goes in the garage.-It comes with plastic caps to fit over the PVC pipes when not in use.-Overall, this is a good product. It could be easily imitated by going to Home Depot and getting all the parts, but why bother when it is a reasonable price and so easy to install.
