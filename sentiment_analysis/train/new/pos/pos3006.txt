Best bottle brush on the market. Easy to use and I love that it has a brush hidden from germs and that can also be used as a stand so your brush isn't leaning. This brush is durable and helps the soap foam up well. It gets every corner.How do I rate the items I bought?Every product that I bought starts at 3 Stars and gets subtractions oradditions as we go depending on how well it performs according to myexpectation and whether the item perform as advertised. In veryunusual cases that I have tried or tested some items and can’t provethat it did or didn’t work, I will likely default to 3 stars just tobe neutral. Most important of all, I don’t owe a good or bad review toany product or seller; I am here to provide a constructive feedback onthe items I bought in order to help you, the reader, to make aninformed decision on which product to purchase to satisfy your needs.Be aware that when I tested a product and it worked well for me, butit failed for you, it does not reflect that my review is inaccurate,it's most likely you have received a defective product, yourexpectations were too high or it did not perform in a way that youfelt was described in the product description. In any of these casesyou should get in touch with the seller to rectify the problem as soonas possible. I received item at a discount for an honest/unbiasedreview it does not change my opinion on a product.
