Maybe I didn't read the description carefully, but I thought that I would receive an actual CD with my child's name.A few years ago I had bought a personalized music CD for a friend's baby. It had his name preprinted on the CD and there were a bunch of songs on there.Note: when you purchase this, you are getting a kit with a generic blank CD and a gift card. You go to the website, download the songs and burn them to the CD and then you can write your child's name on the front. Not a good deal if you don't have a computer or CD burner or are technologically challenged.I'm happy with the songs and my child enjoys it.  One thing is that the album I chose had 9 tracks but one is an introduction and another is a track where they say goodbye so you really only get 7 songs.Overall, its ok for the price but I wish I had known I was getting a generic blank CD when I ordered it.
