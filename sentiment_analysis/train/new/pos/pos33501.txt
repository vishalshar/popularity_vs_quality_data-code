I bought this pad to protect our bedding from all the spit up, diaper leaks, and you name it that comes from a baby. After reading the many reviews about the product material pilling, I was a bit concerned but decided to buy it and see for myself. I ended up buying 3 Continental Quilting waterproof pads to have around the house and also for back up so I'd always have a clean one if the others got dirty. Boy am I happy with this product! It is perfectly sized, not too big, not too small, and completely waterproof as advertised. I've sent mine through the wash plenty of times and I'm happy to report that not a single one has had any pilling to speak of, considering that I have 3 of them I don't think it's luck of the draw that all three have not had any pilling. The fabric is not very soft however I just put a thin blanket over the pad so that my daughter is only in direct contact with the blanket covering the pad. Love this pad!
