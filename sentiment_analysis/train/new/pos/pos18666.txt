This is extremely soft and the color is beautiful.  My baby loves to feel it while being changed.  Nice raised dot pattern on it too:)Personally I would recommend this changing pad cover to everyone!!It can be washed with like colors and cold water.  It does not bleed, you can tumble dry however, I prefer line drying because it would preserve the original texture and color.
