So, I can't comment much on how well this diaper works - it's still too big for my 1 month (8 lbs 11 oz)... however, my LO loves this diaper - as in she stairs at it, cooing and laughing - she even reaches out for it to touch!!! It's so funny how much she loves it, although this probably means I won't be able to leave a proper review any time soon for I don't want to upset my LO by removing it from her line of site (putting it on her where it's hidden under her clothes). I can say though that both my husband and I are very sensitive to the way materials feel (e.g. can't stand the feeling of micro fiber), and we both LOVE how fuzzy and soft this diaper is!!! I really like it and imagine it'll work well :)
