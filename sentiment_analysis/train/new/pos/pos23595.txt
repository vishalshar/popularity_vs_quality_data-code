I have been using this adapter on my 2009 BOB Duallie Revolution for over a month now and I am happy to have it. I go on dog walks every morning with my 2 kids and 2 dogs and usually end up having to leave right after the walk to run errands, so having the young kiddo already in the car seat is a time saver.This took me about an hour to get installed, as it does require you to unscrew parts of the sun shades to install (permanently) spacers...but my 3 year old loves having her own drink tray (or flower/rock collecting tray, as one of the areas have become), and I like being able to see my 5 month old while on the walks.The only con I would say is that the front bar that the car seat is supposed to grip around (I have a Graco SnugRide Classic Connect30 car seat), is very loose. The bars could have been made a little thicker to accommodate this (I really like the adapter I have for my single seat 2011 City Mini GT). They do have you install a safety belt that goes over the car seat, but the design could have been a little better thought out.They also give you a foam brick to place in the stroller seat area to help prop up the car seat into the proper reclining position (sort of).They obviously have made vast improvements with the newer stroller models and as I bought my stroller second hand, I am glad to have this adapter.
