Let me begin by saying that i've tried almost every cup I possibly could of, and despite negative reviewers, I have to say, this cup is the best you can get. Truly.A few flaws I have found though, are that the nipple of this does collapse sometimes from my son sucking perhaps to hard. But it's no big deal. He just unlatches, then relatches and it's fine. If you use the handles on this, 5% of the time, it can get a little leaky, but not from the nipple, but from the part where the lid screws on. Some adjusting should fix it.Other than that, this really is just such an ideal cup for us. We also tried the nuk cup like other said, and oh boy. Firstly, my son can drink a 6 oz thinkbaby cup in two mins flat. With the nuk it takes him TEN MINUTES and i'm not kidding. It just doesn't flow well. The nuk cup also smells horrendous if you let left over milk droplets in there for more than an hour or so. I like to wash my cups at the end of the day, and I am having to toss that nuk cup out. I mustve washed the nuk cup 7 times, tons of soapy hot water, and it smells RANCID and SPOILED. Thinkbaby doesn't retain the horrid smell at all that the nuk does.Just do yourself a favor, and go with this cup. I also reccommend a zoli bot cup for clear liquids :) hope this helps.
