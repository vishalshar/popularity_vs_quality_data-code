This clock looks great in my baby's nursery.  I've gotten a lot of compliments on it.  The price is a little high in my opinion, but I decided to purchase it anyway.  The absolute best thing about the clock is it doesn't tick, like the clock in my other daughter's room (which drives me crazy).  I highly recommend this clock.
