This arrived in 2 boxes (too heavy for my to carry inside) but I was able to put the whole thing together myself (no need for my husband to help out :) I am very impressed with the quality and you would never guess the price based on looks. Let's hope it holds out for all the kids we plan on having. One small complaint: some of the drawers seem to be too wide for the spaces. They are difficult to pull open, although it may be the way they were assembled. Overall a fantastic piece.
