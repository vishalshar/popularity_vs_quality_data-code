My 2 year old grandson has Thomas, Thomas everywhere in my house and in his.  With this decorated potty the likes to sit on it then stand on it to wash his hands.  The seat that is supposed to fit over an adult toilet is too small and does not cradle securely on the seat so that feature is unusable.  Little ones use what they like, so he also has Thomas toothpaste and toothbrush to round out the bathroom.
