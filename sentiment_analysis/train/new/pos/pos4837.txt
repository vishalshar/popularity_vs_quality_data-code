I have two of these and use them as liners in a trash can to store dirty diapers until laundry day. They are nice and big and the colors are cute. I've had them for over 2 years and they are still going strong. The only thing that is fraying is the drawstring but I think it got in a fight with the washing machine so who can blame it.
