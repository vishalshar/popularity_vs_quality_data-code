Being a mother of three I have a collection on pumps, this one is definitely my favorite.  I also own the Pump in Style which I used a lot while working with my second one.  The harmony is fo course not as quick to pump as the Pump in Stye because it only pumps one side at a time but it is very comfortable.  When purchasing this pump I was not able to find reviews comparing it to the Isis.  I used an Isis pump with my second child when I just needed to relieve engorgement or had sore nipples as it was very gentle but there are sooo many parts.  When I took it out of storage with my third child the parts started breaking.  How does the Isis compare to the Harmony.  The Harmony wins hands down.  The handle of the Harmony is repositionable making it much more comfortable to pump.  It also had two suction modes, one mimics you baby's sucking prior to milk let-down and the other after.  The helps your milk let down quicker than with the Isis.  The breast shield on the Isis is more comfortable than the Medela but you can use the regular breast shields and the Isis petal will fit on it if you prefer.  I am definitely glad I made this investment and would recommend this to anyone needing a manual pump for occasional use over any other manual I have tried.
