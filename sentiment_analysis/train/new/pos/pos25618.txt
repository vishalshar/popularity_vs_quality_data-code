Let's get right to it.  This crib sheet is LOUD.  When my wife put it on the crib mattress I walked into the nursery and asked her if she changed a lightbulb because it was so bright and vibrant in the room.  For whatever reason, this thing jumps out at you like neon paint in a Jackson Pollock studio (the picture does not do it justice).  Part of the product description says, "(c)oordinates with Dwellstudio meadow bedding and accessories."  That remains to be seen, but the traditional gender-color ambivalence makes me doubt any claims of coordination.  And all of this is fine, because a baby's room is supposed to have exploding, attention-getting colors.  Colors that don't bleed in the laundry BTW - machine wash cold worked just fine.I can assure any potential buyers that the sheet is, in fact, 100% cotton (this appears to be very important to Dwellstudio since it's mentioned twice in the product description).  The measurements of the sheet are virtually perfect.  There was plenty of room to spare when putting it on the mattress without straining to fit corners or having a bunch of sheet left over.It's soft, artistically designed, fits right, and my daughter slept on it just fine last night.  What else is required?
