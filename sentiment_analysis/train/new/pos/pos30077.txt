These bottles do a decent job of reducing air ingested while also being easier to clean than say, the Dr. Brown's bottles.  The bottles have a plastic disc and silicone membrane that fit over the rim of the bottle before the nipple is screwed on.  These two pieces are a bit difficult to get apart for cleaning, as the fit is snug.  For my daughter I did not see any difference in air ingestion between these bottles and those with an easier to use/clean venting system (Avent, Tommee Tippee).  I like that the markings on the side are easy to see and read, although I would prefer they had the 1 ounce level marked in some way - they only have 2,3,4, and 5 ounces marked.The nipple flow on these bottles always seemed to be a bit of an issue - as a newborn my daughter would leak milk out the sides of her mouth (she did this with all bottles I tried, but the Born Free were the worst), and now at 3 months, she is making a clicking noise when she swallows, which I think means we need to move to a higher flow.  I feel like these nipples went from being to fast for her to too slow, with nothing in between.In regards to the two type of bottles offered - I have a set of the classic bottles and a set of the deco bottles.  The pieces are fully interchangeable between the two.  I was surprised to find the deco bottles are significantly larger than the classic bottles, although both hold 5 ounces.  I find because of the large size the deco bottles are harder to comfortable hold while feeding a newborn.  It is more difficult to cuddle the baby in close to you for feeding when the bottle is as large as her chest.  I can't see any reason why the deco would be larger than the classic, and if I were to order another set I would definitely get the classic.
