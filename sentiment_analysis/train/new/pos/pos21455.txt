Based on the package description, this blanket is filled with organic cotton (not wool). That is OK with us, but I don't like that the description was wrong... that is why I took off a star.The actual blanket is VERY soft and cozy. We washed it before we put it on my son's bed and it made it through the wash well (nothing coming out of it, no pilling, etc.). We have not washed it again yet. It is a small blanket. We bought it for my 2 year old son's bed. He sleeps on a crib mattress inside one of those car beds, so this works really good for him. We wouldn't need it to be over-sized since there wouldn't be room for the excess to flow over the bed. It barely covers the top of the crib... I don't think it hangs over the bed at all... which, again, is fine for what we wanted it for, but others may think it's too small.I would definitely recommend this blanket to others. It seems like a high quality blanket and it's made of organic materials.EDIT: We still use this blanket and have now washed it several times and we are still so happy with it! It is super soft and my son loves it! He is now 2.5 and is still in the car bed. I will definitely be buying this blanket for my other son, who is 1 now, when he is old enough for it. Absolutely love it!
