We bought this for our daughter.  At 2 she is still in a crib and moves around a lot at night, but is too big for her Pack N Play and any hotel provided cribs.  We had a couple of trips with hotel stay planned,  We were afraid she'd fall off the bed if she slept alone, knew she wouldn't sleep well on the floor, and did not relish the idea of her sharing a bed with us and end up kicking us all night.  I saw the portable overnight bed and decided to give it a try.  It ended up being a great purchase.The bed came promptly, and arrived packed in a travel ready back pack as advertised.  The back pack is cheaply made, but we expected this based on the reviews we read. While the directions were not exactly the most helpful, it was relatively easy to set up and inflate.  Based on the negative reviews, I was sure to be cautious when I inflated for the first time to make sure I didn't overly stress the seams.  Once it was set up my daughter went nuts over it.  She loved her "special bed" and wanted to lie down on it right away.  On our first trip, she went to sleep easily at night and got a good nights sleep.  The lip kept her in most of the night (she rolled out once but was not phased in the least and went right back to sleep).  The bed remained nicely inflated despite my daughter wanting to sit and sometimes stand on it (despite our best efforts to stop her) most of the time we were in our hotel room.  When it came time to leave, deflating and repacking was a breeze.  In short we found it to be our new must have for traveling with toddlers.Pros:-Easy to travel with-Easy to inflate-Comfortable and welcoming to toddler-Easy to pack up-Good size and fit well into a standard hotel roomCons:-cheaply made backpack-poor directions
