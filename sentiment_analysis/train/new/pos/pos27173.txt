These are great! I used them with two Babies R Us umbrella Strollers. When attached, the stroller wheels don't touch or collide, turning is not a problem, the strollers move like one unit. I can even fold the strollers with the connectors attached. I was able to fasten these to the tightest setting (3 clicks?). Be careful not to pinch your fingers!These will be perfect for DisneyWorld in the future but terrific for a walk to the library with a toddler and baby.
