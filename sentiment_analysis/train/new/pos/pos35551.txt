This amber necklace really works! We bought it for my daughter when she was 4 months old and starting to get really fussy from teething. Since we received it two months ago, she has worn it constantly. She now has two teeth and two more coming in and hasn't run a fever at all, is a little fussy when the teeth are cutting  through the gum but nothing like our two other kids when they were teething. If you're on the fence about using an amber necklace, I'd suggest to just try it. It really does work!  The beads are also really smooth and pretty and each one is knotted in between so if for some reason the necklace did break, all the beads wouldn't fall off. The string seems really strong and is short enough that baby can't see it under her chin, so she doesn't pull at it. I'm so glad we got this necklace, it has made the teething process much easier.
