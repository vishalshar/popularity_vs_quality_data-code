When we were looking for baby carriers i tested out so many and all of them put so much strain on my back and they were also such a pain to get on and off (and boring colours). After heaps of frustration i started looking online and found this one, it was cheap in comparison to the others i had been looking at so i thought, hey, why not try it and if i don't like it it's not like i have lost a fortune. When it arrived i was so impressed, lovely soft material and the colour was so much nicer than in the photo! I then tried it on and it was SO comfy, i can walk all day with this one and no back pain! It is easy to get on and off, doesn't make you feel like you look overweight (as some of them do, due to where the straps sit). I get so many compliments when i am out as people love the colour, and most importantly my baby loves it, she cuddles in to me and falls asleep - what more can I ask! We have even used this carrier around the house to get her to go to sleep as she loves being in it. I highly recommend this to other mothers!!!
