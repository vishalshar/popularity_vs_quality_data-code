This was purchased as a replacement.  My son received the whole set of three Diwali print blankets as a newborn and he has used them every day of his life.  (He's 3.5 now.)  I especially like that this print is very vibrant but gender neutral.  Unfortunately, two have been lost while traveling, and I was getting nervous about the last one disappearing.  So this one came as a replacement.  It seems quite identical to the original.  Of course, it will need to be washed many, many times to get to the same level of buttery softness, but that's inevitable.  Right now, my son prefers the original, and can identify the difference by feel, even in a completely dark room.  So we will just keep washing it.  Considering the wear and tear, the originals held up great.  We're just starting to get some frayed corners on the older one, and I think I will take it to a local seamstress to see if she can patch that up before it pulls too much.  We always wash these blankets in a lingerie bag with other delicates, on the delicate cycle of our front loading washer.  I've not experienced any damage or color runs from washing.
