I got this cup for my 18 month old daughter who seems to be able to get any sippy cup out there to leak and I'm not kidding. If it says leakproof, she makes it her personal mission to prove that cup wrong..this one was the same as the others. In order to get the juice out you have to compress the spout which encourages chewing. She chewed and chewed it and sure enough the cup leaked all over the place. She did love the cup though. It was easy for her to hold and drink from. maybe she shouldn't chew them but when you make a cup that requires pressure to release liquid, what do you expect. So all over to she loved the cup and it served it purpose but after a week, it leaked all over the place and I have to keep buying replacement spouts for it which gets expensive.
