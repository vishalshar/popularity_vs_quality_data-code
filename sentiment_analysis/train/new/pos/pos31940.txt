Before I bought this product I had a very similar one (actually it was the same brand, only difference was it was a jungle animal theme) and that one only lasted me a couple months. However, my baby LOVED it so I decided to buy the same product, just in this water theme. The reviews I read mostly said that the these are known for the motor dying so I was hesitant to buy another but this type of swing as all that would soothe my colic  AND acid reflux baby. This swing lasted him until he outgrew it and I let my friend use it for her new baby recently and it lasted him until he outgrew it as well. It is still ticking and I sold it to a baby consignment store, and they were very pleased to buy it from me. Should I have another child, I will absolutely buy this product again. IMPORTANT TIP: ALWAYS GIVE THE SWING A LITTLE PUSH TO GET IT GOING. DO NOT LET IT START ON IT'S OWN OR THE MOTOR WILL GIVE OUT QUICKLY.
