Our daughter loves these bottles.  The only complaint I have is that the top portion of the straw wears out due to normal use.  While this is not really a problem, as that's what the replacements are for - you have to buy a whole new straw set - including the bottom portion as well.  This no doubt raises the cost.So, we'll continue to buy these as they are well made, but I do wish they would sell just the top portion to cut down on the cost.
