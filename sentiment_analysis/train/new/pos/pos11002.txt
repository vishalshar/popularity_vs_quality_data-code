This product worked well for me, however the directions that come with the tin are wrong.  It says to add 1/4 cup of water and stir for the first tin.  It should say add 1/8 cup water and stir!  The first tin is so tiny, 1/4 cup of water turns the plaster into soup!  I ended up having to take some plaster powder from the 2nd year tin in order to get it the right consistency!  The finished product turned out well though and overall I'm happy with it.A tip: Wipe some Pam cooking spray on your child's hand before pressing it into the plaster.  It really helps!!Good luck!
