Haven't used the cup yet, but it came right on time and seems quite sturdy. I love the new super spouts, they look amazing. The only disappointment was the colors I received. I got a pink and purple (love that) and a yellow and orange. Don't really like that one. I understand it said "colors may vary" but I really wish I could exchange it for a different color. I was hoping for the blue and green one, but instead got yellow and orange. Blegh.But the cup itself is really cool. I love the soft spout and the grip design. I think this will last for a long time :)
