Really cute and seems warm but my only complaint is that I bought this for our daughter who is 4 months old. It says it works up to 3 (I think) and I would say it probably works better for older kids because the snaps are so high that it currently blocks her face if I try to snap it. I wish there were a few more levels of snaps to grow with her, as she gets taller and taller. For now, I am making the best of a pricey product (I prefer to buy something nice once vs multiple cheap things) to try and get many years of use. Generally uppababy is well designed so this was a bit of a disappointment.
