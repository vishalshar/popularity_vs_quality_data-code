Purchased for use by our 18 mo old great-niece when she visited recently. She uses her fingers for self-feeding, but used these for a little white in her first efforts with utensils. She did a really good job! They are the perfect size for little hands, andI love the safety feature of the rounded outer tines on the fork. Will send these home with her for more practice and use when her terrific parents think it is appropriate.
