I bought this swing for my 1 month old daughter after the original swing I bought her was no good, and she absolutely loves it!Pros-Affordable compared to other swingsCute design for either a boy or girlHas 8 different speeds and is super quietPlays 8 different songs or you choose the rain soundsEasy to put togetherFolds up for easy storage (You could take it with you on vacation even)ConsThe music stops playing after like an hour I would have liked it to play longerI don't care too much for the mobile because baby can't reach up and touch it because it's so high I like the dangling toys that baby can touch, but a lot of swings don't have either so I guess its ok.Overall my daughter loves this swing she spends lots of time in it, she loves to stare at the mobile above her. It definitely helps her fall asleep something that is nice for new parents and I love the cute print and different speeds, I'm so glad I bought this, its a great swing for new babies!
