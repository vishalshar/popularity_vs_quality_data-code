We purchased a Graco Pack n' Play and weren't sure which sheets would work best with the mattress (it's always a little hard to tell with online orders). But, we figured that we'd probably want more than one set, so we purchased three different brands to compare:1. Graco Pack n' Play sheets: easily fits the Pack n' Play mattress. The material is rather thin and cheap-feeling, but I have a feeling that we will be using these more in the summer months to keep the baby cool at night. So far they've held up well in the wash.2. American Baby Company 100% cotton Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheets: these are a tighter fit for the Pack n' play mattress. We had to partially fold the mattress to get the sheets around all four corners (which is probably the easiest way to put any sheets on the mattress). Once on, the mattress did lay completely flat. Frankly, I love the soft feeling of these sheets, and they seem like a nice, general all-purpose sheet. So far, they've held up well in the wash.3. Carters Quilted Woven Playard Fitted Sheet: Similar to the American Baby Company sheets, these are a tighter fit for the Pack n' Play mattress. But,once you get the sheets around the four corners of the mattress, the mattress will lay flat. These sheets are MUCH thicker than the Graco or American Baby Company sheets (as they are quilted). They don't feel as soft as the American Baby Company sheets, but not as coarse as the Graco sheets. These sheets will be our sheet of choice during the winter months.So far they've held up well in the wash..
