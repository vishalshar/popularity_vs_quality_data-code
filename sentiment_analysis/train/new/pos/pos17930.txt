I picked this pack 'n play as a gift for my sister and my niece when she was only 2 weeks old. There were no reviews at the time so I really went out on a limb but it is a great value for sure! The colors in the Adaline are really beautiful and my niece looked very beautiful in it. It went together very easily. My sister, 2 weeks post partum, and I, 7 months pregnant, put it together in less than 20 minutes. It also collapses easy and travels well. I will say, that the napper/changer doesn't break apart and travel all that well and there is really no way to pack the bassinet without stretching the velcro but my husband somehow found a way to pull it off. I was hoping that because the napper/changer was mounted in the middle instead of being mounted on one side or the other that it wouldn't lean to one side but that isn't accurate. It did lean to the inside of the pack 'n play when using the changer but I never noticed it when using the napper. I suppose it's the nature of the beast since every review I've ever read for a similar product says it leans to one side or the other. All things considered, this is a great product and a great value. I liked it so much I registered for one in a different color for myself.
