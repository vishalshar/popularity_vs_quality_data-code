It's going to be 3 years in  may 2017 since I ordered these blankets  for my little girl.Great quality  and color is still there. (Slitely faded from washing and I dropped bleach on accident on colors  load)but no holes or thinned spots from it.The quality,size and how light weigh  Muslim blankets are has kept me from passing them on.I still wrap my almost 3 y old with them before I put on towel
