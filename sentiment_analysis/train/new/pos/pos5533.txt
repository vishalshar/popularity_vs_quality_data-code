I use this on my wheelchair. It's life changing. I use my hands to push myself around obviously, so I can't hold my phone, drink, keys, etc and "walk" at the same time. This little catch-all is perfect! I put it in the bar next to my calf and depending on the day, put all kinds of things in it! My large Tervis Tumbler fits in it, as do large McDonald's cups. I agree with the person who said the drawstring was flimsy...especially odd since everything else is so well made. It was also very long. But I never really plan on using it anyway so I shortened it to just long enough to open completely, tied a new knot, and cut off the extra.I never thought I'd be the type to put a cup holder on my chair (sort of a fashion no-no) but I further injured myself and can't bend to use the bag I used to carry stuff in. This is perfect because it is made out of mesh and if for some reason it dies get in the way, it just collapses, and it doesn't scream "medical equipment!" Like the big plastic ones. Plus in those I couldn't use it to carry other things.
