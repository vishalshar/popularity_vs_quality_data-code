These spoons are great for feeding because the tips are like little spatulas which not only easily scrape the food bowl, but with one little swipe on the chin or cheeks, my nephew's face is totally clean. I have had several friends recommend them (and watched them search through a drawer full of spoons for these specifically) but I should mention that after SEVERAL (like, by the time they're for my friend's second child) rounds through the dishwasher the tips do become a little warped. But at that point she loved them so much she just bought another set, so not a deterrent at all.
