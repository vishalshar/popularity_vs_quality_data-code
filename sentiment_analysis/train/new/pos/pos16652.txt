I've noticed on many of the reviews, parents are complaining that the storage area is inaccessible when the changer is being used. I wanted to point out there is nothing that prevents you from simply placing the changer above the bassinet area instead of the storage area; as your infant can't occupy the bassinet and the changer at the same time anyway. It was easy to assemble, and so far fits our needs very well. I can see how the lining to the bassinet may be troublesome to change if it becomes soiled, but graco offers a second liner as a "replacement part" if you call and request it. Having two on hand will eliminate this issue.
