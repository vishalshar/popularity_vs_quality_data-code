We bought this chair for our first daughter and also used it for our second! It is a beautiful chair made of a dark wood it looks attractive in our kitchen instead of a big plastic eyesore. It is sturdy and still looks great. You can wash the pad in the washing machine and dry it in the dryer. The tray is easy to wash in the sink and pops easily as well. We never had a problem with it.The only thing I don't care for is that the tray is plastic and would have looked nicer if it was wood as well, BUT it probably wouldn't have held up so well with all the washing's after every meal and so I will not knock off a star for that.
