So, I bought this because I get a small duffel bag (it about 16" x 10") every Cigarfest show I attend, and after I empty it of cigars, it is handy for traveling with gadgets and smaller items.  The problem is that the center main section of this little bag has no compartments or organization, and the interior is black, so its hard to see on the road and at night what is inside.Firstly, the manufacturing/petroleum/who knows smell goes away in about a day.  I put it outside and 24 hours later it smelled like any other new luggage piece.So I got this in khaki to contrast with the black in this small duffel (it about 16" x 10") so that I could seethings like GPS cables, mounts, cameras, phones, etc.  It really works for this purpose.  It could even be a range or target bag, as this material is designed to repel most stains, and the compartments are high enough to organize, but not so deep that its like going for a prize in a cereal box.So, like other reviewers pointed out, the weak point is the lack of seams at the bottom of the compartments.  Items tend to shift during travel, and they can sometimes creep into other compartments, especially coins or smaller items.  But for the most part, this bag performed very well on my last 2000 mile road trip.  GPS in a pocket, power in another, flashlight, bottle of water, and still room for maps and whatever along the sides.  You could use it to make any bag into a small travel/tactical/flight/medic bag.So it isn't perfect, but it is as close as I'll come without spending 4 - 8 times more on a specialized bag.  And it reuses a duffel bag I have in great amounts.
