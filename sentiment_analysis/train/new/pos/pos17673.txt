Just to describe this a little better, it comes with seven toys to hang from the bars: a duck, a cardinal containing a bell perched on a ring with beads, a sunshine with dangling rattle, an apple teething toy filled with water so you can freeze it if you want, two plastic discs with photos of a puppy and a duckling, a mirror, and a star that plays music and lights up.  It comes with extra links so you can add some of your own toys, too, and there are hanging loops at the top, middle, and bottom of the bars.  The mat itself is brightly colored, has a satiny sort of finish, and is nicely padded and breathable.Issues:The mirror itself is plastic-y and curved a bit so the reflection is a bit distorted.  Doesn't seem to bother her in the least.The star's lights were a little frenetic for her with certain songs at first, but she loved it by 10 weeks old.The mat's fabric shows drool stains, but that doesn't bother me personally.The upshot:We love this toy.  Our daughter started with it when she was about 7 weeks old and was immediately delighted with it.  In the ensuing weeks we found that she would be interested in different parts of it at different times, but at 10 weeks she would happily lay under it for 30 minutes at a time... or more.  We rotate the hanging toys through and always take one with us when we go out.  In short, this is the one indispensable toy we own and I'd recommend it highly.
