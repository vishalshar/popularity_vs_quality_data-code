This is the first review I've ever written, but I like this thing so much, I felt like I needed to review it!My baby girl was born in November and after fussing with blankets to try to keep her covered and warm for about 2 weeks, I purchased the Posh Pouch.  We are LOVING it.No more bundling her all up just to have to disturb her when we arrive at our destination by taking off jackets, etc.  We just put her in her regular clothes, put her in the carseat, zip her up and go.  She stays toasty warm.  If it is really cold, we do have to put a light blanket over the face opening while outside because the "collar" has some gaps in it when folded up, but there have only been a couple of times we've had to do that.I can't go ANYWHERE without people commenting on this thing.  They love the way it looks, thinks it's a great idea, wish they'd had it for their kids, etc. My husband thought it was a little "over the top" at first, but when he found out how much I paid for it and heard sooo many other parents comment on what a great idea it was, he changed his tune and bought one for a friend who just had a baby. :)
