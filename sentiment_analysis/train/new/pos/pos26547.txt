i received a precious moments calendar for my first daughter as gift.  i ordered the classic pooh calendar for my 2nd daughter. i ordered a memory book at the same time. the calendar is really cute and better than i expected. unlike my 1st daughter's calendar, this one has spots for photos and places for information like family tree, who do i look like most, birth information, and spots for photos.  it could almost serve as a memory book itself.  it has stickers to put on special days like first day home, first smile, discovered hands, 1st Christmas, etc.  it's easier to jot things down on the calendar than to go get the baby book out and write things down.  there's space for something everyday. i also like the nutural colors so i can hang it anywhere and write on it all the time
