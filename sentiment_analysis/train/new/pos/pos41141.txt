I ordered this in the Orange color. LOVE IT! Lighweight, easy to grab and go. Easy to clean- I just spritz it with a lavender essential oil solution and wipe it down with a cloth when needed, otherwise, leaving it in a sunny window works well too. I like that this changing pad can be used anywhere- toss it atop the bed, atop a table, atop a folded towel..anywhere really. I didn't realize it's two-tone as well. Again, I bought the orange color. One side is like the orange pictured, the other is more of a bright yellow-orange tangerine color...it's fun to flip sides to change it up a little. I also like to joke that this will be baby's yoga mat when she's a toddler. Ha!
