These have worked well for our son - they have kept his head from drooping most of the time.  I had to play with the placement a little; we found that placing them a bit forward (i.e. not completely against the back of the carseat) worked best.  He does not love having them on, so we really only use them for long car trips.  But the product is well-designed and the material is very soft against baby's skin.  I would recommend this product to others.
