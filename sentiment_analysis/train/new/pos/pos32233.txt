This bathrobe is super cute and actually fit my 2 month old that was born a month early.  Although it was big on her, it kept her dry and warm after a bath and made her look oh so adorable.  The booties have elastic on them so they fit her tiny feet.  My daughter is 5 months old now, small for her size, but the bathrobe and booties still fit well and she enjoys wearing them after a bath.
