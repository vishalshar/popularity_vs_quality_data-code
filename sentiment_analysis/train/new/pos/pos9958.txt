I have bought several of these for my household and for gifts. I am a mom of 6 and this little device is by far, one of the most useful that I own. Its packed nicely if your buying it for a gift. When you first open it you will notice how lightweight it is, and you may think it's cheaply made. That's what I thought but in time it proved to be a wonderful investment. I could catch infections early and prevent my baby from being in severe pain. The light is bright and has different size ear guards to help you get the best look inside. It also comes with a booklet (with photos), to help you understand what you are seeing and what to look for. I would recommend this to anyone. It is truly one of my best buys.
