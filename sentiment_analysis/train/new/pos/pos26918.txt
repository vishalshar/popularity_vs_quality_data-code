We received the set a few days ago, but just put it together today. There are a few small nicks/scratches on a few pieces, but nothing that is noticeable or causes any structural loss. We were actually impressed by how good a quality the pieces seemed to be for the price we paid. The instructions were easy to follow and both pieces were pretty simple to assemble for two people, but I am glad I didn't have to try to do it by myself!Only complaints were the few nicks/scratches and the espresso colored set is not very dark. More of a cherry finish than an espresso, which isn't quite what I had in mind, but it is pretty close to the picture online.
