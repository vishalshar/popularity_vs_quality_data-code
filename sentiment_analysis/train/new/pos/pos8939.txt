I have a 25 pound 1 year old who is 32 inches long, so I needed to  be able to use the full tub (used to use a Munchkin inflatable yellow duck that quacks - she loved this).  On the first use, my daughter was standing in the tub and slipped and would have bumped her head, but the cushion prevented it.  So, yes it does work.  The reason it isn't perfect for me is that the suction cups sometimes slip and since it is inflated, it basically floats.  It would be nice to find a way to make all of the suction cups hold down the liner, but some do.  Most of the time they stick to the tub too, so even if it rides up it isn't like it is floating on top of the water.  I usually fill the tub from 1/4 to 1/3 of water.
