This is perfect! I have a 2 year old daughter and before she was fully potty trained I was super concerned about what I would do when we were out of the house. I absolutely love this folding potty chair. I purchased a small bag to carry it and I also have a zip-lock of Clorox wipes in the bag with me whenever we leave the house. I just wipe it down after we use it and throw the chair back into the bag. I feel confident taking my child to any public toilet knowing she will stay clean. This is a must have for any parent with a toddler. I've included a picture of the potty folded up next to my iPad mini for size reference. This is an excellent product!
