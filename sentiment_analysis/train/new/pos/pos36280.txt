My newborn initially refused to sleep anywhere other than our arms or next to us, this was a safe way to co-sleep without worrying about safety. It's also great because it is more portable than her big bassinet, which has wheels but doesn't roll well on carpet. When she is sleeping in this I can carry her around to different rooms with me. Great purchase!
