My arm was SO bruised from the baby carrier. This has taken care of that issue and I've spent more on stupider items!! That being said, it would be better if it was a little longer I think. I have a  Graco Click Connect and I have to really get aggressive with it to get it in just the right spot and there isn't much wiggle room. Maybe a bigger velcro for better adjusting would help that issue as well. Overall I do not regret this purchase and would purchase again.
