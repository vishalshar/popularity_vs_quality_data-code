Easy to use, once installed. Rear and fwd facing, it may be a little tight in some cars if the driver/front passenger are over 6' tall.  That includes our crossover Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, which surprised us. I used rear-facing until age 25 mos. Fwd facing gives the most room. Don't try to install in an airplane seat. Mostly because it's insanely heavy and bulky to carry around the airport.  It's not too bad to install in a car, but it took 30+min the first 8-10 times. But I'm super cautious; just try it and get it inspected at your local police dept. That goes for ALL car seats, though. Even with the hectic installation and large size, I'd still recommend it because of its safety ratings and ease of use once installed.
