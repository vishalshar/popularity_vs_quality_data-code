I'm on my second child, and this pack n play has everything I need and then some.  I was lucky to get it for $121 with free shipping on this site.  (Thanks Amazon Mom!) It has everything I wanted: diaper stacker. canopy, vibration/music, and a sturdy diaper changer.  I had the winnie the pooh pack n play with my first and it had a mobile which was a huge waste.  The baby pulled and broke off all the animals, and the mobile just isn't necessary for a pack n play so don't make that a requirement!  The canopy is what you really want to keep light away from baby and it's a bonus that this one has removable toys on the canopy.  The changing table on my first one was not sturdy and slanted downward, but this one seems super sturdy and has great storage spots for diaper-changing supplies.  This is PERFECT and a great deal for the money.  And it's VERY cute in person.  I thought it would be too grey and not enough pink, but it's really cute.  Pink is brighter than I thought it would be.  Great purchase!
