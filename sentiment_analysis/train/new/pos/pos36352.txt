This pacifier is a unique gift for a baby! If you have a friend who is like my best friend-- unconventional and non-traditional -- then this could be a great gift to give them! Especially if they like to have fun with things like these!The binky is study, hazard free, and BPA free. It definitely would be easy to keep around for Halloween time and then use it for a little baby Count Dracula costume! Too cute!You'll get everyone talking with the pacifier and the baby will love it! I highly recommend!
