After trying the Munchkin Three Stay Put Suction Bowl 3-Pack which DID NOT STICK AT ALL and the waaaay more expensive (although not technically a baby product) Large Sticky Bowl which DID NOT STAY STUCK AT ALL (although it did work as intended for keeping a bowl steady), I was about to give up hope.Then I tried the Boon Catch Bowl.And the bowl stayed stuck.Through lunch.With my 16mo toddler almost-constantly pulling at it (he knew he could get the other bowls off)./cue angels singingThat said, I don't yet see much use in the "spill catcher" part of it--maybe once my son starts eating with one hand more than the other...but for now, it's just more of a handle for him to play with.But I still HIGHLY RECOMMEND this bowl and am happy to give it five stars.P.S. We loved it so much we bought a second bowl (the orange/white one), and were surprised to get an orange/blue bowl! Turns out the photo is WRONG--but the description says orange/blue--and you do get an orange/blue bowl.
