I read previous reviews and was skeptical about this mattress! I had the freebie pad that came with the mini crib (Davinci) and it is disposable junk. THIS MATTRESS IS NOT!! It is like a REAL little mattress! It is fully finished on all sides and very firm! I am very happy with this purchase and I really see my baby sleeping more soundly on it. I also LOVE that it is fabric covered instead of plastic so when she moves around there is no sound! I did buy a waterproof mattress pad to put on it just to be safe.
