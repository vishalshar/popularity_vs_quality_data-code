LOVED IT!Every time I went to eat my baby cried and of course Mom is always the one to get up to feed baby and when I bought this it changed everything.I would put her in her carrier and have her join us for dinner and she would eat dinner with us :)We still have dinner together and this got her used to knowing that when you are at the dinner table you eat! I did not use it for long as she started eating soft foods by 6months but this made that transition very easy.  We used it when eating out as well and it worked like a charm, you just cant use fast flow nipples or they will make a mess. I never had that issue as I was always near her and could take the bottle away if she was done. Eventually if you are not breastfeeding the baby will be feeding herself and this helps that process along.This isn't for lazy people, this is for smart people who want to enjoy eating as a family or want to get many other things done while baby feeds!  Don't feel guilty over this product, if there are products to make our life easier so be it.  If anything this allows you to get things done in a faster more efficient manner and move on to better things like playing with baby. Our sole purpose isn't JUST to feed baby especially in a way that OTHERS see fit. Highly recommend this product, I can't wait to gift it to a friend!
