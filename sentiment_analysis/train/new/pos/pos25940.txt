I got this for my 3 year old who had outgrown his full seat. he seems comfortable in it, but the head bolsters do block his view out the window some, but that is expected. It does not like to sit flat on the rear seat of my Grand Cherokee and I am constantly adjusting it to sit right. This may be a trait of all of the boosters, but it's an annoyance just the same.
