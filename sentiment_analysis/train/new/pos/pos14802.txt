I have had the case for about 3 weeks now. I was a little unsure because the product pictures weren't fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised. One big reason I went with this case over a different highly rated case on amazon was because of the way the tablet is positioned when using the stand function. On other cases the larger side of the tablet is on the bottom when in the stand position. This worried me because many apps only allow me to use the tablet with the larger side on the top. When using the stand function of this case the larger side is on the top (If that makes any sense).Aside from that there is a nice little holder for a stylist in the case as well as a elastic band that is attached to the front cover and flips over the case to keep it nice and secure when in transport. The camera holes are positioned pretty nicely and haven't really given me any problems.Another nice feature is when you fold the case back to hold it in your hand it completely levels out the back so one side is not larger than the other. I know it seems like a weird detail to add...but it makes the tablet very comfortable to hold and use.My only negative about the case is that the remote control function does not work with the case on. There is a small hole where they tried to make it work...but it just doesn't. The top flips off easy enough not to make it a huge deal...so take it for what it's worth.Overall the case seems to be a high quality case. The shape of the case fits the tablet s perfectly and its nice and snug. It actually gives the tablet a very professional look. I would definitely recommend it to others.
