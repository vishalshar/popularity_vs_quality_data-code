After hours and hours of research and reading reviews, I chose this bike trailer/jogging stroller. I'm SO GLAD I made this purchase! I have used it so many times and even in different ways. It is just perfect for my boys. They can comfortably sit on the bench-style seat together without falling into one another like some other brands. There is plenty of room in there for them plus toys, drinks and snacks. We don't even use the regular double stroller anymore, because I always take this one along. It's so easy to take apart and reassemble. In most vehicles (car trunks or backs of SUVs/minivans) you can get away with not taking off the wheels. In a Camry I was able to remove the front wheel, unhook the handlebar and fold down the sides and get it in the trunk with no problems. One of the things I find really great about this units is that all of the pins that hold the different parts together are tethered, so you never have to worry about losing them when you do disassemble. I can be assembly challenged, so if I can quickly put this thing together and take it apart, anyone can! Our most recent time I was SO thankful for this stroller was Halloween. It rained the ENTIRE time for appropriate trick-or-treating hours. We put our 3 and 1 year old children in the stroller and pulled the rain cover over most of it. The majority of the home owners in our neighborhood sit on their carports or in their garages to hand out candy, so we were able to push the kids right up to them and keep them dry. As for pulling this with a bike, until you come to a hill you can barely tell it is even there. It's just so great I wish I could give it 10 starts!
