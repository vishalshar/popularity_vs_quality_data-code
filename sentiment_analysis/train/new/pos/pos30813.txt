My daughter absolutely LOVES this mobile.  It plays the classic winnie the pooh theme song which we sing to her and matches her nursery perfectly BUT you have to wind it up.  It only lasts a few minutes so I'm constantly cranking it back up.  I wish it had a switch to turn on and off instead.  I would still recommend it because it is beautiful and entertaining.
