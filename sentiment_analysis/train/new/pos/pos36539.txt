Boppy Total Body Pillow is very comfortable for pregnant women who need all around support. The only problem I had with the pillow is that it's bulky and sometimes if I rolled around in bed, I would get caught up in the pillow and you would have to reposition the pillow (It's a BIG pillow). Moving around that much in bed wakes you up, but what is the differnce when you have to get up in the middle of the night (multiple times...) to pee anyway!:) Great productPS: No need to purchase slipcover...it has a nice breathable, machine-washable cover on it to begin with.
