The product was everything that I knew it would be I brought it for my two month old grandson who has discovered his feet and loves to kick so I knew this would be great to help him with his first developmental skills, and yes he loves the bright colors and he tries to reach for the bee and lady bug, he is very stimulated by the little bugs and he gives himself lots of excise.  However, in the many years that I have shopped at Amazon this is the first time that I have ever received the product that was not the same as the picture and the description didn't say that the design would be different than pictured. I spent a lot of time looking for the right design for my grandson, the one I received was the black and white stripe which I didn't want, and the product was not in its original package it was in a zip lock bag so that was very disappointing, but since I had looked for this product for long and was eager for my grandson to have it I just washed it and he loves it. So the product itself is great cannot take that away, but the presentation of this product was very bad and misleading, Disappointed in my go to online store this time.
