I have been using Bebea first stage spoons since my son first started "tasting" solid food at 5 months. I really liked these spoons, but since they were the first I'd tried, and he is nearly 6 months now, I decided to shop around, just to be sure. The Spuni spoons are fantastic for first feedings!! They only allow you to feed very small portions at a time, and the design triggers the natural latching reflex, so the baby actually sucks the food off of the spoon.  Since the bowl of the spoons are so small, these won't work for very long, but I wish I'd found these first, and switched to the much larger Bebea spoons after he outgrows them.  The only reason for the 4 star review is because these spoons are very lightweight; the Bebea spoons are much more comfortable in your hand and are ergonomically designed.
