I got this despite the complaints because I have had good luck with Kushies (love their changing pads and burp cloths), and the price was right. The pattern looks way better in person than in the photo, too.And, yes. If you have hardwood floors, you might not be happy with this. But for carpet, it's working just fine for me. I can walk on it. Our cats have run all over it but not torn holes in it. The baby likes to play with it. It keeps food from staining or getting ground into the carpet -- which was the purpose. No, it's nothing sturdy, and I have to straighten in out occasionally. I'm sure once my 8-month-old learns to throw food, it'll be useless (as will anything). But for right now, at least I'm not trying to clean raspberries and egg yolks out of our (rental) carpet anymore! It looks nice and is definitely worth the money.
