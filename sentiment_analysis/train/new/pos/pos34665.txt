I don't understand why some reviewers are saying this mattress is "perfect" for Graco Pack N' Plays.  I should have listened to the reviewers who said the mattress is too small.  I incorrectly purchased this portable crib mattress for my Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet, Lively Dots. Being a new mom, I had mistakenly thought that a portable crib was the same as a Pack N' Play (or play yard) - I uploaded 2 pictures where you can see an approx. 2.5 inch gap on the long side of the bed, and there is also approx. a 1/2 inch gap on the short side.  Make sure to buy a "pack n' play mattress" if you have a Graco Pack N' Play.  Dream on Me has one on Amazon Dream On Me 3" Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress.  Even though it was my error, I decided to keep the mattress because my baby loved it.  I rolled up a  long towel to fill in this gap when she was an infant, but now she is a toddler and does not need the towel anymore.  My pictures also showEddie Bauer Velboa Play Yard Sheet, Sage which I love!!
