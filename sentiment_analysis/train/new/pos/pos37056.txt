Our daughter used this for several months while practicing tummy time and even when she was able to sit up unassisted.  Material was soft and washed nicely.  All toys were very pleasing and kept her attention. Purchased for a gender neutral pattern and to coordinate with our daughters Peter Rabbit Garden Nursery theme. Very happy with product, just wished she would have used it longer. Packed away for the next baby though!
