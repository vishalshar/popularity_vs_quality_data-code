I needed a drinking straw brush since my wife insists on putting green (read "lots of kale") smoothies through a straw.  There is no way to get these clean without a brush.  Since the sizes aren't listed, here they are:  Spout brush: 2 3/4 inch long, slightly less than 1/2 inch wide.  Valve brush: 5 1/4 inch long, slightly less than 3/8 inch wide.  Straw brush: 5 1/4 inch long, slightly less than 1/4 inch wide.For a 10 inch straw, this brush reaches "just" to halfway.  I guess it is "just" adequate. For a normal straw.Lately, some smoothie tumbler straws are being made in a 1/2 inch diameter.  This allows the chunks to come up the straw.  None of these brushes will work on such a straw.
