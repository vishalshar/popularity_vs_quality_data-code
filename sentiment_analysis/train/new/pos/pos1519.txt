I have been looking everywhere for safe(er) plastic-ware for my toddler. I love the fact these are not only a safer plastic to use than traditional plastic-ware (plastic has no melamine, BPA, phthalates, PVC, or external coatings), but it's also made from 100% recycled plastic milk containers. They are SUPER STURDY not flimsy like other plastic ware. This almost has a feel like tupperware (as in good sturdy lifetime quality).  I will be ordering more when the time comes. I am also ordering the whole set; Plates, bowls and cups! THANK YOU!
