This is called a dinosaur towel, but my baby son's nursery theme is dragons and this really looks like a dragon! It's so adorable! We had it on our baby registry and were so disappointed when no one bought it for us that we bought it ourselves. Of course, it's maybe a bit expensive for just one towel but so cute that we couldn't resist.It's only about as soft as a medium-quality terrycloth towel for adults, but the baby doesn't seem to have a problem with it. It has washed up really well, too, even after he pooped on it a couple of times.  Sometimes it's nice to have something that just makes you smile when you use it, and this will.
