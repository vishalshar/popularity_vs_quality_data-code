I love this umbrella stroller for my twins. It collapses to a very small size perfect for fitting in the trunk of my Honda accord along side a separate stroller that will hold their car seats. The boys love the view and the red color attracts a lot of attention. It is easily maneuverable when you are in crowded situations.In terms of cons the rear seat is shallower than the front seat but this has not made a substantial difference for us. The canopy for the stroller is a bit difficult to install and uninstall as I haven't been able to figure out how to collapse it with the canopy on. Also, the canopy provides little shade for the kid up front. Likewise, there is significant under carriage storage but these items must be removed before you can collapse the stroller.
