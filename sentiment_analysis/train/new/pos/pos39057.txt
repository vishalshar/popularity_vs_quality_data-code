I have a 20 month old son that is infatuated with Elmo.  Everything has to be Elmo-bibs, blankets, toys, you name it.I found this product on accident while searching for other Elmo items, and decided to go ahead and splurge on it.  Little did I know how perfect this would work out.  I was so tired of cleaning my son's car seat constantly.  It seemed as if he was purposely trying to frustrate me by grinding crackers into the seat, or squeezing juice out of his sippee onto the fabric.I was exhausted from having to take the whole thing apart and trying to keep the (expensive) car seat clean.  Until this arrived.  I took the car seat apart one last time, and gave it a final scrubbing.  It was a great feeling putting that back together knowing that I would not be doing that every week anymore.The car seat cover went on fairly easy, and has stayed on ever since.  It fits great, looks great, and every morning as we walk to the car, my son sees it and says "Elmo!!"  It definitely helps since he absolutely hates getting in the car, so at least now he has something to get excited about.  Now when he gets crumbs in the seat, I just simply pinch the fabric and pull.  It is so much easier than before.  Plus, the cover makes it look like the car seat itself is Elmo.  For those of you wanting to keep resale value in your car seats, this is a great way to do so!!!The material feels really soft, and is machine washable.Definitely would buy again.Hannah Booth
