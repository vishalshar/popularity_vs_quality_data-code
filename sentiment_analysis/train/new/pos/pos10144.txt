I honestly don't understand why people are disappointed in this.  First off, I'm 5'7.  I'm taller (and probably larger) than the other users and I will tell you why I am fine with this product.1) I already have a pillow for my head.  That is not what I bought this for.  I bought this for my bodily aches and pains and it fully helps with that.  I think everyone else is expecting too much from this pillow, and if it's "too short" or "too small" use your other pillow too.  It's not rocket science.2) I share a queen size bed with my husband (and occasionally my large dog too).  This pillow is the perfect size because no one feels like they're losing bed space.  It fits very comfortably.3) I'm quite a mover while asleep.  I mean, I'm all over the place.  This pillow is compact and light enough to shift around and move through the night with me.  I'm sure you will not find the same ease with a full-size body pillow.4) The very best thing about this pillow is that you can easily shape it into a giant "O" and sleep on your stomach with your belly in the center.  In fact, I haven't slept so soundly since being pregnant than I have when I'm able to sleep on my stomach.  This easily allows for that, even though the pictures don't show that option.5)  If you're wondering why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, it is because yes, the cover is removable and washable, but the design of it makes it very difficult to remove.  There are no easy-access zippers, velcro or anything else.  It is a tightly-sewn sleeve on one end of the pillow.  Not very convenient.I think everyone just needs to lighten up.  Everyone expects this to be a miracle, do-all pillow, but it's just a pillow.  It is what you make it.  In fact, you should buy this for its smaller size than for anything else.  Also, for the price, it's a killer deal, not to mention you can use it for nursing once your little one arrives.
