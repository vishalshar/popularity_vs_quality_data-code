Simply adorable! Love the softness of the edges, and the cute koala design. Will be perfect as a co sleeper for our little one (due in a week) beside our bed. Not too big, but still a good size to last several months. I had been looking everywhere for a co-sleeper/bassinet in a neutral color with breathable sides (that wasn't as pricey as the Arms Reach etc). Pack and plays with bassinets had been suggested to us, but they were all ugly black or grey linings and just wouldn't look good in our natural colored master room. Seeing as we plan to have the baby in our room at least 6 months, i wanted something slightly attractive! LOL Out of all the options, this was the best value for money in my opinion, it rocks and is in perfect height with our somewhat low bed (we don't have a box spring). There is a little bit of lime green thats not really obvious from the online photos, I have attached what it looks like next to our bed. Very pleased. I will update review if my opinion changes once we have a baby in it haha
