They work. Period.  I don't know how, I don't know why, I don't care.  They just WORK.  We lost it for about 3 days and we could really tell the difference between my son wearing it and not wearing it.  We scoured the house until we found it in the dryer.  We use it as an anklet until he gets older and it will fit on his wrist.  When he was very little, it tended to roll off when we removed his zipper onesie PJ's. Which is how we found it in the dryer.  Just in time too because I was about to order a replacement.  I promise you, this works.  And my son does not play with it or pull at it.  He totally ignores it.  And nothing gets past his curious little eyes and fingers.  The beads are double knotted just like a good quality pearl necklace.  So if the bracelet breaks, beads won't slide off the string and become choking hazards.  And the string is extremely sturdy.  What a terrific aid for teething babies!  My son's first 2 molars just broke through and it worked so well, we did not even know he had new teeth erupting.
