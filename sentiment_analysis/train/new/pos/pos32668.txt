The colors are nice. The picture is a little off. The colors are more subdued then the picture. But they are prettier in person, I think. The quality is not as nice as I was expecting. The blanket has no filling in it. Just a very thin blanket top with a thin backing. Hold it up to the light and you can see through it. In comparison to my other sons bedding which cost about the same, the blanket in his bedding is actually two parts, a duvet cover and a cotton blanket you can remove to wash the cover. In the cold winters that heavy blanket has worked really well. And in the hot summer you can remove the thick inside. With this set it's just a thin blanket. SO in heavy winters you will need to double up with something else if your older infant/toddler sleeps with this blanket. I do not think the bedding was worth the money. I would have paid 99 for this bedding had I known the quality. But all in all I am happy that the colors are nice and the fabric is soft.
