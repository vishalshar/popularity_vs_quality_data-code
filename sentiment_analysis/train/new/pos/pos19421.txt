When my daughter suddenly went from loving her baths to hating them, I searched for ways to engage her in bathtime again.  I looked up a lot of different toys before finally settling on this one.  As soon as we introduced it, we saw a complete turn around.  She loves getting into the bathtub and playing with her kitchen!  This toy has been a huge help.  That being said, here are a few things I dislike about it:- The faucet is designed to squeezed and draw water up from the bottom and through.  However, it's somewhat hard to actually use and takes several pumps before water starts flowing.  My daughter has completely given up on it.- Two different straining cups is a little unnecessary.  The attached one just gets in the way and she never uses it.- The scrubby brush soaks up water and stays wet a long time.  I have to squeeze it out really hard because I'm concerned about mold and other gross things growing on it- It's designed to hang from the shower head, but the hook area is too small.  We have to wedge it on and it doesn't stay against the wall, but keeps slipping down.
