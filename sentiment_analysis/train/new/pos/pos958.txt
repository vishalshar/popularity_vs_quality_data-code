Our baby spits up A LOT! I wish we had discovered this before 5 months.  We use it now for rice cereal and LOVE that it wipes clean and dries almost instantly.  I do enough laundry around here these days and I'm so glad that bibs won't be taking up a large portion of our laundry any more!!Can't wait to try the next size...I'm even thinking of buying the adult version so I don't get spit up all over me when I burp him!! :)
