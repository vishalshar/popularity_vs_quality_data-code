I purchased this for my second child and was so happy with it. I wished I had them with my first child as well. This makes for a great quick and easy way to swaddle your newborn and is perfect for new moms.The only downside was that my son grew out of it very fast. We lived in a warmer climate so I only got to use it a few times before he was too big for it.I loved using it in his stroller but didn't feel like it fit well in his carseat.
