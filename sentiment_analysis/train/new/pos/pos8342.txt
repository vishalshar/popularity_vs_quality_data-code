When I was looking for baby stuff for our first baby, I found this product and after reading the reviews decided it's a must buy! It also has reviews on you tube just type the name. It functions exactly as it says on the item description.  We have it in the corner of our bedroom next to the bathroom. So, when we need to give a bath we just roll it to our bathroom so we can have access to the water from the sink. I just have a little pitcher and use that to pour water over the baby. You can easily wipe clean the changing pad. My husband and I are short (5'2" ft and 5'6" ft) but found the height of the station just right. Also, there's also all that room and space for al your changing needs from diapers, wipes, and body wash. Definitely, one of the most convenient baby product out there! Highly recommend! I did not have to experience any backaches!
