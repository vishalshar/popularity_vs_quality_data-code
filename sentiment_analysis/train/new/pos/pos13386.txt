I like this plate for teaching my baby how to eat off of a plate.  She can pick it up but only does that when there is no more food.  The compartments are not very deep so you can't put much food on it, but from my experience you do not want to put a bunch of food in front of your baby because too much = play time. A little at a time = it may end up in her mouth.  She has not skidded it though so the slip resistant seems to work for her.  It may get too small for main meals some time in the future, but it would be a great plate for snacks! We got two of them and I'm a happy customer.
