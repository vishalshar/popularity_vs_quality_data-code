I use these nipples with Medela bottles and they fit well. I breastfeed and use bottles. My daughter can go back and forth with no problems since birth and now she's 6 months old. These are supposed to be disposable but I reuse them and sterilize them in steam. They get softer and the bottom rubber cracked off once because I sterilized it too many times. So I try not to use them more than 2 weeks now. They came in the mail quickly after I placed my order too. Would recommend.
