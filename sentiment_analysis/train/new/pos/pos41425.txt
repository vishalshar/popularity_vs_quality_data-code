My bullet proof newborn diaper! I looooove this diaper! They fit immediately after birth and they were her first diaper! They fit my almost seven pounder great! I imagine they'd fit even a much smaller baby! So soft and squishy and snuggly. I only have three of these but if I could do it over I would have probably bought like ten. They are excellent I have zero complaints about them! Perfect diaper for a teeny tiny newborn even with the stump the snap down works beautifully!
