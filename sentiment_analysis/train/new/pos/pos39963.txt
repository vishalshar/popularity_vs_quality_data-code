These are really nice balls. They fit perfectly in my six-month-old hands and she loves to play with them. The only downside is that if you have animals, they attract every kind of pet hair imaginable and are constantly covered in hair if you leave them down.Please note: These do not work properly with the Poppity Pop Dino from Fisher-Price. If you're looking for something that works with that I would suggest buying the actual Fisher-Price balls. These just don't come out of the shoot very fast or very often. They are heavier than the originals.
