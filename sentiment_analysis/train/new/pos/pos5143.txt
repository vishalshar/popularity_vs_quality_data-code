This product was a lifesaver on a recent trip with our newborn - 12 hours in the car EACH WAY! It allowed us to keep moving while our baby was still able to eat when he wanted to. I did find the supplied nipple to be a little too firm which made it difficult for my newborn to keep the milk flowing properly (I kept having to prime it over and over again with the supplied nipple because the milk would flow back down the straw between sucks). Luckily we tried the bottle out before our trip and quickly identified that as an issue and easily found a pack of more pliable nipples that were the same size at the local Dollar Tree. They fit perfectly and were soft enough for our 8 week-old to be able to effectively use this bottle over and over while we kept our minivan moving! Our baby breastfeeds so to save time and keep the car in motion I would pump every few hours (while, of course, we were still driving! Lol) and put it into the Podee for him to drink. It was a perfect system and I am still amazed at how easy it was to make that long road trip thanks to the Podee.
