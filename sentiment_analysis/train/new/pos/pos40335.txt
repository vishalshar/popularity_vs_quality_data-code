I love these cups. The lid fits tight and the only leakage I have noticed is when it’s turned upside down and the liquid comes out of the straw. I have not used the cups to travel with but I think it would be fine for toddlers and children who do not turn their cups upside down. '  If traveling I would not place the cups where they will have the chance of turning over though. The lid isn’t easy to take off so it would be difficult for a toddler to take off themselves.My mom who is bed bound has also started using them. It is hard for her to hold a cup and take a drink without liquid pouring out on her. These cups are lightweight and she can take a drink while in the bed without getting wet. That is a win-win for both of us.I have purchased the pink and the multicolored set and I love all the colors and the shape designs on the cups are nice as well.For the price these disposable cups are a great buy. We have been using them over a month and so far they are still working great for our purposes.
