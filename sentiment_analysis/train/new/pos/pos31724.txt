I love the Britax Adapter!! Everywhere we go with our 2 year old and 5 month old people comment or ask about it!! We had no trouble installing the adapter or using it. I read many reviews about the stroller tipping over but as long as its on solid flat ground I've had no issues while the upper seat is empty.  Our little one faces towards me from the bottom and can see everything at her level.  This has been priceless for trips to the zoo, walks around the neighborhood, etc!
