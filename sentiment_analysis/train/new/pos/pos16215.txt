This chair is fabulous, well made and looks great.  My son loves it.  He is now 16 months and has been using it since he was 5 months old (with infant attachment).  It is so much nicer and more practical than the horrible, huge plastic highchairs.  He'll be using the chair for years to come!  It's one of the best things that I have bought for my son.
