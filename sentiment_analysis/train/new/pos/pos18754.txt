Nicely finished and the right size for my space.  But these will not hold a large or even medium sized dog, a rambunctious puppy or determined dog of any size.  My very small (under 15 lbs) cooperative dogs respect the gates and they stay out of where I put them.  I like them because they look like furniture and are not too huge and intrusive.  I like the door very much when it's just me at home so I don't have to fold up the whole gate, but I have learned to take them down entirely when we have company because people invariably trip over the bottom span of the door.  I did not purchase the stabilizers because my gates have to go on tile right next to carpet and I didn't think the stabilizers would be very stable in that situation.  But these gates probably should be used with stabilizers.  They lean and put a lot of stress on the hinges if you leave the door open. and they have fallen over a couple of times.  I purchased two gates and overall am happy with them for my purposes and with my dogs.
