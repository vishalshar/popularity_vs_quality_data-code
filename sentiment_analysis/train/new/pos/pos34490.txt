I got so tired of changing my 3 year old son's bed every single night. He's fully potty trained during the day and then with his pull ups he would leak every single night. I searched for something that would be a better fit for his bed and found this. I ordered one, he leaked, and it didn't go through! Note: these fit on a crib sized mattress. They are also NOT fitted. They just lay over the mattress. What I do is I have my son just lay over top of it at night. It is soft enough that it doesn't bother him. That way I can just rip it off and change the pad instead of taking off the entire sheet and changing it that way. I know personally that it doesn't bug him to sleep on it because when he sleeps with me I just throw this down on my bed so he doesn't leak and so I've slept on it a few times as well and it doesn't bother me at all. I ordered a few more for extra changes. I love that it doesn't leak through!
