I bought the bassinet for my stepdaughter, so I haven't actually tried it out, but she demonstrated all the features to me and I thought it was great!I was impressed with the pattern/material that it was made with, it was very elegant looking, but neutral enough to be used for a boy or girl.As my step-grandchild was just born last week and we don't live in the same town, I haven't visited the baby at home yet, only the hospital, so that's all I can say about it.
