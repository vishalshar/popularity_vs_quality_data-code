My seven month old is always seeking out tags on everything.  Blankets, pillows, clothes etc.  When I did a search and found Taggies I was jumping up and down because I thought, what a neat idea.  I started small and ordered this one so we could take it on the go.  I figured if he liked it I would purchase the larger one.  I don't know if it's the size or what, but my boy doesn't play with it as much as I thought he would.  I am thinking about buying the bigger one to see if he's more into that one.  Or maybe one of the blankets for nap/bedtime.  Other than that I really love this little thing.  The concept is awesome the quailty is great.  The colors are bright and fun and I was surprised that it came with a link, that was a nice touch.  I would say this is a great toy if only I could get my little man to play with it!  LoL
