This is an absolutely great set for older babies and up.  I never used it for baby food, so I can't speak to the leaking issue.  But for half a sandwich, and snacks like cut fruit, cheese, or crackers, it is perfect.  It's not very big, so if you're going to be out for a whole day you'll need to pack more than this holds, or use the small containers separately so you can put food in the big one too.  I also think that for older than about 2, it might not be quite big enough for a meal-- my 17 month old cleans it out already with no trouble!  I guess that's boys. :)  The lids are somewhat hard to get off, which I'm glad of for my toddler but might be a problem if an older child needed to be independent.  And the main lid warped a bit in the dishwasher, but still fits fine with a little wiggle.  I don't quite understand all the objections to the spoon-- the bowl is sort of flat, and wider than infant spoons, but really not so freakish and useless as you might expect from all the complaints here.  As an added perk, the whole set is also a puzzle-- my son often spends as much time after lunch fitting the little containers into the big one as he did eating.
