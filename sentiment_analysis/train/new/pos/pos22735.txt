These are perfect for our toddler in his car seat. These strap covers seem to be made of some magical combination of pixie dust and lotion - they're very, very soft. I'm a bit of a safety nut, and these covers make the ride immeasurably more comfortable for the little one. They're also machine washable, a big plus considering all the chewing that can happen to anything near a toddler.
