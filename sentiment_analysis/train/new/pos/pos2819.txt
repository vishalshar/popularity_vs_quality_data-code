These are nice, but I didn't get any of the spiral linky loops  =(  I purchased 2 packages of these with the hopes that they would allow me to link my sons Oball to his gym, stroller or carseat as this is his favorite toy.  Both packages had exactly the same linky loops in it, no variety at all... There were only 4 in each package that had a split for hanging things so that left me with 16 plastic pieces that don't have a real purpose.  The 16 other pieces are flexible but my son shows no interest in them.  I am not going to open the second package, may use it as a gift later down the road but not worth it to ship it back.Update:I take back my words, in a way.  I am still not happy that there are not enough linkable loops and that when I contacted the company they never responded but... My son LOVES these things.  I used the 4 linky loops attached together and attached the non-linkable (no openings) to these.  He makes it his mission to pull them apart and place them on the floor.  He is only 6 months old and he doesn't play with any of his toys like he plays with these (and of course his original Oball!).  I would recommend these for young children, it does work well with dexterity and motor development.  Plus, the price is right, they are not expensive for a childs toy and they are very durable.
