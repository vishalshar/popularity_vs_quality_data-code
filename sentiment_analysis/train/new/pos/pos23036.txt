From a very young age, my little grandchildren have grabbed onto this toy first.  The red loop is very durable, and the wooden balls and discs are great for teething.  It is a nice size and the babies have no problem holding onto it.  Also, because it is a loop, it can easily be attached to links on a stroller or car seat.
