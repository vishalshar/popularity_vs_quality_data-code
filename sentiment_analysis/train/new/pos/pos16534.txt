Needed this to cover the thick mattress pad we bought for the pack n' play. My mom (they call her "Happy") was great about taking our boys for the night every now and then to give us a date night, but our smaller boy would not sleep. We started to think it was the super thin pack n play mattress and the fact that the pack n play sheet was not soft. We have the Pottery Barn chamois sheets in crib. We purchased this sheet and the mattress and MAGIC! He sleeps and can stay a Happy's house. YAY!!! It is wearing well and has traveled the U.S. with us and the pack n play
