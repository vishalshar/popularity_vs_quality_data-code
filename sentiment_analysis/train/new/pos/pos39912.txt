This thing is awesome! I installed it 2 days ago and my 2 year old daughter can no longer get in the fridge as she pleases. She said its "heavy" and can't open it haha it seems pretty sturdy also, wondering how long that'll hold up though. They did send 2 extra sticky pieces so that's great for when it finally does loose its stick. Very simple to install and easy too use, I like how you only need 1 hand to open it and it automatically locks back into place when you close the fridge door. Definitely recommend!
