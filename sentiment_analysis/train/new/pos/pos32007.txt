These suspenders have good sturdy clips that allow crawling AND keeping your pants on!  My grandson is a year old and these are a great asset to his wardrobe.  The only draw back is that the piece in the back, where the straps come together,  is not adjustable.  As a result, the straps rub on his neck.  He doesn't seem to notice, so obviously it doesn't hurt.  When I bought suspenders for my son, that piece was metal and allowed the straps to be slightly adjusted.  I couldn't find suspenders with that, so I bought these.  All in all, they are great!
