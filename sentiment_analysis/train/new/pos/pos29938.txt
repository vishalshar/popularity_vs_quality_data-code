I love this product! We are always on the lookout for ways to make our lifestyle more eco-friendly and safe for our children. We have just started potty training our son and this makes the process so much easier! I'm not saying that having to clean the stool after each session is a huge task, but the fact that our son can go potty, remove the liner, flush it and we start and end with a clean stool is a HUGE bonus because he can do it all himself. Even though we use green cleaners, having to either teach the little guy to clean the stool each time or do it myself each time is just one extra step that we can definitely live without! This is a durable, clean, green, parent-innovated product that gets a thumbs-up in my book and in our house! I will definitely be ordering more of these!
