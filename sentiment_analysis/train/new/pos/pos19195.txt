I have a G2, saw the previous review and felt confident purchasing the basket. It fits the stroller perfectly and the stroller still folds normally. Basket slides in and out easily just like the pod, which I now keep inside the basket since there's so much room now.After taking my older kids to Disney world. I love this basket even more!! I used the zippered side pockets for diapers, wipes, ointment, food, formula, and spoons. Yes!! All in the side zip pockets. I was able to close the stroller with these items still in place. This left plenty of room for other items in the basket. No baby bag needed!
