We've been using this bag for 4 years and it hasn't torn, faded, or shown any wear. It still looks as good as new inside and out. When we first got it our son was still an infant. We used it for trips to the store or to go for a walk with him in the stroller. At the time we kept enough diapers, wipes, cream, and tissues in there for 3 - 5 diaper changes, disposable changing pads, and 2 - 3 changes of clothes. He was small so onesies didn't take up much room. We transitioned to pull ups and 1 change of clothes when he was potty training. Now that he's 4 1/2 we keep wipes, tissues, and a change of clothes in it. I keep it in my trunk all year and switch out the outfit change based on season and his clothing size. It has been tossed around hasn't had any issues. It's dark brown with blue trim so my husband has never felt uncomfortable carrying it and our son doesn't feel like a baby with a 'ducky' diaper bag. It wipes clean easily. The strap is adjustable so it's comfortable to carry on my shoulder or by hand.
