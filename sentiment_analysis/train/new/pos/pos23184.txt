I purchased this product amidst the mixed reviews. I needed to use the Medela's pump in style but could not find an adapter for 220v from any other brand than this one. I have been using it and since day one it has worked just as fine as the 110v (USA). I am very happy with this adapter. I have had no issues with my pump (1-3 times/day) and still producing the same amount of milk.  I highly recommend it if you are planning to travel abroad. You still have to purchase a converter to use it, which I already had to use laptop and charge my cellphone.
