This monitor will interfere with your 2.4GHz wireless router unless you change the channel your router is on.  I changed mine from channel 6 to channel 11 and now the monitor and my router work perfectly.  Actually now my internet is faster than ever since it's no longer interfering with anything else in the house.  I do like how compact the monitor is and the fact that you can have up to 3 cameras since we have three boys under age 2.  I do not like the video on/off mechanism.  I think it should have a button with automatic off after a minute or so instead of the switch.  I also don't like the volume control.  If the LCD is off you can't see the volume level.  And I have turn the volume up every time I turn on the monitor instead of it staying at the level I leave it on.  Overall it's a great product, they just need to tweak a few things.
