I have several teethers and I have to say I love this one and so does my baby. Here are some things that makes this one stand out:- it can be frozen- the silicone round piece doesn't get too cold so baby can hold it comfortably- the frozen part at the top can reach further back toward the hard to reach molar area- not made in China
