I got this smock for my two year old who likes to play with water in the kitchen sink. I was sick of changing her clothes after sink time and so I bought this smock. It goes on easily over her clothes and has worked to protect her from getting wet. She is picky about clothes but she likes the pocket and she seems to like the bright colors. It has worked for us.
