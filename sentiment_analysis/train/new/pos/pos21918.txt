I researched and researched forward facing car seats.  I debated buying this car seat for about a month.  I finally decided to buy it and I am glad I did.Positives:  Easy to install.  It took us about 15 minutes to install with LATCH.  (just read the instructions a couple of times and watch the video  on-line if you think you'll have trouble)  The seat fits well forward facing in our car. (Pacifica)  It actually takes up less room then her infant carrier.  It is easy to adjust the positions.  No loops, no straps to re-thread.  My child appears comfortable and the HUGS system ensures nothing rubs on her.  The safety rating is the best!Negatives:  The Click and Safe feature is pointless.  It doesn't get snug enough, even though it "clicks."  It is actually harder to make the harness tight enough.  I wish we would have bought just the Boulevard.  For the price, not a lot of features like cup holder. Not a big deal, but would have been nice.  It does not fit well into my husbands Civic.  We are looking into a  smaller Britax.Overall, it is a wonderful seat.  It is easy to clean and I feel comfortable knowing my child is in a super safe top rated car seat.  I don't think I would use rear facing just because it doesn't have a removable base, so you would have to remove infant from seat to take in and out of home, store, ect.  Summary:  Great Forward facing infant seat!
