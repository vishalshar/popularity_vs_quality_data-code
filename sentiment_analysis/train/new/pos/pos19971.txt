I bought this for my 16 month-old girl who is in the 90th percentile- about the size of an average two year old. When she lays across this sofa, she places her calves on the arm rest. When she unfolds the bed, she fits with plenty of room on all sides. This sofa is very comfortable for napping, but my daughter tends to move a lot in her sleep in general and rolls off this bed onto the floor. I don't let her nap on this sofa although she finds it comfortable to lay on. While sitting, she fits three stuffed animals next to her.I'm currently pregnant and due in June and I can totally see this sofa hanging tough with two kids.I don't have a television so she uses this sofa for 5-10 minutes as a quick break, play time with dolls or reading time. I can see her using this up until she's 3 - 4 years.I would like it if this sofa came with a cover sold separately, so I won't have to worry about food and drink stains. I don't let her eat on it. She has spilled droplets of juice and they came off quickly. She's spilled water droplets as well, but I didn't clean those. They dried up without a trace.I love this product, and so does my daughter...and others who have seen it. Great product!
