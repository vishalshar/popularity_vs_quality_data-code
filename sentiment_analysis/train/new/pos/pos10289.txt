I bought this stroller as an open box instead of another brand, since it was $60 cheaper this way.  Since I planned to use it mostly for walks around the neighborhood, I didn't mind if it was a little small for my kids.I would definitely say that the other reviews and descriptions were very accurate (posted at the time I bought, anyway!)  so I was not surprised to find that my older children's (ages 3 and 2) heads hit the canopy, and their knees are really bent.  I don't have big kids, so definitely this stroller is designed for 4 children all under about the age of 2-2 1/2.Nevertheless, I LOVE IT.  I LOVE being able to pile my 4 children- 3 1/2, 2 1/2, 19 mos, and 3 mos- all into the stroller and go for a walk.  The stroller is super easy to push.  A bit of a pain to turn, but whatever, it's big.  I never intended to, but I did eventually take it to the mall- I got it into the back of my Odyssey without much trouble, and once there, it really was a lifesaver.  Got in and out of elevators no problem, and I wasn't chasing after kids the whole time- I actually was able to accomplish the shopping I needed to do without my kids knocking over an entire belt rack (like they did the last time).My husband put it together very easily, and I keep it in our garage.I was able to remove and re-fasten the front canopy easily.I put my infant in at about a month old and strapped her in with the seat reclined- she did great.I love the storage at the bottom- there are little nets to hold stuff as well as a bin at the bottom, and I can reach both very easily.I did use velcro straps to hold up the hand brake.  If I need to brake the stroller I use the foot brake.I'm so happy to be able to take a real walk and not end up carrying a tricycle half the way!!
