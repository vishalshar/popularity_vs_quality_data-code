I got it for $14 from Amazon ware house deal which is $2 less than listed price. The toy comes quickly and has an excellent quality. My girl didnt show any interest at first. So i clap the toy against my palm ( like a tambourine) and it catches her attention. I only have it for a week, will update later if anything happens.If you worry the charm may come off, then you shouldnt be. The reasons they only have 4 charms because they loop the rope between two and tide at the top. They are super durable ( i tried to pull them, but they didn't budge ! )  The paint seems nice and evenly, it shows no sign of chipping.I love this toy more because it is NOT "made in China" or PRC.It's fun and remind me of my childhood too :)
