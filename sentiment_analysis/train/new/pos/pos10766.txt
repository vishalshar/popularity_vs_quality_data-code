This is better then any stationary entertainer!  I got this for my son when he was 3 months old, since he always wanted to be standing, and he absolutely loved it.  He is tall for his age, but when we first got it, his feet barely reached the bottom and he still managed to slide the seat back and forth to get from one side to the other. He very quickly learned how to take the purple tray out and still uses it as a chew toy months later.When he was about 6 six month we took the seat out since he is very tall and he just didn't look very comfortable in the seat any more.  But he crawled and walked early so it was for the best anyway.  Now that he is 11 months, he still loves this toy and walks around it, plays peek-a-boo underneath the sides and loves changing the settings, and volume.  In fact, when he has his friends over, other boys his age, they all crowd around it and can't get enough of it.He has never hurt himself on this toy while in it.... No pinched fingers in the track, no chewing problems with any of the toys (and he puts EVERYTHING in his mouth),  and he could reach everything.  He used it to help him learn to stand and even used it to take his first steps.  He is very musical and loves to "compose" and look up for Mommy's approval.This toy is better then any other stationary entertainer I've seen because of its longevity.  It might be a bit more expensive, but the use you can get out of it is worth it.  I find the "Exersaucers" will only last you a few month, especially if you have a tall baby or one that walks early.  They wobble around and once your child is mobile, it just becomes a accident waiting to happen, even if your child still wants to play with the attached toys.This has been the best investment on a toy we have made.  I'm glad we spent the extra $10 or so.  I would highly recommend this toy.
