When we were originally looking to purchase a double stroller, we had debated on a side-by-side or a tandem.  After all the pain-in-the-[...] stories we heard about side-by-sides being to wide to fit thru some doorways and how difficult it could be to get thru a childrens clothing store, we decided to get a tandem and we are SO VERY HAPPY that we did!!  We have a newborn and a 2 1/2 yr old and this stroller is fantastic!  There is plenty of room for both kids (I personally prefer the 2 1/2 yr old in the front seat and the infant carrier in the back seat for the baby).  There is plenty of room for a diaper bag under the back seat, even when the back seat is being used with the infant carrier.  Some people argue that this stroller is a little heavy, but for what you get out of it, you don't even notice (it's honestly not much heavier than any other double stroller, and it's even lighter than some).  I have a van and I have no problems handling the stroller in and out of my van.  It was very simple to assemble when I purchased it.  It is also very easy to open and close (you can easily do it with one hand), parts don't fall off and it is really not all that difficult to get used to pushing around.  It is obviously longer than a traditional single stroller, so really all you have to do is get used to the fact that it is just a little longer.  I like that you can remove the trays from the front and back seat if you do not want them.  The front umbrella shade is also very easily removable.  I was also very happy that it accomodated my Snugride infant carrier/carseat that I purchased with a different single seat Graco stroller that I had for my first born.  It was nice not to have to buy another infant carrier and another base for my car.  My friend has children ages 4, 3, 2, 1 and she's pregnant with her fifth ~ this stroller has been a lifesaver for her too!  We highly recommend it!!
