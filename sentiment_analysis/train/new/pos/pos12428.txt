My son loves the Baby Einstein videos, particularly the Mozart one which showcases the dragon.  This dragon is not an exact replica of the puppet used in the show but it doesn't seem to matter to my one year old.  He loves this thing and we have a lot of fun laughing and playing with it.  He loves for me to mimic the same noises that the puppet does in the video.  I am very happy with my purchase.
