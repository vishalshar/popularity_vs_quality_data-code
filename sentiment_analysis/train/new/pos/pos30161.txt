I love this waterproof changing "pad", although I think the word "pad" is slightly misleading. It's more of a thin 2 or 3-ply cloth. The colored side is cotton and the white side is (I assume) polyester fleece. There must be a polyurethane coating affixed to the cotton/ fleece or layered in between somehow. I prefer the printed fabric version to the solid colors because the material is different. The solid colors, at least the two I have, are some sort of synthetic polyester or something like that.Changing pad covers are nice, but babies are messy. Especially at the beginning we would have been washing the covers ever day from leaks and unexpected accidents. These pads are effective at keeping anything underneath dry and clean, but small and thin enough to be washed in the sink easily and air dried quickly, which is exactly what we do. Sometimes we soil all three of them in a day, but they are clean and dry by the morning. We put these on top of our covered changing pad and rarely have to wash the cover. They are also great for diaper-free time anywhere, unless your baby is already moving a lot. In fact, that is by biggest criticism of the solid colors with the synthetic fabric; they are slippery and don't stay put when baby is having tummy time.
