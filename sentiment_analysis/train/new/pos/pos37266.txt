I ordered the carrier for my new granddaughter for use around the house, appointments, napping, etc.  The parents had a carseat that was excellent but very heavy and bulky--definitely not something to carry around and take in and out of the car.  Perfect size, nice and lightweight so is easy to carry; I like the handle and the little removable storage container on the back; washable padded cloth liner is nice.  The only thing that detracts from a 5-star rating is that the I would say the finish of the carrier is a little cheap--cutouts at the back have slightly rough edges.  However, everything that comes in contact with the baby is fine.
