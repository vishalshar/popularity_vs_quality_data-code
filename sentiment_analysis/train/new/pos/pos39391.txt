i would agree with other reviews I read that said this piece was not easy to assemble alone. The instructions were not hard to follow (downloaded from the product page on amazon) but some steps were very awkward without someone else to hold and align pieces. For the price I am satisfied with the quality of the product. It will get me through the two children I plan to have and will then be sold at a yard sale. Not something I will save and pass down to my child, but that's what I expected when I bought it. The storage underneath holds a ton of diapers (8 140 count boxes and the huge box of wipes). It arrived quickly when I ordered it and without any damage to the product. It perfectly matches the crib of the same line and color.
