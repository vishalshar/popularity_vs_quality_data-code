I have this mattress for both of my kids, almost 3 and almost 1 and have not had any denting that other reviewers mentioned. I love how lightweight it is, it is a game changer when you are changing sheets in the middle of the night, have a crying baby, or just don't want to hoist a 30+lb mattress around to put on a fitted sheet.  It is firm, which is how a baby mattress should be. While it is totally waterproof we do use an organic waterproof, cushioned fitted sheet underneath the regular fitted sheet to provide an additional layer between the fitted sheet and the 'plastic' feel.  This really helps. Also, no chemicals, no smells nothing.
