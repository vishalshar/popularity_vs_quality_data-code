This sling is just what we've been looking for and I wish we'd had it during the first 5 months. Unlike the big bath sponge we used earlier, this one is lightweight mesh fabric that lets the water and air pass through easily so it dries completely once you're done with no mildew smell to contend with.The incline is great because you can pour water on the baby's tummy and there's less chance of it pooling around her chin or getting in her mouth. It also allows baby to see what you're doing. We fill a big bowl with water at her feet and dip water out of that to soap up the washcloth and rinse as needed. Since the sling is inclined, she can watch us do each step.Also, since the Bath Sling folds into such a compact size, once it's dry between baths you can store it in a drawer, under the sink, or even take it in your suitcase for trips. It'd be nice if it were a smidge longer: we didn't get it until our baby was 5 months old and as we head for month seven, she's getting a little long for it, but we use it anyway and just let her legs extend a little more past the end.If you're debating bath products, skip the sponge (hard to squeeze water out, bulky to store, especially when wet) and get this sling. You can us it from birth to at least 6 months or longer and by then, some babies can sit in the tub without help, so you can get a lot of use out of it.
