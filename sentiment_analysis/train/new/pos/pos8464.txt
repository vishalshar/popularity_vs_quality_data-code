These along with my TotsBots Easy Fits are the best diapers Ive ever had!  So many cute patterns and so easy to use.  I love that the "inserts" pop out during the wash and I dont have to touch them if its just a pee.  They work GREAT! Ive had no leaks.  I cant even think of one con with these diapers!  Would STRONGLY recommend these to anyone.Experienced: Tots Bots, Swaddlebees, Fuzzibunz, BumGenius, Oh Katy, gDiapers, RumpARooz (These are nice too), Kushies AIOs, and Thirsties covers, pockets and AIOs.
