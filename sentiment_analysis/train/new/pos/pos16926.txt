My sister recommended I buy this after she used it several years back with her twins. At first I didn't want to spend that much money on a co-sleeper, but let me tell you, it is so worth it! Put this one on your registry!!!!PROS:-Allows your baby to co-sleep close to you but safely in their own bed-Tons of room for your baby-Safely straps to your bed-Weight capacity for top part is much greater than most co-sleepers and bassinets out there (It is very hard to find one that allows your baby to be in the top part for so long)-Has a removable and washable liner over the pad (I have washed many times and it still looks new)-Turns into a pack and play once your baby is not sleeping in the top partCONS:-Pad doesn't feel very comfortable although my baby doesn't seem to mind it-Doesn't work with all types of bed framesI highly recommend this to all Mom's out there!!! This has been one of the most useful things I have bought for my baby! I buy a lot of products on Amazon, and I rely on people's review before purchasing.
