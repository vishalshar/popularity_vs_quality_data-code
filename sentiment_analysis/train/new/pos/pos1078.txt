I disagree with whoever said that these are too thin for burp cloths.  They do look gauzy, but fold them over once, and they're thick enough to absorb most of my baby's spit-ups entirely, and (apologies if this gets graphic) even a single layer is effective at catching all the chunky bits in spit-up which can cause your clothes to smell.  I fear that the prefolds would be too bulky for me and not nearly broad enough.  I like the simple, large form of these diapers.I use these predominantly as burp clothes.  They are so absorbent, so effective, so economical, and so handy.  I have three packs, and I really needed them all when my baby was a newborn.  I keep a tall stack on my coffee table, and I'm always ready for errant bodily fluids.I also occasionally use these to wipe up all manner of spills.  They're extremely effective at drying dishes and wiping down counter tops.  In a pinch, they make great handkerchiefs for my runny nose when I'm out for a walk with the stroller.  I also fold them and put them in my baby's (all-in-one-cloth) diaper if I want to give it a bit more absorbing power.  Tuck one in the car-seat, another in your pocket, and lay one under your baby's head when she goes down for a nap.  They don't take up much room in the laundry, so you might as well use them liberally and keep the rest of your life clean and dry!
