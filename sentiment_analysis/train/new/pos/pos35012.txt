I purchased this item as a baby shower gift for my girlfriend. It's about the cutest darn thing you will ever see. It's very soft and the colors or true to the photo. It's a bit bigger than I thought but something that child can grow into. It's about the size of a sofa pillow that 16 x 16. It's well made and durable looking. If I had a kid, I would definitely add this to their collections. Unfortunately, all I have are the 4-legged kind of children and this definitely won't hold up to them. :)The vendor shipped this quickly with my other purchased item in this order. It arrived well packaged without the worry of damaging it when opening the box.Definitely recommend this to anyone with kids or to include in a shower gift!!!
