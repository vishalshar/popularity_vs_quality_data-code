A cloth book with activities for a young child. My grandbaby is now 7 months and she enjoys trying to read it. She will lie on her tummy and look at it and turn the pages. It is soft, washable, and she can chew on it when the mood strikes her. There is a story that can be read to the child and used to teach counting. A good purchase.
