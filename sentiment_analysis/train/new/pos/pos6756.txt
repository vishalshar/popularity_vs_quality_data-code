I love this stroller! You can do a lot of different things with it.  I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 9 month old.  My 3 year old some times want to sit in the front, and some times wants to stand.  I like having the option to remove the rear facing seat, so my 3 year old can sit in the back,or stand.  The rear facing seat is nice because my 9 month old likes to watch us and it is easier to give him a bottle or give him his toys or nuk.  You can also use your infant carrier in the front or back, and still have room for an other kid.  It folds down easy.  The under neath storage is very nice and you can fit a couple of bags under there (like bigger diaper bags and a small cooler.)Down side is that with the canopies and front tray, it doesn't really fit in the back of my Equinox.  If I remove the canopies and tray then it fits great. The canopies and tray are easy to remove and to put back on.
