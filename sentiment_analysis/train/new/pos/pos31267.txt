This pacifier chain is a favorite around our house. My five month old loves to play with it and  she can chew on the wood or look at the fairy. The wooden pieces are pretty tough and the paint doesn't chip at all, in spite of the chewing. The clip part of the chain is tough as well and my baby can't pull it off her clothes easily. That said, it also doesn't tear up her clothing, which is a pretty big problem I've had with other pacifier chains.The only thing that I think is a problem is that the fairy and mushroom are kept on a ribbon. The ribbon is fraying and looking a little frail and we've only had the chain for a few weeks. I also have the Haba "Heart" pacifier chain and I much prefer that one because it has a cord holding the chain together instead of a ribbon.My other complaint is that these are difficult to wash, but I've found that to be the case with any pacifier chain I've tried (and I have three kids, so I've tried a few.)
