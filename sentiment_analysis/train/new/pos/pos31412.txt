We just got this from Amazon and its so easy to use, and it kinda blends into the color of our stainless fridge so its not a total eye-sore in the kitchen. Its easy for adults to slide up the middle button to release the plastic string -- but definitely child proof for our 3-year old who loves to raid the fridge for snacks all day and night! :-)  (Our 8-year old, however, out-smarted this device!).
