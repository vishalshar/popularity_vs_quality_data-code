I spent a little bit of time looking for the perfect potty chair and this was the one that met my needs in my price range. The three in one combo and look were perfect (wanted something that looked like a real potty not a toy). The seat is a little small when on average toilets but it has worked fine both at home and outside the house. I think it would even fit on open front toilet seats.  My child is just 11 months old but is able to sit on the potty rather well. She is a little small for it but the side handles help to make her comfortable. What I wish this had that would have made me give it five stars would have been a seat more like their comfy seat. I didn't use the disc or potty wipes. I use cloth wipes and I didn't see a point in the odor disc when I dump it out and clean if after each use. I am really happy with the product!!
