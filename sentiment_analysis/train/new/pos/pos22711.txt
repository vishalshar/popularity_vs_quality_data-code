When my son was born, we tried sampling bottles from several different manufacturers, including Evenflo, Triflow, Avent, etc. Dr Brown's bottles really are the best in preventing gas, bottle leakage, and flow problems. We ended up throwing all other bottles away. I had read other reviews about the small parts being difficult to wash, but I don't really have a problem with that. We don't have a dishwasher and I end up hand washing everything. Each set of bottles comes with a tiny brush for getting into the small spaces for the inner parts to the bottles; and a regular bottle brush works fine with the bottles themselves. I can wash and fill 9 bottles in under 20 minutes (perfect timing when putting my son down for a nap). As to some reviewers complaints about leakage, it's true that if the inner tube gets full sometimes the milk can leak out the top - but this has only happened rarely and I've found that if I unscrew the cap and pull out the inner tube then put the tube back in (basically reassembling the bottle), the problem is resolved. The adjustment takes less than a minute and like I said, I've only had it happen once or twice. Otherwise the bottles, nipples and all the parts are really durable - especially the nipples. When we first bought the bottles, we bought all these replacement nipples in level 1 and ended up returning them because we never needed them. So, my only suggestions are1. hold off on buying extra nipples to see if you really need them (or at least don't open the package until you need to) and2. to bypass getting 4 oz bottles and go right for the 8 oz bottles. We started off with the 4 oz bottles and now, at 3 months old, our son is already up to 6 oz at a feeding. So, we had to pack away the 4oz bottles and go out and buy a bunch of the larger size.
