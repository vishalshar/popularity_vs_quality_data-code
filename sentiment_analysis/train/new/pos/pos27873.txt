Purchased two of these, one for my infant son and one as a gift. Fast delivery. The Tote 'n Glow elephants are lightweight so even my five month old son can move it if he wishes. Two volume choices, can be used as just the music, just the lights, or both together. The music plays for approximately 30 minutes, however the lights only stay on for maybe 5 minutes. Wish it was longer. The music isn't the usually obnoxiously loud lullaby that comes in other sound machines. At its loudest, it is still soft enough so that sleeping babies are not disturbed. The light is also soft, even when changing colors. Small and lightweight enough that we take it everywhere!  I wish the lights stayed lit longer because that's the part my son loves most.
