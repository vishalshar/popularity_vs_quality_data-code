this is one of the best baby items and most used by me. It makes diaper changes in public super easy whether it's on the floor, counter, baby change station, etc. I still use it now and my child is 18 months old and fairly tall for her age. The outside pocket makes a great pillow for her head (when you pack a change of clothes in it. The diaper case is nice and the diaper pocket can hold 6 or more diapers. I absolutely love it!
