I love the Angel Dear Sleep Sacks and purchased them in 3 different patterns. I own a few different brands of sleep sacks, and the Angel Dear are my favorite, mostly because of the zipper. It has a double zipper, so it will zip up from the bottom to the top and then snap at the top, but the other zipper can then zip from the bottom to the top for an easy diaper change, while leaving the top attached. Less undressing means easier diaper changes!The material is a lightweight, soft, breathable cotton. I did not notice any shrinking in the wash, and the one size fits all is pretty sizeable (little one is about 30" and still has room to grow in the bag). The zipper slides smoothly and I have not had any trouble with the zipper coming off the track.These are a great weight for use over cotton pjs in an air-conditioned house. Angel Dear also makes a double-weight sleep sack in identical patterns, with 2 layers instead of 1, which would be nice for the winter.
