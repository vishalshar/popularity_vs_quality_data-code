With my first child I bought ridiculously expensive bottles.  Between our house and the daycare we would loose a piece here and there, only needing to buy more and more pieces. With my second child I realized there is no point to buying over priced baby gear.  The "baby" year is over before you know it.  All you need is BPA-free products which are safe. You don't need "the latest and greatest".  It just doesn't make sense.  We have nine of these bottles and they have lasted more than 10 months.  Easy to use and clean.  For nine bottles I spent just over $20.  Amazing.
