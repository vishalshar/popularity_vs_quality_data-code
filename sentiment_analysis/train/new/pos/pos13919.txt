I know the Peacock is really popular, but I actually like this version better because with the legs you have more for the baby to grab & play with. I have the Peacock, the Giraffe and the Firefly, and it seems with all the crinkling (from the Firefly & Peacock) my daughter would become over-stimulated and actually would get upset after playing with them for a while. This one is a nice break from all the crinkling. The whole series is great though I can dangle them from her play mat, her car seat, her bouncy chair, and I can even get them to dangle from her jumperoo.
