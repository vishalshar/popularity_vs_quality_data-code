I have these on hand and have used them for my 3 kids (age 6 and under) on busy trips to the zoo, children's museums, and theme parks. I write my cell number on the inside and put it on the kids write or shoe. At first the kids didn't like them and would pull them off but my older kids keep them on. For my little one (2)I put it on his shoe. My kids know that if they loose me then should show their wristband to a mommy with kids.You can also put one on your stroller handle or diaper bag in case it gets lost.I have never needed to use it but I always feel better knowing my kids are wearing them. At the zoo last week my son lost sight of me and I could see him. I saw him holding his wrist band. He knew he had a way to get back to me and he didn't get scared.
