I bought these blocks for my 5month old and she loves them. She loves the jingle sound they make. They have very cute designs and she loves playing with the pop out wings on the bee. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I honestly think that there could of been more variety, They give you four blocks with basically two designs. It's a great toy for babies. She's already starting to lose interest in them at 6months, it would be best for 0-6months age. I wish I had bought them sooner. Overall, it's an great toy for babies.
