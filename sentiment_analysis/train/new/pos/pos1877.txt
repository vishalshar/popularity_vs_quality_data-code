These are our favorites of all the cloth wipes we use for diapering. We also use OsoCozy Unbleached Organic Flannel Baby Wipes 12 pack, which get holes too easily, and GroVia Cloth Wipes, 12 count, which are too thick to fit in our diaper warmer en masse.Here's how we use them:We fold these in half and they fit perfectly in our diaper warmer. We then fill the warmer with water so they stay warm and don't dry up. If we forget the water, the wipe on the bottom sticks to the warmer and we have to peel it off.They are easy to bleach and last longer than fleece wipes. Our daughter is six months old and we are only now starting to see signs of wear (they stretch out, get thinner).Each one has a big tag that we have to cut off.They have the softness of a tshirt material and are quite effective at handling all the waste matter they need too. They are also soft on her face.
