The link case makes my iPad mini look super cute! It's makes my iPad have the feel of a hardcover book. I love the magnetic closure and the fact that the screen turns off when you close the cover. I also like that it has a stylus holder. I'm a pink lover, and I love the color! Also, although this case is meant for landscape and portrait positions, it's a little annoying t have to switch to portrait position. When doing so, you have to literally take part of the case off (part covering iPad) and turn to portrait and stick it back on to the case. The case comes in 2 pieces and sticks together by Velcro. Also, when you want to take pictures, you have to unstick the covering case (iPad) from the main cover to be able to take a picture, otherwise, you'll have a pink obstruction in the picture. Oh yea the inside part gets dirty quickly. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase.
