These are terrific spouts that are interchangeable with all the NUK bottles.  I bought several of the Nuby sippy cups and bottles and was extremely irritated that none of them were interchangeable!!  There was older models that had different tops and different sized bottoms and my son didn't even really like them all that much.  So I made the switch to these and it was a good choice!  We are starting to transition off of bottle completely at 15 months and this spout has made that transition much easier.  My son likes these and I don't have the headache of trying to figure out what pieces go together, so everyone's happy!
