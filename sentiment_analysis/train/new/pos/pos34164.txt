I rented a hospital pump, the Medela Symphony, with the hope of pumping at work and on the road. I purchased this lighter adapter to go with the pump, and so far it works really well. I haven't noticed a decrease in power, and being able to pump in the car has really kept me pumping longer than I had originally planned.
