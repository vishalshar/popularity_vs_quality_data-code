This bag is very small- but well organized.  That is what I was looking for.  I needed something that would work for my little umbrella stroller that doesn't have a lot of space.  This bag is awesome.  The included changing pad is pretty small- so I just ordered a larger kushies changing pad to put in the bag.  I can actually fit quite a bit in this bag- bottle, snacks and small lunch, neat table toppers, spoons, bib, mini mobile, extra outfit, changing pad, keys, wallet, 4 pairs of foldable sunglasses, rash cream etc.  I really do love it.Things I might change would be offering a few more color options- like gray chevron or turquoise...bigger changing pad...and maybe the backpack straps.  They are a little awkward.  I see what the other poster was talking about and I'm not sure if I understand what the company said in the reply on how to fix this.  Although, I don't really know how you can carry so much in this that it would cause back pain.  I hang in on my stroller so it hasn't really been a problem for me.
