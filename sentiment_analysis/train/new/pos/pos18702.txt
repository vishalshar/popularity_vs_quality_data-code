I live in Western Pennsylvania and have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that I take daily on walks/runs.  My son is a year and a half and loves his daily walks/runs as well.  This is an expensive item, but if you walk or run daily it is well worth it.  I did read the reviews and was a little nervous about the zippers.  I do notice that my one zipper will get off track, but it is easily put back on track to keep my son shielded from the weather.  My son also refuses to wear gloves.  We went hiking this weekend with the temperature at 25 degrees and were out for over an hour.  With no gloves his hands were still as warm as if he was sitting in the house.  I also do not have to cover him with blankets.  I bring the stroller in the house from the garage about a half hour before I'm ready to go hiking to warm it up a little and then I go.  It comes with very little directions, but if you have common sense it is easy to put on your stroller.
