I spent a LOT of time researching play yards and finally went with this one. And I think it was a good decision.Good:* No cross-bars baby can climb* Door for my petite wife to be able to get in* White -- wife refused to have primary colors in the living room* Height* Good stability* Light-weight for storage* Expandability -- we added the two-panel expansion and it's the perfect size for our room, and even one parent.* Baby likes to lick it, so it must taste goodBad:* Takes a LOT of muscle to open and close. We'd hoped it would be a quicker, easier on-the-fly assembly. My wife can't do it.* Loud when open and close* Stable, but panels could be more rigid* No barbed-wire or electric voltage option
