All the fittings and hoses are very high quality and quite sturdy. As another reviewer mentioned, you do have to use the washers although the directions do not mention them. The handle itself is made out of plastic and seems a bit lightweight, but I haven't had any issues yet. I love the fact that there is a pressure control valve right on the handle.It came with everything you need to hook it up besides the wrenches. It even came with a new flexible hose for the toilet and thread tape. I really appreciate their attention to detail. I hate having to run to the store in the middle of a project!I had ordered Cool-Craft Toilet Bidet Handle with ** BONUS ** Rockin' Green Laundry Detergent Sample a couple weeks prior, but it broke the second time I used it. Returned it and purchased this one. I like this one a lot better because of the pressure valve on the handle.
