*Update: Baby is 3 months now and I'm making a lot more milk and can now use this pump on the highest setting with no problem! 10 ounces in 7 minutes! The bag it comes with is roomy and very convenient since I have to travel a lot. Easy to use/assemble & easy to clean.*I haven't used other breast pumps so I have nothing to compare it to, but this breast pump does exactly what it's supposed to and it comes with everything I need.The first time I used it I made a couple of mistakes, I wanted to get it over with as fast as possible so I put it on the highest setting. Also, I did it at the end of the day when my boobs weren't at full capacity. End result, I had less than an ounce of milk and my boobs felt like they were literally on fire for the rest of the night.A couple of days later, my newborn had started sleeping through the night so I was waking up in the morning with painfully engorged breasts. Unable to wake him I decided to try the breast pump at the lowest setting. I ended up with a good 4 ounces in about 10 minutes, 2 ounces from each breast, and my boobs felt relieved. Relieved my mind as well because now daddy has to take over feedings so mommy can get some rest!
