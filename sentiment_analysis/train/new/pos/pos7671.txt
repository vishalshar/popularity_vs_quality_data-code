I have purchased two of the pink Koala Baby portable crib sheets and one crib skirt.  The sheets fit the portable crib mattress tightly and held up well through the wash.  The crisp color faded a bit after washing and drying several times, but the color still matches the crib skirt well.  I would purchase this product again if in need.
