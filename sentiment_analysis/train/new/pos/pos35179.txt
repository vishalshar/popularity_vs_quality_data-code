From the moment I laid eyes on this beauty, I HAD to have it. It was the one & only thing diaper bag I ever imagined myself carrying.. just because the bag contains a bunch of things for my baby doesn't mean it has to look like it belongs to one. The tacky cartoon characters, plastic cheap looking material, etc.. this was basically the bag of my dreams. & when I finally received it in the mail, it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It is made of very sturdy stain resistant material, one of those bags that can be heavy as hell but the removable strap & handles definitely feel constructed enough to carry the weight without any rips or tears. I equally loved all of the extras that came with the bag, especially the matching clutch that is a very nice size & fits perfectly around your arm sitting underneath your armpit. I've had several compliments on the bag, it is even more beautiful in person. I will say I ordered taupe & the color I received definitely looked more caramel, but I liked it regardless.
