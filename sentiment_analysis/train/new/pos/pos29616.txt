our last one was in a car accident which lead me to have to replace it quickly. we went to the local Walmart hoping to find something similar for my now 4 year old. we left bummed as all they had that were for her size and weight was those weird ones with the flat back. I came back to search on amazon and looked at many brands including chicco which is a very reputable brand. the problem was the price. I don't want to seem stingy on spending money on something meant to save my daughters life (especially after this accident where I was t-boned on both our sides) but anything over $300 for a carseat is just out of my budget. I ended up looking up the same carseat we had (lx) and found this one (the DLX) and remembered why we loved it, the reliable safety and standards of Graco and the DOUBLE CUPHOLDERS. my decision was made and when my daughter saw her new carseat, she felt right at home. id recommend this carseat to anyone looking for a convertible carseat!
