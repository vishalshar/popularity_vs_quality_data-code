I carefully researched playmats before purchasing this Dwingular in "Dino Land." It's huge, great quality, and if you do some research, tests very safe for use. The colors are vibrant and bright. The pictures are clear and fun and the mat is sooo soft and durable. You can tell its high quality as soon as you unroll it and I love that it's double-sided! It reminds me of memory foam in a way.The box it comes in is about 5 feet tall and a foot wide. If you have the money, you won't be disappointed, as the quality is unparalleled in my opinion. I'm actually purchasing a second one in Fairytale Land so the entire area in our large jolly kidz versatile playpen is covered. Also, for me, the out of box smell was insignificant and gone very quickly. I'm guessing some people just have really sensitive noses... I rolled it out and it was in use immediately. My little one seems to enjoy it :)I just added some pictures of the mat 20 minutes after being un-boxed before we put it in the playpen and also a closeup to try to capture the vibrant, detailed design. (I focused on the "Dinorail" building and the iphone slightly blurs the rest)
