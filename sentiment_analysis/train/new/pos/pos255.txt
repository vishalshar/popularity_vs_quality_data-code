I have used a LOT of wet bags, as we have only cloth diapered, and never used a disposable diaper.  These are the very best.  They come in two sizes (I actually prefer the larger size, these days), are super easy to throw in the diaper bag, can squish to fit any corner, and contain the stink.  They wash up well, and only after about three years of nearly daily washing, have I needed to order more.  They give you the most bang for your buck, come in great colors, and are my very favorite wet bag.
