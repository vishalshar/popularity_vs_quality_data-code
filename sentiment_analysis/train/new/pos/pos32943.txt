My daughter sent me a picture of the Spongebob flip sofa. She was looking for a type of toddler size seat that she wanted as I was getting one  for my 18 month old granddaughter for Christmas. When she came across this flip sofa she ended her search; my granddaughter is absolutely infatuated with Spongebob! She found it at Baby's R Us for a very discounted price. When I went to purchase it online it stated I had to go to the store to get it. I began an instant chat with a customer service person from Baby's R Us and was told they didn't have anymore and wouldn't be receiving any more. The product was being discontinued by the manufacturer. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find it anywhere. I googled the item and found quite a few of them for sale, but Amazon had the best prices. My granddaughter LOVES it! Her mom brought it in the living room for her before she left for work. I hung out with my granddaughter for the day and for a great portion of the day she wanted to watch Spongebob on t.v. and sit in it. She pulled it out and layed on it. She was bugging me all day to sit in it with her. I finally had to give in and sit with her. I'm happy to say that the Spongebob Flip Sofa survived the experience and held its perfect condition. It's midway through January and I have not heard one complaint from my daughter. Thanks Amazon!!
