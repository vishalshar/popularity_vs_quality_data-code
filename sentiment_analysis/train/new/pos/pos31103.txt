Our 8-month-old daughter outgrew her infant carrier, and we needed a "big girl" car seat immediately.  I knew that we were going to purchase a car seat made by Britax because they are always consistently highly rated in crash tests and by other safety measures.  After reading reviews and checking out the Roundabout, Marathon and Boulevard seats in the store, we decided on the Boulevard.  I love the added protection the side-impact wings provide.  True, it is just about the most expensive car seat out there, but I believe it is well worth the price.The only drawback was that I found none of the fabric options particuarly appealing.  I finally settled on Brownstone because I believe it to be the least dreadful of them all.  I was surprised to find that it is not as bad as I had imagined.  It is extremely soft (almost has a chenille-like feel) and does not get too hot (even in direct sunlight).  There is also the option of ordering different covers, if I tire of this one.This car seat is pretty big, but it fits just fine in our Honda Accord (in the  middle of the back seat), and two normal-size people can easily fit on either side.  It was very easy to install using the LATCH system.  I have not had any problems or complaints.My daughter seems very comfortable in her new car seat, and I feel safe with her in it!
