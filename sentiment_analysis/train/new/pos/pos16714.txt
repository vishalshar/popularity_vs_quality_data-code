We got this for my 1 month old and it was so cute! I loved the rainforest theme and all the cute little toy attachments. The giraffe, tree and toy bar can all be moved around to different positions to keep it fun and exciting. There are also 3 toys, a toucan, some butterflies and a tiger that plays sounds. They toys can be moved around to different places as well with their Velcro straps like the toy bar, tree & giraffe. The tiger is the only toy that cannot be placed on a different spot because it's heavier and doesn't have a Velcro attachment. It also has a fun mirror, a ball you can spin and a leaf that can be lifted to show the animal behind it. I was really pleased with this toy at first but after a few weeks the giraffe & tree began to droop and now we can't really attach the toys to them without the toys touching the mat. I'm guessing it's why it was discontinued. If it wasn't for that I'd have given this 5 stars.
