"Caterpillar" was given to my son as a birthday present on his first birthday. It has since become his best friend, pillow, constant companion, and security blanket. There is something so sweet about the very hungry caterpillar, and this stuffed animal/headrest captures it perfectly. He demands to bring it everywhere he goes. We got a second one so we could wash "caterpillar" every once in a while without causing major trauma. But "other caterpillar" was soon discovered and is now also a permanent fixture in my son's life.
