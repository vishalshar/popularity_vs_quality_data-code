Purchased for my son's nursery - I also have the matching bedding and window valance. I placed the rug in front of his crib so it gets quite a bit of traffic. I have carpet in his room so had to purchase some double-sided carpet tape to tape it down, but otherwise I have been pleased with this purchase. The rug is very cute and so far holding up really well to all the traffic.
