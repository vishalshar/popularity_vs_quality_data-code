Very comfy chair! Bought for our nursery after much searching.Delivery kept getting delayed several times otherwise would have give five stars-  it took over a month to receive and after multiple emails from me to the seller in follow up-  delivery service needs to improve!!Material is a wheat-beige color and is velvet/suede like, which seems easy to clean and durable. Just like other reviewers said I'm able to sit in it while comfortably resting my head against the back which is a plus for when I'll be rocking baby to sleep/nursing etc. Bought with the matching ottoman which goes nicely with the chair.  The size is also just right- not too big that it overtakes the room, but sizeable enough to fit me or my 6 foot husband comfortably.Downside is that it seems to have slightly more of a "rocking" motion than a true gliding motion, and has a faint "clicking" noise when gliding in it. The noise is not loud though so not enough for me to decrease the rating.Overall, the chair fits our nursery decor perfectly, is comfortable, and we are very happy with the purchase!
