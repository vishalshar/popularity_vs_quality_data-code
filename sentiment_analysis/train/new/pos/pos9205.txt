My little guy loves his nap mat. If it's at home, he will crawl into it and snuggle like he's taking a nap. I searched a lot on Amazon to find a 100% cotton nap mat which was very important to me. I find the poly blends to be itchy. I searched many of the other nap mat makers, including Wildkins, Olive Kids to see if they were 100% cotton or not (sometimes this info was hard to find), and Bacati was the only maker I found who had 100% cotton.The mat is soft and washes well. It's not as thick as some of the other mats I see at daycare, but is more than sufficient, especially since they put the nap mats on foam pads.
