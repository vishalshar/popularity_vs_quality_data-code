The gate is sturdy and hardware mounted, so it can be used by stairs. Since it is so long, there is a little bit of "give" in the middle - it can be flexed out maybe an inch or two. My biggest gripe with this is that it is advertised as fitting openings up to 72". Our stairway is 74" but we figured that we could add a 2x4 to the wall to make it work. Not the most attractive option, but there are not a lot of gates this size that are also hardware mounted. Well, the gate itself is only 66" wide. The other 6 inches come from the allowance of 3" of screws showing on either side of the gate. So, yes it will fit a 72" wide doorway, but I felt it was a little misleading to not explain this in the description.
