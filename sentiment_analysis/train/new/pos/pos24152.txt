These bags are perfect for: messy clothes, dirty doapers, trash, and portable training potties.Pros:- I love the price and quality of these bags.- Perfect size (in the roll or container) to throw in diaper bag or glove box.- These bags fit both my Summer Infant and BabyBjorn potties. Which is perfect for travel in the car or when potty training (fewer Messes to clean).- quality is similar to the diaper genie brand small travel bags (these do not fit into the Diaper Genie travel container)Cons:- the "lavender" smell is not pleasant and seemingly strong.
