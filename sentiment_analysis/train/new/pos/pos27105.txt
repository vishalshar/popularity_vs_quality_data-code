We are travelling soon overseas which would require safety car seat for my son's car ride, so we will bring the infant car seat along with us, With this carrier it makes us much easier to bring the car seat with hands free when carrying luggages at the airport, etc. while my husband is holding my son. I wouldn't put my son in the carrier  he is  going to be 11 months and i don't think this carrier is designed for carrying  baby  in it.  we could have bought some similar products like a car seat  stroller but it costs  a lot more and unnecessary as  we no longer use this infant car seat for our car while he is getting little big. This is economical and ideal for travel i imagine.
