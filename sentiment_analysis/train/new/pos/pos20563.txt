This bib is great for my messy daughter (1 1/2 years old). Although the pocket doesn't catch much I've tried lots of options and this one is my favorite. The silicone ones with a big pocket are very stiff and rough on her neck but I love the full sleeves - we also use it for art projects. Just don't wash them in the washing machine because the waterproofing on the back can become ruined!
