I have had great results from this. A lot of folks comment that the suction cup does not work. It can work if you use a small amount of water to help the suction hold. I actually had to put some muscle into it so I could get it off my son's highchair table which is great because my son would just knock it off since he doesn't have good motor skills yet. Yes the music is somewhat loud; fortunately there is a switch on the bottom of the lady bug so you can just turn it off. More importantly my son LOVES it. He sits in his chair for a good twenty minutes spinning it around and that to me is a good amount of time for a four month old. And twenty minutes of spinning is twenty minutes of bliss for any parent.
