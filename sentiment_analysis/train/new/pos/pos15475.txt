This bottle system is answer for me! I have twins and time management is key and spending hours a day washing and sanitizing bottles is not what I want to do with any free time. The nipples are great, they are actually helping them latch better when we breast feed. The bags are very strong and not much more money spent then the Medela bags. The bottle casing is light weight and easy to feed the even started to hold them. I highly recommend this bottle system!!
