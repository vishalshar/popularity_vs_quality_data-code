At first I was worried it would be too small as I wanted a 7" ball. But it's actually a great size and I think it would be too heavy if it was larger because it's a nice dense material, very durable! My 2 boys, ages 3 and 1 love it!! I mostly bought it for my 1 yr old. He plays with it all day long since he got it. I was worried about the smell and the squeak but it's not an overly loud squeak or strong smell. Just right! The spikes aren't sharp either, but just enough for texture and grippiness. I love the color too. Definitely a big hit and worth every penny! I went ahead and bought a larger one too but honestly, 4" is really a great size. But I have 2 boys and they're kind of obsessed with toy balls and my son is always playing with one all around the house! He keeps gravitating towards this one though so I definitely am glad I bought it. All the reviews helped and are very reliable! You won't be disappointed!
