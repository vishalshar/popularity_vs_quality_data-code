I assembled the entire set through various sellers. There's a bird, hedgehog, squirrel, & bunny. They are all cute as heck.So here's the bad news. They run on Alkaline AG10 one use batteries. Yes, that means if you're lucky they will last the night. Alkaline AG10s sell for as cheap as one cent for a 10 pack on Amazon. You can purchase Silver Oxide AG10s for about a dollar a piece that promise to last five times as long. So I guess that means you will be changing the battery every 1-5 days. No easy feat as you need a tiny phillips screwdriver to open the battery compartment. You've been warned, cuteness can be a lot of work.
