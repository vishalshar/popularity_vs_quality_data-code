After receiving a couple of other stands, we were delighted that this one not only fit our basket, but was elegantly attractive.  A word of warning to other potential stand purchasers:  Since we had already purchased our basket, we had to find a stand that fit the basket. This turned out to be a little more difficult than we imagined.  I would suggest purchasing a stand from the same manufacturer as your basket to eliminate problems.  Our basket was 30 inches at the bottom which fit into the stand fine, but the sides sloped outward and just fit at the top of the basket.  We were able to lift the basket out easily without scraping the ends of the basket. (If it had scraped, we believed that would ultimately break apart the weaving.)  The stand was easy to put together.  Also, it looked great in my daughter's new, modern apartment.  The wood matched her light-colored oak flooring and looked beautiful.
