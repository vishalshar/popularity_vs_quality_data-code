I'm so happy I bought these!!  Our 2 year old just climbed out of her crib so we got her a big girl bed (full size).  She moves so much that I was worried about getting metal bed side rails but luckily I found these semi-circle bumpers.  It's been 2 weeks and no rollovers.  They are high enough (and long too) and there's no problem with your sheets fitting.  I stuck them under the waterproof mattress cover just in case there's a potty accident.
