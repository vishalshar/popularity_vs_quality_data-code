This is actually my second time purchasing this chair.  I bought one for my son back in 2008 and he loved that one until he was far too big for it.  So when I went to buy one for my infant, I decided to go with the same one.  The colors are super vibrant -- so much so that my daughter loves to smile and laugh at the big monkey the is just to her left.  The material is super easy to clean.  Everyday clean up involves a baby wipe or a wet face cloth  Any stains are pre-treated with a bit of blue Dawn liquid detergent and then I toss it into the washer. It is a lightweight material so it dries fast -- sometimes before I even get it out of the washing machine. The removable tray comes in handy for washing.  As for the height - as my kids get older, I lower the height down notch by notch so that they are able to climb in themselves as they get older.Edit: Forgot to indicate that it does come with a toy that suctions to the tray.  It is a little animal toy that spins. My daughter is apathetic towards it... too busy with the food but it is a cute extra!My middle child had the a variation of this one that had sea animals on it.  The first two that I purchased ended up being the only highchair I needed for each of my kids and I expect the same with the purchase of my third one.  We did travel with these highchairs as well (camping) and regularly used them outside and never had any issues.  Absolutely a product that I would recommend.  Well worth the money.
