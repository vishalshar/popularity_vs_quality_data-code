I never write reviews, but I was motivated to say something about this stroller because it has been the best thing we have purchased for the new baby. We have a 2 year-old and an infant, and this stroller is the only reason I have a chance of getting out the door during the day in the freezing winter weather. We call it the "sleep machine." I have the double seat attached up top with my 2 year-old (in a cozy stroller bunting), and the regular seat below, reclined all the way, with the infant in the Phil and Teds cacoon. It doesn't take up any more space than a single stroller, it is easy to maneuver (even with one hand) down narrow asles, and both kids fall asleep after walking only a few blocks so I can do my shopping in peace! Wow! I imagine it would be a pain to fold up and take in and out of a car since it is heavy and doesn't fold with the second seat attached, but that isn't an issue for us because we live in the city and walk everywhere. The sun shade is genius, and I love the pockets on the side. The foot brake is easy to use and SO much better the the old versions on the other Phil and teds strollers (we tested out the dash which is miserable!) It is also easy to pack a lot of stuff around. I have a diaper bag attached to the side and the rain cover in it's nifty little pouch on the other side. I have a carabeener clip for grocery bags on the handle, and of course there is the bottom compartment. I look like a bag lady after I'm done with the shopping, but I don't care because it all gets home without me breaking my back or having to pay for delivery. I just LOVE this stroller. The biggest con is the price. With all the extras, it is very very expensive. But I expect we will get a lot of use out of it and it is worth it so we all don't go stir crazy this winter.
