Sooooo happy and exited about my new nursing cover!!! I was looking online for several weeks for a nursing cover and also in stores and none really convinced me, either too pricy, didn't like the color, or they felt too big and overwhelming, specially the scarf like ones that are offered on the stores wouldn't work for sunny and hot days of summer in California. Then I found this lovely nursing cover made in India! I have bought skirts and dresses in the past and the fabric used in India it's just perfect! Lovely, fresh, airy, great quality, and long lasting, so I bought it as soon as I saw it online! When I received it and opened my nursing cover I was soooo exited to see the same great quality and fabric that I was used to! The design and detail were gorgeous and even better than in the pictures! Can't wait to use it and show it of! It's definitely worth the price (even cheaper than other covers offered out there). So if you want a beautiful, useful, and airy for hot days this is a great cover for you!
