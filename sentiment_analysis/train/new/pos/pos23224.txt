I was hesitant to buy this booster seat for my 18 month old son because of some of the negative reviews.  And I'm not one to read instructions, so probably like most everyone else, I stuck the seat on a chair and started clipping the belts around the chair thinking "how complicated can this be?"  Well, for some reason the belts come looped through the chair the WRONG way.  You have to take them off and thread them in the RIGHT way.  If you look at the pictures in the instructions it clearly shows the belt coming up from underneath and over the sides of the chair.  I believe a reviewer commented on poor design to have the child sit on top of a strap.  If they are sitting on the strap, then you did not install it correctly and the bottom strap will definitely be way loose, as this isn't how it is intended to go.  Once I took a minute to look at the pictures I realized how it is supposed to go and was able to get it attached very securely.  I will say, some of the buckles were a bit challenging to tighten, but once it's on, you're good. Unless you plan to take the seat on and off frequently it's not an issue.I am very pleased with my purchase.  I think this seat will be very easy to clean and it blends in so well with our brown furniture.  It is so soft and cushy too.  My son was thrilled to sit in his big boy chair for the first time!
