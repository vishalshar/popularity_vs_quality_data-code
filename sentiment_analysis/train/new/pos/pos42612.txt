We bought this washing machine for cloth diapers and baby clothes because we live in an apt in NYC and couldn't fathom washing our baby's stuff in a nasty laundromat. Our apartment is also small so this washing machine fits perfectly. We built a small furniture dolly to put under it so we could wheel it to the sink when we wanted to wash, and wheel it away to store it in the corner when it is not in use, which is extremely helpful. So far we love the washing machine - works really well, is quiet and cleans the diapers well. The sanitize setting is quite long though, like 90 minutes and we wonder how much water it is using (seems like an awful lot). I hope our landlord doesn't get mad for all the water this machine seems to use!!! That is why I didn't give it 5 stars - because I'd be curious to know if it is water efficient or just energy efficient. Otherwise I'd highly recommend it!
