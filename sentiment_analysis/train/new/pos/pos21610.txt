I've been searching for a reclining glider for very long time. The only one that was in affordable price range was the one in Baby R Us, but even that whole set would cost me around 550 with tax. It's just way too much for just a glider that you might not even use anymore after your baby grow up. I saw this glider on amazon, but was not sure that the size will be good enough for me, as I am 5'9 and my husband is 6. By the description this model is definitely much smaller than the one in BRU. But I was very pleasantly surprised that it actually is very spacious. For those who are interested the seat from inside is 20*19, and the back rest height is 30. the color is just like on the picture, maybe slightly bit darker... The material is a little rough in compare to the material on other models, but it's not bothering me at all. So far can not say anything about durability, as just set it up 10 minutes ago. But it's definitely very easy to assemble, I just did it myself, without waiting for my husband to come back from work, as I was way to curious to see the product, and I am 9 month pregnant)Overall, definitely suggest it for those who do not want to pay too much for a good glider with reclining feature. And believe me, i have looked for such a long time, it barely exist on the market.
