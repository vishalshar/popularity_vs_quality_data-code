Obviously great for cold weather!  I purchased this for my son when we lived on the East Coast.  Those cold, wet winters are miserable and taking an infant in and out of a car seat to put a warm jacket on is too much work!  Also, it's impossible and unsafe to place your child in a carrier in a bulky winter coat. I purchased this and he was so snug in his carrier there was no need to take him out or worry about jackets, etc.  I highly recommend this.  Also, it is very easy to use.  Just place the Bundleme in the car seat and pull the straps through the slots.  The lining seemed so cozy and he wasn't fussy with having hot bulky clothes on.  Also, the Bundleme is machine washable and is so easy to wash and throw in the dryer.
