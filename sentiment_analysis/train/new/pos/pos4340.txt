I am very happy with this sling.  I am a new mother and I was searching for something that would be comfortable for my baby, comfortable for myself and easy to throw into a diaper bag.  This was the answer for me.  I tried another sling that my baby was comfortable in for a few minutes before she slid and got lost in the fabric (that item was also bulkier).- I did call the New Native Company to help me determine the correct size for me (that is very important).- And when I first got this product I was a bit frustrated, I thought it wouldn't work.  After several trials and errors (and a bit of crying from the baby) we got it to work.  Now she calms down almost as soon as I get her into the sling.  She loves to be held and my arms were getting very tired.  Now I can move around hands free.- I use a receiving blanket folded up behind her head to give her support and help her from getting lost in the fabric.You might find this sling frustrating at first but stick with it because it really works.
