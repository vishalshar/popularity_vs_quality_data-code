This is a great, simple product. I can remove plug covers most of the time, but it does a number to my fingernails. And, manual removal makes me want to install looser plug covers that while easier for me to remove, are also easier for my daughter to remove.Enter this product. It clips to the vacuum hose (though not very well - the little plastic prongs on the cord clip are a bit sharp) and removes even the tightest covers with ease. And, this eliminated the temptation for me to use a screwdriver to remove the covers (metal + electricity = bad).
