We bought the Fisher-Price My Little Snugabunny bouncer for our twins on the way. Once they arrived we realized we needed two bouncers instead of one. Since we didn't want to spend another $50 for another Snugabunny, we bought this one instead. It cost 50% less and worked out better for us. The vibrate doesn't have an automatic shut off after 10-15 minutes like the Snugabunny, it's either vibrating or it isn't. I'm sure some people prefer the auto off, but we don't. Our babies are able to sit up much better in this bouncer versus the Snugabunny because the seat cradles the baby more like a chair would if it was tilted backwards. The seat of the Snugabunny is roomier and sits baby more hammock style than a chair. That wasn't as much of a problem for our bigger twin, but our littlest tended to slouch down and curl up in a ball per se. Both prefer this chair over the Snugabunny and we could have bought two for the price of one. The toy bar is a poor design.. We took it off fairly quickly because the toys are made of hard plastic and would knock their head and/or body. It needs to be revised in height and material of toys. A soft toy like on the swings would work out better, but for $25 the chair minus the toy bar is okay with us!
