I have purchased 5 of these blankets. One for my sister's baby, and 4 for me. I have twins and wanted a blanket that had satin on one side. They are hard to find and if you do they are expensive. This is a great buy/find! I bought the first one and washed it. I was very pleased with it even after washing. I did hang dry it just incase. I ordered 3 more. 2 as a back up when the first 2 either get lost or too worn. I have washed them at least 4x now and they still feel the same.
