My little guy was soaking through his cloth nappy, pajamas and sheets at night.  I decided to see if these would solve the problem and they work amazingly well.  I put one inside his regular cloth nappy.  It soaks up all of the extra fluid and since using them we have not even had a wet spot on his pajamas.  I highly recommend.
