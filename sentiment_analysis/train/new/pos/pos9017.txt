Eliana is 3 months old and just now she's starting to enjoy this procutc in its full ansamble. Any baby younger than that would not have the neck and core control to maintain balance wile in the activity center to make use of her/his arms to play with the different colorful attachments, so "stage 1" ansambly would be preferable.Safety: I am very satisfied. None of the objects have sharp edges or detach from its position; even after some serious hard pulling. And all the little noice making thingys are well enclosed in their capsules, so no chocking hazard.Cleaning: My only problem with this product was the complexity of taking the floor matt out to be washed. When the product is put together on "stage 1", babies lay on the matt to play with the hanging fishes and other stuff. But Eliana spits up alot, so I would have to wash it every week, and I would have to pull the base totally appart to get it in and out.When product is on "stage 2", taking the seat appart for washing is very easy, and since the other surfaces are all plastic, you can just wipe them out.Travel: This product is very easy to travel with. I whish they would provide a bag or cover to put it in, since you have to take almost all of the attachments out inorder to get is as compact as possible.OVERALL: I love it. I would've given it 5 stars if not for the cleaning issue.
