Our daughter is now 2.5 years old, so we no longer use this spoon.  But when she was younger this turned into an invaluable and essential part of our feeding routine.  When our daughter started on the first cereals, feeding time got real messy really quickly.  She was too young (and wiggly) to sit upright in a high chair, so the process originally was holding the baby, having a bowl of cereal nearby, and then trying to feed her by scooping cereal with a spoon, getting it near her mouth, and trying to have her eat it without kicking over the bowl (or us knocking it over) or dump over the spoon, etc.With this spoon, we would make the cereal, load it into the reservoir, pick up the baby, and simply feed her by squeezing small amounts of cereal out to the spoon when it was close to her mouth.  Much simpler, much cleaner, and a much more fun task than trying to wrangle the bowl-and-spoon-and-wriggling-baby circus.We have also started giving these out as shower gifts to expectant parents, and have gotten universally enthusiastic feedback as well.  This is a small solution to a small-ish problem, but it made our lives much easier when our daughter was young, and we highly recommend them to new parents.
