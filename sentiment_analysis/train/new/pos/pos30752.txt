I wanted to get this for my son as soon as I saw it in a store, before he was born. I saved it for his first Christmas when he was just 3 months. Now that he is 2, he loves it more than ever. He brings it to bed, carries it around, and sings to his "baby". He prefers it without the peanut shell, but I suspect it's just a phase. It doesn't have bells and whistles but it's soft, just the right size, and oh-so-sweet. It's nice to have a toy that kids can play make-believe with instead of just being entertained by, and he likes it just as much as a character he'd recognize (like Elmo). It would make a great gift, for a relative, friend, or for your own child.
