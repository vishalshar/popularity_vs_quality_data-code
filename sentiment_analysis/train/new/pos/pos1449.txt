I love this! I had a friend who need something like this for a weekend. I told her about it. I said if she bought I would buy it from her, as I needed one for my trip. She loved it so much that I had to buy my own.We took this on our trip.We knew we were going to get a rental car and didn't want to carry 2 carseat's through an airport again ( done b4 it sucks doing so) I thoroughly looked into this product. The carseat.org people said that this is legal and safe to use in vehicles when used right. It is handy when your child wants to have a play date no need to undo carseat's. Also nice for trips to Grandparents..
