These are soft enough to cushion an impact to a falling child's head, but firm enough to crawl/walk on without deforming completely. They are light, the finish is easy to wipe clean, and they look good. We have a hardware floor and got these in preference to anything primary colored. While these are noticeably different to the hardwood floor, when you walk into the room they don't jump out as gaudy. I'm very happy with the look, feel and finish of them. They fit together well, but not seamlessly.We got 26 tiles for $40, which I feel is a good deal. I'm only giving this 4 stars rather than 5 because they don't include the edging pieces, and charge an additional fee for the edge and corner pieces of almost $5 each, which makes the edges three times more expensive to buy than the other pieces that are much larger. Edging the 6x4 piece mat we made would cost more than 3 times the mat price, which is just silly. (It's a question for their marketing folks, but I doubt it relates to manufacturing cost.) I'd also like to be able to buy an extension pack of, say, 10 more tiles to make it a 6x6 piece mat, but alas, no such option seems to be available.All in all it's a good buy, and I'd recommend them. I might even buy another complete set of 26 just to be able to extend it. I won't be buying the exorbitantly priced edges and corners though. I'd take a Stanley knife to the ones I have first and make a linear edge myself.NOTE: These tiles smelled very strongly of VOCs when we received them, and we had to let them gas out for a few days to let the smell dissipate enough for us to use them anywhere near our child. 3 days was enough. Don't expect to use these immediately upon receipt.
