These bottles were lifesavers! For the first 4 months I used Dr Brown bottles for my little one. She gagged a lot, suffered through reflux and it was a pain to wash those bottles every day!After I got these, it took less than few seconds to put everything together. My baby loved the wide nipple and I loved that there is no washing involved. Extremel hygenic. I also pumped exclusively and used the liners for milk storage. It was definately a new mom's dream come true. Couldnt beleive it took me 5 months to discover these.. Just by chance when I googled 'Tired of bottle washing'!!
