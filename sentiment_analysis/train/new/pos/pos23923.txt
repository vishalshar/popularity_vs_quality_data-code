We have a large sleigh-like convertible crib for our son with sides much thicker than what's pictured in the Amazon shop page and he was literally chewing through the varnish and into the wood.  We were concerned for his health and immediately purchased these.  Both the sides and the front cover fit perfectly and add a bit of cushion to the hard, wood edges of the crib.  He is no longer chewing the crib and he really seems to like the feel of the rail cover.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR TEETHING BABIES!
