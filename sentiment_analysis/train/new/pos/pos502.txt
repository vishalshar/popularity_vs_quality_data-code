I bought this product form amazon.com 4 months ago before my baby was even born. It took me this long to write a review because I wanted to be sure I can give this product a fair assessment.First off, we do not use this product as an on-the-go-changing pad for public bathrooms. We use the Skip Hop Pronto Changer Diaper Bag for that.  We originally bought Sassy as an on-the-go-changing pad but we've realized it's too thin and too small and won't really protect our baby in public bathrooms.We use the Sassy changing pads at home to change poopy diapers (not really needed for just wet diapers).  As first time parents, we have awkward moments, accidents happen, and sometimes poop gets into the changing pad.  We have a couple of reusable, washable, fabic changing pads but our baby poops 2-3 times a day and 2 of these washable pads aren't enough unless we want to do laundry everyday (or buy more of this). So we started using Sassy changing pads when our baby poops and it's been perfect! If the poops gets on the changing pad, no problem, just throw it out with the diaper. The thinness and small size doesn't really matter since we only use it under the baby's bottom half since we're using it at home, and not at a public bathroom.I give it a 5-star rating because it's just perfect for what we use it for.
