First time mom- and I cannot tell you enough I LOVE THESE BOTTLES.Brought my preemie home from the hospital and she was used to the medela pump bottles by then. We used those for the first few months, but as she got older and drank more, she began spitting up constantly and we were going through gas drops like crazy.I had a family member STRONGLY recommend these bottles to me, in fact, she just ordered some to my house. She was that sure that we would love them, and we absolutely did. Within just a few days, we had put the gas drops to rest. I ordered several more and they are now our favorite bottle.I also really love that they come with their own cleaning brushes to get inside the narrow tube. This brushed has proved exponentially handy in cleaning my pump parts as well, especially the piece that hooks into the flanges.Would definitely recommend for a fussy, gassy baby!
