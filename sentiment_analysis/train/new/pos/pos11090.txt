Bought these pacifiers on a whim in hopes that my infant would take to them. We tried the advent soothies and the puller style with no luck. Finally had success with the nuk brand. So pleased to have a style that the baby would take for those moments as a nursing mom where the baby just needs comfort. With more than one child to take care of, it's harder to spend the day comfort feeding when your toddler is getting into mischief or desires a little more attention. Thank goodness there was a option out there that our baby likes.Love the price and the multiple packages. You can never truly have enough pacifiers scattered around the house. The puller is large enough to slide over my fingers so I don't have to handle the nipple with my hands when I'm trying to juggle multiple things at a time. Super easy to clean and love that the silicon tends to not pick up as much lint when dropped on a blanket. In a house with animals it's a huge plus!
