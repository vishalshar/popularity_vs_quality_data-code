I like the item however I don't think the description of the purchase is entirely clear. The description states, "5 soft, fabric discovery cards with cover featuring crinkle" which is true, however I feel like it needs a little clarity: "With cover featuring crinkle" means only the red card with the number 1 and dog on it has the crinkle feature. All the other cards are soft. Secondly, while the description says there are five cards, the picture shows 6. I didn't even notice it until writing this review, but in case you are expecting 6 based on the picture, you're only getting five. The caterpillar is colorful and cute although my daughter (just over 3 months at the time of this writing) hasn't started to really play with that as much as the cards. She seems to like them and especially the crinkle feature. We go through them together at least once a day and the little sprinkling of Spanish and French translations is a fun twist. I like that there is an element of learning associated with this toy, and certainly simple enough (one word/picture per card) to play with a baby and hold their attention for a short time. The ring is slightly open between the caterpillar's head and the green end, so you can attach this to a baby gym or other item that allows for rings. It's too big to attach to the Fisher Price sit-me-up fabric ring but fits the Fisher Price jungle friends mat well.
