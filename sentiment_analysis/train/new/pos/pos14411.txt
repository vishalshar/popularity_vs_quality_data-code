We like this stroller.  It seems to be pretty durable, and its weight and portability (shoulder strap) make it ideal for trips, especially in airports.  My husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall (6'4"), but it is fine for me (5'3").  We like it for our 5-month-old son because he is able to recline, but still sit up enough to watch what's going on.  He can hold his head up well but isn't sitting up unsupported yet, so the various levels of the reclining back are nice.  Overall, a good stroller for the price.
