I bought the set of balls after realizing my baby was in need of having some Balls to play with, and these received decent reviews.  When I received them, I was surprised how cheap they looked (no offense, Playskool).  I know if I received these as something to play with, I'd be looking for something else.But my kid loves 'em.  We put it in the exersaucer with him, and he goes for the balls and tends to ignore the exersaucer activities.  He especially loves the one that has the pop up from the top.  And the other ones are fun to play with him...with.If the Playskool Busy Balls were a person I was dating, there may not be instant chemistry, but once you get to know them, you get to love them.
