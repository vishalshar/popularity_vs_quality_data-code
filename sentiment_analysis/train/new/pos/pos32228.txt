This jogger is wonderful for walking on trails, but not so good for jogging because the wheels "shimmey" unless you have them in the locked position. When they are in the locked position you can jog well if you are only going straight, otherwise it is really tough to turn because of it's width. I have found trails a little easier than the street. It has many features that the more expensive ones don't have, like adustable footrests and backs, an air pump, and a rain gaurd. It's very easy to manuver when walking. We had one problem and the seller was very quick about sending us the piece. It has held up well for a year with plenty of use for our now 3,2, and 1 year olds.
