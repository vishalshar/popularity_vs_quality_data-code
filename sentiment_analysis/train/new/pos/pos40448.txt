Let me start with this... we were on the verge of setting our high chair on fire and dancing around the musty, stale milk smelling smoke.  We hated it.  We were in a pinch and bought it used and now we know why the couple, who had babies, was getting rid of a chair that they could still use.  Anyone with the older Polly knows the frustration of watching your kid wipe his/her cereal-covered milk-catcher on the cushion.  It would happen in slow motion and I my inner dialogue would sound like Darth Vader watching Luke get electricuted: "NOOOOOOOOO!!"This brings me to my search for a cover.  The Polly is fairly big and many reviews for some covers mention that they won't fit large high chairs.  Dang.  After some research, I found this cover but I wasn't sure if it would actually fit.  All I could go off of was the picture and it seemed like it was on a chair that had similar size and shape.  So I took a leap of faith and bought it.  I'm glad I did.Shipping was actually faster than expected by about a week.  Not sure if this is the norm and probably varies by how how long it takes to get through customs.  Still long, but worth it.The product is awesome.  It fits well and goes on and off easily.  It doesn't do anything to protect the straps but thats ok.  It has great coverage and looks like it was made for the chair.  All but the worst messes actually just wipe off, so we only need to wash it occasionally.We love it and I'm sure you will too.
