We desperately needed new swaddles when our 3 month old baby kept breaking out of his old small ones so I ordered these. They have been great. The blankets are nice and soft and our baby loves holding them, rubbing the blankets on his face and chewing them. They've also been very useful as cover ups for nursing and for covering his car seat/stroller when outside in the winter. As for swaddling the size is perfect. Our baby is 16 lbs and these cover him with no problem. They are quite delicate though as my husband tore one while attempting a super tight swaddle and the baby wore one of the blankets thin from kicking at it while swaddled. Also, the baby still broke out of these swaddles but we found that double swaddling has worked wonderfully. Now we first swaddle him in his old too-small flannel swaddle which pins his arms well and then swaddle him again in this muslin swaddle. He hasn't been able to break free from this and has slept so much better because of it. Another note though is that it is the middle of winter and this combo is very warm. Not sure how it would work in the summer.
