I bought this as a secondary car seat to use while traveling, specifically on an airplane, because my daughter's primary seat has non-removable armrests that make it too wide to fit on one. It worked great on the plane, and in the rental car when we got to our destination. It is light enough to hang off the back of the stroller while racing through the airport (as long as you leave the baby in the stroller) and a great, compact size, even rear-facing (which is how I used it) for small cars. My daughter is also very comfortable in it, and we now use it as a secondary seat in my husband's pickup, and it is easy to put in/take out, which we have to do every time we use it in his truck because it is a work vehicle. Adjustment of the strap height was very easy, and only took a few minutes. However, the button/strap used to adjust the tightness of the straps is a bit hard to use in the rear-facing position. You have to be careful not to pin the strap between the car seat and the vehicle seat when you're installing it. The button you push to loosen the straps is hard to reach, however, no matter what you do. I imagine this is not a problem forward-facing. Also, once you get the button pushed, the straps adjust easily. We have had some issues with the straps twisting and it is a pain in the butt to have to fix them 50% of the time I put my daughter in the seat.
