After A LOT of research, both online and in stores, I settled on these kick mats from Freddie and Sebbie. I couldn't be happier!!I was originally looking into Britax, Brica, Prince Lionheart, Munchkin, and Summer Infant brands. I found all of these (except Prince Lionheart) to be too busy for our needs after realizing that my three year olds feet often plant themselves near the top of the seat. I thought the pockets would be a nice draw for her, but then pictured them just being in the way. They may be great for a younger, less active kid, or an older one who understands to keep their feet off the seat, but not for ours right now! As for the size.. we just got a 2014 Acura MDX, and these covers fit the seat perfectly; not a piece (that she can reach) is exposed. The kick mats come in a pack of 2, so we put the other one in our Infiniti sedan, and it also fits great! Now she can rest her feet comfortably, and our seats are fully protected. I honestly didn't think we were ever going to need these, and was hoping she would eventually listen to our demands, but then I imagined my feet just dangling around with all the blood rushing to them; it's no wonder she prefers to kick them up every now and then! And now she can kick them back on these awesome mats any time she wants! Oh, and we have yet to take advantage of this offer, but these mats also come with a Lifetime Guarantee! They are the only brand I found that provides this benefit.I found the Amazon reviews to be extremely helpful and, if you're in the market, I hope this one is helpful too!
