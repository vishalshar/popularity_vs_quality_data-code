Though expensive than most other washcloths in the market, I highly recommend aden+anais washcloths for babies. These washcloths are supersoft on babies skin, and retain their shape well after multiple washes.As an enthusiastic new mom, I bought 2 packs of the carter's washcloths as well. The terry washcloth is no comparison to these muslin ones, just a waste of money. I use the terry's now to wipe away baby's spit and drool.These washcloths are the right size, and I see this will last me through my baby's toddler years as well. Very durable and has held up well after umpteen washes. To avoid pilling while washing, I run it on a cold wash & rinse cycle. Tumble Press Dry on a low/delicate setting.  If you want the best and softest washcloths go for the A+A ones.
