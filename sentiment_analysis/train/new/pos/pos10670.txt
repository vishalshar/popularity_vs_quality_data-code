I was having a tough time solving the seating issue for my toddler at our dining table. I have tried many different booster seats, but they either do not fit right on our chairs or my child. I was fed up because she is a small 3 yr. old and though she wanted to be able to get in the chairs herself, she had too many close calls to be injured. I absolutely love this chair, it is very sturdy and she is able to climb in and out, as well as easily maneuver herself to sitting comfortably. She no longer argues about staying seating until the meal is finished and I am able to allow her to be unbuckled, though it is nice to have that feature available. It is very easy to assemble and a little work to adjust seat levels, but I feel more secure knowing she cannot slide them out herself.*UPDATE*My now, near 4 year old still uses at every meal. This is a very sturdy chair as I have had plenty of bigger adults sit in at my table while chatting with my husband (not sure why they always choose the little kid chair). I have attached the front bar a few times to use while baby sitting my neighbors 1 yr old and it works great there too (with buckles of course). I love that my daughter can go potty or get a drink and we don't have to help her and she loves her independence. My only complaint is watch your toes, we have at the end of our table to give her more room to move it and we constantly stub toes on the legs mostly because it blends well so we forget it's nit a regular chair. The pad do not sit very well, so I put a piece of rubber mat (cupboard lining stuff) under to keep it from shifting.
