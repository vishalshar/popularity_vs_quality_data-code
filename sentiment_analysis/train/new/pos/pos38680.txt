I've had this for only a day; but, so far, it is working well.  I'm using it to warm adult disposable washcloths/wipes for my elderly mother.  The wipes are a little big for the unit, but they just fold up on the sides by themselves.  After waiting several hours before using, as instructed, the wipes are pleasantly warm.  The instructions state that 1/2 cup water should be added as more cloths are added and to add 1/2 cup water if the cloths begin to dry out.  My mother is already appreciating the warm cloths.
