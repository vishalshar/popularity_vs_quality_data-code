This is a high quality stroller. Many strollers that my fiance and I contemplated buying had a plastic construction, just the same as the cheap ones. This stroller is in a class all by itself. It is made of steel. All stitching and padding is flawless and super high quality. I do wish it came with a few cupholders and a place for a cell phone but it is WELL WORTH the money. I belive that this stroller will last a very long time. I'm very happy I spent the extra money and bought a Hauck!
