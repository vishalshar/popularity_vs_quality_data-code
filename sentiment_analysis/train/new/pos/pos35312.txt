I ended up giving half of this stuff away because didnt need it or use it. Oops! The bed skirt seems a little long and it kind of hangs up in places. It does not fit our crib flush like the picture shows. We also don't have near that much white showing, not sure how they did that. The yellow bed sheet is almost too small. We ended up going to the store and buying another spare because you have to literally stretch this bed sheet out as far as you can just to fit our mattress. Beware if you have a mattress with a changing table attached. One side of our crib is a solid plank to accomodate the changing table on the other side.We were not able to use one piece of the bumper because of that. It would not tie or fit that part of the bed correctly. I would have been better off only buying the bumper and the bed skirt. We used one of the window valance but not both. It has held together for 2 years though, which is nice. It is definitely good quality, just probably wouldn't need the entire bundle if I were going to order it again.
