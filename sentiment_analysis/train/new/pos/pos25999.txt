My daughter has loved this from about 4 months on and she is now 10 months and still enjoys it a little.  One day though I heard her whining, felt it was typical, only to discover her wrist had got wrapped up in the string you pull to get the green toy to spin.  It was blue...thank goodness I checked to see what the fussing was about!  So just be aware they can get their hands or fingers wrapped up in that string when they are little.  This doesn't happen now that she's older.
