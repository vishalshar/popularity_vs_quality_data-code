I purchased this for our nursery and LOVE the colors. Our little one hasn't arrived yet so I can't comment on the quality of the set over time. However, I was disappointed that the bumber cover is not removable. The bumpers are supposed to air dry so I anticipate this will be a problem when the baby is napping (the bumper will take a considerable amount of time to dry).  You may want to purchase a back up if this bothers you. Also, this is a discontinued set. Therefore the other accessories in the picture are no longer available (window valence, etc). Just something to keep in mind.
