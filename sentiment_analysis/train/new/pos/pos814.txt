I absolutely love this product! I always keep some handy in my purse-people always ask where I got these! They are easy to use and stay stuck-easy for an adult to get up but not your infant/toddler. These can totally take the place of plates for littles. Great for gross outdoor tables. restaurants, art projects and more!! I also always give these as baby shower presents. The picture is from Disney Land, we take these things everywhere.
