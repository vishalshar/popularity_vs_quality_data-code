We got our diaper bag a few days after we placed our order! When it arrived my Husband and I were quick to open it, We were thrilled! It's a large bag, It comes with a easy to clean changing pad (that was a surprise to us)It has 10 pockets so there is plenty of storage space! The only thing that we would change is to have a larger opening for the main pocket. It will work just fine but it does not open as much as you think it should for the size of the bag. All in all we were both happy with the bag and would buy it again!!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We have had this bag for 9 months now and we still love it just as much as we did when we first got it! After a while you get use to the opening and it is not a problem. This is a really great diaper bag!
