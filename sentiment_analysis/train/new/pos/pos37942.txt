These are GREAT!!! I got them for my 4mo. old grandson to get his spoiled self out of glamma's arms for some tummy time, and HE LOVES THEM TO!!! Not to mention his overprotective momma, (my daughter)!!! I am asthmatic so I HATE SMELLS, so my only worry was are they going to have that TOXIC smell!!! NOOOOPE, Thank GOD THEY DIDN'T!!! They are 2 feet EACH so until I move next month they are perfect for this tiny apartment! I plan on getting at least 2 more sets after we move!!! One for the basement, and another for the living room so I can just have them wherever we are!!!
