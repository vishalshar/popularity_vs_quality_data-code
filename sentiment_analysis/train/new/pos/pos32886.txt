I didn't buy these for the tri-flow feature. I just needed a faster flow nipple for my 9-month old daughter, and these happened to be the least expensive. I love the angled shape, and these are the only bottles with nipples that my daughter doesn't completely collapse. They work great in that she's able to get more milk, (and she actually drinks more now that she has better bottles). My only complaint is that they leak a little around the top of the ring that goes around the nipple, but it's not too serious. It leaks while I'm mixing the formula and sometimes a little when I first start feeding her, but after that it's fine.
