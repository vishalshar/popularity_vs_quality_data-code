These training pants are absorbent and cute as they can be.  My son loves the interchangeable pads and picking which one will go in the pants.  They've been instrumental in using the "you don't want to wet on the foxes/hedgehogs/letters" method of motivation!  They also fit very well under pants and are soft.  No crinkling plastic sounds at all.  However, there are two design flaws I feel I should mention.1.  There are flaps that cover both ends of the pad and these flaps are -not- water proof.  They wick up any urine and pull it straight into the front of the training pants waist band, avoiding the liner and soaking through the pants.  I recommend these once you are down to just rare accidents.  I have tried putting the flap under the liner and while that has helped "some" of the leaking into the waist band...it makes complaint #2 worse.2. My son occasionally complains about the flap over the liner irritating him or feeling funny. When I place the flap under the liner, the snap that holds the liner in place risks becoming exposed when my son pulls the trainers up on his own.  The liner will roll without the flap covering it and must be hand straightened.  When the liner rolls, the snap is exposed as well as creating discomfort for him.
