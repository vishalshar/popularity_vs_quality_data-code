I am very pleased with this bed. With four grandchildren under age two this is exactly what I needed. I originally looked at porta-cribs but found that they are not recommended for children older than one.As a 60+ grandmother, I put the bed together without help. I've seen better instructions, but did not have any trouble putting it together. As other reviewers commented, the instructions are glued to the bottom of the bed. However, they are facing up and easily viewed when the mattress is removed. .Pros: Very sturdy, full sized crib, adjustable mattress height, folds easily for storage.Cons: A few minor scratches, a couple of warning labels were very difficult to remove and left a sticky residue. A Google search suggested rubbing mayonnaise on the sticky area and leaving for 15 minutes. Worked like a charm.
