Ha ha ha.  My wife gets this 200 fancy bag as a gift from another mom.  Oh honey she says you can use it too because it's unisex.  Now, I'm all about operations. I've seen my brother looking for wipes, the bottles, diapers going through the bag etc. Did some research and came across this bad boy.  Looks like a laptop top bag with nice orange touches.  Great bag. Took it to the hospital to bring home the baby.  Every single nurse asked me where I got it.  I said Amazon.  I asked them what they liked about the bag. They said access to the wipes, bottle, pacifier, extra pockets. "It's all there right in front of you".  I looked at my wife and said she said "you did it again". She loves it too.  I use it in the house to practice for when the time comes outdoors and outside my comfort zone. Get it you will not be disappointed.  It's got enough room for everything you're going to need.
