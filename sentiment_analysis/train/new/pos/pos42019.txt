Jumperoo is a very smartly designed fun-activity toy for infant and toddlers. I bought it in 2007 for my then 3 month old daughter, and she loved it. Both my daughter and son used it until they were about 15 months old, and they both had a blast using it. We have some of thier best video and picture moments in the jumperoo. The kids can become very active using this toy, burning lots of calories and will definitely have stronger feet and legs :) The best is that it is very safe, as the kid can be confined in a spot and can use it for 45-60 minutes at a time. It is also a great help, as one can go about doing the household chores without worrying about the little one falling etcetra. I would suggest though not to use it for more than 60 minutes at a time, and also to massage the kids feet and legs once a day after use. I did notice that my daughter got into a habbit of standing on her toes using jumperoo and we had to help her land her full feet on the ground once she was ready to walk.I would recommend this activity-toy highly. Thanks!
