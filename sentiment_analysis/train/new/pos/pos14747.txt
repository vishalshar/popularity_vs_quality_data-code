This is my favorite cover at the moment. There are some things I wish they would change, like adding rise snaps and laundry tabs, but even without those things, I love it. There is a huge panel on the front to stick the applix to, so you can get a great fit. The back elastic is much more gentle than most covers. It has double leg gussets for containing ebf poo. It is roomy so there's no struggle to get your prefold to fit. I feel like it will fit my 9 lb 8-week-old for a while longer.
