Love these.  To avoid the rusting issue with stainless steel items I dry them well before storing.  If moisture sits on them (dirty or clean) they can rust.  These go in the dishwasher open, when I take them out they are dry so I can put them back in the drawer.  It is also important to wash after use.  I keep a pair or two in my diaper bag and when I come home after a use I put them in the next dishwashing cycle.Taking these maintenance measures my scissors have lasted about 2 years each with daily use.  I'm buying probably my 7th set now (keep some with grandparents, forget them at restaurants, broken)
