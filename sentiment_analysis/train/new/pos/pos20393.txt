These socks fit my 11 months old sons feet perfectly.  these socks have a ton of good quality grips in the bottom and the little panda prevents him from stubbing his toes when he is in the walker.  the only down side to this product is that it  showed up a month later then it was supposed to.  Other then that product is great.
