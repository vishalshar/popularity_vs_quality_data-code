I've had this chair for two years now.  It still looks like new.  My daughter is pretty rough with this chair and frequently climbs over the top, hops over the arm rests, and flips it over on its side to hide behind when playing with her brother.Like most parents, I was concerned about keeping the fabric clean.  It truly is easy to clean.  I spot clean with soap and warm water and it is back to looking like new.This chair is large.  In fact, my daughter, age 3, and her friend, age 4, often sit in it together.  Granted they are on the thin side, but I could see my daughter using this chair for many years to come.The only draw back is that to get the chair to recline, you have to pull the the footrest up.  There is no lever.  For my daughter to recline the chair, she can't be sitting in the chair.  This may get easier for her as she gets older.
