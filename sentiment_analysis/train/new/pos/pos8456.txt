looked around for a good seat, and i saw that the reviews for this seat were very good.  Seat was easy to install, my little boy likes the view from this seat.  Only minor thingabout the seat is that the side cup holder is too low for my three old to reach.  That aside, the best seat on the market.  We since bought another brand name seat for my one year old, and it's not as good as this seat.  Hope amazon.com brings this seat back for members to purchase.
