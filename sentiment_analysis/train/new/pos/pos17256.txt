After trying many cloth diapers, this is THE ONE.*Price- cheapest cloth diaper I have found.*The inside lining keeps away moisture very well.*I like how the snaps align and stay together but are not hard to open when baby is fussy and you are trying to hurry.*Available in lots of nice patterns.*Holds up very well for washing, I use the sanitary cycle and have had no problems.*I like the leg elastic, it is tight enough to not leak but not so tight it leaves red marks (like the BumGenius ones did on my baby, although the overall shape of this diaper is very similar to the BG)I'm reading a lot of people had problems with the leg elastic leaking. I had that problem at first, and realized that it was: 1. His legs were too skinny, and I had to wait another week to start cloth diapers. (at their snapped up smallest, they are about a size 2 diaper) 2. He was a heavy wetter and I needed to change my stuffing/inserts. I personally put one microfiber insert in the pocket, and a bamboo insert on top. Once I fixed that, I have not had a problem with leaks.I bought my full diaper stock from another site after trying one that I got on Amazon. Found them for much cheaper. However they are shipped directly from China, so they take awhile to come, but so worth the savings.Best cloth diaper I have tried, I highly recommend it.
