Before we got this bumper I would always worry that my baby would hurt himself in the crib at night and wake himself up. We got this bumper and I feel much safer leaving him in the crib overnight. We put pictures into one of the pockets and he always crawls to it and reaches out to touch it. Overall great bumper. I've been through a few bumpers before this, but they just didn't seem to do the job. This one is soft and colorful and just plain fun for the baby.
