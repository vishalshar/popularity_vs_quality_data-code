I purchased a Tomy dreamshow for my daughter when she was born. She is now 10, I purchased this new colored one (original one is yellow) and she still uses them. The original Tomy one still works 10 years later after everyday use!  It has a timer to play for 5 or 10 mins and then it shuts off.  It plays cute colorful pictures on the ceiling and rotates the images while the music plays. This is a must have for any young child.  When the batteries begin to run low, the pictures still display on the ceiling but they do not rotate.  Music still plays until it starts to sound sluggish.  Replace the batteries and the joy begins again.  I would say the batteries last for approximately 3 months of everyday use.  Thats a rough estimate because Ive not ever kept track of how often I replace batteries.
