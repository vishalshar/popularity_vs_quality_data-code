This is one of my 4 1/2-month-old twins playing in the exersaucer.  I show the toys that come with it and how they snap in and out, and a chewy fishie that doesn't come with it but you can order on Amazon as well.  I also show how well my son fits into it (he is 25" long), as well as give my opinion on how the exersaucer is holding up.  Please pay no attention to the dirty diapers in the background, I have two teething twins and a husband on deployment :)
