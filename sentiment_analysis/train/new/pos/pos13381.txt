I haven't gotten to use it yet (baby is due in a month) , so I don't know how functional it really it, but I do love this bag. It's super cute and just the look I was going for. I wanted a bag that looked like a purse and not a diaper bag. I am very happy with this purchase and I can't wait to try it out!!
