Yes, this toddler bed is pricey. Primarily because it's chic and eco-friendly. But there were more important reasons we decided to try it out: (1) the side rails come up high enough to be safe (some toddler beds have side rails that barely come up 2-3 inches over the mattress) yet not so high that it felt like a crib (some toddler beds are more like day beds or converted cribs - what's the point of "transitioning" a child into that?), (2) we liked that it had solid wood for the base/foundation, (3) we liked that the foot of the bed had just a few inches of side rail just in case we needed it at the early stages of the transition, and (4) of course, we liked the way it looked.We LOVE the bed. And so does our son. Putting it together was easy (a one-person job). It's sturdy, safe, and gorgeous. And the side rails are perfect... my son is a side and stomach sleeper, so on the occasion he rolls to sleep on his side, he's safe from rolling out of the bed but is still learning the boundaries necessary to sleep in a bed.Transition was smooth - took down the crib one morning, had the bed up and ready in time for the afternoon nap and he never looked back. I know I can't credit the bed for that easy transition, but he does love the bed.
