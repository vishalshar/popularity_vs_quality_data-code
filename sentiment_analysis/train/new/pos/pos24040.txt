I have both these and the Bright Starts soft blocks and I love them both. I think these are better for little hands though. They are so soft and plush my babies can easily grab a hold of them. The contrasting colors are eye catching and each ball crinkles and jingles. Also, each block had a different texture I it for the babies to explore. With the Bright Starts blocks, two krinkle and two jingle with no textures. Also, the Bright Starts are hard for the babes to grab since they are more of a flat foam side. They stack a little better than these though so I'm sure they will enjoy playing with them when they ate a bit older.
