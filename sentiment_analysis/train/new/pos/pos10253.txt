I bought these without having the larger Infantino Pop & Play Activity Gym.  I like the convenience of placing them on the car seat or crib or in mine or my son's hands.  He isn't interacting with them too much at his age but does looking at them.  The unique movement or characteristic of each toy is attention getting.
