Teething. Baby is teething. She's my darling little cherub, but the pain from teething turns her into an inconsolable, cranky little alligator. Enter Munchkin Freezer Pops. Angry biting monster turns into content, numbed-gums toddler. Peace reigns. (For a while.)Seriously, though, these rock. BPA-free, super sturdy and easy to clean; I'm satisfied. Possible negatives: The pops are tiny. When I opened the package, I initially thought they were too small (1-2 tablespoons fills each one), but my daughter has yet to finish a whole popsicle on her own, so I admit I was wrong. The handle of the pop has a little well to try to minimize drips, which means it's harder to get the last little bit of the food. To me, that's sort of a trade-off - easy eating or easy clean up - and since I'm usually the one finishing the last of the melting treat, it's not too hard for me to tilt my head way back and just look goofy to get the last bite. Highly recommended.Edited to add: I'm knocking one star off my review because my husband managed to break one of the halves of the mold into two pieces while trying to get a pop out of the mold. Now, granted, I should also knock a star off of my husband, since, really, running the tray under some hot water instead of brute forcing the pop out would have kept the tray in one piece, but it would have been great if the tray could have withstood his enthusiasm.
