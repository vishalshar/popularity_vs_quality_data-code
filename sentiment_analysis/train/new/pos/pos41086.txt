If you do a search for washcloths, these come back with the others. Please make sure you read these are in the "Baby" department. I was aware of that when ordering them. I ordered them for myself though. I wanted some plain white wash clothes to wash my face every night and using these, they have fit the bill! I love that they are thin! They are perfect to wash your face and after it's nice to run over the front of your neck and the back. Also with it being so thin it is easy to clean out your ears too. I feel so much better crawling into bed with a clean face, neck, and ears. I plan to order more since I am pregnant and know my baby girl will benefit from these too. Great for several different types of washing, I highly recommend them.March 16, 2012: I still use these every night on my face, neck, and ears. I love how thin they are. I have noticed they seem to stain easily. The stains do not come out in regular washing but when I get whites together and bleach them on a warm setting, they are like new. Close to two years and I have only bought two sets total and use one or two a day. Not bad!
