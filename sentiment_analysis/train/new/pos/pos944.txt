This stroller is definitely easier to steer than the average umbrella stroller due to the suspension in all four wheels.  It's also heavier as a result of that and the frame is bulkier. One thing to note is that it does not come with a carrying strap as noted in the feature description. It does have a carrying handle instead.We have an Aprica and Bugaboo frog at home as well. We prefer the Bugaboo for navigating the streets of NYC but it's hard to travel with because of the way it folds so we got a Maclaren techno  XT. The XT is a very smooth ride in comparison to the Aprica but it's no bugaboo.Based on other reviews, I expected it to be heavier and bigger than the quest stroller. However the reason for the four stars is that the swivel in the front wheels keep locking inspire of my efforts to keep it unlocked for easier turning.Update- learned the front wheels can be unlocked by pressing the lock down until a loud click can be heard. So giving it 5 stars now.
