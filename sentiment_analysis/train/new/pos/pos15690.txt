This is one of the grossest stories but is a testament to how well this product works. I am one who buys the environmentally friendly product most of the time but when our kid got to the stage of really stinky diapers, we couldn't take it and bought the Diaper Genie. After our kid was done with diapers, someone stashed the Genie in our garage to use for our next kid. Well about 2 years later, the next kid arrives and we pull the Genie out of the garage to dust off and use again. Guess what we found?! We found old diapers in it - not infested with bugs, not stinking outside the bag at all. They were in there for years and nobody noticed! Of course when we cut the bag off to throw it out, we were hit with quite the stench but it was remarkably contained all that time. We were very impressed and grossed out at the same time. You don't need the Genie for newborn diapers, which don't have a significant stench, but if you'd like to pamper yourself a bit - get this product and avoid the stench of the solid food diapers.
