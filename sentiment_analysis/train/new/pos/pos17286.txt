I purchased this set a few months ago, and it is adorable in person.  The greens are more vibrant than pictured (Google a bit and you can find more accurate images)--more lime green than yellow.  Plus, the woodland animals are soft to the touch and very cute.  I am not sure how long the quilt would hold up under multiple washings and a busy toddler, but I did not mind for the price and the fact that it will serve more as decoration for my baby (like the picture) rather than as an actual quilt to keep her warm.The diaper holder is a neat feature.  I took off one star because, not surprisingly, the sheet and bed skirt are a little bit thin.  I contemplated purchasing thicker sheets in a solid color from another vendor, but in the end I ordered a few more of the Dena pattern because they are extremely cute in person.  Since I am not using a bumper in my daughter's crib, I figured I should keep every color and pattern that I could.  With a good mattress pad, I think the sheets will be fine for the cost.PLEASE NOTE: My set came with 4 items--the quilt, sheet, bed skirt, and diaper holder.  I am not sure why the current description on Amazon lists a bumper instead of a diaper holder, because the holder is still pictured in the last image.  The bumper was NOT included in my set, and is usually only part of a larger, 5-piece set.  Hopefully Amazon fixes the description soon to avoid more confusion and disappointment for other buyers!
