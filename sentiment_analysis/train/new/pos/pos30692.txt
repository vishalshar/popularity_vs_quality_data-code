This is a very high quality piece, it will last a very long time. It is completely made of real wood except for the very back piece.  It needed to be assembled when it arrived and it couldn't have been any easier.  I did it with a 1 year old by my side.  Took me about 10 mins total.  I used an electric screwdriver which helped speed up the process.
