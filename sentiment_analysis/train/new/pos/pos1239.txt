These are wonderful! When you first get them the are thick and fluffy - so soft! After some washes (in Washing Soda and Borax) I found that mine aren't as soft, but they are still very nice. They are thick. My baby is a heavy wetter and rarely soaks all the way through these.The picture on this website makes it look like the front of the diaper isn't contoured, but it is. It is just not as wide in the front as in the back, as it should be. If you like you can just use these with a pin on either side and they'd work great without anything else, though there is no elastic to prevent leaks out the side and the outside would get damp.You also can't tell from the picture that there is a rectangular doubler sewn into the inside of these - with one line of stitching right down the center to hold it in place. It is the full length of the diaper. I think I would have rather had it stitched on both sides so one side wouldn't accidentally get folded over the wrong way, but then perhaps that would have caused bunching problems.I use the Bummis Super Whisper Wrap diaper covers with these and they fit perfectly.I have no complaints. After numerous washings they haven't started to fall apart like some others do. I really like them.
