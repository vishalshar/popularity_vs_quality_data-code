Great snack bowl for Thomas the Tank Engine fans. Love the easy open slot and so did my nephew as he used it for his goldfish snacks. Wish the product description had mentioned it was not microwave safe but at least the bowl is marked well. Thankfully it is dishwasher safe although I probably only put it in the top rack to avoid ruining the image
