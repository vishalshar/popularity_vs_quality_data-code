As other reviewers have mentioned, the top cushion is constantly popping off, with only the lightest of bumps.  I use the chair for my son, who has cerebral palsy and related feeding issues, so having a chair that can be adjusted to get correct posture for a larger child is huge, for us.  There are only a couple of these types of chairs on the market to choose from and this is the most financially feasible one, that does the job as well as the more expensive options.  The chair itself, without the cushions, was the same price, so I guess I can't really complain about it too much.  We usually use it without the back cushion at this point, because otherwise it falls off while my son is eating and causes more issues than it's worth
