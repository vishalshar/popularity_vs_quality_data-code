My teething baby loves these. They are very easy for small fingers to grab, and have a variety of surfaces to choose from. The handle portion is hard plastic, while the chewy portions are very soft silicone. Some have bristles, others have bumps or ridges. The bristles are my kid's favorite part. These are great to buy a few of and keep one in each bag to grab.
