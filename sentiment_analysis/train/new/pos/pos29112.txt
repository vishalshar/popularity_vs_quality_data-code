I gave this to my daughter at her baby shower and we both love it that it is loose leaf and can expand for all the wonderful memories of the first few years of her first baby! The questions to answer, and blanks to fill in give great ideas that we know Ella will treasure in years to come.  In fact, it had us opening our own baby books (my own and my daughter's) and reading through our milestones and wondering when Ella will reach those milestones as well!
