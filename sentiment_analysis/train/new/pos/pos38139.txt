I bought this urinal after learning that my 2 year old son preferred to stand while using the potty. As an alternative to standing on the toilet seat, this mini urinal allows a toddler to stand like an adult and feel more grown up too. The potty itself is smaller than it seems in the picture, however the height is perfect for my average height son, who is almost 3. The piece used for hanging the potty could be made a little better, however it works fine and has not fallen off as we are gentle with it. If you were to be rough, it would likely fall off the side of the toilet. My son is also able to easily slip the urinal off the hook and dump it into the toilet himself. Easy clean up. I would definitely recommend this option if you want a standing option that keeps sprays off of your toilet seat!
