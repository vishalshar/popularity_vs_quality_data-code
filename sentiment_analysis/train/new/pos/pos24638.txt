This simple hamper goes well with the jungle 123 nursery decor.  It is very cute and looks good in my son's jungle themed room.  It is incredibly light and does exactly what it is meant to do.  The top part, with the monkey face, is actually a flap that serves as a cover.  Sometimes this flap can be cumbersome, but it does stay in position and does not sink in unless there is weight on top of it.  When I get a little lazy, I toss the clothes on top and the flap eventually sinks in so just the giraffe portion shows, which still looks fine.  There is an easily removable mesh laundry bag inside the jungle themed hamper bag. I have not washed it yet, so cannot comment on how it washes up.  It is a simple design, but functions well.  I am pleased with this purchase.
