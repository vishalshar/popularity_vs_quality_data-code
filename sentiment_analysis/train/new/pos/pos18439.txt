What is there not to love about a cheaper option to purchase these!? Being a mom we often seem to find bottles stored in places that we never imagined and although yes it would be cheaper to boil them to get the awesome film that was left from your ever so loving toddler throwing and hiding this under your couch for the price!? Just throw them away and order the replacement. These are always impossible to find in both target and walmart and when you can you often pay the same price for just one or you find yourself just purchasing a new cup. The soft spout I will say was a good in between from bottle to hard plastic sippy cup and I would for sure suggest it to tired moms across the world!
