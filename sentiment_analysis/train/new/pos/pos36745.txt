I really like this bag.  I first purchased a Columbia diaper bag and then switched to a Skip Hop Duo but they were too big for my taste.  I am on my third baby and I just don't feel the need to carry around 20lbs. of baby goods anymore.  This bag is perfect in size, just enough room to carry 6-8 small diapers, wipes, an extra outfit, cell phone, sunglasses and a wallet, plus a few other things.  The pockets on the sides are nice sized, you're able to put a bottle in the side w/out it being too bulky. There are also several storage pockets that are discreet to put your credit cards or money in.  The only thing I don't love is when you put stuff in the outside pocket it does get a little bit top-heavy but that's not really a big thing.  One other great feature is that the strap is long enough you can adjust it to wear it like a messenger bag.  For the price and size, this is a great bag.  Fits nicely under an umbrella stroller if you don't stuff it too full.
