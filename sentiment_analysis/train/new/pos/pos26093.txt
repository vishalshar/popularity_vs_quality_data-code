We have a Graco carseat (it's the blue/yellow plaid stroller/carseat combo), and this cover fits great. I did take the hood off for now, as it would be too much for an infant. I love this cover -- unlike other covers, it allows you to use both the canopy and the detachable head/neck support that came with the carseat. We live in Colorado and use this cover every time we go out, whether it's for a walk in the stroller, or in the car. Life would be much more difficult if we had to dress our son in a snowsuit or something every time we go out. We just pop him in his carseat, include a blanket if it's really cold, put a hat on him and zip him up and we're ready to go.
