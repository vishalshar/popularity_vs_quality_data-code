These plates are great because they are designed with toddlers in mind.  I have a two year old, and like most two year old boys, he is a miniature Godzilla.  Now I'm not saying he won't make a mess, or somehow find a way to damage the plate, but it is much less likely and as parents that's all we can really ask for.This is our second purchase of these plates, the first of which we have owned for more than a year and they have held up quite well.  One of the plates does have a decent sized gouge in it, but we do have Cutco Cutlery so I'm guessing we might have went a little overkill on something.  This is not something you are going to be able to do with a butter knife.They pop in and out of the base easily but firmly, so the little munchkin isn't going to sit there and detach and reattach it.  We often leave them attached even through the dishwasher (top shelf) because you really only need to clean it that thoroughly for a super messy meal (or kid).Comes with spoons which are nice if your little one is just starting to learn to eat for themselves, so as not to watch them repeatedly bash their front teeth with metal utensils.Microwave safe is also a plus, not only because of convenience but also because the plate doesn't get that hot.  The material seems to have an exothermic quality to it; it doesn't get very hot, and releases heat quickly if it does.If you are looking for plates for your little one I highly recommend that you buy these right now and stop wasting your time, as you are probably ignoring the fact that he/she is drawing on your walls with markers as you are reading this.
