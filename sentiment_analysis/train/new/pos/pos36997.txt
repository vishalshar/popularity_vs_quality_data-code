My granddaughter loves this. She was really fussy when we brought her home from the hospital(later found out formula was to blame)but this soothed her and it was the only place we could get her to sleep. The only really negative is it should be made with an a AC adapter like the matching swing. We have gone thru A LOT of batteries. Gonna have to look into buying rechargeable batteries.
