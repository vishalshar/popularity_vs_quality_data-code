Our daily trips to and from daycare were becoming quite difficult because my 2 year old dd was often unhappy bc she would decide she wanted something different than book or toy she had selected before we got rolling. My choices were either to pull over to assist or spend the miles listen to her unhappiness while trying to distract her verbally (my singing voice is rather distracting) or reignite her interest in what she did have at hand. I was able to quickly and easily set and secure this to the folded down armrest in the middle of the back seat and it is a great height for her to more easily reach what she needs. I make sure there are one or two toys and books, a drink and a snack in there before we set out and she helps herself. I may still get around to inventing the roof mounted mechanical extra arm that I thought might be my only solution before I decided to try this but at the rate I get things done right now I think this was a fairly priced, sanity saving solution.
