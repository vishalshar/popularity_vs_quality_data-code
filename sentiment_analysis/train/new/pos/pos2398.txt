Medela was my go-to brand for all things baby feeding: pump, bottles, nipples, everything. I love that everything is so interconnected and you don't have to worry about it not fitting. I have used these nipples for 10.5 months now, and most of them still look brand new. We clean ours in the dishwasher, and the only ones that don't look new are the ones that we used orange baby food in.HOWEVER! They do not make a fast flow nipple. The slow and mediums are great, but I had to switch to another brand for fast. I have put them all in storage, and will use them again should we ever have another baby.
