We use both cloth diapers and disposables.  These covers are fab.  I actually got more leaks with the Costco/Kirkland brand diapers, actually we never had any leaks with the Bummis diaper cover at all.  My only complaint is that they were a little bulky.  My little boy looked like he had a humongous tush wearing these, but since these were the only covers I tried, I have nothing to compare them to.  They were pretty easy to keep clean.  I only bought 2 just to try them and would rinse off with soap and water and it would be dry by the next time I changed him.  Basically you don't need too many.
