We purchased this for our Graco Snugride 35 (hoping it would fit). Our little one was born during cold and flu season...but going to church and social activities are difficult to keep well meaning sick people at bay. We bought the Bug Shield to put over the car seat so strangers and acquaintances could admire from a safe distance. It is especially nice to keep little kids' hands off our baby's face and fingers. The bug shield works great for us. The elastic and netting is of a good quality. Best of all, it works great for our carseat...even though its not a maxi cosi car seat.Hope this helps someone else who wants to keep their infants safe and healthy, while still socializing and fellowshiping.
