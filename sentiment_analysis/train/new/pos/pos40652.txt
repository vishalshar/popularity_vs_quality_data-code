I'm 6' and plus sized and this fits just fine.  We used it extensively on vacation and we use it on day outings like the zoo or shopping.  My little one loves it and doesn't get hot.  We also have an Ergo and she definitely prefers this.  It is easy to shove in a diaper bag, easy to put on, and easy to get her into and tighten.  She feels secure.  I've breastfed in it but I'm definitely not a pro at it.  I wish I'd bought a black and pink one but I like the chocolate too.  My husband has used it but feels it is girly.  This is one of my all-time favorite baby purchases!
