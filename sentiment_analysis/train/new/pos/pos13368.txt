Purchased this so I can pump in the car.  I have been exclusively pumping for my son since birth (using a rented Symphony), and he's now 6 months old.  There have been several occasions that I've needed to pump in the car.  On those occasions I've used the Medela Swing, but once you are used to a double pump, using a single (and taking twice as long) stinks!  I finally decided to buy the car adapter and give that a try.  I didn't expect for it to work great, but it does!  I don't notice the difference between the suction when it's in the car as opposed to being plugged it at home. Now, as I'm approaching the end of my pumping journey, I wish I had bought this sooner.  It would have given me a bit more freedom to go out in those early days when I was pumping what seemed like constantly.  I plan on using again when child #2 comes along!
