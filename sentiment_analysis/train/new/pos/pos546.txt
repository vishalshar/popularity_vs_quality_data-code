I have these on my baby's car seat handle and she just LOVES them.  When we get to day care in the mornings, the daycare provider takes them off and puts them on other play-things throughout the day.  I guess my daughter just loves batting at them and grabbing them wherever they are.  They are super cute and definitely worth the money.
