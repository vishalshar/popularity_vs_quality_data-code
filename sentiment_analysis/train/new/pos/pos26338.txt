I have 4 of these. The colors are just what they look like. I have used them for over a year. I love how easy it is to use the velcro. It has fit my daughter perfectly since she was born (8 lbs 8.8 oz) and still fits her now and she is 24 pounds.My only problem with them is I probably won't be able to use them with future children because the velcro is very worn out. I think that is just a velcro problem though, not anything wrong with the Diaper.
