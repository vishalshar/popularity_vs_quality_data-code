Before buying this, I read many of the reviews, and a few people commented that it was not sew properly, and that the top slipped against the bottom, making it dangerous for young kids her might step on it etc.I am going to presume that they have made improvements since those reviews were written a few years ago, because the picnic blanket I received doesn't seem to have that problem.It is big and fits my family of 4 nicely. My kids (baby and toddler) don't seem to have any problems slipping on it, and it shakes off really well when covered in grass or dirt etc.I LOVE that it has a cotton top and not the regular flannel top that so many others have. EVERYTHING from grass to leaves to sand sticks to flannel picnic blankets, but this one just shakes everything off in a pinch. LOVE IT.They have also included the folding directions on the cardboard insert in the bag AND on a tag sewn to the actual blanket. A great little feature that makes it so much simpler to get packed up again.I'm very happy with my purchase. A great picnic blanket that I look forward to getting lots more use out of :)
