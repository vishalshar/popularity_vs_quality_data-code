yes it says its an ointment but it was a cream, which is/was even better! our 5m old little has had a few diaper rashes before (this one being just awful) and i've gone back and forth between this and A&D wanting to see if one worked better then the other. until now the only difference was A&D is an ointment, which i found to be too goopy while the Lansinoh is a thick cream, which i find easier to apply so for me that was a preference. for diaper rashes though they seemed to work about the same.this time she got a rash beyond anything i had seen, we used A&D and it just got worse so we saw her ped. thinking due to location maybe it was a yeast infection not a reg. diaper rash. He told us it was just a really bad diaper rash and gave us an ointment for layer 1 and a cream for layer 2, a protective layer. we used that combo for roughly a week and it only seemed redder and looked like it was blistering, the poor girl, i wanted to bring her in again but hubby said it would take time and it was part of the healing process. we ran out before it was time for a refill so i used the Lansinoh cream as layer 2 and noticed a difference that day. when hubby got off work he looked at the area while changing her and suggested using it on its own, so we did. we finished off the tube and its looking much better. today is day 1 w/o it and shes cranky so ordering more to sooth her tush!i'm so glad i wanted to test each kind to find our favorite instead of just buying one brand.-Tra (wifey & momma)*UPDATE*she's 6m now and the rash never did come back into full effect. at the slightest sign of a rash we apply a layer and the next day she is good to go. :)
