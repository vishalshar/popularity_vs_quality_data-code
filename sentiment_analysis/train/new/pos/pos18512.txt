Having no high chair, I ordered this seat when our 5 month old grandson was coming to visit.  The seat was perfect!  It fit securely on a chair, and seemed very comfortable to him.  My only disappointment is the difficulty in adjusting the seat positions. The two buttons on the sides of the seat are very hard to push in while trying to change the seat position.  It almost takes two people to adjust it.  Despite that,I would definitely recommend this product.
