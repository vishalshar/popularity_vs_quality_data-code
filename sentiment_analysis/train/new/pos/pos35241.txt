So, my daughter had the little giraffe, but he only played sleep sounds for 45 minutes. As she's gotten older, 18 months to be exact, she is sleeping lighter as many toddlers due, as to not miss out on the excitement, thus tossing and turning more. I saw this sound machine raved about on a sleep training site and thought the price was rather minimal for the raves it got. Tried and we are on about month 3 of daughter loving the lights for diaper changes and the sleep sounds (that DO NOT GO OFF AFTER A SET TIME, PLAY 24/7 UNLESS YOU TURN TIMER ON) are oceanic, waves, white noise and more. Give this one a try and you won't be disappointment, no joke!
