dreambaby gate model L170 /L191We have about a 48" wide opening. For those of you wondering about what extensions to get add  the follow extensions (according to the manual):41.7"-46" (106-117 cm): L159/L192 (3" ext)45.2"-49.5" (115-126 cm): L171/L193 (7" ext)59.5"-63.7" (151-162cm): L172/L194 AND L172/L194 (two 10" ext?)Other than that the instructions are okay, its hard to follow with the multiple languages but once you learn where to look its a straight-forward installation. The gate works great, auto-closes just fine.Hardest part was finding the correct combination of extensions to buy in order to fit our gap.We only have a small dog so we haven't had any problems. I can't speak on what a child could do but in my opinion it would work great.
