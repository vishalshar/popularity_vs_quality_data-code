I love the set! It is the most adorable thing that I have found. It looks great with the colors I have chosen, and is really easy to decorate with. You get so much with the set also, well worth your money. The only complaint that I do have is that the blanket/comforter was cheaply made. There were strings all over the blanket and very obvious seams. There was also a small hole in the side of the teddy bear where it was not sewn properly. Other than that I would highly recommend this product to anyone out there.
