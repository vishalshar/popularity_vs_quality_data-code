These are pricy little things and I debated for awhile spending that much on nipple pads.  I had my first baby and bought some cotton reusable ones that were soft and a fraction of the cost, but they didn't have the waterproof backing these have, which is great for keeping air flow, not so great out in public.  They were super thick and extremely noticeable and I would leak through them if I even thought of my baby.  I then did disposables which were all horrid.  They stuck to the bra which sounded like a convenience until you tried to breastfeed and they got all wadded up and stuck to you.  And don't even get me started on the genius that made at least one brand I used have nipple indents already in them and god forbid you misalign them!  As I read somewhere that accurately describes the experience, wearing disposables is like smuggling biscuits, you leak, they expand like a diaper and they are already big and bulky to begin with!!!So second baby came around, I was determined to try these and so glad I did!  They are super soft and thin, I wore them with just a nursing tank and it wasn't very noticeable and anything thicker, like a bra plus shirt, invisible completely.  They are cute and oddly make you feel adorable while your not feeling so cute otherwise (Oh immediately post birth fun!)  I have had zero leakage with just the regular ones through the engorgement period and overnight!  The bamboo lining was a godsend during the delicate time little one and I were learning to breastfeed together as well, I had long forgotten those first weeks of soreness!  Little one had a poor latch causing quite some pain and issues and that softness really eased me through it.Toss these in a lingerie bag (I have two from dollar store, one for clean and one for wash) just to keep these together and throw in with your regular laundry.  Easy as heck and wish I splurged with first baby!
