This bouncer has all the bells and whistles you can ask for, however it requires an excessive amount of time to assemble.Unfortunately, the screws require a lot of manipulation in order to securely fasten in to the holes.  Furthermore, some of the screws do not fully enter the hole which is another drawback.The assembly of this product should be seamless and require minimal effort.  For the amount of time required to assemble, I would not have purchased this item if I would have known in advance.Please develop products that require minimal effort and time to assemble.  There has to be a easier and more efficient method to assemble a bouncer.
