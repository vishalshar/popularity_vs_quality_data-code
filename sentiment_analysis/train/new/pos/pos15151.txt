This travel potty is exactly what I was looking for. My son is tiny and definitely can't use an adult size potty yet. I was the mom carrying his normal potty around because I was disgusted by the thought of him trying to not fall through in regular toilet.The potty fits nicely on every seat I've tried so far.When using it as a stand alone potty it is low to the ground but my toddler doesn't seem to mind.It's small enough to fit in my backpack diaper bag no problem.I also love that he can hold on to the "legs" instead of grabbing the public seatI use it with a toilet seat cover and it's the perfect pair.
