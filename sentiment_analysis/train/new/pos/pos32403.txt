I have very wide open doorways in my townhouse. I was having problems finding a baby gate that would fit them. I happened to find this one, which says it goes up to 54".  We originally purchased it for one doorway, but after putting it together, we realized that it actually goes wider than 54"! We were very happy because we actually wanted a baby gate for another doorway in the house, but didn't think we would be able to find one wide enough. We wound up putting this one in that location.  It is very easy to open and close and you can use the stopper attached to it to make it swing open in only one direction.  If you need an extra-long gate, this one is definitely the one for you!
