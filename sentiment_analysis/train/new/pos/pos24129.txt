Come on people! This lambskin is plenty soft! No, it's not like an IKEA lambskin which is dyed and who knows what else, but it's great! I raised ALL four of my kids on lambskins way before it was popular... 'ruggies' get dragged around, slept on, taken to college even. Back in the day babies were put on the tummies to sleep. Maybe that's what you were worried about in terms of softness.The small difference in softness, if there is any difference, will never matter to your baby and child who will love on this pure product for a lifetime.My puppy has an IKEA one... but your baby deserves the best. I know my grand baby sure does!
