I read through many reviews for this product--aparently this is a new color, and there aren't any reviews here?  I bought it despite many complaints about it being difficult to clean all the nooks and crannies.  I think the people who hate it have older babes who are self-feeding and making bigger messes.  And the ones who love it have little babes who are not making their own messes, yet.  I'm still in the love category, but my son is eating finger foods and it's really not that difficult to clean.I love the easy to wipe fabric, and the fact that it doesn't have a print on it.  It's not all that bad looking--for a high chair.  The straps are easy to operate and it creates a safe zone for a squirmy tyke.  I love that it has a bar between the legs to keep my son from sliding down.The adjustability features work easily and well, although I've seldom had cause to use them.  I imagine if you had this chair when your child was newborn, it would be a great napping place with the seat reclined.My son is about average size, and the tray table is slightly high, but not unworkable.  I also think it slides in close enough to him.  He does drop some foods into the seat, but what child learning to feed himself wont?
