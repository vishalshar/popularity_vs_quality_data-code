I had purchased little black iron stick figure "family members" including our cats, but thought it needed a little something more.  I was looking for "family" sayings, but thought this saying was perfect for us.  I split this saying to have one line above and one line below the iron figures and have gotten so many comments on it. This was easy to put up on the wall, however a little time consuming to get the decal on the wall (patience required). But it looks great.  It arrived when they said it would, in great condition.
