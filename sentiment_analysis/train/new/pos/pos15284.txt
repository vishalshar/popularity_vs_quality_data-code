Awesome idea! I had stayed away from the disposable food pouches because I did not like all the waste involved and the cost. I found the Yummi Pouch and it has been working GREAT! I put greek yogurt and applesauce in them for my 16 month old. They are a tad tricky to fill, but I just zip the top and suck out the little bit that is above the ziptop line. :) i was surprised they are dishwasher safe, but they are and come out clean on the top rack. Super value and super product!
