My baby just loves loves loves this play gym. The item shown in the photo does not do it justice as it is made well, colorful, cute, full of functional fun activities and much more affordable than the more 'popular' brands. It won a best toy award and I can totally see why.My daughter was 2 and half months when I got her this and she became so excited and start kicking the mobiles and was delighted at the music. I love the crinkly leaf that always gets her attention, and these mobiles are easily detachable so you can move them around and hang them in different places to adjust to your baby. My baby has reached many landmarks on this playgym. She learned to reach out and grab a mobile, improved her head control during tummy time, and has such a blast that I can actually walk away to grab myself lunch. I often get under there with her too.There is a musical mobile that many reviewers complained was too loud but it's not so bad and there's always the duct-tape option if you find it loud and annoying. You can also easily detach the mat (snap buttons on the four corners) so you can wash it, and easily fold it up to take it somewhere or store it away. I truly recommend this product for your little ones. It is worth every penny!
