We bought this recently for our 4mo (at the time) daughter so that she could get more space to move around, since our house is mainly floored with tiles and wood.The product is fine for what it is: it's a foam playmat with interlocking connectors. Foam seems to fray a bit after some use, but I suppose that's to be expected. The foam is about an inch thick, so it does cushion baby's fall, but not by too much.Sadly, the connectors (and round circle holes) don't fit as snugly as we'd like, so they're easy to pry up. And if you pick up one side of the 4x5 ensemble (we like to prop it up against the wall when not in use, instead of reassembling the whole puzzle again each time), it tends to fall apart very easily.When putting it all away back into the original zippered bag, I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get all the connector pieces to fit back into the supplied box! It must be some kind of intelligence test, and I'm failing it.All said and done, sure, I'd buy this product again.
