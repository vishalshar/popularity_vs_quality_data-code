I spent hours and days, searching to find the best ones out there. Life is too short and I rarely spend time writing reviews, so I've done your study for you. Like many other similar products I found that followings the the keys.Make sure1. it doesn't bleed color to the seat.2. the anti skid pad on the bottom doesn't melt onto the seat3. measure the seat (this one is the perfect height for our Nissan Quest 2014)4. Great quality and nice paddings.5. Stays in place6. Extra pocket storage is a plusAnd this one meets them all! I even got so many compliments! The only complaint would be I wish they would make in other colors like tan and grey and etc. but it's really not that big of deal since they match the car seat.(evenflo MAESTRO=great booster seat wt harness, just got this one too 2/25/14).
