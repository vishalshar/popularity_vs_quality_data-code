What I like about this booster seat:It's soft and quite cooshee on the tushyIt's grippy, so it stays put on our wooden chairsSometimes simple is better. Now that my son can be told to stay put in his seat I'm glad to ditch the straps and buckles.I like having an entirely wipeable surface- no cloth!It's super easy to toss in the car and take with you to someone else's houseWhat I was slightly disappointed about:Mine did have a minor surface scratch when it arrived. I'm just super picky and considered sending it back but ended up keeping it b/c I figured we'd add a few of our own over time anyway.I am careful to try not to scrape it at all to damage the surface, and if it was a hard plastic I probably wouldn't have to be. But, we've had it about 6 months now and I don't think it has any scratches or visible wear yet.Just remember:You have to lift the booster off your chair and clean all sides and on the chair itself from time to time because some how food gunk or sticky stuff will find its way and just sit around the edges of where it sits on the chair.
