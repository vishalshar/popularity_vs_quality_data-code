Love all of these Angel Dear products. I have four grandchildren, four different lovey characters. Boy, tiger. Boy, frog. Twin girls - purple hippo and pink lamb. They'd never nap if not for the nap blankets - when they began to get attached to these soft loveys, my daughter bought duplicates thinking she could rotate them around for washing, etc. Didn't really work, but it was a good plan! One of the twins has a bright future as a hoarder, so has removed all unclaimed Baby Dear products to her room - under the bed, on the bed, beside the bed, under her pillows. You won't be sorry if you order these products as it will make some baby very happy, and for years to come!!
