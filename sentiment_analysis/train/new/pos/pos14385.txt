I was looking online at the more costly leather diaper bags and really couldn't justify paying that much for something that would most likely just get stained. There is enough room in it to carry my son's diapers, wipes, clothes, toys, cups and my makeup, wallet, sunglasses, and phone. No one can even tell that it is a diaper bag, but it has a spill-resistant lining inside that I love!The only con about it is that the two side pockets could be bigger to hold the cups. I can fit his sippy cups in there, but it is definitely a tight fit.
