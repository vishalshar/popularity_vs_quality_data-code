This blanket is gorgeous and so soft. I bought two of these for my twin girls at the start of their 3 month NICU stay. It is very warm, which is great for when I hold them, especially when they were less than 3 lbs and couldn't wear clothes. It is thick enough that light doesn't get through it, so we often use it to shade their eyes. I get so many compliments on this blanket. It is fun and different from most of the blankets the NICU nurses see every day. The colors are bright and the pink "sherpa" is very pleasing and snuggly. My favorite blanket.
