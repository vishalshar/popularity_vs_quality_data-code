this is a winner from parents'/grandparents' point of view and our grandchild loves it.  It is such a cute item and if you're going to have something hanging in your doorway, it should be fun to look at as well as play in.  Our 6 month old grandson has a blast in it.  We also have a matching walker that he has fun in, too, and they are so much "cooler" to have hanging around your house than the run-of-the-mill looking baby accessories.  We are thrilled with this and would recommend to others.
