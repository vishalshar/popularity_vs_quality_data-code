Tupperware has been around for a long time, and these came recommended to me by my son's pediatrician beacuse they don't have valves added.  The lids are a little difficult to get on and off initially, but it does become easier with use. My son is still not all that interested in them right now because he loves to chew on things, but they are the perfect size for his little hands!
