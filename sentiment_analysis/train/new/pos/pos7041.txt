We have a bigger stroller that we use daily for going to the park, but it is quite heavy and my wife couldn't fold it or put inside the trunk. So we needed a light one, and easy to drive / control in the same time.This stroller is quite comfortable for my one year old. We keep it in the trunk of our car and we use it only when we go shopping. It doesn't take a lot of space folded. I use one hand to fold and unfold. We like it.
