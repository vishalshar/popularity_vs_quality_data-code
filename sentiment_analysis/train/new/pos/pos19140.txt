I'm not sure this lamp is quite worth the $30 it sells at suggested retail price, but other than that I love it. It's cute, it matches the rest of the honey bear collection, and it works. I saw some other reviews that say the shade is too short, but mine covers the light bulb completely. Perhaps they fixed a problem or some others were flawed. The quality on this isn't bad, but I'm not sure the materials quantify the $30. It works fine for what we use it for since we have an overhead light this is more a backup for reading in the nursery or a little bit of light while reading and hoping to fall asleep.
