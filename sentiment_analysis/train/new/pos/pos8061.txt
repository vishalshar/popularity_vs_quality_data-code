I'll preface this by saying that I am a dad of twins and finding effective "twin" gear is critical because we buy two of everything.  I came across the Tiny Diner on Amazon and thought it would meet our needs.  I ordered one and tried it out - got back from dinner with the twins and ordered the second on the spot.  The tiny diner exceeded my expectations and did a great job covering the table, catching food and rolls up nice and small for transport.The Summer Infant Tiny Diner ended up being much bigger than I had anticipated.  The diner measures 12H by 18W inches at it's tallest and widest.  Placed on a table it covers more area than my kids can reach - so plenty of coverage.  The suction cups on the bottom are plentiful and effective, they've stuck to everything we've used it on so far.  The food trough at the base captures food that would otherwise end up on the floor - saves you the cleanup.  Lastly, the diner rolls up nice and small into itself and fits nicely in a small diaper bag.All and all it is a great product.
