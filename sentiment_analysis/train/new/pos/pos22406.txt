I purchased may different toothbrushes (finger and traditional) to find one my daughter would use. She was nine months old when I started searching for a training type toothbrush. My requirements were that she could easily hold it, it easily fit in her mouth, and she would want to use it. Baby buddy's toothbrush did all these. I like it because it cleans the top and bottom at the same time, is soft so I don't have to worry about her stabbing or poking herself with a hard handle, it is harder for her to gag on, the bristles do not poke her when she chews on it and she enjoys brushing her teeth. I can just hand this to her after meal time and she will automatically stick it in her mouth and brush for up to 15 minutes. She can even flip it to brush the other side of her mouth without help. I really like that it is curved to fit the contours of baby's mouth. Save yourself bit fingers (when trying to brush with a finger toothbrush) and the fear of baby hurting herself or you hurting her when trying to brush with a tradition toothbrush and just get these.
