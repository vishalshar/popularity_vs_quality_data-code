We are really happy with this ornament.  We've since bought other ornaments from the company that we purchased from via Amazon (Wild Moose Ornaments) and we love them all.  Even with the customized lettering, they were shipped the next business day after we placed our order.  The quality of the ornament seems to be great- it's made out of a really thick plastic of some kind.  It won't melt in the attic, and doesn't feel like it would break if it fell off of the top of a Christmas tree.Note that you'll need to use the e-mail function to contact the seller to add customization options if you don't want the standard text.  We added our child's name to the hat, and "1st Christmas" to the top of the stocking.
