I have a leased mini van, and one of the back seats had some deep scratches on it, caused by baby's car seat. The kids never seat still and why should they, they are kids. Besides, often times you need to make complex manipulations with seat belts in order to unbuckle the car seat and put it into a different car. So, the material gets damaged pretty easily.I don't want my dealership to jump for joy while charging me for the damage. There must be a solution, I thought. Quick research and I found this. It's been in my car for a couple of months now. It looks neat, doesn't cause any inconvenience and prevents seats from further damage. No new scratches, stains are easily removed, and it stays right in place. I hope it's helpful.
