My baby (8 months) is crazy about our tv remotes, so before disaster happened I got her this toy. It was the only toy remote I found that was rated as safe for such a young baby. She was about 7 months when I got it. Instantly became her favorite toy! It took her a little while to learn to push the buttons, but even before she enjoyed holding it and touching it. I think she likes the bright colors. She loves the rolling ball at the tip! Also, the songs are actually enjoyable. Even after almost two months of her playing with this daily I haven't gotten annoyed by the music and sounds (same cannot be said of other toys). All this at a super-affordable price... what's not to love?
