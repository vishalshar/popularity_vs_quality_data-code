I thought this bedding was so cute when I saw it online and it is even cuter in person!  I ordered it on a Sat night and got it Wed afternoon with standard shipping, not to mention the price was such a steal!  I am really glad I chose this.  The only bad thing is the lack of accessories but I can work around that!  I was a little worried since most bedding is twice the price but I am very pleased!
