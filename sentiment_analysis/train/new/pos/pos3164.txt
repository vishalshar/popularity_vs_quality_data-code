I had to take my two year old around the world (on my own) for his grandmother's funeral and I bought this primarily for use at the airport.  It was a true lifesaver. There's no other way I could have managed multiple suitcases while juggling a toddler on an 8000 mile/24+ hours (each way) trip.  Unfortunately this item has been discontinued because it can be considered a choking hazard.  This is no more a choking hazard for a child than a dog leash is for a dog.  Perhaps if you tie your child in the back yard using this and leave them unsupervised like you might do with a dog on a leash, it could prove problematic.  Not really sure how a child could ever have this wrapped around their neck without gross neglect on the part of the person holding the other end of the leash.
