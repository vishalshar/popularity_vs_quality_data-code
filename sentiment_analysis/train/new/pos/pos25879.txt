UPDATE: APRIL 16 2013=====================================================================================================Its been 11 months now since i bought these and my niece still loves them.  she uses them every time she comes over (she just turned 3 last month).  still give them all 5 stars. they've held up to her usage, one thing to note though the trim around the edge of the bowl, guess its just some kind of stick on decal so the inner edge of it is bubbling up a bit because of the washings, but no biggie. didnt notice it for the longest time.  its just one of those things that comes with heavy wear.  still have all the pieces and works great.============================================================================================================================i bought this little set for my 2 yr old niece for when she comes to visit. she absolutely LOVES dora anything, so i thought id get her something a little more toddler friendly that fits in her high chair.  the colors are vivid and girly and the silverware is big enough for her to actually get food on it.  the bowl is surprisingly deep too, i didnt except it to be as deep as it was but i like it, its the perfect size.  the divided place is also pretty handy,  though she pretty much will mix everything up anyways, (chocolate pudding and yellow rice...) loli was worried a little that the silverware might be a little big or heavy for her little hands but they're fine, they are a little weighty though, seems like they will hold up nicely to her being a little rough. they certainly arent flimsy.It's kind of hard to scale the size of this set because there arent any photos, but its really not big, the plate is half the size of a standard paper plate, but perfect for little ones.  I'd definitely recommend this. will update on its condition after its more thoroughly used.
