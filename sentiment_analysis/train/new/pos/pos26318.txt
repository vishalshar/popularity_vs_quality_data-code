I am VERY happy with these. My son's room is jungle themed and I have been looking for wall decor for a while now that wasn't outrageously priced. I was shocked to find this set for only $16 (I got them on sale.)! I made sure to thoroughly read the description, because honestly it seemed too good of a deal! I have seen one canvas print at the store for more than this set of 3 cost me. They are 12" by 12" and very cute. In other reviews people said the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured, and they may be slightly less bright than pictured but they are still super adorable. Even for the full price of $30 I would be in love with this set. I highly recommend these items to anyone who wants to add some wall art to their nursery or child's room.
