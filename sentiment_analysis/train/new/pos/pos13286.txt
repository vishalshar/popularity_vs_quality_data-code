Adorable! But huge. We bought this for newborn pictures and couldn't use it. My daughter is 7 weeks old and we tried it out. It was really cute but we did have to pin it smaller in the back.The only legitimate downside is that it took absolutely forever to get here. I emailed the company and they sent me another one express mail. So that was nice.
