I love the monitor that goes with this charging station and we were really looking for an extra charging stand so that we could use it in the living room or the bedroom without having to move the charger. It can stay alive for a while but it also dies depending on how you use it, how much you turn on the screen, stuff like that. This unit works just like the original one we have and we have no complaints.
