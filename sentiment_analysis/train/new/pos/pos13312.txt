My boys seem to be extreme in the drool department, so I need tons of absorbent bibs to keep their necks and chests relatively dry so they don't get rashes, change shirts so often, etc. Of the MANY more inexpensive bibs I have tried, these are BY FAR my favorite. They are soft, pretty absorbent but still waterproof in the center to keep their chests dry, and the Velcro stays on well in the laundry, so they don't tear up my other clothes or themselves the way the other inexpensive ones did. I loved them so much I ordered another set for me and I give them at baby showers telling the women you'll need a ton of these, look them up on Amazon and save some money if you want more later. The other cheaper ones I got on Amazon only lasted a round or two before the Velcro stopped working, and they just tear up the other clothes in the laundry, not even worth a penny if they ever priced them that low, please just get these and save yourself some effort and money. Thanks Green Sprouts! :-)
