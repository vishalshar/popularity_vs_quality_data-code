I researched online and in stores for months before making this purchase and I'm so glad we went with this booster seat. Our 4.5-y.o. loves it and she manages to buckle in just fine now (only helped her getting the hang of it the first few car rides.) For the price, Britax delivers on quality, safety, and affordability with this seat. We saw this in a store first, then researched online. The features we felt set this booster apart from the others were:-The secureguard feature is peace of mind; it allows the lap portion of the safety belt to be slid up under the strong secureguard 'hook' and belt. It sits in the crotch area, so it keeps little ones from sliding under the belt in the event of a sudden stop, preventing injury. Since we were moving her out of a very secure seat, the Evenflo Triumph, into a booster with only the car's seatbelt, that feature made ME feel better about her car safety.-The back of the booster seat has some give to it, so I can see her being comfortable on longer car rides and even napping if we recline the actual car's seat back a little.-I recommend the cloudburst material as it's breathable. I wanted to get bright pink because she would love it, but I noticed in the store that the pink (and other colors) were rough and would be hot. Other reviews have both confirmed that the other colors are indeed hot and uncomfortable and that the cloudburst is a better, softer, more breathable fabric.-Another huge plus to this seat versus the others is that I can detach only the seat cover material if I need to wash it. Other car seats are all one piece, which washing machines LOVE to eat to pieces!-Last is the optional use of the tether/lower latches that work the newer vehicles that are outfitted with seat latching hooks. Again, this is extra peace of mind and I'm surprised how many booster seats do not have latches. The are very easy and quick to unlatch if you need to remove the seat from the vehicle.
