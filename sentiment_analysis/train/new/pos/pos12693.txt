My 3 month old can stare and giggle at this for a long time. If baby is happy, so is mom and dad! The pictures are captivating and I like how there's a high contrast side and a colorful side. We don't use the ties at all and I'm contemplating cutting them off. Also, it would be nice if the material inside the fabric (is it just cardboard I wonder?) were either more malleable (would be easier to fold up), or maybe like a board book so it stands up better like the accordion shape depicted in the picture. But not a big deal. Would definitely recommend.
