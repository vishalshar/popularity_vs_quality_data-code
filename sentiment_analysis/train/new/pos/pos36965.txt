This thing is like having a third hand- really. It keeps track of all the necessities when we are out and about. Easy to take off the carrier (Velcro)- especially nice when you are in line at the supermarket. I use the pouch with a 360 and can attach it the whole way around- not just in front. Great to stash car keys etc. when you aren't wearing pockets. Washes well. One if the most useful items I've bought.
