We have a 2yo who is potty training. She's at the point she can go on her own, but she's not tall enough to reach the light switches. It's very frustrating for a busy Mommy. I ordered the three pack so that I can install them in the kids' rooms as well (it's cheaper to order a 3 pack than 1 by itself).I opened the box and immediately my DD wanted to play with them. We broke out the handy dandy screwdriver and set up shop in the bathroom. I got to work, taking out the screws from the plate, and WITHOUT READING THE INSTRUCTIONS, installing the Kidswitch. Hmmm...it's funny I can't tighten it very tight and it seemed very flimsy. I shrug it off and move on to the kids' rooms. I install them in both rooms and those fit remarkably better. My DD tested them for me rather well and was very please with the ability to help me turn the lights on when prompted.So I went back to the bathroom to see what went wrong as I had an idea as I was installing the last Kidswitch. And sure enough I had installed the Kidswitch backwards in the bathroom. Doh! So I unscrewed it, flipped the switch around and poof, it works like magic. I read a few of the reviews on Amazon prior to purchasing and I truly think that there are a few that probably made the same mistake I did. Just make sure you're installing the screws into the side that has the recess on it.Long story short, AWESOME PRODUCT and works very well when INSTALLED PROPERLY. I will definitely recommend these to my friends and family.
