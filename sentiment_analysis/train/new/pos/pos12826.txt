First off, the ad that I saw which I purchased from told me I was getting blue and orange cups, I received mint green/pink and purple/pink.  I wasn't happy since the bottles are for my son.  That said, I did use them and like them.  The material is a sturdy plastic  that wears well after multiple washes and being thrown on every hard surface imaginable.  I also like the little plastic piece that goes inside the bottle preventing leaks when traveling.  It works.  My only complaint is that the sippy piece is a little hard.  I know it is meant for teething babies but I worry that when he chews on it it might hurt his teeth, it is that hard.
