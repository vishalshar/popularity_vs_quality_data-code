Milton the Monkey has been our 11 month-old daughter's favorite for about 6 months.  The monkey has different textures (ears, nose, tail, "hair") that she likes to touch, stroke, and chew on.  We tried to keep stuffed animals out of her crib, but Monkey fell in the crib one day and now he's her favorite.  Even before she was crawling, she would scoot around her crib to be close to monkey.  She likes to hug him and wrestle with him.  He's about 12" tall, sitting up, which is big, but not too big to carry around.  For right now, he stays in the crib though...which matches our NoJo Jungle Tales nursery set perfectly!We're ordering another one or two just in case something happens to our current Monkey!
