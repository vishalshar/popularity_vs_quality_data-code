This is really nice. It is hard to explain but it is cushy and breathable at the same time. Protects my baby from bonking his head or sticking his legs out and I don't have to worry about his breathing. I had a scare though the first time I put it on I thought it wasn't going to fit but I read the instructions and found there are different ways to put it on.Used it on my DaVinci rocking mini crib. I put the mesh on and then put my mattress in so the mattress presses the mesh to the bottom and there are no gaps.  I do wish it had more ties on top though.
