I just ordered this swing...and I am very pleased. FIrst cheers to you Amazon for outstanding delivery and customer service~  Ok for the swing  Assembly took about 15 minutes and was very simple.  I love the bright colorful Dreamsicle seat . The swing is so quiet and just glides with a nice steady pace. This swing can go nice and slow or have a more faster pace, yet gentle and soothing to the baby. The music is nice and not irritating to us parents and soothes baby. I am just extremely happy and I am a pretty picky person ~  It does come with a plug so good bye batteries, I never could stand the swings with battery only option. What a pain to change...  I highly recommend this swing if your looking for something that is quiet , glides with a decent pace , battery free, and is pleasant looking in the room.  A+++++++The glider to swing option is fantastic plus with the way the front of the swing at the base goes inward allows you to pull up a chair and can be used as a feeding seat  -  Just my observation.. Nice designGood Job Fisher Price... I think other colors like Lime, lavender, etc would be nice to add as options but the pastel orange is nice to
