We have a 2yr old and a new born.  We have the bugaboo frog and really didn't want trade it in for a double stroller.  After a lot of looking the Pick-up seemed like a good choice because it had the option for the toddler to sit or stand.  She does like to help push her baby brother in the standing position but when she gets tired its nice to have the seat.  It would be nice if there was a way to strap her to the seat although there are slots that look like you can create your own seat belt if you want.  A lot of the other attachments had the complaint that you can't walk behind it but this one is not bad at all.  The base sits high enough that if you are walking you can keep a normal gait as long as you walk with your feet between the wheels.  My biggest complaint is that it is very bulky. It doesn't really break down or collapse for storage or for traveling.
