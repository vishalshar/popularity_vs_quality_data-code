My son came a few weeks early at just under 7lbs. I purchased a lot of "one size" cloth diapers and was disappointed that most of them didn't fit him well while he was so small. He is 4 1/2 months and many brands I purchased (Kawaii and Alva) are still too loose around the legs causing major leaks so he can't even wear them yet. I had a great experience with Charlie Banana. The legs adjust like bra straps so I get a perfect fit. He has also never peed through the diaper which is a huge deal because he's a heavy wetter. I plan on purchasing more.
