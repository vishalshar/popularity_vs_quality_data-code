The sounds and songs are great. Works very well overall. However, you should know that the "keys" aren't actually separate keys, but single piece of fabric with keys printed on it. They are still 5 separate buttons underneath the fabric, but there's no tactile separation of the keys from the fabric itself.Also, because the keys are not raised at all (just a flat piece of fabric), the plastic rim of the keyboard comes up above the keyboard itself. This makes it hard for 5 month old to actually press the keys, since her primary strategy at this point is repeatedly smacking the keys in random locations: her hand hits the rim of the keyboard instead of the keys themselves. (Her other strategy is to put the keyboard in her mouth but that, also, is not particularly effective.) Were I to buy again, I'd get a keyboard with separated, raised keys.
