This was a little smaller than I anticipated, but my toddler LOVES it.  as soon as it came out of the box she grabbed it and laid down on the floor and put her head on it.  It is her very first big girl pillow and boy does she love it.  She sleeps with her head on it every night, even though before we switched to her toddler bed she flipped around in bed all directions.  Now she just lays nice with her head on the little satin pillowcase.She likes it so much that I bought a second one for her to have and take to daycare for when she naps there.  Also, this is at least $3.00 cheaper than the ones in the stores.  So if you have prime shipping or free shipping somehow, I would definitely choose this over the one available at Target.I see reviews of people saying the pillow comes out of the case too easily.  I do wish it had a velcro closure, but I do not find that it is "always" sliding out of the cover.  I shake it back in tight every night before I put my daughter to bed and it never comes out.  But I also pulled apart the filling inside a little which probably fluffed it up.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is no velcro or zipper closure to keep the pillow in the case, and that it is a bit smaller than the one at Target.  I thought it would be a little bigger.  Otherwise, GREAT product, and I recommend it for you!
