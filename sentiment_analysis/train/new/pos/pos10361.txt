Quite cute!  Is smaller than the standard switch plate by about two inches vertically and 1 inch horizontally. My wall job under the switch plate did go in enough so no need for touch ups, but check yours before ordering or you may also need to paint or patch and that may be a pain.  Also, careful: Don't over tighten it or it will break, as mine did. :-(
