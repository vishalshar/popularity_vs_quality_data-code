I had bariatric weight loss surgery and can only eat 1/2 cup of food per meal.  Was looking for small divided dishes to pack my lunch in, that did not look like a child's dish. Most had cartoon characters on them, or funny handles for babies.  These are awesome.  I can fit my 2 oz of meat in the main compartment and then 1 oz of other stuff in each of the smaller compartment.  It gives the feeling of a much larger meal like this.  Plus, they don't make my food look pathetically small like it does in a full size plate.  That really makes you feel deprived.  Although tupperware may seem a little expensive at first,  I still have some that I bought as a newlywed over 30 years ago.  So I know I will have these forever.  PLUS, they are both microwave and dishwasher safe.  I just love these bowls!
