I have 3 Maclaren strollers and other strollers. I have been constantly looking for cup holders for the past three years. I looked at all cup holderrs available on the market. I was very excited that I found this cupholder one day on amazon when I was just browsing.I was not disappointed. It is very simple in design, stays on the square tube of the stroller, moderately easy to detach if need to.  It is not huge, but the top ring gives a little to accommodate bigger drink. Maclaren finally offers a cup holder!  I just wish it comes in black also to go with the black-framed Maclaren models.This cup holder will also fit other strollers with square tubing of same size as the Maclarens. Examples may be. Mamas and papas umbrella stroller and inglesina swift.It is two piece  design that slide on each other onto the stroller frame. It stays on the stroller very well. I like to install it out towards the back instead of to the side of the stroller.It is the best cup holder for Maclaren stroller to date.
