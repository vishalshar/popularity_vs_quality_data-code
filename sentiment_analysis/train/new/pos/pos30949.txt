I bought these and a set of the keys made by 'Parents' to keep in the car for my 1 year old and 3 year old. The 'Parents' keys have metal parts and look like realistic keys and make very realistic sounds (even has a small flashlight)  but they are not for teethers. These are good for teethers. These make a realistic sound that imitates the shaking of keys which is fun for baby but can drive you nuts. It took me awhile to learn that you can press the main button, hold it down and this sound will go off. (ahhhhhh)  Still, these are the less loved of the two keys sets however, i dont want my 1 year old chewing on metal so i always hand her these first and she seems to like them for awhile on long car rides.
