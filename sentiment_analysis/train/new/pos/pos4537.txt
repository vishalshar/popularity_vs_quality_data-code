I got mine in today and it's really a good deal. We do pigtails a lot so, this is two sets of 20 different colors which is perfect for pigtails. They are a nice size for my two year old, you would probably want bigger for a 5 year old or older unless you want very subtle. They seem well made. It took a little while to get them, but they came earlier than expected. So overall a good purchase.
