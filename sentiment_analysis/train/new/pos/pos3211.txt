The 2 issues are the front wheel can not be fixed as described, making this a 2 in 1 not a 3 in 1. The second is, the rear wheels are 18 inch and not 20 inch as described. BUT, this probuct is perfect for an on the move lifestyle with kids. Storage space is more than most. The suspension works well. It is easy to change from trailor to stroller. Park brake works good too. I got the red and black one, it is easily visible. This meets my requirements with flying colors and the kids love it. I highly recommend this product over others of this kind.
