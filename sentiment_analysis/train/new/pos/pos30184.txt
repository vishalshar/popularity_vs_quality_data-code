Bought this as it was suggested to go with our Delta Children's bassinet. I was nervous that it wouldn't fit the oval shape of the "mattress" that comes with the delta bassinet but it did fine! Washed and dried it with no issues and is nice quality.I will say, the delta bassinet mattress is very flimsy so this can make it bend a little but once I got it inside the bassinet it was fine. Thats more of an issue with the delta bassinet rather than the mattress pad, though.
