my son is lucky enough to have two amazing grandparents who babysit him while my husband and I work.  He loves his napmat, I got it for his first birthday.  I love yo gabba gabba, he loves yo gabba gabba!  sometimes when he's not napping he enjoys just relaxing on it.  I love everything about this...I wish they had one in my size!
