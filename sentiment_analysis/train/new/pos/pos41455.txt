I've seen some previous reviews which describe this cushion as too thin and uncomfortable. I suppose everyone is different, but from my own perspective it is a pretty nice chair cushion set. It's not ultra plush, but is is very soft and nice to sit on. The color is accurate, looks good on any chair really. If you have back problems, go for something thicker for the extra $$$. Otherwise, this is a great buy.
