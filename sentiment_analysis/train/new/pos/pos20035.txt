My 8-month old loves this. He moves quickly with great ease. I love the narrow width frame. Our living areas are pretty tight but this walker allows him to move through tight areas. The seat cover can be removed fairly easy to wash. We have a drop of about an inch from the den to the kitchen. The walker does not allow him to cross the threshold because it's not level with the kitchen floor. It treats the drop like a stair almost and prevents him from moving any further.I would highly recommend this walker.
