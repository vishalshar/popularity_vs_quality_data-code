I really wanted to like this brush. It is the right size and great design for washing out large mouthed bottles such as similac, nuk, or tommee tippee types. It does not scratch the bottles, and cleans the oily milk scum wonderfully. Please note that it will does not fit into medela bottles. So here is where the brush fails: I have placed the brush into the dishwasher for cleaning/sanitizing it about every 10 days. Maybe that was the wrong move, because I noticed today that the sponge material is starting to rip along the seams. I tend to use items to death, but I think this brush is only going to last 2 months. I just expected a longer life from a brand name that I usually find to be of higher quality.
