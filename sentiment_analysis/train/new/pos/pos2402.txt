These are the BEST! I have bought these  many times in the store but I can no longer find them! This is awesome for a baby who is just starting to eat. Don't get them a spoon they will ram it in their throat, poke their eye etc. These are great for cereal, apple sauce, they are easy to grip and hold for little fingers and they can suck on them. They will feel so proud. I let mine hold onto these and then I used a baby spoon to feed them. They then would never grab at my spoon as they had these to use and as they were developmentally ready they would then scoop into the bowl.
