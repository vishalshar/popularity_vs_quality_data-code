I bought this pump in desperate hope, because the Avent pump I was using had unpredictable suction and would bruise my breast, so I stopped pumping and could never leave my baby because I had no milk to give the sitter. The Dr. Brown manual pump was gentle on my nipples and I could express way more than with the Avent one. Plus I don't really have to pay attention. I can watch TV or talk on the phone. I can even do it in near darkness (relaxation helps letdown). I did increase my supply and now I have enough milk to send my baby to grandma's house for three days! One of the features like no other is the nipple compression. It stimulates the letdown similarly to baby's mouth. You can control it with the suction valve. lighter suction means not much nipple compression- harder suction means lots of compression and that can shape the nipple some, but it goes away in a minute. I prefer somewhere in between. I give it an A+!
