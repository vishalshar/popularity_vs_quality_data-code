For my purposes these hampers are perfect (I bought 3). I love the size and slight flexibility in them because the design of my cabinet makes it a tight squeeze around the door hinge and these fit behind it easily. This product is NOT something I would feel comfortable relying on if I had young children trying to use it or if I needed to regularly carry laundry from room to room because it feels a bit delicate; for that you would want a firm plastic style. These sit in my laundry closet and I put the dirty clothes in them while awaiting their turn to go for a swim so these hampers simply corral the clothes in the closet in tidy fashion. They seem to be marketed more as a baby/nursery product and I believe they would suit that purpose fine because, there again, they would be used gently.
