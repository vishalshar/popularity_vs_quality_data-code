These spouts are really good.  I replace them about every 6 months because the get dried out and start to leak through the holes on the nipple.  I hand wash them so they last longer.  As for leaking, I just make sure the spout is seated well in the lid then screw it on.  I use these every day for the nuk active cup and they work great.  The active cups come with the silicone spouts and the silicone ones are terrible!  My little 18month old has bit a whole in them every time I get a new silicone spout on a new cup.  They last about a day.  These work much better.  Don't hesitate to buy these, just hand wash and you will be fine.
