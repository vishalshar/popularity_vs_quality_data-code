I bought these to add to my Smartipants for night time use.  The first few times I tried laying them flat along the diaper on the outside of the pocket.  That worked ok.  Then I tried placing them inside the pocket, again, just ok.  I did some research and other parents had suggested to fold it in half and place where baby seems to be the wettest.  I have a boy so of course I would place the doubler toward the front.  That worked like a charm!  My baby could make it all the way through the night with no leaks.  I would also use this same method for when we would go out in public and again no leaks.  I was also impressed to see that these would agitate out in the wash along with the insert, so there were no extra steps needed when it came to throwing these into the pail.  I really love these because they are soft, thin, and thirsty!  They also dry pretty quick because of the design.  If you try them you won't regret it!
