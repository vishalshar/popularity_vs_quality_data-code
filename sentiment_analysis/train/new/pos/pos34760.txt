If you are looking for a side-by-side stroller, this is a GREAT buy.  I purchased this model because of the low price, and also because it had other good reviews.  It handles BEAUTIFULLY--so easy to push!  This is an excellent stroller for the price!  Aside from the smooth ride, another feature I appreciate is the height of the handlebar.  I am 5'9", and the height of this stroller is perfect.  I have sometimes found that with other strollers, I end up hunched over while I'm pushing.  Not with this one.  Another great feature of this stroller is the fact that both seats can recline individually.  I have a toddler and an infant; I enjoy strolling with my toddler sitting up, and my infant reclined.Initially, I was torn between a side-by-side stroller, and a front-to-back stroller.  I am glad I made this choice.  I was afraid that this stroller would be too wide, but it is not at all.  Like I said, it's very easy to handle.  The stroller does require some assembly, but it was not terribly difficult (you must attach the wheels, cup tray, and foot rest).  The ONLY issue I have with a side-by-side stroller is the fact that my 2-year-old is able to reach and is constantly touching/annoying my infant.  However, I am sure this is an issue that will subside as she gets older and is able to better control herself.I would definitely recommend this stroller; it is affordable and durable!
