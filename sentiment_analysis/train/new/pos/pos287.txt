We have 3 of these seats in our car...actually, two of them are older versions and one is the 570.  We have had them for years and all of our 4 children have used them.  Yeah, now we are down to 3 car seats!I had to write today as we were in a collision yesterday.  The seats preformed beautifully in the worst situation -- a wreck.  The 570 has a different shoulder latch system than the older versions & at first I didn't like them as they are a bit difficult to get used to.  However, after yesterday, I'm so thankful that the shoulder straps in all 3 car seats work as designed.We purchased all 4 compass boosters from Amazon too -- the best prices at the time.  I also have the carrying case and have traveled with it numerous times!Thanks COMPASS!Julie
