I live in the arctic circle (aka Minnesota) so the name of this product was appealing to me. I needed something to protect my 6 month old from the biting winds of the frozen wasteland that is a winter "north of the wall". This cover is easy to use and does a great job keeping my kid from becoming a literal ice princess. The internal fleece blanket is a nice touch, but I also use another fleece blanket inside the cover (over the restraints) to provide her with additional insulation.I would've given this product 5 stars but the face cover doesn't always cover the entire opening so ice demons are able to sneak in during the occasional 60 mile per hour polar vortex shenanigans we experience here on a regular basis.Summary: If you are a parent who lives on a god forsaken barren rock of ice and snow then 1) reconsider your life choices, and 2) buy this cover now.
