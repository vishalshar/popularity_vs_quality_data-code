We bought this stroller a year ago (March 2011) and it's been great for us. We've taken it to street festivals, a hilly university campus, the museum, the state fair, etc.1. The wheels are study and roll over everything we've walked on.2. Love how you can roll the back up and down (depending on weather). It seems to keep my little one much cooler in the summer.3. It's light and folds small. Easy to transport. Easy to open. Easy to close.4. Saddle bags are great. We keep toys on one side and snacks on the other.In response to other reviews:1. Our cup holder works just fine. I usually have a 20 ounce bottle of water in it. Maybe people are trying to put large to-go cups in there? I've never had any issues.2. I don't think it's narrow at all. My little one is 33 inches, 25 pounds and he fits just fine. Maybe he won't fit when he's 3 years old...I don't know.3. My stroller has never tipped over. Not once. And I have a stroller bag hanging on the back (see below)Recommendation - buy a stroller bag that you can velcro on to the handles. We have this Jeep Stroller Tote Bag http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CUYZ76/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title and it works great.
