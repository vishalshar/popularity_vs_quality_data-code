The Econobum diaper cover is the less-expensive version of the Flip diaper.  It is built cheaper in a few ways, of which I do not think it affects the effectiveness of the product: there are one row of straps (instead of two), the PUL seems thinner, and it doesn't have the flaps to hold the liner in place (although, I don't find this particularly useful).When I use the diaper covers, I fold a flat, prefold, or fitter diaper, and secure it with a Snappi.  Then, I place the diaper cover on top.  I think this actually is nicer than the Flip diapers for placing over a thicker diaper.  I have been using this set-up for a little over three months, and I have bought a number of different brands of diaper covers (Thirsties, Dappi, Flip, Kushies, FuzzyBums, and Happy Heinies), and these are some of the better ones, especially since they are cheaper than some other brands.Overall, the cover is great.  It fits well on the baby, and over the various diapers that I use.  It holds everything in well, and has held-up in the wash.One of the main differences in covers I have seen is, the covers with some soft fabric between the baby and the PUL, and the covers that are just PUL.  For the most part, I like the ones with no extra fabric, since the covers can be wiped-off and reused, when needed.  This is one of those.The prefold that comes with it is very thick, and could definitely be used on an older child.  Just, it seems rather large for a small baby.  Also, it is intended to be folded up and used more like an insert, than a prefold.  That is, the wait it is sewn is not to be folded around the baby and secured with a pin or snappi.  It is meant to be folded in thirds and placed inside of the cover.  I use it, sometimes.  I only have one prefold, so it comes up in the pile once in a while.  I usually use it as a pad for under her during "diaper-free time".Over all, a great deal.
