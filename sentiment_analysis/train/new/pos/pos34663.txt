I have several Halo sacks which are good but I was looking for one that was heavier without it being fleece and had more versatility. This one fit the bill on all things. It has so many different zippers to let the feet out or venting it was super flexible in that mode.The material feels like a comfy old sweatshirt so its warm but not over powering like the fleece sacks.I love the colors although the chocolate looks more like a washed out black.Pro: Versatile product, many different ways to use and get your baby out/in the sack. Sweatshirt material, especially soft and super comfy. Zippers are super durable no issue with them splitting. Product is strong and very well put together.Cons: the only one I have is so small in the grand scheme of things. The Chocolate polka dots fade really bad. They use to be black more then brown and have faded to a really light black, I never saw chocolate brown in the dots ever.I love this product and really wish it came in an XL size for the next size up!
