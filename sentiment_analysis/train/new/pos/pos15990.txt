Five babies later, I can say with certainty that these are the best pacifiers made. I've had babies that are not big pacifier fans and these are the only ones they will take. I encourage pacifiers since my babies were going to suck on something (me, their fingers, other objects) and I would prefer they suck on something that I can wash and that I can take away when the time is right. Mam pacifiers are also the only ones with a bulbous end that makes them stay in a little better than other brands. For example, soothies are tapered in a way that makes them slip right out and the handles on avents make babies instinctively grab them and pull them out. The final pros for these? The absolutely adorable designs! This is the best price you can possibly find these for, just hope you win the lottery and get boy pacifiers for your boy. The boy ones are still neutral enough for your girl, however.
