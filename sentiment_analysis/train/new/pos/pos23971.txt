Love this chair!  All the screws worked fine on mine must be a defect on some. Theres no way the cover can slip if its on right, it goes on super tight over the vibrater and straps around the back too. Absolutely love that it can be used as a seat when their older and i dont just have to get rid of it when she grows:)
