My wife and I just had our second baby and wanted to try and save come money by using washable nursing pads. The firs kind we tried were simply 5 layers of organic cotton TL Care 6 Pack Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, they soaked through and just were not very absorbent. We got these to try an found them to be satisfactory. Granted we are comparing them against disposables which are very absorbent, but these work well enough for daily use. The are more absorbent than the 5 layer cotton, my wife says she would recommend them, and I am getting ready to order a couple more packs of them myself.update 03-03-2013, we now have 8 packs of these total, my wife goes through them in about 5 days give or take. We found that ordering a mesh bag to put the dirties in and wash them in(so they don't get lost)has been invaluable an recommend this bag Honey-Can-Do LBG-01145 Lingerie Wash Bag, White. We plan on buying several more bags. Also my wife recommends using disposables while out of the house in general, but for in the home day to day use these are great. She recommends these disposables Lansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 4), as they are a bit more absorbent and larger than others, and come in individual baggies for ease of transport.
