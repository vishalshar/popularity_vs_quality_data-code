At last, I'm free of the constant sound of rattling closet doors as the cats force their way in. My clean sheets are also  free of the signs of little "cat burglars" sneaking in to shed on everything and scale their way up to hang out on the top shelf of the linen closet.Nothing I tried previously had stopped them for long. Door stops jammed under each side? They were soon flipping around the house as cat toys. The big twist ties across both door pulls to hold the doors closed? You rattle those enough and they'll come untwisted (or someone has to get up and chase you away AGAIN before they do). Plus all that was ugly and inconvenient for the humans who actually needed to use the closets.I'd checked around the baby-proofing sections of several local stores looking for something for bi-fold doors, but never found anything. Finally I found these online. At just one to a package it starts to add up when you have a lot of closets (you'll need two per closet), but I have to say it was well worth it in the end. The cats have 98% given up on even trying, and peace has returned.It comes with a spacer that lets you adjust for 3 different widths of doors. This is a bit of a challenge to slide on, but once I'd figured out the first one I was able to set up the rest of them pretty easily. I had one closet where the doors initially sat a bit too high for the slider to go on top, but the package includes instructions on how to adjust the doors. It's true the locks are pretty much just cheap plastic, but this is something you're only going to think about when you're holding them in your hand, not while they're on top of  your doors mostly out of sight. Once in place, they are inconspicuous and move easily in and out of position. In the locked position, my doors will not move at all. Just what I needed.
