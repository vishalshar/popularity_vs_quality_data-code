I love this set. I just got this for a baby shower, and I was excited to see all the products that I used most frequently for feeding my kids from 6 months to about a year and a half old. I dont remember being able to find a comprehensive set like this and had purchased all of this individually. The funny thing is that I had the more advanced/electronic feeding systems (bullet/etc.) but I always went back to this basic hand grinder. You can back it in your purse or diaper bag and be able to feed your child cheap and easy from whatever your eating (encourages moms to eat healthy!). Jars of baby food are expensive and ultimatley tasteless and low quality. It was nice for me as a busy working mom to feed my children well in a manner that didnt require me to always make seperate recipes/food. I also love the tasters bag items. My boys could munch on hard fruits and veggies without any fear of choking; which i also used much more than the offical teethers. I would simply place frozen grapes or even pickles (my boys loved) and they would get the relief they needed and a tasty treat :)Great product. Fantastic baby shower gift
