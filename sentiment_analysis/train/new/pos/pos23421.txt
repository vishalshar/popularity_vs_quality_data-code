I know these are for babies, but I am a full grown woman and love them as a panty liner. I am super sensitive and only wear cotton undies. I recently had to use some medication and needed to wear a pad. All the commercial pads caused me great discomfort so I went looking for an alternative. I looked at the cloth period pads for women but they were soooo expensive and all kinds of crazy colors. I was not bleeding I just needed something to protect my undies from the medication I was using.These are a little bigger than needed but I do not mind. They did shrink up a little when washed and dried but not much. I am hoping like some others reported that they will shrink after I wash them a few times.The contour of these work perfectly and do not bunch up in my underwear. They are thick enough that you could use them for a light period or light bladder leakage. If you are a tiny women these might be too big to use them the way I did.The fabric is soft layers of cotton flannel. They are super comfy. They wash up nicely too.I felt these were a great value. I paid under $13 for ten of them so you really can not beat the price, especially for my uses.Not sure how they work for babies, but I love them as a panty linerThanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks
