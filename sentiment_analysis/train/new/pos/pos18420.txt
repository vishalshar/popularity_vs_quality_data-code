Our son Charlie LOVES Comotomo. He's an early teether, so at 3 months he started the finger chewing and excessive drooling. We started trying different teething options, hoping to avoid a finger sucking habit and to give him some teething relief. So far, we've tried:1. Comotomo2. Manhattan Toy Winkel Rattle and Sensory Teether - Charlie loves it.3. Munchkin Fun Ice Chewy Teether - Newer for us but Charlie definitely took interest in the cool sensation. Wish the fingers were wider.4. Sophie the Giraffe Vulli So'Pure Teether - Charlie has expressed little interest in this one.5. Chewy Tubes Knobby Super Chew Red - This is a mislabeled product that is not really a teether and not safe for children under 7 months.Comotomo and Winkel are Charlie's favorites. They now come everywhere with us.The Comotomo is made of a soft rubber with four finger shaped ends that Charlie loves to chew. It's the perfect length to access molars without gagging the little one and the ring at the top is just big enough to allow him to grip it with one or both hands. This was one of the first things Charlie would proactively grab and pick up. I recommend buying a few so you always have one on hand!
