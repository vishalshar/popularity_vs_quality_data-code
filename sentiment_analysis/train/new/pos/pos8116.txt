I had NO CLUE how bad engorgement actually was until I was home for the hospital and walking around like I had glass in my bra (TMI?). I scoured Amazon's website for a product that would relieve the pain and stumbled across this. It was well worth the money to have it delivered the next day. It provides instant relief from engorgement pain. I mean INSTANT. I keep it in the refrigerator (as suggested by the manufacturer). The scent is a bit strong, but fades over time. I will be buying this for upcoming baby showers as it is one of those things you will never hear of or know you need until you really need it. I don't have to use it as much now, but once I stop breastfeeding, I am sure it will come in handy again.
