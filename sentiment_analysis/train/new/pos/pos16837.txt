When found out I was having twins, this pillow was on the list of recommended gear, so I got it. I have one older boy who I never used a boppy or anyhting with because I found them in the way so I can say I was skeptical at best, but having never had twins, I thought I better defer to experts. THEY WERE RIGHT! I'm a big fan of individually nursing my twins because I feel it gives me better bonding time, but for those many, many times that they have other plans (like not wanting to wait for the other to be done to eat, or they wake at the same time and are both crying for food,) it has saved my life, and probably my sanity.The sturdy foam makes it easy to hold them up at the same time. You have to do relatively litte to no lifting. My twins love the soft material and the cover is nice to have since you are having to expose everything at once, but if you don't want it on, its removeable. It simply makes life with twins so much easier (and every bit helps.)My olny problems were that the cover gets in the way if your not using it (the side storage doesn't work very well.) So I usually just take it off when I'm at home. Also my twins are now 8 months old and the pillow is starting to sink (my 2 yr old jumping on it didn't help that.) Finally, the back pillow is pretty much manditory if you are smaller but doesn't stay in place very well unless you are leaning back on it. None of them are so bad that they would cause me more than a minor inconvenience.Overall I think that the product is great, and I would recommend it to anyone.  I would even use it if I had just one baby becase it is so sturdy and easy to hold your baby up high enough to reach your breast (the failing the boppy had was that it was too low down for my long torso.)
