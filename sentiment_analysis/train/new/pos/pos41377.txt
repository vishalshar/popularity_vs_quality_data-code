The thought of a necklace healing my daughter's teething pain was a bit hokey to me. And I continue to get strange looks when I explain the necklace to others. But I'm not waking up in the middle of the night to give my child medicine for the pain. I'm not waking up at all.I found out about this necklace when my daughter was about 9 months old, she already suffered through 8 teeth and several dosings of Tylenol. I figured I had nothing to lose, it was a harmless, all natural approach, and if it didn't work, at least it was cute. She's currently 11 months old, wearing the necklace around the clock (especially at night when her teething pain was always the worst). She is cutting 4 molars at once. MOLARS! I didnt even know until I saw a little white peeping through. She's been sleeping 11 hours straight through the night and napping beautifully all day. I haven't given her a dose of anything in over a month and a half. I'm impressed!Give it a shot. Allow the body to warm the necklace and the succinic acid to be released into the bloodstream. THIS is where the relief comes from. It's not magic, it won't work like a cloak of miracles draped around their neck. Leave it on to get the best results. It's all natural and won't tax the liver like most pain relivers. Give the Tylenol a rest!
