I wanted a metal cup for my daughter to avoid plastic. I did a lot of research and this was the only one I could find that had a straw instead of a sippy spout. My daughter is 9 months old and has no problem drinking out of it. It occasionally leaks when left on it side for a long time, but she only drinks water out of it so its not a problem. She can easily pick it up with the handles too. I would recommend it.
