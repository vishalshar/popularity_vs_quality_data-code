I just started using this car seat for my six month old and I love it. She is so secure and safe. Also, she likes that it sits up higher and she can look out the window. When you first get it out of the box, its a little overwhelming. Lots of belts and adjustments! I actually watched a few videos on the britax site and you tube to make sure I had alll the settings right and installed correctly in my suv. Definitely worth the price to know my princess is safe!
