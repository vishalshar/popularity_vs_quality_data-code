So incredibly sweet. I purchased this over 5 years ago for my little boy when he was a baby. This has been my favorite baby company for years, and I just realized how well made and long lasting these toys are now that my baby daughter plays with them now, and they look just as they did when I first purchased them.These types of toys are perfect for babies and toddlers, and also make the perfect gift. I couldn't find any information on Amazon about whether or not the coloring used is non-toxic, but the Under The Nile website give a little more in-depth description of the product: "NO Azo colorants, BPA, flame retardants, formaldehyde, fragrance, PVC or lead".This is one of those toys I am going to keep forever because of how much my kids have used it, and I am happy to know that it will stay in great condition despite the constant use it's gotten for years. I can't recommend this set enough!
