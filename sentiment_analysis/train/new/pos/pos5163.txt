This bib is perfect, or as close to perfect as a bib can get!!1) The bib has a huge pouch that stays open- The pouch on this bib is long and wide. It catches almost everything, making cleanup a breeze! My kids almost never drop anything into their laps because this bib catches it in its pouch. Other bibs I have tried (Bjorn, Tommy Tippee and others), have a smaller, less wide pouch. Or I have tried other bibs where the pouch folds in and doesn't stay open, so it doesn't catch enough dropped food.2) Maintains its shape, does not stain - This bib is made of sturdy yet flexible rubber. It has maintained its shape perfectly despite daily use over the last year. It also does not stain. My Tommy Tippee bib is stained from pasta sauce but this bib has not stained, nor has it faded or changed color.3) It is wider than other bibs- this bib overall is wider than my Tommy Tippee bib so it catches more drips.4) It rests comfortably on baby- with the Tommy Tippee bib my kids sometimes pull at it to take it off because the thinner plastic can aggravate their neck. Whereas, this bib has soft thick rubber that does not aggravate their necks when they wear it.5) Conveniently folds up for travel- you can just roll this bib up and stick it into your diaper bag. The ability to roll it up is a great space saving feature!When I buy extra bibs, the Summer Infant Bippity is the only one I buy!
