Very handy little straps. My 7 month old loves to throw things on the floor and these are just the thing to keep me from bending over several times each minute. Each strap is durable with five snaps (2 male, 3 female) to adjust length ranging from 10-11 inches. Although other reviewers thought the straps were too short, I feel these are appropriate lengths. If they were longer they would get too close to the ground when in the stroller. Buying the 8-pack also allows you to double up if you need to. I keep a set on the highchair, stroller, carseat, and in the diaper bag. The snaps are strong which is nice that my son cannot un-snap them himself. They fit around almost any toy and my Phillips Avent Bottles perfectly. The colors I received were 4 navy, 2 light blue, and 2 red, so if you're looking for specific colors you may want to buy each set individually. My only hesitation is nervousness the edges may start to fray with continued use. However, we've been using these for three months now and they don't show any signs of wear. Will update the review if anything changes.
