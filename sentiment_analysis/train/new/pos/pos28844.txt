This is the second Diaper Disposal we've purchased from The First Years and is an exact replacement to the first. We have this located in a restroom off our main family room and, with the exception of a few seconds after adding each diaper, almost never smell any odors from the device. We do change the bag a bit more frequently then needed as the disposal is slightly deeper then it needs to be which will tend to hold the closure mechanism open once the bag is slightly over half full. That being said, the ability for this device to conceal the odors has far exceeded my expectations.The reason for the 4-star review is the attachment device holding the lid to the back of the unit isn't strong enough to withstand daily use for a number of years. As the bag fills up, the tension on the closure device increases which increases the tension on these brackets causing them to break off prematurely. I glued these back on, using JB Weld to our first device and it held for some time but eventually gave way. Despite this issue I would highly recommend this product as the best Diaper Disposal on the market.
