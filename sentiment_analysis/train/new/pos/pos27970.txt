I bought these (The First Years Take and Toss 28-Piece Feeding Variety Pack) back in November of 2015.  Back then my son was 7 months old.  These are very light weight, cheap and convenient.  They come in blue, red, green, yellow, and orange.  They work pretty well with boys anyway.The sippy cups are the ones we use the most out of this set.  It is just a cup with a regular sippy cup top.  There is no special parts that slow the flow of the liquid, nor threads or clips to keep them from opening up.  If your baby drops it to the floor full of liquid, chances are it will bust open and all the contents will be every where.  With that said, our son has dropped these cups multiple times and only once it busted open.  If you turn the cup upside down with the lid on it WILL spill.  However, they are very lightweight and easy for little ones to hold and lift.  (Not to add they fit in his car seat's cup holder!!)The containers are great to carry food in.  I usually fill them up with cut up fruit, yogurt, or other snacks and put them in the fridge for the hubs to feed him while I am at work.  The lids fit very well on them.I would recommend these if your kid goes to daycare since you don't have to search for pairing, just pop the first one you pull out, don't matter the color, and it works!  They are cheap that if they lose them you can just buy more; and again, you don't have to worry about matching everything.Even after a year these look pretty good still.The only thing I would complain about the spout is rather hard to clean, since liquid (milk specially) can get dried up in there and leave residue behind.  We do not have a dish washer so we usually rinse them up, or use a brush to wash the spouts with.They do have their cons, but for the price and convenience I give these four and half stars... but since I can't half a star, 5 it is.
