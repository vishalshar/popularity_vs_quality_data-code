I really wished I could of used this baby carrier more than a month or two but the fact that my son is a big baby, his legs outgrew the part where the legs hang out. It started to leave marks on his legs because it was too tight for him so I only used it for about 1 1/2. I believe if I would have ordered it as soon as he was born, I could of used it a little more months.
