I just got this today, so if anything about my opinion changes I'll come back and edit.The set is absolutely adorable! I can't wait to set up our nursery with this.One note: The description says it comes with certain pieces, but the set I got did not contain a baby bib or hat, but had baby socks.  I didn't really care too much, but if you're counting on getting exactly what's in the set, be forewarned.
