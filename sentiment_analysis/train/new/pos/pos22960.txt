My 3 month old, 17lb-et still sleeps comfortably in this but with a tightly folded blanket under him for additionally support. When he's in it it almost looks like the bottom is touching the floor because it sinks in so low...but hoping the 20lb weight limit holds out. I really love the incline for his reflux. A bit tricky to figure out how to take off the cover but once you get it, it's off and back on quick for easy washing. And I love the mesh sides! Breathe able and less worry that he will turn and not be able to breathe. Overall it's a "suggest to friends" definite!
