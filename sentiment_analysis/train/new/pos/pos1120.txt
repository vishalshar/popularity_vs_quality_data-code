Great seat for an infant who can hold their head up but still needs support in a sitting position. My son is able to sit and play with toys in the Pod--although they have to be tall enough that he can grasp them, as he cannot reach the floor while in the seat. I also did not realize beforehand that you cannot add on a tray to this style--it does not have the white twist-off pommel. I was planning on adding the tray when my son was a little older and would have snacks there, but that is not possible with this style. That was disappointing (it should be noted in the description), but overall we are pleased with the seat.
