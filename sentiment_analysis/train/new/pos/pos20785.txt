I just bought the Graco Ready2Grow double stroller, but it had a terrible flaw. My diaper bag shoulder straps were too short, making it impossible to hang. Additionally, due to its large size, it didn't fit in the basket well. :(I decided to try out the Think King hooks to see if they would work to make the bag hang UNDER the parent tray. They are PERFECT!  They seem very secure, and tight, and the hooks are laying flat against the parent tray, (see my picture) versus sticking out like they are in the main Amazon picture (which I didn't like.)I can't speak to their durability yet, as our baby doesn't arrive until next month, but the fact that it fits nicely, and holds the weight has me breathing a sigh of relief!
