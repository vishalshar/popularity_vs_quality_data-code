Great concept! I purchased this set as a birthday gift for my son when he turned 3. He was in the thick of the picky, too-busy-playing-to-eat phase, and this does help him focus at the dinner table. The pusher utensil is great. The fork is well designed, too, because the tines are straight, thin, and pointy. So many kid forks are blunt, making them nearly impossible to use.My only complaint (why I gave 4 instead of 5 starts) is that there isn't a whole lot of room for the FOOD on this plate, once you put the three utensils on. If you leave the utensils off, you can put more food on the plate, but you know a hungry 3-yr-old will cry if you don't put the utensils on the plate just so.There's room for about 4 bites of food--one bite per section on the plate. Other than that, a good product. Good quality justifies the high price.
