Son received this blanket as gift and used regularly for 18 mos. The softness held up through weekly washing and drying. The decal is only in one corner of the blanket, so the product does not feel like a tribute to Disney character worship. The green rim of blanket separated because of heavy use; we liked the product well enough to purchase a 2nd replacement. Enjoy!
