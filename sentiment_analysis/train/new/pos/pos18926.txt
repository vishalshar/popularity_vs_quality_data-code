The power button is a little sensitive. I have figured out that if you touch it lightly and hold down for a few sec it works like a charm. I was pressing it too hard assuming it was like everything else you buy and have to smash the buttons down to get them to work. I haven't had any problems with ours. We also use a sound machine that runs all night long while our baby is sleeping. I did notice that if I turn the sound machine on any sound except ocean the monitor is silent except when she moves around or cries. If I put the sound machine on ocean I can hear everything in her room without the monitor going silent. I like being able to hear everything. The microphone on the monitor is sensitive and does pick up every sound in her room all the time (even when the monitor is silent) I am not sure if this is because we have tile floors so all the noise is amplified or not.We have the sound machine next to the crib and the monitor across the room on top of the dresser. The battery life seems to last a long time. Although I have noticed that the monitor will not charge when its turned off. So when I want it to charge quickly I leave the monitor on and plugged in but I turn off the sound and it charges back up very quickly. I like the monitor and would recommend it to others.
