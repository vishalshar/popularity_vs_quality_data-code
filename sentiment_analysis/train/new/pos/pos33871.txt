My husband and I are expecting our first child (a girl!) in September and absolutely love the water. What we didn't love was the lack of underwater themed nursery sets. I was a little worried about how the quality of this set would be in person with the price being so low but most of the reviews were wonderful so I said 'what the heck'. I couldn't be happier with my purchase!!!! My husband loves it and he hardly shows emotion about anything! Lol! As others have said, there are a few loose strings to cut off but that doesn't bother me. Everything is super soft and absolutely gorgeous. I've already washed it all with cold water on light spin and tumble dry... it held together and none of the colors ran. The coloring matches what's shown perfectly. I'm so excited and can't wait for our Princess to start having her own little underwater adventures with this set!
