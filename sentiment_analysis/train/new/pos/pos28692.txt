I bought this for my baby (2 months old) to help him with his acid reflux.  I looked at its web page and a video, and saw it was very upright on its tallest position  (I think it has 45 degrees inclination).  I liked it a lot.  He can sit there very straight, not laying as in bouncers or swings.  Although he is very young and his neck is not as strong as to hold his head perfectly, he stays on the onfour nicely.  It is lightweight, lime color not too bright, and in general I am very pleased with my purchase.
