I got these for my 2 year old son for Christmas. These are perfect for him as he is learning his colors, abc & 123s, and just to identify animals and other objects. He is in the "what's that" stage lol. These are perfect for any were not just the bath! (I don't recommend putting all of both packs in the bathtub.. That's a bit much, lol) however since they are foam and water safe it does make it easy to allow them to bring to the tub or pool and makes them easy to clean off if they get dirty! And so far they seem to be quite durable, even for those destructive toddlers. I'm very pleased with these even for out of tub play! (I'm thinking a little play box full for him on his toy shelf instead) Will update after I've had them a while or if problems occur(:
