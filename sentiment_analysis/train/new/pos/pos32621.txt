i put this item on my registry and sure enuf, recieved it... and i'm glad i did.  although it is true that the pockets can be a bit crammed, you'd be surprised at what i have been able to put in it:  the outside back pocket has my mini photo album ( yes 4x6's), a small toy, a bottle of sunscreen, and my digital camera.  the outside front pocket holds a pacifier, batteries ( at least 2 AA's), a spoon, some gum, and tissues.  The inside front pocket holds 3 of his towels, and 3 bibs.  The inside middle pocket holds 7 diapers, the wet-wipe box, diaper rash ointment, tylenol, and extra dry cloth-napkins ( about 5) that can be used if i run out of wet- wipes.  The inside back pocket holds a disposable camera; a mini bath set ( including lotion, shampoo, powder, etc.); a grooming kit; another album;a pair of socks; a pair of mittens; a jacket; 2 onesie type shirts- 1 long-sleeve, 1 short; 1 set of overalls; an extra t-shirt; a bottle of baby food, and another toy. and, i still have room to add other items.  ( i think there were more items, i just can't remember at the moment).  so to sum up my long review, it is crammed but not bad if u make good use of the room.  oh did i mention i love the fact that it could be converted from a shoulder- purse to a backpack.  finally, i guess i should add that my son is 8 months old...
