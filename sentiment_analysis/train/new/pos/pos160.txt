My co-worker had triplets and we wanted to get him a gift that would help him out on having triplets. He and his wife could not afford a stroller and was going to settle for a two stroller. I looked on-line and found that Amazon had the best deal! For $400.00 including shipping and taxes, we could not go wrong! So we all chipped in and bought this great stroller. It arrived in three days and we were amazed at the quality of the stroller. It was well equipped and had all the safety mechanisms possible. There is enough room for seating and very well padded all around. My co-worker was thrilled and really appreciated the gift! We call it "The Limousine of strollers"! It was money well spent because it folded up very compact and could fit in the car! I would recommend for anyone with triplets!
