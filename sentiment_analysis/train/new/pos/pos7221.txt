I love having trays for both my daughters, but it really should come standard with the double stroller. It does stick out a bit, so it makes it a little difficult to reach for their sippy cups but it's not too bad. The arms of the trays come apart so it makes it easy to fit in a bag or luggage for travel. At the same time it sucks that it comes in three different parts because shouldn't a snack tray come in one solid piece? Oh well. The cup holder itself is deep enough to hold a cup so that it doesn't wiggle around when you're pushing the stroller. I do wish that the tray would swivel around from one side so that it makes it easier for the child to get in and out of the stroller. My 3 1/2 yr old climbs out from underneath the tray while my 2 yr old climbs over it. Overall, I'm satisfied with it and would recommend the trays.
