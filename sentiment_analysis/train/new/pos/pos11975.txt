i bought this with my stroller and i only jus got both of them last wk so i haven't had to use it yet i live in the caribbean where it rains a lot so i know ill have to use it at some point and when i do ill update this review but other than that it fits the stroller perfectly and the quality of the actual material is great doesn't look or feel like the cheap material well worth every cent i paid for. everything i purchased from maxi cosi or quinny i love they are always well made and look really nice and i always get great compliments on them. i recommend this to all quinny stroller owners.
