I bought this product because it holds 4 dividers instead of 3. I don't have a hard time twisting it to go to the other divider for the formula, but it is a bit hard to open. I do not sterilize this for, I think, it is not in the instructions to do so. I just clean it with mild soap and warm water and leave it out to air dry. I have read in other reviews that it only holds 2 scoops. No it does not. It holds upto 4 scoops of formula. The powder comes out fine especially when you tap it in the bottle, unlike what the other review said. Another review complained about the color, which I thought was kinda weird. The color looks fine for me. The dispenser is a bit large than normal, but probably because its a 4-divider dispenser.I did not give it a 5-star because it is hard to open and you are worrying you might spill the powder inside if you are trying to open it. But all in all, a good value for the money.
