This was only $36 here on Amazon, and the Kolcraft toddler mattress at Wal-Mart for $39 isn't as nice. I now own each (I bought the Kolcraft one in Dec 2013), and this one is a little softer and fits the toddler bed better. It seems more comfy, too. I'm completely satisfied with this mattress for my 3.5-year-old's toddler bed!
