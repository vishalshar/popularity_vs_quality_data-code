So far it works relatively well, but as other reviewers have pointed out, it seems to push them forward a bit, which is both awkward and messy since it seems to encourage more spit-up.  We put a book under the front to tilt her back.  Maybe this will get better as she grows longer and leaner - right now she's a chunky 3-month old!  The safety instructions say minimum 4-months, but I know the daycares start babies in Bumbos around 2-months, so I'm not sure why the difference.  We only put her in it a few minutes at a time right now.  Also, she seems to completely fill it out at only 3-months and she's average height and weight for her age, so I hope she doesn't grow out of it too soon.
