My baby (now 10 months old) loves this monkey so much, that when we press on the sound & music button on its cheek when she is bored\crying\moody - in just one second she will be smiling and clapping! We've got this toy about 6 months ago and it is still very much in use. She will even try to repeat the monkey sounds! ^_^It plays short tunes and make monkey sounds every time you press on it's cheek. She still didn't figure out how to play it herself though.The factory's batteries are long lasting till this day.The tail is holding on tide as long as you use the butterfly on its' end correctly (on an angel).I would have bought it again and again just to see that smile on my baby's face!
