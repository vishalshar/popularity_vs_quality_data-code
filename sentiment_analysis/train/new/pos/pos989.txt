I bought this baby montior for its 2 way feature, and I absolutely love it. My son in 2.5 and since the move he sleeps upstairs from me so I use the 2 way to let him know im on my way.Ive never had a problem with static or interferience. Ive used several baby monitors since my son has been born and this is by far the abslulute best!ITs crystal clear and i can even hear my son snore.
