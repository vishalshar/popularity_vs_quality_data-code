First time mom here. Ordered this at a steal of a price (only $12.99 over the holidays) and it's high quality has impressed me. It's so very cute and well made. Strong fabric with such a cute design. Fits my standard crib mattress perfectly but after washing and drying, it was a little snug. I recommend drying on low heat and removing before completely dry. My dryer was only working on the high heat setting so it was my fault it shrunk. Great sheet! Hopefully using it for years to come since my crib converts to a toddler bed.
