The gate is solid, and it was fairly easy to install.  My 1-year-old daughter hates it with the burning fury of a thousand suns, so it seems to be doing its job well.  It also looks great and blends right into the end of our hallway.However, the screws that come with it are abysmal.  The recess on the head of each screw is too shallow to properly seat your screwdriver, so you'll end up stripping the screw almost instantly.  It doesn't help that the metal is soft as a sponge.Overall, it's a good gate.  Just be sure you have your own screws on hand to mount it to the wall.  You'll need them.
