I noted some reviews said these didn't crawl but I ordered them anyways.  The fact of the matter is it depends on what surface you place them on.  If you put them on a wall with flat paint then they stick, but don't crawl.  If you put them on a door frame with gloss paint then they crawl very nicely and look very, very, lifelike.  Basically they will crawl on any shiny or glass like surface, some painted areas work, but some don't (gloss paint best).  I put one on a door frame, and it totally looked like a real roach crawling downward and absolutely terrified the person I was pranking...was hilarious.  The crawling action is lifelike in that they crawl a little, then stop...crawl some more, etc.).  I think these are great and worth the investment for me based upon the first prank I did!!
