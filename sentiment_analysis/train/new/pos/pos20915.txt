We bought this bag for our trip to Florida to protect our Graco Mosaic umbrella stroller.  It served it's purpose for the most part.  Both times when we got off the plane the stroller was not waiting for us because the airlines thought it was regular baggage despite having the gate check tag on it.  So we had to wait quite a bit to get our stroller.  The stroller still was beaten up a bit despite being in the bag.  This is probably more than airlines fault than the bag.  When we were waiting for them to find our stroller Delta told us it was with the golf clubs.  So I don't know if it was even with the other strollers or thrown around with the other luggage.  Southwest airlines had the same problem with the bag. Makes me think that it might have more rough handling with it being in the bag than without it. So I guess until more people start using bags on their strollers this will probably be the issue with stroller bags.  The bag itself is very well made and held up great during travel.
