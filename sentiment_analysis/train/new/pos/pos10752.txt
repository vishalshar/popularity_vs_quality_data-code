I received the bibs I ordered quickly, just in time for a baby shower I was about to attend. The first thing I noticed was the minimal packaging. The less waste in our landfills, the better. Besides, why do manufacturers feel they need to use Fort Knox-like packaging material for unbreakable items? The second thing I noticed, and this might be weird, is that the bibs didn't smell. I am very sensitive to certain types of smells, so I found myself bracing for the stench of chemicals when I opened the simple plastic wrapper. Nothing!The bibs are much more flexible than I thought they may be. When my children were young, back in the 80s, they had similar bibs, but they were made of a hard plastic. I was pleasantly surprised to see how far they've come in designing a better bib. I also like the adjustable band, which is flexible and easy to adjust. What I REALLY like about the bib is the fact that you can just throw it in the dishwasher! How convenient!As a former teacher who receives several baby shower invitations a year, I am going to keep these on hand as a quick addition to the gift baskets I like to put together for my students who become parents.
