I am more than happy with my recent purchase. I thought the crib was pretty online. ..it's even more beautiful up close. The size is perfect for an infant up to 1 1/2 to 2 years depending on when they are big enough to get their little foot up over the side to climb out themselves.  It's a sturdy and we'll made crib. It's easy to set up and down. We will use ours for a cradle and when baby gets bigger...around 5 months we plan on using the crib for our babies bed. The pad that comes with is OK for those first few months. We may buy the thicker pad accessory when baby gets heavier. For now, the pad is plenty comfy.  We tried using a standard pillow case and sliding the pad inside, also using a Carters keep me Dry Flannel to protect the pad from moisture ( spit up, urine, diaper leaks etc.) and what everyone else is saying is true. The pillow case fits perfectly as a fitted sheet. We love this little crib! Nothing to complain about from us :) Thanks for a great product!
