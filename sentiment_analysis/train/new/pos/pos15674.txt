As other reviewers have said, this is not a "fitted" mattress pad.  It is a flat sheet style that will cover the top of the mattress, but not wrap around the sides.I actually bought this for my dog's kennel bed.  I wanted something waterproof to protect the dog bed itself in case of accident.  It is the perfect width for a 42' kennel, but is obviously a little long.  However, it is easy to just tuck the ends underneath the dog bed.  I then covered the matteress pad with a special fitted sheet I had made for the dog bed.I have not washed the mattress pad yet, so I can't say how it will hold up when laundered.  But so far, it's working well for me.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars was that I was hoping it would be a bit more fluffy/cuddly on top of the waterproof layer.  It's not bad, but it's not much padding either.
