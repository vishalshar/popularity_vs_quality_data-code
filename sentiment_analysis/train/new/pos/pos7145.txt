putting in a pet or kid gate in isn't exactly an inspiring job.  Most of the gates out there are either plastic, flimsy, painful to use, etc.  One just hopes one can find a gate that is reliable enough, doesn't detract from overall house appearance, and easy to install.  The kidco wood safety gate seems to be the best of the bunch, at least for bottom the stairs installation.  It matches in fine with wooden rails.  When locked, it is very stable and not even a medium sized dog is going to be able to push it down.  Drawbacks -- the supplied manual/instructions suck, but you don't really need them.  Add on extensions work very well.  Took ~30 minutes for us to install and we're hoping it will last at least 10 years.  I'll update this review if it doesn't.
