I found this item thrifting but I think it's totally cute. Our four year old loves it. I wouldn't be worried about a baby playing with it (some mentioned the tail and key could wrap about child's neck?) I wouldn't leave a baby or young kid along playing with any toys regardless so I don't see it as issue. The legs are not hard to squeeze maybe for an infant. It's cute and fun.
