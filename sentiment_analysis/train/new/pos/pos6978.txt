I purchased these for my Medela Pump In Style (bought in 2010) since my original tubes had mold in them. These tubes fit well and the price is much cheaper then the Medela tubes. When disconnecting the tubes, sometimes the tube separates from its plastic tip. Not a big deal since you can push the tip back in, otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
