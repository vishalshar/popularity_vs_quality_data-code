I just love the Party in the Tub. I have a 4 year old and usually loves taking a bath. But we live in Minnesota so during the winter I try to give her oatmeal baths or some other type of moisturizing bath to help keep her skin from drying out. Well both types of baths require a kid to stay in a little while to get a benefit and they can also be messy so not something I really want her to take her barbies into. Picking oatmeal out of Barbie hair is not fun. Trust me. So we saw this Party in the Tub on tv and my daughter just had to have it. I got it. Did not have much confidence in this thing working let alone last more than a few baths. Well we've owned ours for over 8 months and my daughter is still using it! Her favorite thing is to take a bath with the lights dimmed or off and then turn on the Party in the Tub. Lights flash everywhere! This does take 3 AAA batteries. But they are completely sealed and the water never gets to them. The lights flash in different colors and the toy floats on top of the water. My daughter just loves this light show and it can usually keep her entertained for the time I need her to be in the tub. The other great thing is it cleans up fairly easy. It's a smooth non porous plastic so I just run it under hot water to get off the soap and then put it away. Sometimes I do need to place it on it's side to dry out and they do give you a hook to hang it on your bathroom wall. This toy is a blast! We just bought one to give to my 8 year old nephew for his birthday because he was always playing with it when he came over. Kids of all ages will love this.
