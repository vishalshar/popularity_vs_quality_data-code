I have a Quinny Buzz stroller, and currently use both the Maxi Cosi infant car seat as well as the toddler seat on the stroller (my son is now 5M and big enough to use toddler seat, but I still take the advantage of the infant seat)Once my son turned 3M, he started to be interested in the world around him. I used to cover the stroller's view w/ blanket so he doesn't get direct sun exposure, and thus sunburn, but he was getting frustrated since he was just staring at the blanket :-)Once I got the umbrella, I was eager to try it out; I hated it for about a week - to the point I wanted to return it!Only after I switched back to the blanket solution, I realized that the umbrella was in fact useful, and I can live with all the issues I had w/ it.Now, I am it's happy user :-)Here are my pros/cons:PROS:- provides sun protection while the child can actually see things around him- small size is practical to carry around- easy installation and easy assembly on/off the stroller- finally, it is cool looking :-)CONS:- it is small umbrella (so not as much coverage as I would hope for)- the body of umbrella is pretty long, so it really sticks out of the stroller (quite visible)- the adjust-ability is pretty tricky; there are two ways to adjust it but I find it hard to find the right position; also, w/ any wind movement, it shakes and changes position (this is what bothered me the most about it)
