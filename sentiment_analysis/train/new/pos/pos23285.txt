Installed two of these on a stairway. The construction is solid, quality materials. The only issue I had was that the width of my opening is variable top versus bottom due to the baseboard, and the difference was right in between needing the small extension and the large extension.The way the extensions work is if your doorframe is 28-31.5in, you use just the gate, if it's 32-36" you use a small extender, 36.5-40.5 you use a long extender, etc. My particular stairway had a baseboard at 35.5" apart, but at the top it was 37" apart. Using a smaller extension made it unstable at the top, and the large extension was too big to fit in between the baseboards.The solution is to suspend it over the baseboard so you have a consistent width, or do some finagling with the tighteners so you only tighten on one side. Neither is necessarily optimal.For your reference, this is from the instructions, so you can measure your doorway properly:28" - 31.5": no extensions32" - 36" one short extension36.5" - 40.5" one long extension41" - 45" one long and one short extension45.5" - 48" one long and two short extensions
