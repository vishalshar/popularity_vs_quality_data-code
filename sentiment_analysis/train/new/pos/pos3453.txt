I ordered this as a baby gift for my sister, and it somehow came two days later! I have no idea how the store did it, but they sure were happy to get it so soon! And the price with shipping was less than driving over to Target to pick it up. Her baby loves the swing, and the small size is perfect for her city home. Highly recommended product and store.
