I use these to make burp cloths by adding a layer of printed flannel.  I wanted the kind without the thick poly padding.  These are thin and just made from prefolded birdseye fabric.  They would make terrible diapers but they are perfect for my purposes!They did shrink/quilt up slightly when washed as I expect any cotton diapers to do.  (I actually cloth diaper as well but use higher quality prefolds sold in on-line diaper shops for that purpose.) I haven't had any serging unravel either.
