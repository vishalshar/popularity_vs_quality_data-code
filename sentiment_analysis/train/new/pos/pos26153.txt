My son is 6 months old, and his pediatrician told us he could start practicing with a sippy cup. This is the first one we've tried, and he's taken right to it. I don't know if it's his superior intellect, the intuitive design of the cup, or maybe both, but he has no problem slugging down water from it with no leaks. He's a breastfed and bottle fed baby, so the silicone spout is an easy transition. Other reviewers say that the trick to avoid leaks is in the assembly, and it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to see that you have to just line up the notches on the cup and silicone spout to put them together correctly. It was obvious at first glance, so I don't know why so many others have a problem with it. At any rate, it's a good size, well proportioned, light, and comes with a lid for transporting. Once my son is sitting up and figures out the mechanics a little better, we might explore other cups, but for now this one is great for him to just play with and become comfortable with.
