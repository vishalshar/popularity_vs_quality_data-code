If you are into "cute and convenient," this would be for you.  I make a bento box for my kid's lunch because he doesn't like eating out of separate containers.  He is too lazy to wash his hands first and get out a fork, so these food picks are the answer.  The part that you grab is very sturdy and easy for a child to handle.  The fork portion of the pick does not break easily, even when you push it down against the table.  They are also not so small that you would lose them down your garbage disposal while cleaning them.  Some of them have four prongs, like a fork, and others have just two prongs.  I put the two-pronged ones in soft items like a sliced up cheese stick, or in the stem of a strawberry or grape.Most of all, I am just happy that my son likes them and it makes him less picky when it comes to lunch time.  Less whining and more eating is always a plus in my book.
