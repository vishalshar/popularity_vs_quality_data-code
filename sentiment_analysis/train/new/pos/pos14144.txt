I got this pillow for my son's third birthday because he loves Toy Story. It is just as the description says and I was satisfied overall. It is a fairly small pillow (probably just enough space for an adult head to lie on) which is fine. I give it four stars because it can be hard to rest your head on it sometimes. There is a hard bulky area where the batteries are kept under the red bull that lights up. Other than that, it's a nice decorative pillow and our son loves it.
