We just moved and our full marble standing shower makes it pretty hard to shave your legs. It was becoming pretty annoying. I had no idea such a thing existed until i googled some magical keywords. I noticed a lot of people complaining that it didn't stay but I haven't had any issues. Try running the back under some water and snapping it down to dry tiles. A few times it didn't seem to take but finally I had to apply a ton of pressure to the flip down trigger and it was stuck good. It just takes some patience and finding the right placement. It obviously has to be on a completely flat dry service. I suggest placing it under the shower head so that no water is really running down onto it. Great little product!
