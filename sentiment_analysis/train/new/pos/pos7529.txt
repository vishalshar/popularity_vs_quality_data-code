I have 2 of their products:one preschool one and one  full size(this one).I love the idea of having  a backpack  that has the option of having a lunch bag that can be attached to it.Less things to worry about losing when carry it around :-).The system of attaching the lunch bag to the backpack  is very secure and well thought and it prevents the weight of the lunch bag dragging the backpack down and on the back.I had that problem with another brand when in the situation of having the lunch bag attached to the backpack the lunch bag would drag the bag down and force the main zippers from the backpack to open and all the contents of the backpack would be on the ground...Not fun especially when you are in a hurry, on a busy street and in the middle of the winter....I love the fact that O3 changed the insulation material for the lunch bag and they put a better grade one( like for the heavy duty coolers).The only thing that I wish would have been different  is the depth of the lunch bag...It is unfortunately quite narrow and it seems made for flatter lunches only.Depth wise it just fits  an orange or an apple in it along with a sandwich and one more  flat snack.It is enough for one day at school but I just wish they have made it  just a little bit  more spacious so I have enough room for a snack container too.It is also very organized(lots of pockets everywhere).I love the quality of the products overall.It is so easy for my kids to spot their backpacks in their boxes at the daycare and school as the colors are very vibrant and so unique compared with the other ones.It also saves me lots of space and and  having  the lunch bags integrated or attached to the backpacks makes me more organized and saves me lots of energy and time when looking to load or unload everything into/from the car :-).
