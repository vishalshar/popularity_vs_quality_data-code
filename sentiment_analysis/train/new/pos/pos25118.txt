I got these for over my newborn's crib onto painted drywall and it took a while for me to get the design just right.  I did NOT plan out where each sticker should go like they recommend and ended up moving each piece about 5-6 times.  THEY STILL STICK WONDERFULLY!!  I was concerned about their durability in the humidity of Hawaii but it has been no problem whatsoever.  Despite all my rearranging, 7 months later not a glimpse of any peeling.My daughter definitely digs them and gazes up at the mural these stickers have created.  I plan on getting another set for elsewhere in her room.Highly recommended!Note:  I wouldn't recommend this set for a 3-6 year old to apply themselves since some of the pieces (the deer's antlers) are a little intricate or small for stubby fingers.***UPDATE:My 8 month old managed to peel one of the stickers off the wall, and spent about half an hour chewing on it in her crib.  So bad news is that a persistent baby can peel these off.  You may want to place them accordingly.  But the good news is that the sticker STILL works, and smoothed out nicely.  Couldn't believe it.
