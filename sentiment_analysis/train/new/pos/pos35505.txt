we got these to use with pretty much every baby accessory we own. they were hanging on the floor mat to look at first then the baby started grabbing them to play with. now they get taken every where. one of our most used toys since they crinkle, rattle, teeth, and hang. they work well in stages since they are brightly colored for early viewing by drawing attention. they are nicely sized for little hands and have lots of spots to chew on. plus they have a bunch of different textures for feeling and chewing. great all around toy.
