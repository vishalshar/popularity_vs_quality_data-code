I bought the Under the Nile swaddling blanket, baby wrap shirts, booties and hats from a local boutique while I was pregnant. I loved their products so much that when I needed a few more burp cloths after he was born I looked to see if Under the Nile had any. Sure enough they did and I LOVE them! They are so soft against my baby's face. I love the simplicity. I have used them all day every day for almost 3 months and they look brand new still!! They are a little pricey, but totally worth it in my opinion.
