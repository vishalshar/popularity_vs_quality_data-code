I have twin boys and a small nursery.  There isn't much place to put a boombox but on the floor.  After weeks of tripping over the boombox - and after one of my sons learned how to open the CD part of it - I finally decided to get this little CD player.  It is *perfect* for what I need it for.I love that:- it clips to the crib- it shuts off after the CD is through (or can be programmed for an amount of time to play)- it has a little light (that shuts off after 5 minutes)- it cannot be opened by a baby- it is small and unobtrusive- it is white and therefore blends in with my nursery (my boombox is black and all the other options I looked at were either black or some sort of bright/garish color)I don't have any problem at all with:  skipping, opening the battery compartment, babies taking the unit off the crib, not enough volume (I don't want it loud enough that I can hear it outside the nursery, I want it soft enough for them to go to sleep to).  A lot of people here have complained about the battery compartment, but I just don't see the problem with it.  If you have many baby toys that need batteries then you are probably used to needing a screwdriver for most of them - it keeps the baby from being able to open the battery compartment.This is the only product like this that I have been able to find.  It is absolutely perfect for my needs and a great addition to my nursery.
