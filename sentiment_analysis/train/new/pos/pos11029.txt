This was originally a gift for my youngest. Her older brother has the frog version and loves it. My daughter has fallen in love with "Bunny" or "Buns" as she affectionately calls her. She even recently called her her BFF. Both Bunny and my daughter are 5 now and they are still madly in love with each other. They sleep together every night and go on trips together as well. Bunny gets washed often and holds up well to a normal wash cycle. After 5 years, Bunny is looking well loved, but no one, especially my daughter, really cares. We do have 2 and could probably could use more because she often leaves her places around the house and then when it is bed time or nap time, she has trouble finding her. They are never out together, one stays in the top of my closet for Bunny emergencies. She will always have a special place in my daughters heart.Bunny is made of such soft and durable fabric. Her body is silky and has earned her the nickname "Tickle Bunny" since my daughter uses her to tickle her face. Bunny also fits into the nightgowns that come with the Doll & Me pj sets. Instead of a doll wearing the pjs, Bunny often does! An excellent lovey!
