I first bought the Boppy pillow since I could get it at the store, the the next day after using it, I packed it back up and will return it. I ordered this one and slept with it for the first time last night and I love it. I also purchased the pillow case and it's a perfect match. I love the pillow! My 15 year old son also likes it! I highly recommend it. It gives me head, back, leg and front support. I didn't even have to use my own regular pillow as backup.
