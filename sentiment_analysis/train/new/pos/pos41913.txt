This insert fits perfectly in my new Michael Kors Jet Set Tote. It does have a slight chemical odor but it's not strong. I can fit a change if clothes, snacks, sippy, water bottle, diapers, wipes, changing pad, toiletries, & my wallet easily. Great item for the price. Love the large and structured compartments.
