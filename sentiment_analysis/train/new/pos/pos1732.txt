This product was recommended to me by a friend who swore by it. She was right! It's really great at reducing strange odors. I have pets so it sure helps for those unfortunate accidents. We also have accidentally left trash in a hot car in the summer and it's helped greatly to get out those lingering odors that just don't seem to go away.
