Fast shipping. Perfect cards.  My mom ( 92 years old)  loves them. At last she can play solitaire and actually see the cards.  She's so happy. Now she's teaching all the great-grandchildren - 8 of them - to play cards with actual cards right in their hands, and they love it.  So we've got  least 9 people having fun with the cards you sent us.  Can't thank you enough.
