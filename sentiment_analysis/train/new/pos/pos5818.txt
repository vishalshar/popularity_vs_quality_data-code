This fork and spoon set, though slightly more expensive than most, is worth the investment. What I dislike about most toddler fork and spoon sets, is that they bend fairly quickly, and I have yet to encounter that problem with these. The handles are very sturdy and dense, not hollow like most toddler fork and spoon sets. The fork, as well as the spoon, has a nice smooth edge, which is sadly uncommon among most toddler silverware sets lately. I have washed them countless times in the dishwasher without a problem. The color shown is true to picture and I would definitely buy again.
