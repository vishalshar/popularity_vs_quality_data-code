I can only compare this to the Chicco infant seat, as we don't have any other experience with a convertible car seat.  The cover is easy to wash and looks fine after a washing machine wash, but it is not easy to put back on the frame.  It is also only fairly easy to install, but that is because of how big and bulky it is.  We actually have to have it on the side, not middle, of our Jeep Grand Cherokee, and that surprised me.  It is really that large!  We put our son in it at 10 months, and I think we'll put another child it it at 6 months. I cannot see how an infant could be comfortable in this chair.  The headreat pillow does not hit well for small children.If it matters to anyone... the blue looks more like denim than a nice deep blue.  I think its kind of ugly, but I also find most carseat fabric ugly, too.The knobs are not difficult to understand, but occasionally they are difficult to maneuver, as if they get stuck a little bit.  I can see where some parents do a poor job of properly installing their child in the seat and the belts are too loose... really, it is easy to do this.  I find that I have to tighten it a lot more than I expect to get a safe fit.If I had to do it over again, I would probably purchase a Graco similarly priced item for the shape/size of the carseat with my Jeep.
