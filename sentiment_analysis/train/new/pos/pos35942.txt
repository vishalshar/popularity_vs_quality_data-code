My 6 week old loves this toy! She follows the changing lights back and forth and she grins every time I show it to her.  It has an on and off switch and a try me switch for the music and lights which is great. There is no volume control, but I don't think the toy is too loud or too soft.  The toy is about 6 inches tall.  The music changes with movement, sometimes it will change with a small movement and other times you really have to shake it to change. I wish that it would change music with a slight movement that way she can learn cause and effect.She is now 2 months and still enjoys this toy, but I hope it can keep her entertained when she gets older. The lights can project in a dark room, but not very far.
