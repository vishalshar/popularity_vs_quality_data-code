My son loves the Doctor brown pacifiers.  He will not take any other one.  These seem like they are more sturdy than the other brands.  The ring on the pacifier is also smaller than the other brands so he can hang on to this one really good.  The other brands he can hardly get his little fingers around.  These are simply the best.
