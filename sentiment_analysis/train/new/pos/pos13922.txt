I have 2 of these- one in the spare car and one for the babysitter.  They are semi easy to install (though the latches are very rigid and hard to dislodge), I was glad when I could turn them around and get rid of the latch attachments.  Comes with a cup holder which is removable.  I never attached them so I cannot speak to how well they work.  The seat only goes up to 40 lbs, butt he price is decent and this is not her primary seat so I am happy with my purchases.  The cover is easy to remove for cleaning and the color is nice (this same seat in the Willa color is more vibrant)  and there is a recline mechanism under the seat for rear facing infants.. Nothing fancy here, just a sturdy seat.
