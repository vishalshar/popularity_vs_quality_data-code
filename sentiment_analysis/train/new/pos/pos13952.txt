If I could give this pillow 10 stars, I would.  I don't know how long it will take for it to go flat, or if it will ever go flat; but I can say that it is the best pillow I have ever had in my entire life as far back as I can remember.  The pillow envelopes my body, and feels like the embracing arms of the angle of comfort.  Ok, let me get serious.  The pillow is soft and giving, but firm enough, that it does not go flat under body weight.  It supports the entire body from your head to your toe.  I can comfortably lay and watch TV with perfect head and arm support; and when I am ready to sleep, all I need do is just shift to either side, and I am in the perfect position for sleep.  I can sleep on my back if I wish, and it is still just as comfortable.  I haven't tried lying on my stomach with this pillow, but I don't think it is designed for that.  I am not presently pregnant, but me and my husband are in the middle of family planning.  I purchased this early to ensure I have it just in case I get pregnant.  I am pleasantly plus sized, and need a little extra support during pregnancy.  OMG, pregnant or not, this pillow is better than any memory foam pillow you can ever use.  It is worth the money.  The picture is not deceiving, she is as comfortable, even more comfortable, than she looks.  Even the advertisement does not give the pillow as much justice as it deserves.  Do yourself a justice and buy this pillow, it will be one of the best choices you've ever made in your life.  Oh, if you are married, a king size bed would only be fair to your husband.  We have a king size bed, and my husband fortunately has room to stretch out.  He should probably try one of these pillows.  Anyway,  I don't think your significant other will be comfortable with you and pillow in anything smaller.
