The quality is very good and I like that this set comes with the clips since many of my daughter's pants don't have belt loops.  This was also a good, practical color choice (pink/blue).  Now that she is 2T, some of her jeans have adjustable waistbands built in, so we're not using these as much as I thought we would.  Though we don't use them really often, it seems like something that will be a pants-fit solution for years.
