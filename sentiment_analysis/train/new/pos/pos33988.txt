I read all of the reviews on the product and have to admit that I was hesitant to purchase it. Plus I was not sure how much we would use it (was I buying this just cause it would make the room look cute). I also did some research and experts do recommend getting a mobile and moving it around the crib to help with shapping the babies head after birth.I am so glad that we purchased this item! My son loves it now that he is 7 weeks old and is able to see it better.I admit that I had an issue with some of the plush pieces getting stuck. It got stuck for two reasons: 1) the angle of the mobile and 2)the mobile arm would move. These were both easy to fix and looking at other mobiles, I could see having the same issue with them. For the 2nd issue, I used the thick sponge like drawer liner (the kind that keeps things from slipping) and cut it out to match the pieces for the clamp. This fixed the mobile from moving on the crib and also kept the crib from getting scratched up from the plastic. If you find the pieces are still getting caught, remove the individual product tags on each of the plush toys. The quality of the music is great.
