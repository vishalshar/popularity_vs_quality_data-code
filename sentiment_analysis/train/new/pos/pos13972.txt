So we haven't had the Dragonfly rocker long yet, but its quality is outstanding! And I got it on sale for $60 so that's a huge bonus!... I was a bit nervous about purchasing this for my soon to be 1 year old daughter based on the "dangerous" reviews. But decided since it was on sale I'd try it and see... All I have to say is.... if your child is such a destructive, wild individual to be able to flip this rocker God help you because I find it  EXTREMELY SAFE. I don't think my almost one year old could flip forward or backward if she wanted to. So those people saying its extremely unsafe either have demons for children or got a botched product because I received I well balanced, well structured rocker the music works great... Although I will agree the music isn't very pleasing. But not annoying either. So to those worried about safety I personally think it's very well built and safe.
