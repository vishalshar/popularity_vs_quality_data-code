Update: It's been over two years and this bed is standing up well. At eighteen months we put the toddler on and it too is still holding up. We have absolutely no regrets in purchasing this crib. The color is beautiful; the size is perfect; the drawer on the bottom is so awesome to store extra blankets and sheets in.
