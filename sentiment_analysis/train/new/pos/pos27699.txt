My son enjoys bath time, but I often had to cut it short due to the fact that all I had between my knees and the linoleum was a rolled up towel. I wasn't sure about ordering this mat at first. My spouse kept asking why I didn't just get a garden mat to kneel on by the tub. I also considered getting the Fisher Price tub mats (which I would have bought and never even seen this if Walmart had not stopped carrying them in my area). Both would have been huge mistakes. Garden mats are too big and the little Fisher Price tub mats just aren't very thick. THIS mat is what you need for bath time!Pros:1. So cushiony that I barely notice I'm kneeling on a hard floor2. Compact, but plenty big enough to kneel on and give a child a bath easily3. Folds in half with a magnetic closure4. Sturdy handle fits right over the back of the bathroom door handle5. Water resistant6. Easy to clean7. Attractive light blue colorPossible Cons:1. Some reviews mention that the edges are a little stiff against your shins. I'll admit they could be if you were kneeling on this for hours with shorts on maybe. They do feel a bit rough to the touch if you just run your hand along them. But I've used this mat a lot and never even noticed the edges hitting my leg.2. Some reviews mention that with the way it folds, you could have your knees sink in the middle (the top is one continuous piece but the bottom is creased so you can fold it. Theoretically you could kneel in such a way that your knees would sink into that gap from the other side). I have NEVER even come close to having this happen to me, and even if it did, I'd just move up a quarter of an inch and the problem would be solved.BOTTOMLINE: Buy this! You will NOT regret it--your knees will thank you! Baths will last as long as you and your child are enjoying yourselves, not only as long as your knees can handle it!
