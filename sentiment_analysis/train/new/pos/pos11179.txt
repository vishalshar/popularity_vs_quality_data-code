DaVinci Emily II 2-in-1 6" 242 Coil MattressI bought this mattress as a replacement of an older 2-in-1 mattress that my toddler used from birth (a Sealy from Babies R Us).  When it came time to purchase a new one, the Sealys were all sold out on Amazon, so I picked out this model as a "next-best" without remembering exactly how much I spent on the previous one.  The price seemed a little steep, but once I saw how much comparable models go for in stores, I felt a little better.It isn't as heavy as the previous mattress, and is actually a bit softer in the springs.  I am not sure what the coil count is for the other mattress.  I couldn't really detect any major difference in "bounce" from the infant to toddler side for either mattress.One thing I wish I'd looked into is whether it had a handle on the sides, which makes it easier for lifting in and out of the crib when you're changing the sheet.  This particular model does not, but it is still fairly easy to manage.So I guess I'd say this mattress is okay for quality, but you're probably just as well off buying a single sided mattress from the store and save your money.  There's rarely a huge difference on any of the 2-sided mattresses, and your toddler isn't likely to notice anyway.
