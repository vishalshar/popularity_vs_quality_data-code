This is a necessity if you have an ergo carrier.  My daughter is teething and drools so the pads keeps the straps clean and somewhat dry.  I love that the material is super soft and is easy to attach and take off.  It makes it easy to throw in the wash whenever I do the laundry and they keep me from washing the ergo every week.  I do wish they were a little thicker because I find that my daughter could drool through them pretty quickly without much effort.  I also think the price is a little high for what you get, but I can overlook the price because it protects my ergo and saves me the trouble of washing the whole thing too often.
