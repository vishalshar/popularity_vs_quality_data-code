This set was absolutely lovely.  I bought this in 2012 right before the birth of my third son and it has held up amazingly well.  He just now is moving to a big boy bed and we have loved the set.  It is still in good shape and my best friend is having a gran baby and she is going to pass it on to him  I really just wanted to come back almost four years later and let you know what an amazing set this has been.  It was purchased with the additional  Musical Mobile, Lamp shade and Curtain toppers and all were excellent quality and are being passed on with the exception of the sheet it has come up missing and one the little pillow.The set Included:One ComforterOne SheetOne Crib SkirtOne Crib Bumper setOne Diaper StackerTwo PillowsThree Square wall hangingsOne wall hanging pouch which we used for  extra sheetsOne curtain Valance i think.  I am pretty sure it came with one and we bought one.Sorry I did not have better pics I have been through two computers and I lost all my pics except the ones on my phone.This set will not disappoint and has lasted the test of time!
