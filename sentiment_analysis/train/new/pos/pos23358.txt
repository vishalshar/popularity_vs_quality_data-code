Perfect for my baby's naps. He fell asleep right away on it. Even my toddler loves this pillow. I didn't have an issue with a chemical smell but did air it out like it says on packaging. We have both the baby and toddler sizes and we love both. I tried to take a picture of the width of each pillow (baby size on top of toddler) and the size difference so you have an idea.
