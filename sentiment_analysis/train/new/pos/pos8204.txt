This has been a pretty good changing pad for my youngest child.  It has a scalloped shape to it to help keep your baby in the middle of the pad.  The problem is that your little one doesn't stay very little for long.  Before you know it your baby will decide that they dont want to lay there on their back any more and they want to flip onto their bellies.  This makes them fight for it a little more than they would on a flat surface but not by too much.  The plastic cover is easily wiped clean for when "fluids" leak through what ever cover you put on it.  The reason I didn't give this thing 5 stars is because it slides extremely easily on the top of the changing table we use.  This means that if you aren't paying attention, one wrong kick will send baby and changing pad off the edge of the changing table.  I'd rather warn you now than to hear you had to explain this to child protective services.
