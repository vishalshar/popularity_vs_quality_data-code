These tiles are wonderful! I bought them when we first started physical therapy for my daughter. Her ability to sit independently is limited and she often falls over. We wanted something to help cushion the falls and would allow her toys (ones that roll) to be used as well. I researched several other brands and these were the thickest ones I could find. They are GREAT! The stay together very well, are soft enough that even adults are comfortable sitting on the floor, and have provided peace of mind for those unexpected tumbles. I highly recommend this companies floor tiles! I know they are a bit pricier than other versions, but are well worth the extra expense. I was given some of the thinner ones and they are not comfortable and don't provide enough cushioning.
