I haven't used the bottles or sleeves yet, but I was able to easily slide the sleeves on both the 5oz and 11 oz bottles.Tips: turn the sleeves inside out.  For the short 5 oz sleeve, put the bottom smooth side of the sleeve (what was the inside of the sleeve and is now on the outside) against the bottom of the bottle and roll it up the outside of the bottle so the bumpy side is once again on the outside.  No dish soap needed.For the taller 11 oz sleeve, do the same as for the short, but when it is inside out ( smooth side out), put a drop or two of dish soap on the bumpy side (the inside).  Roll it around a bit in your hands to distribute the soap on the bumpy side.  You don't want soap on the smooth side as this will make it more difficult to unroll up the bottle.  Place the bottom of the sleeve against the bottom of the bottle and roll it up.  I found that using kitchen towel to grip the smooth side as I rolled it up made it much easier.I also found it easiest to grip the bottle between my knees or against my abdomen to hold it steady as I rolled the sleeve up the bottle.Using this method it only took a minute or two to slide the sleeves on.Hope this helps!Also, just FYI that the blue sleeve is not the same blue color as the travel caps that come with the bottles.
