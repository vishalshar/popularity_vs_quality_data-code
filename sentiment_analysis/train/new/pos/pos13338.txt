Overall, we really like this bouncer.  We actually put a different bouncer on our baby registry (Ingenuity) and our baby boy loved it for the first few weeks, but then the strap to hold him in started to fit him oddly and seemed like it hurting his legs.  This bouncer does not have that issue.  I really like the hanging toys - especially that when they are pulled they play music.  Our son seems to like it a lot.  He will hang out in it even without the toys.It should be noted that the seat does not actually bounce when turned on, but rather vibrates - which made no difference to me.  You can actually manually bounce the chair yourself.The 2 main drawbacks that I found were that:1. it is battery operated.  I will say that we have had ours about a month and have not replaced batteries yet.  We do not really use the vibration very much but the toys get pulled and sounds play a lot.2. The toy in the middle is a little bit of a stretch for my 4 month old to reach.  He can still trigger the sounds by pushing up on the toy beside it, but I thought that was a bit odd.
