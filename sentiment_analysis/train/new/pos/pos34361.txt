These will arrive in plastic packs of 5, all brand new with sterile seals. Yes, the plastic can smell a little strong but I get the same smell when I microwave sterilize my own bottles. It won't come in the pretty box from medela which is usually only 12 -- but it's a very good price for these storage bottles.
