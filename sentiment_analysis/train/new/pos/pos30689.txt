I purchased these spoons because I wanted to be able to toss them into my purse so that I could quickly feed my son whenever we were on the go. The carrying case is very helpful for keeping "gunk" off of the spoon. The spoons themselves are the right size for my son's small mouth. This is a great product that is now a mainstay in our diaper bag.
