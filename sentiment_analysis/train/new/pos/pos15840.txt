I hesitated to order this because the colors are extremely confusing. I wanted black, the photo was black and the drop down selection said black. However, the title description said yellow and the description on the actual order I made said yellow. I looked for other organizers and could not find one I liked as much as this, so I decided if it came in yellow I could live with it. When it arrived, it was black making me very happy! It has lots of pockets and a nice sized center storage area that will help you turn any tote bag into a diaper bag. The handles make it easier to get in and out of your bag than most other organizers that come without handles. Note, the higher black part with the red at the top in the photo is not actually part of the organizer and does not come with. I did not experience the smell that other reviews have mentioned.
