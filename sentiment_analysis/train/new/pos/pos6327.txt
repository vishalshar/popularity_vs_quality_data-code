I had received the blue version as a gift for my son 4 years ago and I decided I wanted to have one for my daughter.  The yellow color is great (I am not a fan of pink) and the pictures on the cube are very nice.  One word of caution is that the marker you receive with it bleeds when you use it.  It needs to be more of a fine point so what you write can be clearly read.  Luckily I had the marker from my son's cube and that is working.  My suggestion is to pick up an ultra fine point marker.  I have not been great with keeping baby books but at least I will have some milestones fom her first year recorded thanks to this :)
