Overall I really like the bottle and nipples.  I did receive one bottle that had a flaw in the stainless steel and leaked from the bottom, but my money was refunded promptly upon return. The nipples will not drip or leak when they are new!  My daughter is almost 2 and tends to chew on the nipples and they get torn pretty easily.  The only negative about stainless steel is that it feels very cold on the hands if you put cold liquids in... however it does seem to keep the liquids colder and milk fresher longer which is a plus.
