I purchased the Ittybit bunny for my 97 year old mother, who has dementia. She's at the stage where she needs help bathing and doesn't remember when or if she ate a meal. She is comforted by and likes to hold my 5 lb. chihuahua. I also noticed her "petting" a stuffed dog she owned, so thought she might like one of these bunnies since the reviews state how soft they are and how much children gravitate to them...as those of you who have experience with dementia know, patients become progressively child-like.She loves it. I gave it to her on Christmas Eve and ever since she has slept with the bunny and even keeps it with her during the day. I brought her 3 year old great-grandchild to visit and she had the bunny hidden under a cover she wore while sitting on the sofa. She told me she didn't want him to see the bunny in case he might be tempted to take it from her. lol. (Not to worry, he had plenty of toys to play with while at her house.)I'm thrilled she likes it so much. Because dementia patients often pull away when being shown affection, it's nice to see her cuddling with something, even if it is an inanimate object. I will buy another Wee in the Bunnies by the Bay series for her.
