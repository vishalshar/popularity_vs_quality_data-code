My wife had been through numerous Diaper Bags until we got this one delivered.  This bag looks good, and is functional!The zippered compartments are great, as nothing falls out if the bag flops over on the floor.  There is plenty of space in the bag for diapers, wipes, pacifiers, burping cloths, blanket, changing mat, formula, bottles, and a sundry of other things that end up being shoved in it.  The adjustable straps are great, allowed the straps to be lengthened to fit around the baby stroller handles.  It is very easy to clean.  Is lightweight, so doesn't add unnecessary bulk to the bag when full.Would recommend this, as i said, my wife is happy with it after an exhaustive search for the right Diaper Bag!
