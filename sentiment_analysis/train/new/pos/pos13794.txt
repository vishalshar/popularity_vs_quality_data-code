I may be one of the few reviewers who didn't buy this for pets. I purchased this because my 2.5 year old twins are like stealthy ninjas and have even bested 36" gates - and they're just over 36" inches tall! So far this gate has kept them safely in their bedroom at night. The handle is too complicated and requires too much pressure for them to open and the height is perfect to keep them safe. As for the pressure required to open the handle, it does require quite a bit, so it's not recommended for folks with arthritis. The gate does not latch automatically upon closing, but the gate does close short of the latch if you just walk through. It also STAYS OPEN if you open it all the way - very nice if you're frequently in and out of the room (we only close the gate at night.) Installation took about ten minutes and it doesn't require any holes in the wall nor any tools aside from the included little wrench.PROS:Latch isn't easily figured out by even the craftiest toddlersEasy installationStays installed - my twins haven't been able to knock it over they way they can most pressure installed gatesEasy to walk-through and can stay openCONS:Latch button and lift could be difficult for people with arthritisI'm very happy with this gate!
