Easy to hold and baby eats from them well. I do however, think the handle is a little heavy and they often topple out of bowls, but they wouldn't be as easy to grip if the handles weren't as fat as they are...so it's a give and take on that. The reason for 4 stars is that I think they are a little too sensitive to heat. As with most temp guard baby items...they err on the side of caution which is good but I often find these say the food is too hot when it is barely luke-warm. It just annoys me a bit and makes the hot safe part a bit useless as I end up testing the food every time anyway regardless of what the spoon indicates the temp is. And with that being said, I would most likely test the food every time anyway with or without these spoons, just as you would a bottle, so it really means the hot safe feature is a bit moot from the get go.Overall though, they are very nice little spoons.
