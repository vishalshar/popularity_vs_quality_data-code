I've been searching high and low for a sippy cup for my baby who never took a bottle and transitioned straight to a sippy.  The good thing about this cup is that you can tilt it upside down and there's a small drip of liquid that comes out.  In other words, it is not spill proof.  It works for my child because he's doesn't really suck the liquid out so the small drip will allow him to learn that there is liquid in the cup and he can start to suck.  Also, it allows the parents to "force" them to drink.  It's a good quality cup.  It's thick (not the cheapy plastic) and the lid is very secure.  It is also super easy to clean.  There are only 2 parts to it (cup and lid!). These days, the sippy cups are so fancy and super hard to clean.  You can also use this as a plain cup without the lid once your child graduates from a sippy.  It makes a great kids's cup.
