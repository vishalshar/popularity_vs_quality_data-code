We bought this bedding for our first born because we wanted something neutral that could be used again for either a boy or a girl. I did not seek out the bedding because it claimed to be organic, but it was a nice touch! I just washed the entire bedding set and put it on the crib and we love it! It's such a warm color and goes with any and everything! The only complaint is that when we washed and dried the bumper, the top edge of the bumper was rather "pilly", but you can easily remove it yourself by hand. Other than that - the price is great in comparison to the bedding sets purchased in the stores ($200+), and we are extremely happy with the purchase! I'd certainly recommend this product!
