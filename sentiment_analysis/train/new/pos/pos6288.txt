Like some previous reviews, my biggest complaint about this toy is that the monkey broke almost immediately.  But that did not take away from the basic fun this toy provides.  The rest of toy still works fine, and my kids never seemed to mind that the monkey wasn't dancing along with them.  We've had this for over 6 months now, and it still gets played with almost daily.  We have only replaced the batteries once in 6 months, so as long as you're using a brand name battery, I don't really think that's an issue with this toy.  For the price I paid at the time, it was well worth the money spent!
