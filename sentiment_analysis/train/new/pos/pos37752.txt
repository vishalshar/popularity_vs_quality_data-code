I love these spoons.  I tried to use the other spoons I bought from the store but they all had a little dip which made it difficult to get the food into my 4 month old baby's mouth.  I would put the spoon in and pull it out and the food was still on the spoon.  But with these spoons, because they are flat, my baby is able to pull all of the food into her mouth.  It also works like a spatula and I can get every last bit of food from the jar and off her face into her mouth.I agree that the spoons were a bit expensive.  But I read some of the other reviews that it was worth it so I got them to give it a try.  Immediately after the first spoonful, my baby was enjoying the food and I was feeling less stressed about feeding her and having to use my finger to get the food out from the little dip into her mouth.  I'm glad I purchased these spoons and am using them for every feeding.
