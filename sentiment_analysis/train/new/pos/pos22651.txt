I purchased the Packabe to tote around my 13 month old son's important cargo, I wanted something that could be a backpack (good for solo outings with a squirmy toddler) or a shoulder/messenger bag...this bag does all three!!  The Packabe is a really nice medium sized bag, the contrasting inner color does make it a bit easier to find things. There are three mesh pockets and one zippered pocket on the inside,and two insulated bottle/cup pockets on the outside. The two front pockets are great...in the top one I can fit a wristlet, cell phone, keys, mini lotion, mints, and lip gloss and it still closes easily.  The bottom front pocket I use for easy access to some snacks for my son, his utensils, table topper, and wipeable bib.The only minor complaint I have is that the strap that comes with the bag isn't padded and it's not overly comfortable to carry solely as a backpack, to remedy that you can get the padded straps from Ju Ju Be's site...those make this bag a lot more comfortable as a backpack.  For occasional use the strap that comes with it is fine...we use our bag almost daily and 95% of that time we do the backpack option for convenience.The solid black bag (what I have) does seem to show dust, dirt, and other random things easily but it does clean up very well. The patterns I think would be the way to go since they would help hide any dirt or anything.
