We bought this for our preschool-aged daughter to use at nap time at school. This is the second nap mat we've purchased from Baby Boom; the first was for our son when he was a preschooler. So, obviously we've been happy with our purchases from this seller, but I thought I'd take a minute to explain why.First of all, don't expect this to be a standalone nap mat. Think of this more like a pint-sized pillow/blanket combo that's meant to go on top of a foam nap mat (such as those made by Kindermat). This is designed to stow in a small space and be easy to bring back and forth from school to home for washing. The pillow comes out easily, and the nap mats are fully machine washable. The blanket is soft, and my daughter loves the vibrant colors of the owl design.Some are saying that the mat is too short for their tall children. My daughter is very petite for her age, so that hasn't been an issue for us, but if your child is on the tall side you might want take that into consideration.The mats hold up very well. My son's mat is still in great shape after two years of use. We could have easily continued to use it for our daughter, but we figured she deserved to have a design that was different than the dinosaurs our son loved.
