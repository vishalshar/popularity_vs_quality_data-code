I use the tote for my dr. brown's 4oz bottles with a regular cap (not the bottle top) for transporting my pumped milk from work to home. Note that it does not fit dr. brown's bottles with the nipples and tops. Everyone seems to have these bags-- the work fridge in the mother's room is filled with them.
