We just received the Infantino Merry Monkey travel gym and love it!  The size is just right, it is soft, bright colors and you can change out the toys.  I read in a previous review that the bar won't stay up.  There are two flaps on the back side that opens to reveal a long plastic piece.  Slide the under piece around and it forms a base to hold the bar up.  I love the fact that this is easy to break down and put in a carrying case, which is included.  For the price I would recommend this for the grandparents house or if you need to entertain your baby other places then at home.
