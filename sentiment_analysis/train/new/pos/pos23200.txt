We searched for a long time for a Glider, both on and off of amazon.com.  We settled on this glider in part due to the reviews it received, the price for the glider, and the brand name.Amazon was stellar as usual with the shipping and handling of the glider.  Putting the glider together was a very simple affair.  The instructions are clear, and it took me approximately 20 minutes from unboxing the glider to having it fully assembled.It is a very comfortable glider, and the padding on the seat, backrest and arms rests are plush and soft.  The gliding aspect of it is flawless, effortless to use, and works like a dream.  The arm rests are a great height to rest your arms while holding a baby.  The ottoman portion is good, albeit a little clunky to move around with a baby in your arms!  The ottoman is not really needed all that much, probably only when you are in the glider for an extended period of time as the chair portion alone is plenty comfortable.  I took one star off of the review because of this.  Probably a little harsh, and would be better if i could have taken a half of a star away.In conclusion, a great buy from amazon.com for the price, and brand name.  It is a solid unit that does what it says.
