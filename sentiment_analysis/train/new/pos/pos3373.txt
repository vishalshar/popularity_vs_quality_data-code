If you have a medals pump you should order these right away, not matter what. These 4 pieces are easy to lose or damage and having back ups is necessary.For the first few days home from the hospital, my husband washed and assembled all of my pumping parts. Maybe on night three I was washing them myself and couldn't figure out how to get the yellow piece off. I tried to pull one off with my teeth which damaged the yellow piece so the white flap wouldn't lay flat.Spend the money now Just in case you send one of these down the garbage disposal  or some other small catastrophe.
