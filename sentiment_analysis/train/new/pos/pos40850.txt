I purchased the first Elephantunes for my granddaughter when she was months old, and since I take care of her during the days and drive around with her a lot,I keep it in the car.  She rarely fails to be entertained by it. Now that he's older she plays the legs, still giving the broad grin when she first sees it.I just purchased two more for baby gifts through Amazon because of baby girl's grinning recommendations.
