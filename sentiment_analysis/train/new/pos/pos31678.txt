Our small church PA system often suffers from popping "P" and "B" sounds.  This is caused by the puff of air from the speaker's mouth hitting the microphone diaphragm.These windscreens allow sound through them while blocking the air puffs.  Windscreens are almost ALWAYS used in radio studio microphones.You can spend whatever you want on windscreens.  Microphone manufacturers usually have windscreens tailored to each model of microphone.  In my experience, though, a generic "Sock" (as broadcasters call it) is usually fine.These windscreens are meant to fit "ball-type" microphones like the Shure SM-58 series.  They can be used with many hand-held wireless or wired microphones.No purchase will improve the overall sound of your system more.Recommended.
