Got this before our son was born after doing a LOT of research online and in the stores. Ended up with this for 3 reasons:1- It was lighter than most combo travel systems, especially the stroller. My wife's #1 concern was being able to lift it into the trunk without damaging her car or hurting her back.2- Easy of fold/unfold3- PriceThis was the only one that met and beat our 3 criteria!Now that we've been using it daily for almost 4 months, here are some observations:1- Car seat is also light and an unexpected blessing. We have friends with similar aged kids and our baby feels 5lbs heavier in their car seat.2- Car seat is relatively easy to clean, just note how the belts face when you remove them/put them back (specifically the hip ones). The first time we twisted them and didn't notice for a week. Explained why baby didn't like being in it that week, once fixed, he's happy to sit in this seat for a couple of hours.3- Stroller is super easy to fold but slightly awkward to unfold. Hard to describe unless you try this yourself. I kept going to the front/tray side looking for the handle as that was what felt the natural place for it.4- The car seat is smaller than others we've seen and already see our son having to change to a different one by the time he's one year old.Anyway, the stroller/car seat has gotten my wife multiple compliments and she really appreciates the light weight of the stroller!
