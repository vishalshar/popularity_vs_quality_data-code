What's in the box:  - Two parent units  - One monitor  - Three AC adapters  - Two battery packsThe Great:  - The monitor has an extremely sensitive microphone. You'll be able to hear EVERYTHING that is going on near your child.  - You can install three AAA batteries on the baby unit. So, if the power goes out, your baby and parent units will remain on for hours.The Good:  - Two way communication  - Up/Down volume adjustment  - Ambient temperature reading.  - Night light with two intensities (plus off). You can control it from the baby unit as well as the two parent units.  - Parent units can run for about 10 or so hours. Please note that this will shorten over time as the batteries wear out with each successive recharge.  - I haven't been able to run down the baby unit backup batteries. I've had it on batteries for 8 hours and they were just fine. I tested their charge afterwards and they still showed as if they were new on my battery tester.  - Parent units have belt clips.The Bad:  - The baby unit is prone to disconnect from the parent units once in a while. I found that if I turn the baby unit once every night (just before bed), I have absolutely no issues with it disconnecting in the middle of the night.  - Belt clips tend to break.This baby monitor is digital but it is not DECT 6.0. I got a chance to compare it against a Vtech model which features DECT 6.0 technology (model: DM221-2).The signal from the Vtech seemed to have less noise on it. At times I had to make sure that parent unit was actually on. However, this Graco monitor has an extremely sensitive microphone which picks up EVERYTHING that is going on near your child. For me, that made the difference between the two and thus kept this Graco product.I would definitely buy again.
