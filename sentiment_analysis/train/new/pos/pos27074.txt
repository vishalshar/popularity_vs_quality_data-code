I recieved this car seat today and am very pleased. Had a little bit of a problem with the canopy however. It comes with two sets of canopy attachment parts. They kinda sent me 3 correct attachment pieces and one wrong one but I was able to figure out a way to put them together anyway (and done in a safe manner). I was expecting it to be brown and a little bit of a pinker color. It's more like brown and a burnt orange color. Still very cute. The material is VERY breathable and durable. Looks like it's easy to clean as well. When you want to adjust the straps, you don't have to go through the back anymore like the car seat I bought by Graco in 2007. It's right on the seat itself below the buckle in the middle of the legs. I really like that part. Overall a great seat. Can't wait till my daughter is born in April 2010 so we can bring her home. Also bought the Zarafa double stroller. Hasn't arrived yet but very excited.
