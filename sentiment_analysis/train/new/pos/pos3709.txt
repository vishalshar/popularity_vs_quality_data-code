We love the Lifefactory glass bottle system!  We did not know the gender of our little one when purchasing this kit, and were very happy with the neutral color options.  The bottles are durable with their silicone sleeves - even after being repeatedly dropped & tossed from our little one's high chair.  The lids and nipples will not leak if you tighten them well.  We also love that they are glass so we do not have to worry about chemicals entering our little one's milk, formula, or juice.  This kit provides you with a great start for your little one.
