I have never written a product review before, but I am so incredibly thankful for this car seat I had to review it.  Unfortunately, my worst fear came true yesterday when a Ford F-150 smashed directly into the back passenger's side of my car where my 3 month old daughter was fastened in her car seat. The entire side of the car was caved in, but my daughter is completely unharmed! Even the EMT's and doctors commented on what a great job the car seat did protecting my little girl.  I love this car seat so much, I ordered the exact same thing again. Thank you Safety 1st
