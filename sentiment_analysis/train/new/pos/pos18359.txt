I hesitantly purchased this monitor after reading so many negative reviews, but took a chance because it was in our price range and is 2.4GHz instead of the 900MHz one we had previously, which was picking up too much interference in our house from electronics and cell phones.  Overall, I am very pleased with this monitor.  It does not have a constant hum like our 900 MHz one did, and does not pick up interference from our many electronics and cell phone.  I do see what other reviewers mean about the blue light being a bit much; in the dark, it looks like a strobe light.  That is the only negative we have experienced, and I plan just to put a piece of masking tape over the light to dim it a bit.  We have an 1800 sq-ft house, and have not had any range issues like others have mentioned.  In addition to good range from receiver to transmitter, it has good range from baby to transmitter, meaning it picks up noises far away from the base station transmitter.  Also, it has a sleek look to it, with modern silver color, a nice rechargeable stand, and a short antenna.  It also has a belt clip for easy portability.  Overall, a very nice, clear-speaker, low-interference, sleek-looking, well-priced baby monitor.  Give it a try; you can always return it.
