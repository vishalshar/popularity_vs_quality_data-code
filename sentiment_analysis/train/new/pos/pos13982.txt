This mattress appears to be as natural as expensive natural/organic mattresses. It had no obvious off-gassing out of the packaging. Before purchasing, I contacted the manufacturer to ask what thermo-bonded core meant. It is compressed natural fiber. They assured me that there is no foam in the product. As they advertise, there is no flame retardant. The mattress is very firm and fits my standard-size crib very well.
