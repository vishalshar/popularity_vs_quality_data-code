These are cheaper and slightly larger and softer than the Roving Cove corner cushions we also bought.  These seem a little cheaper quality, but I actually prefer their softer and spongier feel to the more durable and more expensive roving cove.  The shipping is free but does take a while to arrive (a little over a week) because it shipped internationally.  There is no packaging or instructions, the cushions and tape were just placed in a padded mailing envelope.  The tape is tedious to place 4 pieces on each cushion, but I had the same problem with Roving Cove.  Also, these are not pure white.  They have a slightly cream color to them.  Overall, I would buy again because of the price and softness.  I can't speak about the durability of it on young ones who might try to take a bite out of them!  (My daughter was not able to bite through the Roving Cove but she hasn't tried to bite these yet!)
