First off, I was totally sold on the pattern. I love all my built products I've ever gotten so I honestly don't know what to say about this one. First off, if I'd seen it in a store I might have passed on it. The concept is brilliant. But the reality, not so much. That said, I might have totally misunderstood the design and purpose of this bag. I thought it was a girly diaper bag that was open- I understood that before I bought it. I guess I was imagining that it was one of those things that stretched over your handlebars that you could put all your stuff in??? Nope. So you can fill it with stuff (warning- it can all tumble out ) and sort of hang it (you must need two clamps) from a clamp on your stroller and carry it into places. Right now it's sitting in the bathroom holding hair clips and such. It's got a strange cardboard structure inside it so it is ridged and stands unaided.
