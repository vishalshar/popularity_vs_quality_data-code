This works okay, but this isn't a miracle worker by any means. As an adult, I could use this on myself without getting any water in my eyes, but little kids really add an extra element of difficulty to the task. You've got to press the edge of the cup up against their forehead while tipping their head back to make this work. Even then, one you remove the cup, their wet hair tends to drip water onto their face. Either way, it's a convenient item to have because you WILL need a cup to rinse their hair with. It might as well be one that can keep the bulk of the water out of their face.
