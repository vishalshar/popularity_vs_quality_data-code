I use the Pura bottles and LOVE them. They are so easy to clean. My husband left milk sitting in a bottle for a day and a half before I found it. With plastic bottles even the good ones they have to be scrubbed well to get the slime feeling off them. Not so with Pura. No lingering smell or mess. The nipples are great. My son latches well on them and has no issues going between nipple and breast. I love the way the nipples vent. It's very easy for my son to stop and breath for a while between swallows. Also my son is three months old and I still have him on the slow nipple. I just received the medium and fast flow, but the slower he goes the less fussy he is when the bottle is done since hopefully the milk has started to hit his stomach towards the end. Someone else commented that the flow rate isn't marked on the nipple which is true. However you can see the holes in the nipple end. Slow is one, medium is two, and fast is three. So I don't have a problem so far.
