I really like these ladybug strap covers. They are so cute and very soft. I have them on my daughter's red umbrella stroller to make it more stylish. She really loves them as well, she now calls her red stroller the "ladybug stroller". This brand has many different stylish and fun belt strap covers to choose from, I would definitely recommend them.
