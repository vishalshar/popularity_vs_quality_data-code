Though I agree that the picture  here is not the same as how the product looks like (because of the warning label at the front) it's still the best thing we could've bought. My 4.5 year old was constantly frustrated with all other booster seats we tried because the space between the armrests and the seat is smaller than this one, so it would always twist and get caught and she'd get upset if it twisted.Since we got this seat she is able to put her seat belt on her own without any problems and if by any reason it were to get twisted she is able to fix it on her own.Some may mention there is no cup holder, but in all honesty I think it's best. The cup holders from other boosters, from our experience, are always tilted and cups always fall out anyway.The seat is very comfortable, we can easily recline and still keep the seat secure. It has been a great investment for us.
