Our little has had this for almost a year and really enjoys it. He is to the point now where he likes to turn it on and off on his own. He even turns it on in the middle of the night if he wakes up for a second to put himself back to sleep.I wasn't a big fan of the look of it- our nursery doesn't have anything else "cartoony", but we needed something.I gave it 4 stars because it does not fit on our crib correctly. The straps are just too short to fit on our crib, which means we had to place it sideways...so the stars shine on my kiddo and not on the ceiling! This could have been a simple fix by just making the strap longer...our crib isn't anything special, but it's real wood so it has some thickness. They need to fix this problem.Also, when the batteries start to wear out, it starts to switch songs every few minutes which drives my son crazy and he can't sleep because he keeps trying to put it back on the sound he likes. I have to always keep spares and change it fast or take it out of the room until I can change the batteries.
