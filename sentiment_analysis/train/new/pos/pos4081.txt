Love the size of this carrier!It is very lightweight and easy to put on.The back pad is very comfortable.Just make sure it goes to the center of your back for easy and comfortable fit.It has the dual facing feature which is a plus.I was worried my baby's nose would be covered but it wasn't at all.Just make sure that you turn the side click of the head support so it wont fold up when you put your baby facing outward.The bib is very helpful indeed coz once i put my baby in it,she kept biting the folded part.If the bib wasn;t there then it would be soaked with her spit.Overall this carrier is excellent for the price.We're ready for some strollin!
