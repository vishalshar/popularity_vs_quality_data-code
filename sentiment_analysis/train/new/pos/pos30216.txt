I love these!My local wal-mart stopped carrying them. Turns out these were cheaper with free shipping. I bought enough to last me for a while.I love that they are able to stand up. They're easy to clean with a common bottle cleaner. You can see every nook and cranny. You can also put them in the dishwasher. The large pour in area makes it ideal to just pour in yogurt from the container, no spoon or funnel needed.I love that the green part twists on opposite of the usual so a kid is less likely to figure out how to get it off. The range cap screws on as a typical item would, lefty loosey, righty tighty.My kids didn't really like that the lid was attached so I just cut it off. There is about a tablespoon of product left in it. Kind of like that last bit of toothpaste that is a little difficult to get out. But as an adult, there's only about a teaspoon left in it.They last a good long time. My only trouble has been when they have gone to nursery and the workers throw them away. I have just had to make it very clear not to throw it away. Leave them a note, write in big bold letters: DO NOT THROW AWAY, etc.
