I bought this for our daughter when she was about 3 months old to drown out street noise, the dog barking etc. We put it on ocean (single sound) and it worked great. I like that the ocean sound does not have birds or the clanking buoy bells (they are a option) but the seagulls and bells were too jarring and would keep me awake through the baby monitor! but the single ocean sound is perfect.After 2.5 years of being used every night- we pack it up and take it with us where ever we travel, now the speaker is getting too quiet. We used to run it on almost all the way up, then we ran it on all the way up, now all the way up is just not loud enough. I am in the market for a new white noise machine for the almost 3 year old and 1 for the new baby. Because of the lack of birds and bells in the ocean, and a few other constant sounds like the rain, heart beat (womb), brook, and wind I think I am going to buy 2 more of these machines. 2 years of nightly (10+ hours) use for $30 each is a pretty good deal.
