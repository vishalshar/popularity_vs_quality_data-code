This is my second Bebe Au Lait Nursing Cover. My first was given as a gift to me for my baby shower with my first child. I got so much use out of it and then I (stupidly) donated it after my second child thinking we were done having kids. Surprise! Baby #3 was happening and I didn't have a nursing cover. I saw this pattern on Amazon and I had to order it. I did order covers from Udder Covers before with my other two kids, but I didn't like how small they were. As my babies grew, the nursing cover didn't offer as much coverage as the Bebe Au Lait brand did. I mostly used the Bebe Au Lait cover. I especially loved that this cover has terry cloth on the bottom corners just in case I forget a burp cloth. The hoop is stiff enough so that I can see my baby nursing but not so wide that someone could see in. This is a fantastic product that offers me the privacy I need when I need to feed my baby in public.
