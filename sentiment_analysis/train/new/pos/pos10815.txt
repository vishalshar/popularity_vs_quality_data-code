I am a Speech Pathologist and use these toy with all my toddlers. It is appropriate for this age group due to the cause and effect/dump and fill type play it involves. The shapes make sounds as they are put into the slots which is very motivating to toddlers. I use it to stimulate language by with holding the shapes and requiring the child to ask for them (more, mine, my turn). You can also work on turn taking with this toy. I call this my magic toy and buy it for all of my friends who have young toddlers. Enjoy.
