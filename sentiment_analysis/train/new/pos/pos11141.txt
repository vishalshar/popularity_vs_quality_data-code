What an awesome product. I live in a small mountain town with over 300 days of sunshine and my stroller's shade wasn't long enough to cover my son's legs.  This does an awesome job of doing just that.  You can adjust it to block sun from any direction.  It keeps my son protected from the harmful UV rays and keeps the sun out of his eyes when we are walking in the afternoon. I love the cute patterns they have to choose from.  The only negative thing I have found is that you have to tighten it from time to time as it loses it's position if there is a lot jiggling when you are pushing the stroller.  (It does add some extra width to your stroller and takes a little getting used to, so be careful if you are using it in crowded areas.)
