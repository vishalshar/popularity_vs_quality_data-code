My son is now 6 yrs old but we purchased this product back in 2006 for my son when he was a baby & we never had any complaints or issues with it.  No injuries, no problems, very uneventful except for the fun my son had using it daily.  We actually still have it but are planning on handing it down to someone we know with a baby, I'd trust it as a hand-me-down, it's still sturdy & in good shape almost 6 yrs later.  Nothing ever broke on it or anything & my son really used it to the hilt & was pretty rough with it!  Good buy & worth the money.
