This is definitely one of the best car back seat organizers we have used. It is strong and is made of heavy duty material and also has lots of pockets. The two straps on top and bottom, both have clips unlike some I have used in the past with strings only.At last our car is tidy and WELL organized. We also think it will be great when we go out camping...we can use it to hang in the tent, to keep items organized.Good purchase and would recommend it to all my friends. I don't know why I waited so long to purchase one.
