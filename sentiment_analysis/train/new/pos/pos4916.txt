This net is great. We're using it to keep our daughter from sticking her head between balusters in the gate that secures out 2nd story, sliding glass door which leads to nothing (instead of a deck). However, the strings looked super sloppy to me, so instead we used Darice Locking Cable Ties, 12-Inch, Clear. See the picture. we cut the excess, and this produced a very clean look.
