I got this to help my son enjoy tummy time a little more than he currently does.  Unfortunately it didn't help him, but the product itself is adorable!  I love the two little birds (one squeaks, and one rattles) and love that they are velcro so they can be pulled off and stuck back on.  I'm really hoping that he enjoys it more once he is a little older.  The only thing I don' like about it is that the mirror is kind of curved, like a fun house mirror--which I have heard is pretty common with "safety" mirrors for kids.
