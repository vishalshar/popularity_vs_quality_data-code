This is a wonderful monitor, I purchased this after using "summer" brand video monitor with night vision. This is an INCREDIBLE upgrade from Summer. The daytime color is nice, and the night vision is exceptional. With the old monitor, my daughter blended into the shadows of the sheets at night, so I could never really see her. With  this monitor, I  have detailed vision of her in complete darkness. ( she doesn't use a night light.). One important feature to know about- the camera for this system has a very bright blue light on the front, about the size of a pea - this would be great for a night light if you want one, but I did not. I felt it was WAY too bright, and lit up my daughters room too much at night. But a simple small piece of black electrical tape placed over the light completely solved the problem.  I have no problem with interference at all with this system, and it comes in clear everywhere. Wish I bought it sooner!!!
