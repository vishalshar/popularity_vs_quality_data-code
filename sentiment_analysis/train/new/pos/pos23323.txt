I have never been this excited to leave a review! I have a 7 year old, 3 year old, and a 1 year old. I know this is meant for babies under the age of 9 months, but I was a little slow to come across this product. And besides, I'm glad I now have one whole piece with all 3 of my children. It was a little tricky cause I had to use more product since my 2 girls have larger feet, and my son is at that age where he won't stay still. I made them without any help holding down my son. Getting the hand done was impossible. I had to throw it away because he fought me hard lol! You have to move quickly, cause the mould dries fast once it's mixed. I also used my own containers since the ones provided aren't meant for kids my age. Also, since my kids touched the sides while doing the mould, I had A LOT of touching up to do, to make it look natural. All in all, I'm in love with the outcome! Be sure it is completely dry before painting. I finished them off with an acrylic gloss spray. I then bought clay from Amazon, and pushed them into it to make a stand. I didn't want them to be permanently stuck into it, so I let the clay dry for a couple of weeks. It shrunk a little, so I had to sand it to get them to fit back in. Then I bought acrylic paint for the base, and a bronze marker (all from Amazon), used adhesive putty to get the feet to hold in the clay stand, sprayed the whole thing with acrylic gloss spray again.....and voila! You'll figure it out with trial and error, just like I did. I don't have an artistic bone in my body, but I couldn't be happier with how it all turned out. And yes, I have a little over 2 packets left over. $45 is a bargain for what you can create from this! I thought it was going to be complicated, but I think it's more just time consuming (if you're as picky as I am). Go for it! Years from now you'll be glad you did!
