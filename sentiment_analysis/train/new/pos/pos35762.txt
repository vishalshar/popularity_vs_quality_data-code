I chose these above other outlet covers because I was drawn to the curvy aesthetics. They arrived looking exactly as I expected and I'm quite pleased with them.But that's because I'm installing them semi-permanently. If you're planning to frequently use the outlet then these aren't what you want, unless tearing out fingernails and pounding your fist into the wall to make them go all the way back in is your idea of a good time. They could potentially become easier to remove/insert with time, but all I know is I'm still wincing from my first attempt to remove one.Not much else to say; they come in packs of 2, I've seen them here for $10 but nabbed them for just under $3/pack. I wouldn't recommend paying much more.
