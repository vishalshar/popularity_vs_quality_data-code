I researched a lot of different walkers before I finally settled on this one.  It's a bit pricier than other walkers but I feel its well worth the price difference.  First off, I have to say that this product is advertised as being for 6 months and up, which I mostly agree with.  We bought this for our 4-month old and he's in the 80th percentile for his length and can touch the floor on his tiptoes when in the lowest setting.Pros:  removable dj tray makes this very convenient--you can switch up toys any time you want.  Battery replacement for the tray is easily done.  Very sturdily built, with optional brake pads.  About the brake pads: you won't need them at all on carpet.Cons: the seat is a royal pain to remove for cleaning and reinstall.  Also, the back wheels don't swivel.  This is probably a good thing in general, but its a bit frustrating for the smaller babies to scoot around, as it limits directional movement.  One last thing, when this is collapsed, there is no locking mechanism, so when you pick it up from the side to carry it, it will pop out and expand... nothing big, just makes carrying it kind of a pain.Overall:  Great walker, and my baby LOVES it!
