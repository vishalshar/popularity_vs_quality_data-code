I bought these even though other reviews said the self-stick doesn't stick all that well.  I have to say, they do start to come off every once in a while but we've got great walls that are smooth so it doesn't happen very often.  And I also went to Home Depot and bought the wall paper paste for self stick borders.  That took care of the problem of them peeling off.  I do plan to have them up for quite a while.But I LOVE the decals and the scenes.  They really do look like they are painted on.  They've got a clear background and just seem to pop off the walls.  These are the watercolor ones so they are muted.  But I like them that way.  They are adorable and with a little imagination, you can create your own 100 Acre Woods.
