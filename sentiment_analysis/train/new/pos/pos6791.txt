This is our second stepstool which we bought for the bathroom next to kid's bedroom. The previous one which we have been using in the main bathroom is a slightly bigger and more expensive model. Having two slightly different items that do the same job gives me the opportunity to compare them side by side.The Munchkin one is larger and sturdier. It can handle the weight of an adult easily which we have tested a lot. However it is also heavier and bulkier. So the younger kids might have difficulties moving it around. It is foldable but it is neither easy nor convenient to keep folding and unfolding it so I would not rely on that function. It is well balanced and non slip.Mommy's helper (this one) is half the size, which gives it less surface area but offers easy storage and carrying. I am sure it can not handle the weight of an adult but would be okay for kids of all ages. It looks pretty and costs half as much as munchkin does. It does not fold but the reasonable size compensates it. It is light weight and kids can carry it easily. The height for this model is 6 inches compared to the 6.5 inches the other brand offers. This one is easy to clean and also offers a non slip experience as wellMy conclusion is, if you only need it for your increasing the reach of your kids then go ahead and buy this one and save the $8 difference, however if you think that an adult up to 200 pounds can also use it for a purpose then the other one is the thing to go
