This seat fits great onto oblong toilets and I'd assume odd-shaped toilets also. It 'locks' into the opening by 2 prongs in the front and 2 adjustable prongs in the back. It's a very snug fit and does not move once placed. Because it's so tight, it's actually a little difficult to remove, not ideal for a guest bath where we needed the flexibility to take on/off in a pinch. Also, I'd assume that taking on/off to clean it would be more cumbersome although you can just pry and lift the white cushion off the plastic holder (but pee can get between the cushion and plastic).The seat is AIR-filled and provides enough cushion, but do not expect the full-foamy feel. It also has a LOWER profile than most of the foam-padded seats so the munchkin doesn't have to climb another 3in foam mountain to get on top of the potty. Possibly a bigger deal for little ones starting out with the stepstool, but probably not an issue with older/taller kids.The opening looks to be a SMALL 4.5x6.5in. (although most openings average 5x6.5in) which may be fine for a skinny/petite child but may not work for an older/bigger kid. It's a little difficult to take in/out of a diaper bag because the 4 prongs jut out relative to the rest of the ring (as opposed to a 360* ring that protrudes) and it tends to catch other things in your bag, but overall it's definitely on the more compact side as potty rings go.Overall it's a great product if the above criteria is what you need for your child.
