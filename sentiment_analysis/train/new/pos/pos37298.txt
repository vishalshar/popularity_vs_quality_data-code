This is a little bit expensive for what you get, however, it is a wonderful product. My 3 month old sleeps in it every night and most naps.  Don't buy the summer infant cheapo swaddler.  After 4 weeks of use it had 5 rips in it and it bunched up around my babies neck on 2 occasions before I tossed it, I should have known by the way she fussed when we put her into it. My only complaint is that my daughter can kick her legs (she loves this thing and thinks it is play time when we put her into it) and it pulls down lower on her shoulders than it seems like it should. I love that she can move her arms and legs, just like in the womb, but cannot startle herself awake.  I will be buying a bigger one when the time comes around.
