Ordered this set for our 4 year old daughter so she could have something to lounge in in her play room. She immediately loved it when it arrived (super fast), and uses it all the time. It goes well with the recliner, which was a smart decision since she's not always the best at sharing (only child). They seem well constructed and she hasnt destroyed them yet. Even my wife sits in it to watch movies with her somtimes, and she weighs 110lbs. Only shortfall is that it shows dirt very easily given its ultra bright yellow color and the texture of material that covers it. Overall we're happy with the purchase though
