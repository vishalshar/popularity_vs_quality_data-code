Super Easy to apply and looks amazing on the wall !!!!I did a lot of research on amazon to find a tree with good quality and the actual size I wanted.  You have to be careful with some of these wall decals because some can advertise like they are really big but aren't.  This tree is actually the right size ! It covers the whole wall.  I have a nursery with a woodland theme and the tree fits in perfectly !!!I couldn't have asked for an easier tree to apply to the wall.  It was actually fun to put it up !!!
