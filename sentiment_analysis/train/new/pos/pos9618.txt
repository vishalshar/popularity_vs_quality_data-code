My boyfriend and I recently got a gorgeous new sectional couch, and two pairs of mushy, deliciously comfortable throw pillows for it. The couch is brown, the pillows green and orange.When I saw this cute, little nursery pillow and how well it matched the couch and throw pillows, but also introduced another color - blue - in a way that would help tie it into the rest (not to mention, the green and orange stripes feel like suede or microfiber, same as the couch), I had to have it as an accent pillow. The fact that my boyfriend loves and collects elephant-related items helped seal the deal.The pillow is small and definitely more for show than comfort (hence the 4-stars), but it really is quite adorable and adds a whimsical touch to the room. I love it!(See my image above.)
