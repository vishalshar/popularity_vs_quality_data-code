We just started feeding solid food to our 6 month old baby and were having a hard time finding a spoon to use.  I wanted to avoid plastic for health reasons and the spoons we had were just too big for his mouth.  This spoon works perfectly.  It is just the right size for an infant mouth and fits just enough food on the spoon for one bite.  It is not too deep so all the food comes off of the spoon rather than being left behind when I take the spoon out of his mouth; it is also not too shallow which allows me to use it for runny rice cereal - it really is the perfect size!  Our son loves eating with it, the metal does not bother his gums or mouth (and he really chomps down), and we have had no problems or complaints at all!
