I didn't realize there were pink bows on the monkeys' heads, but my sister didn't care.  The mobile is lovely...it's so cute and the lullaby sounds great.  Pay attention to the instructions and how you put it together...because once it's set up, you aren't taking it apart!  (I may or may not have put something on backwards but the crib's setup made that mistake a moot point.  Phew)  I got this on the next day shipping and got it when I needed it!
