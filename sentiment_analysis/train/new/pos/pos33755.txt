I'm completely satisfied with this product. It really worked well for my 20 month kid , she used to be a thumb sucker with both the hands since she was 6 months old.I tried several ways before using this product and nothing worked out. As soon as I started putting this thumb guard on her hands I saw the difference within just 3 days after wearing those. Initially she was reluctantly wearing it and at times stressed out trying to pull it out but within couple of days she was comfortable with it. By the end of one week I saw she was no more interested to suck her thumbs so I started to remove it during the day time , however I continued to put it on her hands during the night when she used to suck her thumb for the most. Now after almost 2 weeks I'm seeing good improvement in her overall activities like speaking tiny words and playing with her toys. I would definitely suggest it to anyone having similar problem.
