After having two children, I know that there are just some people out there, mainly strangers, who feel this need to just reach out and touch my infant's face or hands. It drives me insane. I am not even a picky mother or germ freak but I do not want the unwashed hands of strangers touching my babies, especially my newborn. For expectant mothers, this does happen and sometimes often. I wish I had purchased this with my first two, it would have saved me a lot of time. I have a little boy on the way and I have already pinned this to his car seat for extra protection. It's big enough and bright enough that anyone should be able to see it and read it clearly. It looks nice too and not an eye sore. I'm happy with it!
