I just received my Quirky Bubba Crib Mattress protector & I couldn't be happier with it! The product is made of terry toweling which is clearly stated on the packaging & the size is true to the description. All stitching is high quality and I really couldn't be happier with this protector. Thanks Quitky Bubba all I need now is for baby to arrive & we can start using the crib!
