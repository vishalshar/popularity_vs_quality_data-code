We originally did not buy the stroller that went with our carseat because we insisted that we wanted a very small, slim, stroller that could easily be packed away and navigate busy areas, such as a Farmer's Market. After messing with one of the tiny strollers, we decided we wanted to upgrade to something larger that could carry the carseat from daycare to home (our baby is dropped off in the carseat on the way to work) as well as ride smoothly over streets and sidewalks.This stroller is truly amazing. The wheels turn smoothly and silently, all handle and folding operations are just a click away, and it has features like cup holders and cubbies in just the right places. Now that we have it we agree that the other stroller might as well decorate the trunk space of the car for "emergencies" because the Cortina does it ALL. I highly recommend it.
