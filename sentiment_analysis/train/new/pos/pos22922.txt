I bought this play pad because of the pillow that it comes with.  My babysitter has it and my baby seems to fuss less when we use this pillow for tummy time versus no pillow/other pillows. We are also using it to help her learn to sit up on her own.  It is easy to take care of and I have washed it at least once a week (gentle cycle, air dry) due to the amount of drool it takes on and it has held up really well.  I have also noticed that her flat spot is almost gone now that she is able to spend more time on her tummy.
