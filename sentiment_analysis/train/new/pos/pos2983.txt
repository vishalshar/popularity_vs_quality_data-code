This pillow is just what I needed! I used the Boppy full body prenatal pillow with my first pregnancy and didn't remember having any complaints at the time. However, when I got it out to use this time around, I was constantly waking up all tangled in the giant pillow and sheets. This pillow is the perfect size to give some belly and hip support, without taking over the bed. Also, it allows you to use your own pillow for your neck and head, thereby leaving you free to roll over without having to stand up and reposition everything. It's also great for underneath your knees or behind your back support for watching tv.
