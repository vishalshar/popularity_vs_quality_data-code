I love this Britax, I graduated my daughter out of the roundabout when she turned 5 and hit 40lbs although it is recommended to put them back into the 5 point harness she has a hard time buckling in herself in carline at school.  The one complaint I did read about was the low armrest but I have found no problem with them I taught my daughter to pull out the seatbelt buckle in, tuck the seatbelt under the armrests then pull the seatbelt snugg, she got it after our 4th practice try with the ease of a pro.  We have been in a small rear end accident where we where hit from beind the seat did it's job and she was not hurt at all and very safe.  I drive the BMW X5 and the seat sits great on my backseat, the cup holders work great I have no problem with them.  It is an easy in and out booster when we are carpooling with friends the head section adjusts with ease.  The price it what I expect for a Britax it was actually a lot less then what I was imagined it would be considering I paid $300 for my roundabout, but worth ever penny I have recommended this booster to many of my "mom" friends who are or where looking at boosters and each one of them love it. Thats right they also bought one.As for the little passenger who has to use it... She loves her seat, she has never complained we have done a few long road trips in it and she is comfy, as for the colors grey and pink... well what can I say she is a girl and what girl doesn't like pink, she adores it and the grey matches the interior of my car beautifully.
