This seat lasted from when my son was 6 months to his 4th birthday when he graduated to the next size and his younger brother needed the space for his seat.  My sons were both large and outgrew the 22 lb seats at 6 months.  For the second I bought a larger weight range on his infant seat, but for my first son I bought this one.  As a seat for a 6 month old the cons are that it is not removable like a carrier (which just encourages you to carry your babe which is great) and it was difficult to fit rear facing in my Toyota Camry.  It had to go in the middle (which is fine) and the driver's seat had to be pushed forward more than I like.  It may be fine for a shorter person (I am 5'10") because the seat would already be forward, or for a different type of car.  However when forward facing it fits great.  My son loved it and didnt' want to give it up at 4 years.  I sewed the removable part to the seat because it was always falling out.  I thought that the price on this seat was much higher than many others, but it is an excellent seat and at the time I had the money and have no regrets.
