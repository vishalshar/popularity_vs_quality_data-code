I have a bad back. I bought this stand with the tub separate. I put it in the shower and bath my son in there because I have one of those shower heads on the coil that you can move around. He loves it. He splashes around and loves when I aim the shower head at his feet. Best part is I never have to bend over for long periods of time while bathing a baby like you would in a regular tub. I dont know how many pounds this will last for. Hes 20 pounds now and its totally fine. He does splash and kick and move around alot and I havent had any scares with tipping or anything. Then again I have it shoved in the corner of my shower between walls. Maybe at ten more pounds I will switch to the bathtub just because he will be able to sit up anyway. For what I bought it for I love it. Not sure what the hose or tubing is supposed to do. I just use it to drain the tub but I see others upset that their tub didnt come with one. I'd like to know what they need it for. Because when you lift it up the water stops coming out anyway so you cant use it to rinse baby or get a constant stream of water. Anyway. good product.
