This playmat works on so many levels, but at it's heart, it's the second largest changing mat I could find. To me, bigger is better particularly for changing the kiddo on the public changing tables in restrooms. Those things are disgusting so the more coverage I could get, the better! I've also used this at the park for the kiddo to lay on.It folds up pretty easily. It's also very easy to wipe or spray down to clean whenever you'd like.It's a great deal at this price. As I mentioned, it's the second largest I found. The one only slightly larger is the Patemm Round Baby Diaper Portable Changing Pad (Turquoise Giraffes), though it is five times the price (but that may be worth it as it is made in the US, and this is not).
