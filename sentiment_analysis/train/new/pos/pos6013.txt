These sheets are fine.  They are on the thin side, but with a mattress cover and sheet protector it's really not a big deal.  They are reasonably priced and meet my expectations.  I bought them to fit my 5" Davinci Crescent Mini Crib 50 Coil Mattress (as suggested by another reviewer.)  Because they are fitted sheets they wrap snugly around the min crib mattress despite being measured for a regular sized crib mattress.  The sheets are sized for a regular mattress but the elastic keeps them snug enough to fit my mini mattress safely.
