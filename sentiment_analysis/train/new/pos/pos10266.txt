My first daughter, Annabelle, died from SIDs at four months old. Because of this I was extra worried about my second daughter, Ashley when she was born. My sister gave the Snuza Halo to us at the hospital when Ashley was born. It has been on her for every sleeping moment since the day we received it. It is the cherished thing that I have for her. I would gladly give up EVERY other child gismo and gadget just to own this monitor. It gives me peace of mind like you can never imagine. When she was first born it took us a while to figure out how to best keep it in place on that small little diaper. Since then I have figured out it still picks up movement though small amounts of clothing such as a onesie. The best way to do make sure you don't have any false alarms is to clip it onto a pair of pants. And if you have a real mover or a very little baby who's breathing is less pronounced, clip the halo to a pair of well fitted pants and snap the onesie OVER the halo. This will insure that it never looses contact with the belly and makes it go off falsely. In light of my first daughters death, many people have asked me if there is anything that they can do to help ease the pain of my loss. To anyone who has babies my response is always the same. Buy the snuza monitor. The only thing that I can do about my daughter's death is to try to eliminate the unnecessary loss of other precious babies. Somehow, knowing that I may have spared other babies' lives and the heartbreak of other mother's makes the pain of loosing her a little less. Please, buy the snuza monitor and tell your friends too. That way, Annabelle's death will have counted for something - saving the life of other babies.
