This is a super cute bib.  It has soft fabric and a lovely design that doesn't look cheap.  It is wide enough to catch spills and drips.  Unfortunately, the neck opening is sized for smaller babies.We purchased this bib for a 6-month old to wear at a wedding reception.  The baby is 17 pounds for perspective's sake and usually fits into 9-12 month size clothing.I measured the inside diameter of the bib and it measures 11" when the Velcro ends are pressed together.  In other words, if your baby has a neck with a circumference more than 11", this bib will seem too tight.For comparison's sake, currently, the baby wears a bib that measures 13" which fits fine.
