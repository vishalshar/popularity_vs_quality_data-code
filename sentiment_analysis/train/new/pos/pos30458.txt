For the price I think this is the best motor mobile there is. It is very basic the animals are a flat plastic with a sticker inlay. I didn't want to waste money on a mobile but my son saw one and stared at it for hours. I like that it has three volume options (low medium and no sound) and the option to have a short run by pushing the button or a longer run by using the on/off switch. It has a height adjustment on the orange base (the arm is a fixed height) and attaches with a safety clip.
