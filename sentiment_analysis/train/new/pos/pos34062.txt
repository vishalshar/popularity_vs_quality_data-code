I bought this for my 22 month old son. He is tall for his age and very active.  We have been going back and forth to the mainland and he gets very bored waiting in the terminal to board the plane. I saw this and bought it. He has not stopped rolling around on it since it came. He LOVES his trunki.  I know he will be playing with it for years. Although it does say for ages 3 years and up, it may depend on your child. As I said, my son is only 22 months but he can balance himself on it and push himself around without tipping.  Also, this price is comparable to other site, however,watch this site for free shipping offers and that makes it all worth it. Especially when it is being shipped to Hawaii.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
