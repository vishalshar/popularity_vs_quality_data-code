Ok - what people are saying about it being small is kind of true but it is SOOOO beautiful and seems really well-made.It is for my infant daughter so it doesn't need to be that big. When she's a toddler I plan to have fun teaching her the value of money by having her collect loose change and then using the change to get small stuff (like maybe sweet-tarts from the candy machine or used toys at a garage sale --- we do that with our 4yo son now; we have him help us turn in the recycling for garage sale money). When she's older it'll just be a keepsake from her childhood and maybe something to pass down to her own kids.In any case, it's a blingy addition to any nursery room or little girl's room. I really like that it looks more like a real pig (the wrinkled snout, the longish ears, the curled pigtail). Some piggy banks are more stylized, cartoonish versions of pigs which is fine, but the more realistic nature of this one somehow makes it feel more special, more heirloom-y.
