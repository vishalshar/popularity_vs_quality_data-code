The fabric is SO SOFT! I love that it has a soft fuzzy side and a smooth silky side so babies get to feel both textures.  I looked everywhere for one like this that does not have a rattle in the head, and this is the one I found.  I'm very happy with it.  I've also washed & dried it a few times and it comes out like new.
