My 18 month old granddaughter loves to drink boxed juice. When she picks up the container she usually gives herself a good squirt of juice all over her clothing. I searched for "juice box holder with lid" and this item was included in the first three items displayed.  When I received the item I saw that it did not have a lid. However, after using it several times with different juices, including organic juice in the pliable plastic pouches, I have concluded that a lid would not be useful. Since using this item my granddaughter has not accidentally drenched herself in liquid. She took to using this right away and now when I tell her "go get a juice", she returns with a juice in one hand and a juice box in the other. Apparently she likes it and that is the best part! I did expect the item to be better than some of the others listed as the price point was higher. I see no difference I this one compared to the less expensive ones. If pink is your color...this is the one.Note: This item is not intended to perfectly fit a box snuggly. If you are concerned about the box having too much movement while in the holder, just use a paper towel stuffed inside. I have not had any problems with even the small juice boxes.
