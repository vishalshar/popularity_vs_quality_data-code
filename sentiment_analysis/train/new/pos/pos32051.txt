I was a little nervous about ordering this baby book because there weren't any reviews or inside pictures but it is just perfect! One of my favorite things is that it's written from the perspective of the child so it says things like "Mommy & daddy first heard my heartbeat", "Mommy first felt me move", "New discoveries I made" etc. The pages are absolutely adorable with cute patterns and cute little giraffes, monkeys, elephants, etc. and there's room for pictures on most of them. This book covers the first five years and has a page for each month for the first twelve months and then has a page for each birthday up to the 5th. It includes a section to put in the baby's firsts like "found my hands and feet" or "clapped my hands." It also has room for photos for important firsts like first bath, tooth, haircut, steps. There's also a couple of pages toward the back after the 5th birthday for the first day of school and a full page for keepsakes or photos from that first day. Also in the back is a page for a letter from mommy and another page for one from daddy. A nice surprise is that there's room to put info from when the baby was born like headlines in the news, the president, popular TV shows/movies & songs, the price of items like a gallon of gas, gallon of milk, movie ticket, stamps, diapers, etc. There's also 2 pages to put a copy of baby's birth certificate, hospital bracelet, handprints, & footprints.
