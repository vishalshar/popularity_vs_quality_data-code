I really love this thing and I'm using it as a wall shelf in my bathroom for my body jewelry!  It honestly works perfectly considering that I'm using it for something other than was originally intended.  The ONLY reason this is missing a star is because they really don't want to stick together very much while moving it.  The pieces don't really LOCK together.  Its absolutely perfectly fine while its sitting still.  Its when its being picked up that things get frustrating. haha
