We love this!  Somehow I was under the impression that the globe rotated on its base, but that's not the case.  The locations of the stars change slightly as the two colored bulbs alternate and slightly overlap for a brief second.  It's a very simple lamp but my three-year-old loves it.  And we steal it from his room after he falls asleep and bring it to our bedroom because it's so cool.It is, however, very bright - not the stars, but the globe itself.  In a dark room, the glare of the globe might prevent you from falling asleep.We solved that problem by unscrewing the globe, stuffing it with tissue to protect the LED lamps and the interior surface, then spray-painted the outside with a metallic color to optimize coverage.  Now the light only comes through the star openings as opposed to having the entire globe light up.  Doesn't look too pretty turned off (in part because of my shoddy paint job), but when lit up it works exactly how I wanted it.
