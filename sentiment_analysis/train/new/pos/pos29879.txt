I have nothing but good things to say about the decals. They are nice and do not taer easily. It is a bit difficult to get them off the paper without sticking since some pieces are big and intreqite but it is possible for one pregnant person to do ;0).  If applied with the little plastic card included, they do not come off the walls at all. All you need is to follow direction and presto
