I've had one of these for almost two years now.  I still use the neck wrap on long trips when my toddler is going to fall asleep.  It is the only head support I have used that keeps their heads from flopping over.  When we took our baby home from the hospital we had it in his car seat.  I bought this one for a friend's baby shower.  This is now going to be my go-to baby shower gift.
