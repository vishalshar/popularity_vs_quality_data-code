We received a different angel dear as a gift for our newborn son 2 years ago. He loved it so much, that we got this one for our daughter when she was born this year and she loves it so much too! We gave both our kids the angel dear lovies at 3 months and my son is still obsessed at 2 years old.  Both love to nuzzle them as they fall asleep. We have other brands of lovies and these have always been their favorites. I think it's because they are really soft, light, and have little nubs on them to pinch. I like them beacuse they are easy to wash and light so im not scared of the lovey smothering them as they sleep.
