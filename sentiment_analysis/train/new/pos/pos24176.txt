I ordered this and didn't pay attention to the "Colors may vary" in the description, so I was expecting green.  We received pink.  This being for a boy, it makes me a little sad, but other than color, I have no other qualms with this product.  The packaging was perfectly in tact, the product has good sized handles with the rubber grips - making them comfortable in an adult's hand.  The brush's bristles are soft and plentiful, and the comb has on every other tooth, a tiny round ball which is very smooth so as to not scrape or scratch our son's scalp.It would have been nice to be given the power to decide the color.
