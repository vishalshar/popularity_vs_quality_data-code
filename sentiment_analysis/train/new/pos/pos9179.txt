We bought this for our 10 month old son. He was giving me a hard time when I would put him in the stroller and I thought he would enjoy this more. I am so glad we bought it. our neighbor has the radio flyer version of this and that was what we were going to buy but we like some of the features on this much better. Some things we liked were the retractable foot rest, the nicely padded seat, and the wheels are hard plastic but have a thin rubber coating. The hadle part folds down nice also so it can fit in the back of my GMC Acadia. We didn't want completely hard plastic wheels because we do take our dog for 2-3 walks a day and were worried the wheels would wear out over time. Two negatives that are not a huge deal are we wish the wheels were all rubber and the zipper pouch can be a little snug to get items in and out. but those are not really huge issues. It is a little tricky to steer while walking our dog but you get use to it. Also our son has started to grab the handle bars and he does take over control then of where the bike goes.I got the box and it was really beat up but all the parts were there and not broken. I assembled the bike myself in about 30 -40 minutes. The hardest part was getting the harness/seat to bolt to the main frame. I had to push down with my foot hard to make it fit. Other than that it was an easy assembly!We love the color and people will see us coming. We have received so many compliments about this so far. We use it everywhere! on the side walk on gravel paths when we go to the park and I also take it to the store sometimes. My son is a bigger baby also and he fits in it just fine. He is 11 months old now and weight 24 lbs and has lots of room.This was a great purchase and our son is so happy to ride in it! We are very happy with the purchase and debated for a while if this is what we wanted to buy but it is worth the money and we would recommend this to everyone.
