If you breastfeed, you have to own a boppy.  It will save your back from hunching over, and save your sanity when you have to sleep upright and use it as a neck pillow.  This was super soft and easy breezy to wash in washing machine if you spilled something on it...read, your baby upchucked milk all over it and now it smells like rancid trash.  Plus, pink is girly...so I liked it.
