I breastfed exclusively and my baby refused to take a pacifier so I was afraid she would also refuse a bottle. She loved this bottle. My only complaint is about the warmer, keep a close eye for blue stuff! Even tiny dots of it mean it's leaking and should not be used! Luckily I contacted the company and they sent me a new one free of charge :). You will want to keep a few warmers on hand to swap between because you can only use it once and then you have to recharge it (which takes 4 hrs). I would recommend it and have :)
