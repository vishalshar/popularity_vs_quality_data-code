Fantastic product.  I have been using this for4 years now, with very curious 4 year old and 2 year old in the house.  They pretty much ignore the stove.  A couple of times I have taken it off if I am opening the oven a lot, but I notice my daughters almost immediately make a beeline for the gas knobs! I'm really shocked at how effective this is at removing their attention to such a dangerous area of the kitchen.  I agree with other reviewers that the extra width can be annoying to move back and forth as I need to open cabinets on either side of the oven, but that extra width keeps little hands away from the knobs.It gets splashed and dirty easily, and is a little difficult to clean as it is way wider than my sink, but I've learned to just remove it and clean it with a soapy washcloth right on top on the stove and then replace it rather than struggle with rinsing it in the sink.After 4 years, I just broke the arm and cracked the shield after one last fatal drop onto the floor. I came back on Amazon to purchase another one, and was reading the Q & A and saw that the company has replacement parts.  Perfect! I went on their website, and saw you can not only replace parts - but they are LIFETIME GUARANTEED and replace parts for FREE! Wow, you don't see that very often.  I had to come on and give this product a RAVE review, for effectiveness, appearance and outstanding customer service.  I wish I could give it 10 stars.
