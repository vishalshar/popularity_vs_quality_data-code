We have tried different swaddlers for our newborn baby, including miracle blanket and Aden & Anais swaddle blankets. Miracle blanket turned out to be to difficult to put the baby in because it has to many flaps that you have to wrap around. Also, I noticed the baby was sweating in it because it has that many layers.  Aden's blankets have wonderful material and are extremely soft but to thin for winter months (our daughter was born in November). Plus, our daughter managed to get out of them pretty fast no matter how tight we swaddle her.  We will use those blankets in summer for stroller walks. So, now SwaddleMe Organic. We started using it around second week she was born and were amazed how easy it is to use and change baby's diapers without waking her up. There is a difference to fabric between organic and regular one. Organic one is super soft and stay in shape longer than regular one. We have 3 of them and use them every night. It is one of the best buys for a baby!
