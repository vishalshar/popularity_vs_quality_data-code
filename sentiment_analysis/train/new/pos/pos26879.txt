Great spoons for whens starting solids with your little one. I let my daughter hold one while I feed her with the other as I try to teach her to self feed. Its a shallow spoon so my baby can get all of the food off of it without having to slurp/splash which is nice. Since the handle is short I also don't have to worry about her sticking the wrong end in her mouth and causing a gag reflex like she has done with the nuby spoons we also tried. .
