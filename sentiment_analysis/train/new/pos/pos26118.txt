If you know how to use it this is a good nasal aspirator.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of five stars is because it is sometimes difficult (but not impossible) to empty the balloon.  According to the instructions you are supposed to bend the tip with your finger.  When it works well you get a lot of mucous in the tip and balloon and this clogs the tip temporarily.  At times I have bent the tip, the balloon did not empty, only to come back in 1 to 2 mins and it had emptied itself.I think this is a great product and I am really glad I bought it and glad it's out there.  I can't imagine using the type you have to suction with your mouth, and I can't stand the bulb that has who knows how much old mucous still inside, and no way to clean it out.  This is a good investment.
