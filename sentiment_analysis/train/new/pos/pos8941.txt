I absolutely love these bottles. Before my baby was born, we knew we didn't want to use and plastic bottles, especially since sterilizing must be done under high heat.  After about a month of using these bottles, I am pleased to say these are simply amazing.  For comparison's sake, we have "tried" Avent, Mixie, Dr. Browns, and MAM bottles.  The reason why we tried the other bottles was because the size 1 Lifefactory nipples were to fast for our newborn and milk would leak out of his mouth.  After trial and error, we found that the newborn dr browns nipples fit perfectly onto the lifefactory bottles (and much much slower). Problem solved!! I was thinking about docking a star for that but i'm so happy with the quality of the bottles, I didn't want other viewers to hesitate buying these. The sleeves are awesome, it allows you to handle the bottles even when its very hot. We have dropped these bottles onto our hardwood floors with no problem.  I even bought the sippy cup toppers so that we can use these when baby becomes a little older.Cons:-Must use a bottle brush to clean inside the bottle (very minor inconvenience to me)-Size 1 Nipples to fast (rectified with Dr. brown nipples)-heavier than plasticOverall, the benefits far outweigh the very minor cons.  I anticipate these bottles lasting a very long time.
