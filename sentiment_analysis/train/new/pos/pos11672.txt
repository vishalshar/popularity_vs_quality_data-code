I used this for both of my boys and then passed it on to someone else. When my kids were little I liked having the option to "box them in" so that I could walk away for 30 seconds without them rolling off the mat  - there certainly is plenty to keep them occupied. It was also super easy to wash with a wipe - and a couple of times I through i t the washing machine and it help up great.
