I was a bit apprehensive about ordering these, after reading the negative reviews. But they turned out to be exactly the same bottles that came with my Medela accessory kit from the hospital when my first child was born two years ago. The Medela brand is embossed both on the bottle and on the cap. I am fairly comfortable to say that these are authentic Medela products.Pros:- They fit my Medela pump perfectly.- They don't leak, though you do have to make sure to tighten the cap all the way.- Light weight. A plus especially if you need to pump hands-free.- Size is great for feeding. You can fit about 6 oz if you fill to the top. These will last me for a good 4-5 months before I have to go up to a larger size.ConsThe volume marks are in increments of 1 oz and 50 ml. I wish the ml side were in smaller increments, since I like to keep track of my milk output in ml.A few side notes:- Personally, I did not find the lack of printed lettering to be a major annoyance, since I am used to glass bottles which have the same kind of raised lettering.- These arrived in a padded envelope, and were not individually wrapped or packaged, but the bottles looked new to me.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase.
