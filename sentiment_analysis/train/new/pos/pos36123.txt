I searched long and hard for a really good mobile for my 5 month old son. This is PERFECT. I love it. I was a little skeptical because it had some negative reviews, but I'm so glad I went with it anyways.The first mobile we bought our son was one of those wind ups that only plays for about a minute, then you have to wind it up again. It was ridiculous. And then our cats broke it because it wasn't very sturdy. It also didn't fit on our crib, because we have a convertible crib.This mobile is AWESOME. It fits our convertible crib (you can adjust it so it'll fit pretty much any style crib). It plays music for quite a while, and it has two different volume levels to chose from. We love the remote it comes with. Our son cannot go to sleep without his mobile playing. It's very sturdy, and very nice. After your baby is too big for the mobile, you can take that part out and leave the base attached to your crib, and it'll still play the music. It's great. And for the price?! Perfect.I really highly recommend this mobile. It does run on batteries, so keep that in mind. We run his mobile quite a bit and the batteries haven't needed to be replaced yet. Even if they did, it's so worth it. What a great buy.
