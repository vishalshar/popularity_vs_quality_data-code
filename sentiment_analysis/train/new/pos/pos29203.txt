Pros: Quality, priceCons: NoneI bought the Joy Baby Dinosaur Costume for my son to wear for his newborn photoshoot. In the past year, I have seen quite a few of these Crochet/ knitted costumes on Etsy, but was unwilling to spend a lot of money on an outfit my son would literally wear for 15 minutes.Obviously, this is pretty easy to put on, which was my personal focus when choosing what to buy for a newborn photoshoot. Its basically a long hood with a tail. When it came in, I did wash and dry the garment on delicate, without any issues. The quality of the knitting, nor the yarn itself, was not compromised in the wash.
