I love that this safety strap isn't extra. I mean, isn't it enough that we get looks for putting our kids in one in the first place. I like that the more my kid tries to run, it makes it tighter, so he won't continue. I purchased because he ran out of the store and almost got hit by a car...thinking that me running after him was a game. I figure from now on, if a cart isn't warranted on our excursions, or he just wants to get out of the stroller, this will help me not have a heart attack. Until he's a bit older at least.
