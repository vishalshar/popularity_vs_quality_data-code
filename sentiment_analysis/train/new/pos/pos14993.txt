Exactly what I was looking for. Blanket is soft and stretchy which makes it great for swaddling. The color and pattern is beautiful. I'm glad I purchased two of them so if one is in the wash, I still have another for baby. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is smaller than I expected but still a great product.
