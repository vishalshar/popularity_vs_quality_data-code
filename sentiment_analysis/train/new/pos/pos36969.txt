So these are great little cups but I may have been confused. They say they are spill proof which I've learned is not leak proof! I thought this would be great for my 15 month old who always shakes her cups, drops her cups and so on. It's hard to find ones that don't send milk or juice out the spout all over. That's exactly what happened with this one. She turned the cup over and all the milk came dripping out at a rapid pace. So these cups aren't for us at the moment, maybe when she is older and knows not to tip the cup upside down. Very cute and love the design and colors though!
