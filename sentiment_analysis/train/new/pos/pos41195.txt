This bathmat just couldn't get much cuter! It has nice sticky feet to keep the mat slip free and fits perfectly in our standard size tub (see pictures attached). I actually had this product on my baby registry and about a year later I just couldn't stand to not have it around! Now that our little one is standing up and really wiggling around, it helps to have this in the tub to help her not slip and smack her face open. We want her to enjoy her bath without having to over correct her so this item helps with that so much! The top of the mat has some little elevated squares that were a little uncomfortable at first on my husbands sensitive feet, but he doesn't even notice them now. It seems the suction cups underneath keep the mat elevated just enough for hair and pieces of debris to be able to wash through and not become stuck under this. We lift it up every once in a while to let it dry and help prevent any mold issues that would be natural to occur. Feels thick and of good quality. I would definitely purchase this item again, but I don't think I will need to anytime soon as this product feels like it will hold up!
