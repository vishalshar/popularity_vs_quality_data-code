I like buying my niece the most annoying gifts I can find to annoy my brother.  Anything that is loud, requires assembly, or will make a mess. These are my criteria.  I googled most annoying Christmas presents and this wonderful toy came up on the list.  The other reviews I read said this was the devils toy.  Horribly annoying.  Well that sold me I bought a dozen.  Gave them to all the kids in my family cousins, nieces, second cousins, her nephews.  Holy cow was Christmas Eve and Day a trip.  I mean there were flying monkeys everywhere screeching, smacking into people.  O how I laughed and still am as I write this.  The kids loved em and I'm amazed at how durable they are, how far they fly, and how much noise they make.  This thing screeches.  It is simply the most awesome thing.  The bigger kids(myself included) enjoyed them just as much as the rest.  After testing the annoying value on my family, I sent my brother 2, then 2 flying chickens, then a flying cow, and I think a frog.  My cousins husband who is around my age went downstairs for Xmas day to see what the kids were playing with from santa, but wait no he's got the flying monkey and smacks him you know where.  I simply laughed even more.  Overall, I think this gift rocks and everyone should have them.  The kids will play with them til they break I can guarantee that.  Kudos to the maker of this item!!!  Hope this helps in your shopping for your friends and relatives kids.  hahahhahaha
