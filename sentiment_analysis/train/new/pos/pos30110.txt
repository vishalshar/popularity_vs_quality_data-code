This booster is a good booster, narrower for my twins who are smaller than many four-year olds so they don't slide around in the seat too much.  The boosters also fit in both my vehicles perfectly (vw jetta and bmw sedan) with a carseat in the middle for my two year old.My complaints for this booster are:  in its description the width of the booster is only for the seat part, not the high back part which is wider than the seat by 3/4 of an inch(for those of us with 3 seats in the back that can mean the difference between safety and overlapping carseats), and when put together the high back section does not lock into place more securely.  I have looked at other boosters that offer the seat and high back to be separated but only after pressing a button to release the locking mechanism.  While carrying the booster from the car the seat part will flip down out of place if I don't support the seat and the back.  This is annoying.My twins do like the seats; being able to buckle and unbuckle themselves. I have not used the cupholders for the boosters, so no comment there.  The head rests help to keep their heads up while asleep in the seats.I would not allow my experience with the locking system of this booster to dissuade anyone from purchasing it.  It is still a very good booster for people with smaller kids, and/or a need for more space in the backseat for other carseats.
