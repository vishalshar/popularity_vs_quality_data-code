These work great for us. Read some of the reviews about them not sticking and easily able to be pulled off. That happened to us too when we first started using them. There are adhesive rectangles on both sides in the back, which confused me. Then one day I stuck both to his shirt rather than one side to the other and voila! it stayed on until I pulled it off at the end of the meal. They should really put that on the packaging.
