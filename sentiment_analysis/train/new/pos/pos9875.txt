We previously had a Motorola MBP36, I loved it but the monitor won't keep a charge. I thought we could use our old camera with this system, giving us 3 cameras. You can't. It will not pair with the other camera. The outside camera is nice but I do wish it had sound. It does seem to lag a bit more than our old system, but for the price I'm not complaining. The night vision is decent. The screen is good sized.  Fairly easy to operate, pretty self explanatory symbols. You can have up to 4 cameras paired. Love the feature that lets you talk to your kids/spouse. We have never had a need to use the music but it's not all that soothing. (very electronic sounding) I can zoom in enough to see my child breathing. I think it's a great product to help give new parents peace of mind (& check up on ornery toddlers).
