The Samsung SEW-3036W BabyVIEW baby monitor has easy connectivity, intuitive control, and does the job you want it do, but some of it's execution is a little dated.Pros:' Easy to setup (this cannot be stressed enough - plug it in and your are good to go)' Night vision is decent and allows you to see the larger motions that your baby makes' Expandable for additional cameras (sold separately, but the monitor can interface with 3 additional cameras, so 4 total)' Nice range even through multiple walls' The monitor is rechargeable and maintains a good charge throughout the day.Cons:' The speaker on the camera is atrocious (your voice will sound like the soothing sounds from the depths of hell - babies hate it)' Contrary to their statement that it doesn't interfere with wireless signals it does.  I don't know how much of an issue this is for others, but it seemed to throw a garage signal that affected my other wireless devices.  It was solved by turning off the camera when we didn't need it.' The camera is functional, but for 2016 I thought that the video quality was honestly mediocre.  Being half the cost of the other current monitors I accepted this though.Product Link:Samsung SEW-3036W BabyVIEW Baby Monitoring System IR Night Vision Zoom 3.5 inch
