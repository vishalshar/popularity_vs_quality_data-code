I had the monkey backpack for my son and after loving it, I chose this one for my daughter even though she isn't old enough to need it yet. It is incredibly soft and really cute! After reading the first review, I "tested" it out around the house with my son (he was willing to participate lol). I can't comment on long term use, but it held up with him finding it hilarious to try and "run away" with me still holding the strap which made it tug on the strap and him go backwards. You have to have some fun sometimes!! :) Nothing broke and he's 5 so I'm hoping it means that the first reviewer just got a dud. I'm giving it 4 stars and will update it if necessary whenever I use it for it's actual intended purpose.Edit 12/28/12:This has held up well! My daughter is 2.5 and hates the stroller. Living in FL and having passes to SeaWorld, we go often, which means this gets used often. I upped my rating from 4 stars, to 5 stars. I have absolutely no complaints. Also, my daughter who HATES being confined has no problems when we use this (probably because she knows that the alternative is the stroller).Edit 06/22/14:This puppy is still going strong! It has survived trips to SeaWorld, Disney, and around our local zoo. It is definitely deserving of a 5 star rating!
