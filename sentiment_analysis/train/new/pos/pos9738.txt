Love this but used it maybe once.  I quickly got over my fear of nursing in public or caring to cover up.  Nursing is a natural, beautiful thing and shouldn't be covered.  But for those that are a bit concerned, this will do the trick.  Super cute print and very lightweight material that folds up into a tiny little bundle to throw in a diaper bag.
