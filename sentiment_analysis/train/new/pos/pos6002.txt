Love this bumper set. I was going back and forth on getting traditional bumpers and "mesh" ones. Honestly mesh bumpers won't do a damn thing. The purpose of bumpers is to protect and cushion. Our son has never had any issues with sleeping with stuffed animals, toys or blankets in his crib. These are adorable, well made and serve their purpose well.
