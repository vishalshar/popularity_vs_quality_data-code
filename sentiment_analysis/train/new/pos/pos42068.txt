This looks even better than the picture shows! We got this for our living room so my two year old would have somewhere to hide all of toys and provide some additional seating. It is perfect! We installed a chalkboard behind it and he loves to sit and draw plus his much older teen brother enjoys sitting and drawing with him. The leather is super soft and he likes laying on it with his blanket!Just to update a year later and we are still using this every day! We have moved things around some and now use it as a coffee table. Our 3year old fills the bins with books and toys and LOVES it. Still looks great and is worth the money.
