They do exactly what they are intended to do. Put my kids to sleep!What more can a tired mom of multiples ask for?They have held up better than the clear silicone pacifiers. I am not sure if the natural rubber is stronger, but my toddlers weren't ready to give up the pacifiers just yet and kept chewing through other popular brands. These have surpassed and outlasted the other brand I was using, which is probably a way more popular brand in the "mommy world."The only thing I wish is that I had found these sooner. My kids went through so many ripped and torn pacifiers from teething and chewing on them. Now they are old enough (3 years old) to know they aren't allowed to chew on them. When they were little we spent an excessive amount of money replacing another brand of pacifiers. It actually got to the point that I considered forcing through the transition just so I could stop replacing torn ones.This brand has withstood everything and I plan to use these pacifiers with any future children for that reason alone!I also like that this is one of the few brands who carries pacifiers for children beyond toddlers. One of my toddlers seeks out oral stimulation often and getting him to give them up completely will be no easy feat. It's nice to have found a product that will make items for older children, as well. Not all kids give up their pacifiers at the same time and the US is the only country that seems to really pressure parents to force that decision and take away comfort from their children when they may need it.Thanks to NUK for a great product.
