I am very happy with this piggy bank.  I was looking for traditional style, like the one I had as a little girl & this is it but bigger.  It's large, similar to the size of a standard soccer ball, made of smooth ceramic & has a nice gloss.  My package arrived in perfect condition with no chips on the paint.  The color is very pretty, it has a white plug to take money out from the bottom.  A detail I really like is that the feet are padded (white) so that it doesn't skid or scratch furniture.
