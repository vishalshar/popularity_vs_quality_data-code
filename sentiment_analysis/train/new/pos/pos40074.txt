I bought Binki Bear when my son was around seven months old, because he constantly lost his pacifiers under his crib in the middle of the night and we wanted him to be able to better soothe himself. This solved all those problems; the paci stopped disappearing and he could easily reach for his bear and calm himself down when needed. It completely eliminated walking back to his room just to give his paci back in the middle of the night.Binki gets five stars from me because my son just turned two, and he still LOVES this bear. We phased out the paci a little after his first year, and I actually think Binki helped that process. I took the paci off and gave him the bear, and while he was confused at first, he still seemed content to just have his bear. He barely put up a fight for his paci and I think still having something "related" to it helped.So far we have had to put a few stitches in the top of Binki's thigh, and he now has a small hole in the side of his neck that needs fixing as well, but he has gotten heavy wear and has honestly held up better than I expected. He's been washed several times and came out just the same. My son still sleeps with him every night, and asks to bring him in the car or into stores on occasion. He is truly soothed just by having his bear and genuinely loves him. Binki is even serving a slightly different purpose now, as my son teethes on his ears and nose occasionally and he's still holding up great.I'm due in two months with our second son, and will absolutely be buying another Binki when the baby outgrows his wubanub, although maybe in a different color so the boys don't get confused! I couldn't be happier with this purchase and recommend Binki to anyone who will listen.
