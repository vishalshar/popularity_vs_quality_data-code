Exclusive pumper- meaning I only pump. She does not feed from the breast at all.Had my little girl in March. She came 3 weeks early and didnt take to breastfeeding well because she was so small. I rented the medela symphony for the first two months and loved it!Finally after doing some research purchased this pump. Im never looking back! I have used it for 3 weeks now and LOVE IT! I personally think it works better than the medela symphony! It takes me FAR LESS TIME to pump! I love that i can use all of my parts from the medela on this pump! I purchased the one with the internal battery! Best move I ever made! It has proved worthy! Holds charge well! I havent had it die yet!  So many times I have caught myself without an outlet nearby. I also purchased the car charger and it works like a charm!I love that you can change the speed and the suction power. This is great!My only downersThe sound- it isnt Horrible but it is louder than the medela symphony that i had been using! It doesnt wake the baby though, so all is good! flange sizes. I use the XXL from medela and Hygeia has nothing even close. This would cause me to return had the pump not been compatible with medela parts. :/
