My husband and I purchased this matress inside the babies-r-us store and it worked out really great. My crib size was standard with exact measurements listed on the crib, so all I had to do was write them and select a matress that met the requirements. I pushed on the matress it felt soft/firm (normal) but no so hard to perhaps hurt your child's back. He hasn't slept on it yet but considering that babies sleep under water without any matresses in the womb, I figure he'll be fine after all at least the bed won't be moving all the time like most pregnant women. The price is great, looks good, and wipes clean after having poured over it, I tested it myself.
