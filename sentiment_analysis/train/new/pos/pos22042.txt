i was skeptical with this purchase before I delivered despite reading all of the reviews.While in the hospital my daughter had latch issues and my nipples suffered GREATLYthe lactation consultant brought me a set of these and I couldn't believe the instant relief I felt as soon as they were on.each set lasts about 5 days ... and after my husband saw how much better I was doing with the original pair, he ordered me two more while were in the hospital and they were waiting for us when we got home from the hospital.i would say, definitely worth the $$$
