My daughter has a large Graco swing that can be portable but doesn't fold down easy. I bought this to keep in my trunk for when we travel to friends and families houses. It folds down very easily which makes getting it in and out a breeze. My daughter loves this and actually falls asleep within minutes of being in it. The only thing I don't like about it is that, although it has a timer, it shuts off automatically after 1 hour. At first I thought the batteries died and I was actually mad because I thought this thing would blow through batteries but then I realized that it automatically shuts off. Overall, I like this swing and it was very easy to assemble.
