First of all, for the price, I was pleasantly surprised. It is very similar to the Booginhead ones, but not quite as expensive. I have both  types and I'd still say I prefer the Booginhead, but for the money, this is right there next to it.Pros: Price, color & pattern variety, and usefulness. The colorful strap is fabric, with cute patterns. I think this pattern is pretty gender neutral, as I bought it for my son. The clip holds on securely, unlike other brands I've purchased in the past, where my son pulls the pacifier off himself (like JJCole, which are cute, but don't stay on). I'd say it isn't quite as strong as the Booginhead, but pretty close and way stronger than J.J. Cole. This sort of pacifier clip (with the loop) is the only kind that I have found that fits Gumdrop & Soothie pacifiers (which are all I've used).Cons: The little loop that needs to be threaded through the hole in the Gumdrop and Soothie pacifiers could be a little more rigid. I do have difficulty every now and then getting it into the holes. But that's just really if I'm in a hurry. The Booginhead loop is a little more rigid of a material - both for the loop and the strap itself.All-in-all, I'd definitely buy them again, especially when I wanted several colors to match different outfits and to keep some at my Mom's house and mine.
