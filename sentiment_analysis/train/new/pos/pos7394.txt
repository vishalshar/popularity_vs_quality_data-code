If your child loves SpongeBob as much as my son, I suggest you order this! We were in need of a shade for our vehicles, the sun would come right in his eyes -- He is obsessed with SpongeBob; the price was right, so I ordered it. Absolutely love it. Everytime I put my son in the car, he just looks at it and laughs. He loves it. I did have a few problems in the beginning getting it to stick to the window, but now it is on there good and not going anywhere. I love the feature at the bottom.. it tells you if your car is too hot for your child. The little circle is always yellow, and if it turns red and says "hot" it's basiclly advising you to open the windows right away. Obviously it is not needed, common knowledge is not to leave your child in a hot vehicle, but still nice to have if you needed to. It fits my 4 door VW Jetta just fine, also our Yukon. I would recommend this shade if you are in need of one!
