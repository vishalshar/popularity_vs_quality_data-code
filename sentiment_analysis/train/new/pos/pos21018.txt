This hamper makes doing the laundry a snap.  I just take the inner mesh liner full of dirty clothes down to the laundry room with me when it's full.  The mesh liner makes a great "basket" to cary the clean clothes back upstairs in as well.  The hamper is small enough to not be too noticable in the corner, but large enough to hold a load of dirty baby clothes.  It's a vital piece in my nursery!
