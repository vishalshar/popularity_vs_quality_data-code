I am a certified passenger safety seat technician as well as a police officer who works in the field of traffic enforcement/safety. There a couple of things I want you to know when/if you purchase this new product so that you can have a far easier time installing it- and so you can install it correctly.First, the instruction booklet is permanantly attached to the seat w/ a cord. Simply tuck it behind the cover to stow it. Britax has the manual available online in a PDF if you would like to sit and review it without having to crouch down and read the book attached to your seat.Second, when you go to tighten the LATCH straps at each lower anchor, the seat is designed for you to pull these tight through the spaces in the seat shell itself (simply move the cover to the side and you will see where the back of the seat shell has a hole on each side so you can EASILY pull the LATCH webbing tight on each side). If you try to tighten these LATCH straps outside and behind the shell of the seat- YOU WILL NEVER GET IT TIGHT AND THEREFORE IT WILL NOT BE OPTIMALLY INSTALLED.Please contact your local hospital, poice department, fire department, or Safe Kids Coalition ([...]) for a referral to a free child passenger seat fitting station in your community if you have concerns or questions. Even if you don't have questions, it is a good idea to take your car, seat, and kiddo to one of these fitting stations to make sure you have a good installation AND good use/fit for your kids.Finally, this seat is remarkable becuase the 5-point harnes straps are rated to a child of 80 pounds AND it converts to a booster seat for kids heavier or who otherwise won't fit in the harness. The seat is rated for 9 years (the longest manufacturer rating I have seen). And, unlike other Britax products, it is more narrow and therefore can fit in more applications than other Britax products (known for being BIG).My kids had their first run in the seats today (I installed them last night) and we have thumbs up from both on the comfort and the fashion while I give it a thumbs up for safety/design and installation!!
