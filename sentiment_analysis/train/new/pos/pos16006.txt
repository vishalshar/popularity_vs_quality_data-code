I have been using these continuously for over 5 years, and they make a great everyday straw cup that you don't have to worry about losing and having to replace. (For those concerned, these are coded #5 for recycling, and many municipalities don't recycle #5 plastics. Luckily, ours does.)We found that the other Take & Toss style, with the vented spout,The First Years 5 Pack Take And Toss Spill Proof Cups, 10 Ounce had two problems: (1) It leaked when tipped over (enough to cause carpet stains) and (2) Our daughter got frustrated by how long it took to drink an appreciable amount through those tiny vent holes. They really were the worst of both worlds!The straw-cup style is great, though. I use them myself. My daughter, now 6, still likes them. Most of them have survived years of top-rack dishwashings. The cap snaps on tightly and the straw forms a pretty snug seal with the hole in the cap. The straws are as tough as the cups, but if they do get chewed or mangled, ordinary soda straws work fine in these cups. And-- hurrah! huzzah!-- there are only 3 straightforward parts to the cup: cap, straw, and cup. No fussy little valves to clean.The straw cups come in a 7-ounce or 10-ounce size, and I'd suggest skipping the 7-ounce. The 10-ounce is light enough for a baby to hold, while still containing enough thirst-quenching liquid for older kids.However, I took off one star because these are not good cups for toddlers under 2. Both our kids tended to remove the straw and dump the cup's contents all over the place, until they got old enough that this trick was no longer interesting. They also didn't quite "get" the concept that the straw has to stay fully inserted or it won't work. So, we stuck with Playtex twist-lock straw cups until they were 2.
