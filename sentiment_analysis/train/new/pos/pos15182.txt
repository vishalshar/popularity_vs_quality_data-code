I ordered the Evenflo AMP LX No Back Car Seat in Blue Splat for my 58 pound son because we needed a booster seat on vacation and didn't want to drag our Evenflo boosters with a back through the airport. These are on the IIHS's Best Bet list, which means they are the highest rated boosters. (I always check that list before buying child seats.) These seats are comfy enough for my child and are light enough to be easily transported through airports where we will gate check the booster seat.
