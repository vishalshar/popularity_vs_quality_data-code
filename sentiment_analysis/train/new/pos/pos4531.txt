i was first fascinated by "hooded towels" after receiving one as a gift so i decided to order these.i am happy i did!these are bigger than the one i got as the gift but it is also the reason i love it more! once i put the hood over my son's head the other end touches the ground so it allows for a cozy wrap. he also enjoys playing peek-a-boo under the hood.i am also happy with the absorbency: does a great job without getting overly soaked tru and dries fast enough in time for the next bath.(my son is now 35inches/21 mths)i would definitely recommend these if anyone asked :)
