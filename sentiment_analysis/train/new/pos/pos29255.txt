I love this blanket! So cozy! My baby pulls it to his face and falls asleep! I keep the small monkey blanket in my baby bag so i can give it to him in the go. I love it so much, that I ordered a second one. I also bought the pink one for one sister and the blue one for another sister and they both love it. It washes really well too.
