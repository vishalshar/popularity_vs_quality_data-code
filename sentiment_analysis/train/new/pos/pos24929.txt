Okay for those of you that don't want to wait for the juicy stuff...what the con of this is putting the parts together and washing each piece and tube and easy to lose tubes.Whoo...now that the cons are done the plus side is....get ready drum roll....feeding multiples at the same time with these bottles is simply amazing.  I love these bottles. Like love, love.  Our twins would want to eat at the same time and I never got the tandem feeding thing down so I would try to bottle feed them and it was almost impossible with new borns.  I changed the actual nipple to a slower flow nipple and our babies took to it easily.They can eat in the car, on a bus, in a plane even a train.  They can eat where ever they want,  If you are a parent of multiples I highly recommend this product.  Its worth the time it takes washing and putting it together.
