Our children loved this toy. It apparently tastes great! And provides lots of entertainment. It can be used by adults in "puppet" shows. It makes noise thanks to it's "hands" with rattled about. Definately recommend this for babies looking to mouth something :) It was so good, we've since bought many more of them (or their similar versions - there's mouse, and other characters) for our friends' and familys' babies.
