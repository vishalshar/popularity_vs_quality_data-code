I purchased this item to keep my furry boys (dogs) from my kitchen.  I have a Lab and Border Collie so I purchased the tall gate.  The gate works very well.  I like the automatic closure - I wish these would have been around when I had small children.  The only catch.....my Border Collie found a new way to the kitchen - he jumps on my dining room table and fits through a very small serving window.  Now he is able to get to everything - inlcuding items that are on the refrigerator.  I moved the gate so it blocks my entry way.  This way, I am the only one to greet our visitors.  The boys have full access to the kitchen again.  I will be purchasing my daughter one of these gates to keep my grandaughter safe from stairs.  I HIGHLY recommend this gate.  Many of our visitors have complimented the gate and a couple have purchased the gate.  Your money will be very well spent.  "Make sure the tension is right or the gate will not automatically closse."  Also, the gate needs to be opened all the way for the automatic springs to work.  If not, it will not "catch" when it closes. Just a couple of tricks I learned.
