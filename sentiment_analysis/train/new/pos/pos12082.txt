I have used hook and loop BumGenius and Flip diapers on my son since he was born.  As my son has become more mobile and dexterous, he began taking his diapers off- I was wishing I had just ordered diapers with snaps, but the velcro seemed more "daddy-friendly" for my husband who was reluctant to use cloth diapers.  The pocket 4.0's and Freetimes also began to leak as my son became a heavier wetter. I decided to try out a Best Bottom cover and insert, and I love them.  I love that the inserts snap in, and the fit is perfect for my average weight, 70th percentile height 13 month old.  These inserts are absorbent, and when combined with this doubler insert, which snap together in a stack, have never left my son soaked or leaking even after going 12 hours overnight.  I have been working on replacing my entire stash with Best Bottom covers and inserts.  The patterns and colors are a bonus too, as they are very cute.
