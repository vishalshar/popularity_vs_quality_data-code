I found a simple high chair at the thrift store for about $7, but wanted to secure my 1 year old in it, so I bought this belt. It was well worth the few dollars. I can take the tray off and not have to worry about her slipping out, but it also doesn't cut into her. She doesn't mind it either. I haven't figured out how the other parent was able to twist the straps into a 3 point, but there is plenty of extra strap to do so if you tried. I really would recommend this, and I may get another in the future because I cannot tell you how annoying it is to go through 5 shopping carts and every strap is busted!
