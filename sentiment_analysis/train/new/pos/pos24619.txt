We bought these blankets to match the room decor we chose for our son.They were especially perfect during the summer months as they are not heavy, rather cool and perfect to drape over a baby as they sleep in your arms or in their carrier/carriage.I've also used it on the floor just to have my son play on.  These blankets wash beautifully and washed often they are!It's a very cute design and a great buy just to have as a spare.
