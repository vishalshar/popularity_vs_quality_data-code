These were perfect for my one-year-old daughter.  The slippers were all leather, with a cute giraffe design, as she loves giraffes, and the leather soles are soft and provides non-slippage supports for her as we have tile and wood floors.  The leather slipper is shaped like a small ankle boot and easily slips into her feet.  No elastic lining around the ankle to cause pinching, which was wonderful.  My daughter wears these most of the day and has no complaints. Bought two more pairs, blue with dinosaurs and a pink with monkeys.
