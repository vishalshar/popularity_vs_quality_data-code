At first the Farm Roller scared the heck out of my grandchild, but she got over it very quickly once she realized the friendly sounding "thing" rolling towards her was soft and did not hurt. In fact, once I sat her up on her riding horse, she was able to kick it hard and it always came back which was a delightful treat! She giggled and wanted to do it over and over again. Then she was ready to get on all fours and hit it with her hand. It's a wonderful toy to promote crawling and overall delight in a child. I intend to buy more as gifts for my friends who are soon-to-be grandmothers. I like that it can be deflated to store when baby outgrows it. But, by the looks of it, our baby will be playing with it long after she's walking. I highly recommend the Farm Roller by Infantino.
