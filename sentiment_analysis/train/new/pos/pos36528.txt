I originally had the Fisher Price lights mirror, but the music and lights only lasted around 10 minutes and the remote only worked sporadically.  That's when I decided to purchase this one.  We LOVE it!The timer can be set for up to 60 minutes, which is perfect for the trips I use it for.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it isn't designed to act as a mirror for the driver.  It doesn't have any way to slant it so that you can see baby from the front.  My husband was still able to rig it to work  =)  but it would be better if it had the verticle adjustment like other similiar mirrors.
