My little one loves these. So do I. They fit her toddler bed, which is converted from a crib. It was hard to find a complete sheet set to fit a crib mattress, which is strange because many, many families have the crib-that-becomes-a-toddler-bed set-up, like we do. The top sheet is fitted at one end, which is brilliant! Although the top sheet should not be used in cribs, if your toddler's bed is converted from a crib, and uses a crib-sized mattress, these sheets are perfect.We do not find them scratchy. They are really soft and smooth after washing.The colors are red and ecru (not bright white), giving the linens a nice vintage look.
