Love this set! This is a good deal, comes with 4 bottles, microwave sterilizer, bottle brush and 2 pacifiers. Makes things very easy to sterilize, which is great when you have to spend all your time tending to your newborn. It only takes 4 minutes microwaving, and 2 minutes of cool down time. Do not open it before the cool down period is over, I was rushing and steam burned my hand pretty bad, lesson learned!My exclusively breastfed baby took to these bottles naturally, no problems with nipple confusion for her. Just make sure the nipple is pulled all the way through the white ring, and screwed on the bottle correctly. I have lost pumped milk by not checking if it is screwed on right, I blame it on sleep deprivation!
