My brother went to Russia and brought me back a set of nesting dolls...pretty special to me. My 3 and 6 year old really like playing with them, but it makes me nervous something will happen (break or lose). I wanted something similar they could play with that I would be more relaxed about. My brother ordered these for them and they love them. I wish their were more pieces to the seat, but that is my only complaint. Bright colors, cute animals...love everything else about them.
