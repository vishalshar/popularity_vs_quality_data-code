Before we became really health conscious, we had went through several different plastic bottles and they all worked fine, but the writing would quickly ware off so you couldn't see how many ozs you were putting in them. Also all of the ones I had used, weren't big enough to hold all of the milk that I was pumping.When we began to really research what was in plastic bottles, such as BPS which can be worse than BPA, we decided to look into glass or stainless bottles. I researched several different brands and decided on these big ones. They would be big enough to hold all of my milk and with the silicone covering, I wasn't worried about them falling and breaking. I have been very happy with these. We have been using them for several months and they have been through several washes and been dropped many times and they have held up extremely well. We did end up buying more of them and are glad we did. My babe has loves holding these and they are just big enough but not too big for her to be able to help hold the bottle. I love knowing that she isn't ingesting any toxins along with her milk. I would def recommend these to any pumping or formula feeding mom who has concerns about plastic and wants a quality product that they will only have to buy once because it holds up. These are worth the money!!
