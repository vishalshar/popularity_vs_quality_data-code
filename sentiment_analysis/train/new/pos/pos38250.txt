I love this baby monitor! I didn't buy a video monitor at first, because I wanted to save money, so we just bought an audio monitor. But after some careful consideration, I convinced myself to spend the money and get a video monitor. I did a lot of research, online and through people I knew. And this is the one I decided on. Some of the negative reviews about this brand had me nervous, but I'm so glad I went with it! I haven't had any issues! It works well, it has good range (I can be in my basement and still see/hear baby upstairs), I love the ability to talk to baby in his room, I love that I can move the camera up and down and side to side, I love that I can turn the sound all the way off but still see if there is noise coming from the room, I love that I can see the temperature in his room. I seriously love this thing and would recommend it to anyone! The only thing that I would maybe change is the dimming option on the screen. You can alter the brightness, but it's just very, very slight. When I turn the brightness all the way down, it's still too bright to have on while I'm sleeping, so I just turn the screen off. Other than, GREAT camera!!
