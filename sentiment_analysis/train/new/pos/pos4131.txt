I really like my Nuby potty seat on my elongated toilet, however it doesn't fit my round toilet. I've gone through a LOT of different potty seats on the round toilet, which is in the bathroom my daughter uses the most. Most of them did the job fine, up until she started potty training in earnest and holding her pee longer. Then overspray started becoming a real problem. I'm not a fan of pee shooting across the room and hitting the wall. Yuck.So I got this because it has a pee guard on it. Pee guards are NOT JUST FOR BOYS. Little girls pee forward too, if there's any real force behind it. And maybe my daughter is just gross, but she's fascinated with her pee and doesn't seem to have any incentive to lean forward to make it all go into the toilet.This potty seat does a pretty good job catching most of the overspray. Due to the shape, if she oversprays a little bit it generally drips back into the toilet instead of all over the toilet seat.It seems comfortable for my daughter, it's very stable, doesn't pose a big finger-pinching risk, and has handles which she really likes. I also like that it's one piece; the other seats I've used have to be taken apart for cleaning (pee gets between the cushion an the plastic base).I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because: (a) it isn't quite as overspray-proof as my Nuby, and (b) the ridges in the splash guard are kind of hard to clean. I had a tough time getting poop out of it (don't ask).I have not tried it on the elongated toilet.
