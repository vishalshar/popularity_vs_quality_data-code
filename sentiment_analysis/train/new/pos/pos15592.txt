This adapter was perfect for our stairs.  This is exactly what we needed.  We looked at multiple gate styles.  Most required that you drill holes or install eyelets into the wall or stairway posts to make a solid connection.  I really didn't want to drill any holes into any permanent fixtures as we want to take the gate down when our children are okay with stairs.  There are some adapters we had to get to use this at the top of our stairs as it's a littlewider than the gate and we didn't want to drill holes into the wall or railing.This part of the gate is easy to set up and put in place...it gets left for a year or two, then it comes down...then we put it up again with the next kid for a year or so...However, it feels pretty solid and works well.  We have not had any problem with any of our children going down the stairs when playing near the gate.  We currently have it up again for our current baby.The latch is easy enough to use, yet difficult enough for our other children that we can keep them from going downstairs when we don't want them to.  We like that you can lock the gate in an open position.  The downside of this is that it's kinda weak - a slight bump or imbalance in the installation and the gate won't stay open.Definitely get the pressure gate wall savers to protect your wall.  It makes the surface area a little larger, so it is a lot less likely to slip.  It really will save your wall; a smaller surface area pressed into your wall is more likely to make a dent in the drywall.
