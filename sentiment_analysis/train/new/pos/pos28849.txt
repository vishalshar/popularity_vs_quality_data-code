The first time the product arrived I had 4 broken pieces and was extremely disappointed. I called South Shore and they offered to replace the broken piece no questions asked. I didn't even have to return the broken pieces. 10 days later the new package arrived and 2 of the 4 replacement pieces were still broken. Extremely frustrated and this preggo momma in tears at this point, I called South Shore; again they offered to replace the damaged parts with no questions asked and I asked them to beef up their packaging this time (which they did) and asked if they could expedite the order since it's now been over 3 weeks since I received the product. They said they would do the best they could but wouldn't put that in writing. I still think it took longer than 7 days to receive but just under 10. 3rd time was the charm as they arrived undamaged and we could finally finish putting the dresser together. I do applaud South Shore for being professional and correcting the problem but am disappointed it to so long to get all the parts undamaged. The dresser looks good after it's been put together and seams pretty sturdy. I have come to terms with the fact that no matter if you spend $260 or $500 for a dresser they are all going to be made of the pressed board material and have a cardboard backing. Unforunately, things just aren't made as good as they used to be but I think this dresser will hold up and do the job I intended it for.
