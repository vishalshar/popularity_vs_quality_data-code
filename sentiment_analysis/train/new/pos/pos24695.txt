This product is easy to clean and doesn't retain odors.  That said, don't put it in the bottom of the sink! They do break! One of mine ended up having dishes stacked on top and there is now a "fracture" in the pocket.  It is still usable but a bummer.  The plastic is a bit too rigid.  Otherwise it is a great product and I may buy more when our daughter begins solids!Update:Both of ours are cracked and unusable.  I have duct taped the crack to keep the pocket on and prevent liquids from pouring through.  The back clasp thing has broken on one so it is now unusable.  Waste of money!  It won't let me change my star rating to 1.
