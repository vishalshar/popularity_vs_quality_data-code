I have bought my grand baby several teething rings, but this one is her favorite by far. My grand baby has been struggling with teething since she was 4 months old and she is now 6 months old. She hurts my heart, because you can tell she is struggling.One day I looked up teething rings and this Luv N Care/NUBY teething ring was one of the top rated and it was super inexpensive if you purchased it as an Add On Item.The Nuby Icybite teething ring has multiple surfaces for baby. There is the gel portion of the keys. There is the top or base of the keys, and there is the ring. My grand baby chews on the gel key parts the most, followed next by the ring. She absolutely loves the Nuby Icybite, as you can see from the picture!
