This organizer comes complete with a large roomy storage area for bulky items and toys, plenty of small pockets all around the exterior for additional items, and a lid taht doubles as a food tray. Here's a list, with measurements. The pockets are not rigid, so there's some give and take in terms of what you can fit in them.Main Storage Compartment: 9"w x 9"h x 12"dStorage Lid/Tray: 9"w x 1.25"h x 12"dEACH SIDE of the organizer has the following (from rear to front):1 large pocket - 6.5"w x 8"h x 1.75"d (Think decent-sized novel or chapter book.)1 small mesh pocket on outside of large pocket: 6.5"w x 4"h2 small item pockets, one above the other:  top small items pocket: 6.5"w x 3"h x 1"d  bottom small item pocket with sipper across the top : 6.5"w x 4"h x 1"dThe front of the organizer has two cup-holding sections featuring mesh sides and elastic around the top.Base of the cup holder measures 3.25" in diameter and cup holder stands 6"h.***This is the only feature I am not thrilled with. The elastic gets in the way of getting wide beverage container in and out. Here's how I solved it: I used two large, heavy plastic 32 oz. cups (like the ones you get at a conveniences store or gas station) and marked them 5.5" - 6" from the TOP. I then cut the bottom off of the cups with a box cutter and scissors. I then used these as "inserts" in the cup holders, to keep them expanded and rigid. We find this works to give them a little more structure.This box holds a TON of stuff, all neatly organized. Great for kids, but can also serve traveling moms, commuters, sales people, etc.Certainly built well, and to last. It's taken a beating from both my kids and I for nearly a year, and it has certainly held up well!Hope this review is helpful to all you organized folks out there like me!
