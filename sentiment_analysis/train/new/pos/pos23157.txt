This is an amazing product!!!! The toys attached to the activity top are very colorful and of different textures. The Pipe Organ makes noise, and the Ferris Wheel spins as well as the spinner on the Discovery Center which the Discovery Center lights up and makes noise, also attached are the flower and butterfly in a soft rubber material for teething. The Big Top Picture Book is there to just flip the hard plastic books and make noise of a banging sound. The Roller Coaster has 2 toys attached that slide on the bar, but the one I received, the sliding toys are made too small (the holes in them) for them to slide easily. The moonwalk bead popper is alittle too hard for my little one to press.The Mirror is a great fixture to the activity center!!!The Fun Ball center is really GREAT, and the balls can also be put in the wheels and slide down on the bottom of this activity center. This is a great activity center for the price!!! The only thing it doesn't have is a bouncing option on this :(. The seat does spin all the way around this activity center. My Baby is 6 months old and as of now LOVES this product!!!!!
