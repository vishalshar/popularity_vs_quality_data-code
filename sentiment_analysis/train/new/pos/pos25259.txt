One month into pumping and my valve broke! I was devastated as I scoured the amazon web for a replacement. When I came across this set of valves, I decided to just go for it. Not only do these fit my Ameda Purely Yours pump perfectly, it is also extremely durable and made better than the original valves - even better, the set comes with 4! I'd definitely buy this again.
