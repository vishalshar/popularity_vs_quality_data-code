I bought this to use in a newborn photoshoot. While I'm happy with the product, it's too large to use for a newborn - unless the newborn is the size of a one month old. I'll use this for older newborns, but looking for smaller outfits to use in the future. If you'd like to see the product and how I was able to use this (because the photo on here is a little misleading), you can check out this link to the photo: https://www.facebook.com/171507806198688/photos/pb.171507806198688.-2207520000.1407507723./831771710172291/?type=3&theaterIt's well made and it came in faster than expected. Will order from this vendor again.
