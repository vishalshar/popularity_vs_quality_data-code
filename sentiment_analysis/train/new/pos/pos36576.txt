We've just had these bibs a week or two, but have been using them since the second they arrived.  I am very pleased with this purchase!We previously used the bumkins brand bibs which were cute, easy and worked pretty well.  After having to replace those many times with a couple of kids due to mold growing and not being able to remove it, I knew we needed something totally different.These silicone bibs have pretty good coverage on my almost 18 month old, and we use them with a space saver high chair.  I was concerned that the pocket would sit at a height that would be a problem for the tray.  They actually sit on top of the tray and catch nearly everything.  Another concern I had initially was that the skinny wrap around closure would be uncomfortable on my toddler's neck.  This turned out to be a non-issue.  The bibs are so light weight that he hasn't complained at all.  One added bonus is that the closure stays much better than velcro, so he can't rip it off whenever he wants.The little white logo seems like it might not stay on long after a couple runs through the dishwasher, but that does not bother me at all.Super happy with how easy they clean too!
