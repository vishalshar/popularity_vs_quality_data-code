I purchased this gate to fit in a hallway for the purpose of keeping kittens contained. I obviously did not want anything expensive but fairly durable and wider than the average gate. It worked beautifully for the purpose I had intended and actually ended up surpassing my expectations by being the perfect gate after the kittens grew a bit. While they were very little, up to about 8 weeks old, they could not pass the gate. The mesh was perfect since it allowed my other pets to see and smell the kittens standing on the other side but could not reach them. At 9 weeks old when I felt that they were old enough to explore and meet my other pets, but were still unable to leap the height of the gate, the ones who were mature enough learned how to climb up the mesh sides, and with a chair or plant stand of some kind on the far side, make their way over to freedom. They simply climb back over when they want to return to their area. I keep it up because the kittens and mother can come and go, but the dog cannot enter.Now...many reviewers complained about the difficulty of putting it up and down. It took less than 5 minutes to put up but I have never taken it down and moved it so I cannot say how difficult that is. I do have to step over it, often carrying something including kittens, but it is not overly high and this has not been a problem. HOWEVER, if it was in an area where I would be walking all of the time, and I did not mind spending the extra money, a door in the gate which opens and closes would be nice, especially if carrying a human baby is involved.For the purpose I intended it has been a perfect gate and an excellent value. For use with puppies I could see it as being particularly effective since they, as far as I know, cannot climb vertical surfaces. For kittens up to about 8 weeks old it will contain them very well while allowing them to see and smell the outside world. I would recommend it for this purpose.
