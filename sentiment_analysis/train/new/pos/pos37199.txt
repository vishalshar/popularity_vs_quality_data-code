These have been a lifesaver!We live in an apartment with mirrored closet doors in both bedrooms. Of course, my toddler pulls everything out of the two closets in his room. I have to be very careful about what gets put in there (since one is storage and the other is for items he can't play with by himself as well as our board games). These have been a true lifesaver! I put one on each side of the doors and it has been such a fantastic peace of mind! I know he isn't going to pull something over on himself or get into any board games with the small pieces. I still have everything as baby-proof as possible, but he is such a clever stinker. These are just fantastic.-Easy to place-Easy to understand instructions-Durable/Quality materials-Very strong bonding agent-Easy to use unlatching for us adultsREAD THE INSTRUCTIONS. ONCE THE SNAPPING PIECE IS CLOSED, IT IS MEANT TO BE PERMANENT! I DIDN'T KNOW THIS AND I HAD TO PRY IT OPEN WITH A SCREW DRIVER. My fault. I was too excited to see how it worked to read the instructions. It is a bit of a bummer that they can't be reused for future items at a different size but they weren't expensive for the amount of help they give us. So I would buy again.
