We love this gate and have three of them.  It is beautiful.  Super easy to install, no tools required, and very sturdy.  Our son uses it to stand and then tries to shake the door and it hasn't moved.  Did I mention that it is beautiful.  Blends perfectly in our house, and doesn't stick out like we're living in a daycare.  The doors automatically shut and lock.  It would be nice if you could disengage the lock when you don't need it, but we have just solved that by not letting it close all the way when we walk through.  Love this gate!
