We've been using these clippers for our 3 year old son and 16 month old daughter for 3 years now. We tried a number of other child nail clippers (First Aid, Summer Infant, etc), and they did not compare! These are by far the easiest for parents to manipulate and the safest for kids in terms of not accidentally cutting too short or too close to the skin.
