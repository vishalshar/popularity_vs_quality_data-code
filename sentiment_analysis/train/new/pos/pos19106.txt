I was looking for a few straw sippy cups that would not leak and this one is great. My boy can throw it around and leave it on its side and it will not leak. The only time it does leak is if the straw is out and he bangs it on the ground. Otherwise it holds up very well. My only dislike is I could not pick the color, I got a finding nemo cup with a pink lid. Also, it is very easy to clean because it all comes apart and is made with the same silicone-like material that other playtex sippy cups have. Overall I would recommend this cup to others and I am happy with my purchase.
