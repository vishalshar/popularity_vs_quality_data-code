It's great to have when needed, but It only gets 3 stars because it became a game with my daughter to rip it off the table before food could be placed on it. (This started when she was about 7 months?)Pros- On a dirty table it is so much nicer to be able to put on the table and know it is sanitary.On flat surfaces it sticks fairly well.Has fun Elmo designs that she would probably like when she got olderYou can tear it off and throw it on your plate when leaving so that you cut down (a little bit) on the mess.Cons- Although all 4 sides are sticky it can still easily be ripped off.If the table is not flat it doesn't stick very well (More tables than you think are not smooth flat surfaces).I still consider this a must have and will probably buy it for baby number 2 for when it is better than nothing...but more often than not i opt to not use it and just use an antibacterial wipe to clean the table instead.
