We have had our far share of travel in airports and found this to be perfect for protecting our stroller both gate checking and luggage checking, the zipper is strong and it has wheels.  We have a Quest so it  there is tons of extra room so when we went on our cruise we packed our daughters life vest and extra towels around it to save room in our luggage and to protect the stroller a bit more in layovers. The handles are strong and I have even carried it like a backpack with no trouble.Its a bit pricey but good quality.  We sprayed Scotch Guard on ours and redo it every few trips, because we have been caught with our luggage in the cart beside the airplane when the airport shutdown ground crews due to a storm.If your child is like mine who falls asleep laying their face against the side of the stroller... you definitely need something to protect it from all the dirt, grime and who knows what else is in the plane storage area.
