We LOVE this. Our home basically looks like it belongs to the baby and he lets us stay here. I love that we can collapse it at the end of the day and reclaim a few feet of adult space.My fave things about it:-It collapses and opens easily enough to do it one handed if you're holding your baby.-It's super easy to pull apart for washing-You can buy different toys to hang (in packs of 3). We like to rotate the toys out so our baby doesn't get bored.-We can travel easily with it because it folds up and secures with velcroWe learned quickly that if we put the baby down in it at a diagonal so his feet could kick the base of one of the arches he could shake his own toys. Then we'd just helicopter him around each corner when he started to get bored with the view. So by the time our baby was about 5 weeks old he could entertain himself under this for a good 15 minutes at a time. Now, at 12 weeks, he'll hang out playing with the toys for a half hour or longer.  We hang the toys at the high setting when he's laying in it and move them to the low setting (attaching the mirror to the base of one of the arches) to do tummy time. Works like a charm!
