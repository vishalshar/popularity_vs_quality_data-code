This bib is fantastic. I've used other long sleeve versions that are made from that thin plastic material, and while yes, they clean up really easily, they're still really messy while the baby's eating because the food doesn't soak into it, it just sits there, waiting to be rubbed on baby's face, in mommy's hair or on the table/chair. This bib has a terry cloth cover that works like a bib and a napkin, but the backside of the front still has that water resistant plastic layer so things won't go all the way through to baby's clothes. It's brilliant.Getting it of without getting the food all over baby was easy once I figured it out - put a hand under the back panel, reach through the neck opening and flip the bib over baby's head, then take arms out. That way, the messiest part in the front never touches baby's head/hair when you take it off.As for sizing, the 6+ month size fits my 5 1/2 month old well. It's a little loose around the neck and the arms are a good length, and while it covers well even now, it's loose enough that it seems like it will fit for a few more months.
