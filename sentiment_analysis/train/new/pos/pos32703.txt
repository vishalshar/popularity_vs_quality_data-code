We had bought this crib at Buy Buy Baby and when ready to convert into a full size bed we were told by Buy Buy Baby it would take 14 WEEKS to arrive. After a quick search on Amazon I found the rails, ordered them and they came two days later. They were very easy to install and look great with my daughters bed. The instructions that are sent are for multiple cribs, so you have to search for the right crib instructions first, that confused us at first.
