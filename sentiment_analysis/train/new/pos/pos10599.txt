When my toddler started to act up during bath time I thought long and hard on what the issue was. My conclusion was that she was bored and that I needed to find something to spark her imagination and bring the fun back. I looked at many toys and looked for educational, interactive, fun and price.While not extremely educational, you can twist the head and back fin and watch the gears move as you pour water through it so it is interactive. As for fun, I wouldn't of guessed it except for some of the other reviews, but it is. She loves pouring water through it and twisting the fin, so hey, it works.It's fun, interactive and inexpensive, you can't go wrong.
