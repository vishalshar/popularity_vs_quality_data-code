I had this high chair for 6 months and needed to get a second one for a nanny share.  That was when I realized what a good chair this was for my needs.  The pros:  it has a little curve in the lower back so it's the only highchair that we can actually tie to our chair.  The tray size are BIG compared to some of the other ones out there.  It swings, which suits me perfectly.  Some people don't like it because their kids can remove it but it hasn't been a problem for us.  By the time my kid could take it off, they really didn't need a tray to eat but can sit by the table.  The best thing is that it has a second yellow cover.  I didn't realize how much I liked this feature till I saw the other high chairs I bought (and returned one by one).  Having two covers means that you can remove the top one, rinse, and recover w/o having to remove the white cover completely.  It also means that if you're lazy and your kid gets one really dirty, you just remove it and voila you have a second one for the meal!  The chair seat size is also pretty sizable compared to others I've seen.The only con may be that the height isn't adjustable.  But I didn't find that to be a problem w/ our furniture.All in all, I love this high chair! I tried the Safety 1st one and also Rainforest vertion and both were lacking.
