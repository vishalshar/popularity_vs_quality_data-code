I recommend this product!I originally saw this product at a friends house who had it attached to her island.  She didn'thave the big/bulky plastic highchair cluttering her kitchen and it wasn't in the way.I was pushed to buy this product because when we went out to eat for breakfast one morning, Miranda sat in the restaurants wooden high-chair.  When the waitress had to lift the coffee pot and our food plates over my daughter, I thought she needed to be IN the booth, not outside of it and in the walking path of others.  It is a bit bukly to carry, but it is worth it to have Miranda sit next to me and she is very close to the table.I also use this at our kitchen island, we sit there a lot versus the kitchen table, but it does fit there too.  We also have a big picnic table outside that we use a lot during the summer for family events.  This way I know Miranda can again be up close to the table and not have to be off to the side in a high-chair.
