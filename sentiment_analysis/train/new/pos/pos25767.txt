We have a very fancy high chair that is supposed to go all the way through childhood but my toddler figured out how to undo the buckle by 15 months! This was an awesome option. We have smaller seat chairs at our breakfast table and it fits perfectly. Great option for multiple children too, to save floor space.Bought the Bambinos Tidy Table Tray to use with it and the combination feels easier to clean and more secure than our old fancy high chair.Bought some shelf liner to put under it and it doesn't budge. If you use a shelf liner, make sure it is the solid foam (like a yoga mat) not the textured one because the textured stuff will leave marks on your chair.
