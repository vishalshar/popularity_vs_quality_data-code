Designed for toddler 'cause they're easy open, I use them to pre-mix my morning smoothie.  I use about 4.5 oz of dry items plus I add additional vitamins & minerals.  I purchased 5 sets of these and I fill them up, snap the lids on, and store them in the fridge.  They make my morning prep time quick and easy.  I absolutely LOVE them!!
