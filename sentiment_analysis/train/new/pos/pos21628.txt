We have a German Shepherd and a Black Lab. Our Black Lab destroys our kitchen EVERY day, my husband had gotten to the point to where he was telling me to get rid of my 6 year old lab that I have had since she was 4 months old. It was breaking my heart. I suggested a gate to keep her out. The first one was a cheap one from Wal-mart that was wood and wire. This was laughable to my dog, she tore it up. The Second one was a steal frame 36" high gate, it was wonderful but... she would jump it. Then we got this gate. It was tall enough that she could not go over it. She has not gotten into the kitchen yet. There are some things about it that I would change. First the opening is quite narrow, probably 20" +/- so if you are a larger person you may want to consider a different gate. It has stopper at the bottom so once you install it it can only swing one way, the shorter gate we had had an adjustable piece so that the bottom locked and it could swing both ways, I really liked that feature in that gate. The Lock on this gate does its job but you cannot unlock it with your hands full of groceries. All in all this gate has served its purpose, and was very affordable. If you were purchasing this gate for a child just know that it can keep my 70lb very determined Lab out of the kitchen, then it can keep your toddler in a designated space.*Update* 8 Months with this gate and my dog has not broken into the kitchen since owning it (except for one time I left it open on accident!) What a life saver! She has tried to break in, there are bite marks on the bars and one of the bars is slightly bent from her pulling on it. Now if I can just get my German Shepherd to leave the couch cushion alone my house will have it's sanity back!
