Both our boys enjoyed this car, and it's now being driven by our nephew. It looks cute online, and with your child driving around your house, it's even better. One side of one of the handles popped with our first son, but we glued it back down and have never had any other problems--and its on kid #3. The seat is very supportive and comfortable for the little one.
