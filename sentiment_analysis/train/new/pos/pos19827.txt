The Beco has been a life-saver!  My daughter LOVES to be held and snuggled by her momma!  As a first time mom I was more than open to baby wearing.  After doing lots of reasearch and trying different baby carriers on, we landed on the Beco, and could not be happier that we did!  It is super easy to put on and take off.  The latches are very secure and can be easily adjusted to keep the baby snug and secure against your body.  I have worn her on my front facing in and out and on my back as well.  I have not tried her on my hip yet, but considering the ease I've had with it so far, I do not anticipate any problems.  The Beco has allowed me to function while keeping baby girl happy and content.  It is much easier to wear her while out shopping instead of lugging a bulky stroller.  She has nursed while being worn without much trouble.  Also, it is simple to adjust for another person to wear, making it easy for my husband to strap her on as well.  I wore her outside on walks in the summer and she never got too hot.  My only wish is that it had a pouch of somesort for keys, a small walet and phone as some of the competitors have.
