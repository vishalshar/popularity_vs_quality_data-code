Ended up purchasing the Colgate Eco Classica III Dual Firmness Eco-Friendlier Crib Mattress, Ecru' by Colgate instead.  While the Eco Classica I seemed fine (liked the cotton covering a lot), it was very firm.  The Eco Classica III has the benefit of being dual-sided, for only $10 more - in addition, the firmer side seemed to be not quite as hard as the Eco Classica I.
