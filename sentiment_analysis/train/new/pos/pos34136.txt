First off, I haven't tried the little green bags, but I will say filling from the bottom and washing in the curves is a little bit hard, so if you're between the two, I'd sway the other way. But these are so cute, so I picked these! hahaI love the concept. My almost 17 month old refused to eat veggies - except blended. This keeps me from having to go back to spoon feeding. The storebought pouches are so expensive! And just like with jarred food, it isn't the same as home made. So, I pulled the baby bullet out of the cabinet and filled these little guys and my tot ate veggies willingly! That's a win in my book.I will update if they tear or anything because they feel kind of flimsy, but we will see! Some things aren't as delicate as they look, so they may hold up! No leaks yet! Though I don't feel like I could turn them inside out without risking a tear, if that's how you planned to wash them.I LOVE that they are freezer safe! I may get the little green bags later, to compare, so I can make big batches ahead of time and freeze, instead of blending every other day. We will see. But these guys are just as cute in person, and I have no regrets, really.Update: The smaller size, the bird and lion, they are really difficult to fill! IF I were you, I'd go on Amazon and search for the 4pk that is four of the larger size, two each of a panda and walrus. The cost is about the same! The little ones are almost pointless.
