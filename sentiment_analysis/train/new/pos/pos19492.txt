I make yogurt at home everyday and we as a family eat yogurt 2 times a day at the end of each meal( lunch and dinner). Its a south indian thing... I made yogurt at home perfectly well at home all summer without the yogurt maker....but the weather in winter at the place where i live gets really cold and even with heat on at home...i was not able to make good yogurt. Then at last i purchased this yogurt maker. This works perfectly. I do the exact same thing with my milk that i used to do before, bring it to boil, cool it down till its just luke warm and then mix some yogurt from the previous day into it as culture and keep it into this yogurt maker and turn it on...and next morning i have perfect yogurt.This yogurt maker comes with 4 , 5 ounce jars. These too worked out great for me. I make different kinds of yogurt now everyday in these jars. yogurt with whole milk for my kids and yogurt with fat free milk for myself and husband. I also purchased on big bowl from walmart that fits perfectly into this yogurt maker...for days when I need more yogurt when we have ppl over and stuff...and it makes more than 1/2 litre of yogurt......I usually let the milk sit in the maker for 6 hours to make sweet/non-sour perfect yogurt for daily consumption. But when i need sour yogurt for some dish ( like rava idli) and stuff I let it sit for 8 -10hrs and it works out great.It consumes very less power, this device comsumes only 11 watts and so haven't seen any noticeable difference in my electric bill too..
