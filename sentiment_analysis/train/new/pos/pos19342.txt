Requires some minor assembly (stick the ear pieces through the flaps). The elephants are made of a very thin plastic, which enables them to be moved by the slightest breeze. Our A/C running is enough to keep these spinning for several minutes, or you can turn on a ceiling fan, or just blow on them. They come perfectly balanced/positioned on the metal pieces out of the box.I like that they are simple shapes, but do have some depth to them when viewed from underneath by the baby. The picture is not quite accurate as to color. The elephants are actually white, light grey, and black, respectively. Later on I may purchase a more colorful one, such as the hot air balloons. I put mine over the changing table in an elephant-themed nursery.
