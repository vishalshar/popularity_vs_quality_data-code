I didn't clean my walls before I applied the stickers and they stuck great. The edges of some of the stickers started to pull away from the wall the next day, but they were stickers that I'd pulled off and repositioned about a dozen times; so my advice would be to plan carefully where you want to stick them before hand to minimize moving them around unneccessarily and wearing down the adhesive too quick. For the edges that started to pull away I just used some gummy sticky dots I bought at a craft store awhile ago to hold them in place and I havn't had any problems since then (and I live in Seattle Washington where it's more humid than most and they still stick great!) Other than that I love them, they are adorable and they worked perfect to fill up the empty wall space in my twin boys nursery!
