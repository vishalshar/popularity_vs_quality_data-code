This is my 4 month old's favorite out of all of the teething toys I got him. There are 3 different parts to the ring meant to target different areas of the mouth-- front teeth, back teeth, etc. Out of these, my son likes the green part because it feels like a soft rubbery toothbrush. But strangely that's not his favorite part to chew on. The two little feather shaped attachments make a fun crinkling noise when you play with them. He actually likes to chew on these the most, rather than use his hands to play when them! Either way, this toy keeps him happy and distracted, which makes me happy!
