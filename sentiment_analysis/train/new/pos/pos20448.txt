I bought two of these, one for each of my children who are ages 2 and 5. Very nice set and very good price. We just got these in today though so have not had a chance for any drops to see how they hold up. Not being microwavable kind of stinks but this serves its purpose to help provide children with healthy eating and healthy food portions. I do not think we would need to microwave anyway but you never know. I would and have recommended MyPlates but this set makes them even better! We LOVE these!
