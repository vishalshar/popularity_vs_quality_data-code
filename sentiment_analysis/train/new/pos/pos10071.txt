We had a Graco infant snugride which worked great for my little one up until about 10 months. That seat goes up to 22lbs and my daughter is almost 1 and only 15.5 lbs. So shes small and we got good use out of our infant stuff. I started to get frustrated with that seat and knew it was time to move up. It also swallowed our back seat much more than you would think...I am so glad I chose the Britax Roundabout. It is SO heavy duty, comfortable and is so roomy! Not to mention its Britax, these are the safest seats out there and you can see the quality... It fits perfect in our little Hundai Sedan. It doesn't swallow the sides of the passenger seats so people can sit comfortably with our daughter back there. I am very happy with this seat and at the rate my tiny child is growing we will get great use out of this :-D!
