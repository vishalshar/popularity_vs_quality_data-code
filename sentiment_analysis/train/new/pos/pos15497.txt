I ordered 2 of these with low expectations since they were so cheap- a friend & I were making matching Halloween costumes for our 1 yr olds. I was skeptical of the size range listed "infant to 10yrs" - but the waistband did fit our 1yr olds & would have stretched to fit a much larger waist as well- def an avg size 10 yr old girl...We just cut the length for our babies to wear & it worked perfectly. (You can cut tulle without it fraying.) I paid less than $3/piece for these but having seen them, I would pay more to order the same product again if needed- our backup plan was to make the tutus ourselves if these didn't work but this was way cheaper than it would have been to make them.
