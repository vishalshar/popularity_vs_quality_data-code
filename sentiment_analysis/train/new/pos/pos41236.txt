I bought these for our 2-month old and only just now at 3 months is she starting to be able to grab them.  They were nice to use to help with tracking (though my red phone case seemed to be preferred) and they are light enough for her to hold them on her own.  The bright colors and patterns will catch her attention and we play games where I rotate the face visible to her to keep her engaged for longer.  They haven't been through the wash yet, but the stitching looks to be good quality with even spacing, not too tight/loose, and no loose ends hanging out.  I expect they will do fine.Update at 5 months - she still loves these!  Now they are apparently "teether toys" as well, and they have survived just fine through several washings, though I do put them in a delicates bag to help protect them.
