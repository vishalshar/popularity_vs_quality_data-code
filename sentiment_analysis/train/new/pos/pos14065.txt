I've been cloth diapering for nearly 5 years at this point, primarily with pocket diapers, so I've tried a *lot* of different inserts.  These have become my hands-down favorite for maximum absorbency with minimum bulk.When I started cloth diapering, one of my first questions was which inserts to choose. Here's a quick summary of the primary choices in materials: microfiber inserts -- the ones which most pocket diapers come with -- tend to hold onto smells. They're also subject to 'compression leaks' -- they absorb the liquid fine, but can let it leak if there's pressure on the wet insert, which of course is almost always the case for a baby lying down while sleeping or sitting in a car seat.  Microfiber works fine for lighter wetters or younger babies, but can be inadequate for heavier duty use.  Bamboo is much better, and is my preferred material for the bulk of my daytime inserts; it's about half the price of hemp inserts but much more reliably leak-proof than the microfiber.  Hemp, however, wins hands-down for naptime and bedtime.  I pair a bamboo insert with a hemp insert for overnight, and it works reliably even for my current super-heavy-wetter.I've compared many brands of hemp inserts over the past 5 years, and the Thirsties Hemp Inserts are absolutely my #1 favorite. In fact, if I had it to do over, I'd probably only get these inserts and skip all of the others!  The 6 layers of hemp is remarkably thin for a 6-layer insert, so you could even double up with 2 of these for a total of 6 layers of hemp if you wanted.  The Thirsties inserts appear to be considerably more durable than the otherwise very similar Babykicks Joeybunz (the hourglass-shaped ones with serged trim, http://www.amazon.com/BabyKicks-Piece-JoeyBunz-Inserts-Green/dp/B006CG7HZC/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1368798260&sr=8-7&keywords=hemp+joeybunz ) -- the Joeybunz worked just as well as the Thirsties Hemp Inserts, but after only a year of use, the edges are fraying and the fabric itself is disintegrating, while the Thirsties are still in nearly-new condition.  I've tried the Babykicks Joeybunz Premium, as well -- the kind with 2 3-layer inserts sewn together at the top, http://www.amazon.com/BabyKicks-Pack-Joey-Bunz-Premium-Large/dp/B001NAAQRS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1368798260&sr=8-1&keywords=hemp+joeybunz -- and while they seem to absorb roughly the same amount as the 6-layers-in-one inserts, they're stiffer and seem like they'd be less comfortable for the baby.  They are more durable than the regular Joeybunz, however, and aren't showing the same tendency toward fraying and disintegration.  I'd rate the Thirsties Hemp inserts a first by a large margin for the combination of utility and durability, the Babykicks Joeybunz Premiums 2nd for similar absorbency and durability but less softness/comfort, and the regular Babykicks Joeybunz last, simply because they wear out far too quickly.
