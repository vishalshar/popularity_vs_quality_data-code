These are our favorite snack cups....and we have many different kinds!  The munchkin ones are almost sharp on little fingers and the OXO brand are very difficult to get the snacks out of due to the angle of the cup.  The snack-trap brand works well but these are our favorites bc the slits in the top are nice and smooth making them gentle on tiny fingers and they come with two handles which makes them easier for little hands to hold.  We use these almost exclusively now and the others just sit in the cabinet.  Especially the OXO brand, don't waste your money on those!
