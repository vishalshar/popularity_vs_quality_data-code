My son does not like to use the toilet, but enjoys peeing in the shower so I thought this would be a great way to jump start his potty training. The suction cups were terrible, but it also came with a hook and 3M adhesive strip which worked perfectly on my shower tile. The urinal is small so it doesn't take up a lot of space and it's easy to clean. It took several weeks for the item to arrive so I recommend ordering it early.
