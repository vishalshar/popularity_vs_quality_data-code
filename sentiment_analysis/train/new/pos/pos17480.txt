Quality heirloom blocks - they actually include a little card to list how it gets handed down through the generations (as if people will actually keep track of that card, but it is the realization that these will indeed last and get handed down that counts).The braille is nice, the size is good and standard, the blocks are solid. The artwork and etching is very nice. They are definitely a quality product - the price ($33.95 at time of review) is not exactly cheap, but you are paying to get a quality product. The letter associated with the sign language picture could stand to be a little larger, as with the letter associated with the braille. The braille sides just have a solid color, the letter is sunken in and the braille itself is engraved obviously for touch.When looking at blocks on amazon make sure to take note of the block count and block size. There are a lot of smaller block options for cheaper but I don't think that's what most people want.
