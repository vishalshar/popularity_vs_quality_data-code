I have the oxo tot food cubes which are also good and didn't really need more baby food containers but the oxo tots didn't fit in my bottle warmer so I bought these. I wish I had seen these ones first. They are the perfect size, easy to clean and the lid snaps on really well so I don't foresee any leakage (haven't taken them out and about yet). They fit perfectly in my bottle warmer (I HATE using microwaves and don't even own one so this is important for warming the food right out of the fridge). And I LOVE that they are made in the USA. The reason I only gave them 4 stars is because they don't have measurement markers on them like the oxo tot ones. But if I could have given them 4.5 stars I would have. They are great and really the only baby food containers I need.UPDATE: It would seem the customer who complained about being put on a mailing list is correct. I've received at least two e-mails from the company asking if I'm satisfied with the product (which is just good customer service in my opinion but only one is necessary) and asking me to review the product on Amazon even after I did (which is annoying in my opinion). The e-mail did not come from a personal e-mail address and has an "unsubscribe" link at the bottom which leads me to believe that it is a mailing list I have been placed on.  Annoying? Very.  Dealbreaker? Not for me...unless I receive more e-mails after having unsubscribed. Will update this review if I do.UPDATE: I heard from an actual person via email apologizing for the follow-up emails and explaining that they are a small business that relies on good reviews to keep them alive and providing us with this great product. They also thanked me for my review. Totally understand where they are coming from. Great product and good customer service even if a little overzealous.
