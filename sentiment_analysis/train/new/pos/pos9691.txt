I ordered this crib because I wanted a black crib and all the retail stores seemed to hike up the crib price just because it was black!?  This was more reasonably priced than most cribs I'd looked at and had the underneath, matching storage which I think is a neat idea.  The product arrived with all the pieces intact - the only downside to assembly was with the underneath drawer - the corners are slotted so you can slide and lock the corners together, however, some of the boards didn't fit properly into the slots made for them and we had to shave off some of the slot in order for them to fit.  Other than that, the only downside is the the crib absolutely reeked!  It probably was the paint smell, but it's nothing I would ever want to subject a baby (or even an adult to!)  I had to close the nursery door, with a fan in the room and the window opened to air it out and it took a month for the smell to go away (luckily I ordered it a few months before baby was due!  Now that's taken care of, I think it's going to make a great crib, seems very sturdy and will easily convert to toddler bed.  Also, it's not a really bulky crib like so many are these days, so it's ideal for our smaller sized nursery room.
