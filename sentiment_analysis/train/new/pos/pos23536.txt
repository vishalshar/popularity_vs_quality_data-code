This changing pad lasted through two kids without any issues. All we had to do was buy a new cover for it. The strap was good but did not fit around our changing table, so we had to just let it be loose on the table ... but we never had any problems doing that. And even if the diaper change ended up being messy, all we ever had to do was change the cover, and maybe wipe up a little bit on the pad, but it always cleaned up easily.
