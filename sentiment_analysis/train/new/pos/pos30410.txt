I am so happy with these little duckies! I honestly thought they would be smaller from what some people were saying. They are 1 3/4" tall by 1 1/2" long and 1 1/4" wide. It sounds smaller than they actually look. They are adorable!! There are 4 different ducks and I got an equal mix of the 4 in the bag. I washed them as I wanted to put a few in a punch bowl for a baby shower. None of the paint chipped which pleased me. They didn't float upright (I knew they wouldn't but wanted to try anyway) everyone still thought they were cute. The rest of them I laid around different tables and people got to take them home with them (which made everyone happy). These really are super cute. I would totally buy them again for another party. -- One reviewer said that Oriental Trading was stamped on the bottom. Mine didn't, there were a few small numbers on the bottom but that was it.
