My daughter won't take any bottles, this was my last resort. Though this didn't work for my daughter I still loved it. The nipple is very soft. I love that its only 2 parts. Easy to clean. Closest thing to a real breast I could find. The shape and shortness of the bottle is great to fit when baby is laying sideways in breastfeeding position to prevent air.
