This product completely surpassed my expectations.  I am having my second child (my first was a girl this one is a boy) and since I hadn't bought anything for the little guy yet I thought I would try this out, the price was just too tempting.  Because this was one of the cheapest bedding sets on Amazon I had doubts that it would be any good but this stuff is really just for show anyways so I figured what the hay.  Boy was I surprised, this is way nicer than the much more expensive one we bought for my daughter a couple of years ago.  It came with so many little extras, it is very soft and good quality.  All items were shipped promptly and packaged beautifully.  The one little bonus I really wasn't counting on was the diaper bag...wow, usually the freebie diaper bags are pretty crappy but this one is pretty nice.  Not one that I would use all the time but a good little one and it had some special touches like 2 little bags on the inside, a changing pad, and I have never seen a free diaper bag with a little plastic insert for wet things.  Overall I am so satisfied with my purchase AND I ordered this along with other amazon goodies and this arrived before all of my other things.Oh just a quick note, my set actually didn't come with a bib, which didn't bother me because I wasn't buying the set for a bib, however, it did come with an adorable pair of bootie socks (look like little cleats) .  Nothing gets the baby fever going better than a cute pair of socks.  Much better than a bib if you ask me.
