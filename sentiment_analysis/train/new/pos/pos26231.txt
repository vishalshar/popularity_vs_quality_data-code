I didn't necessarily NEED the adjuster, but chose to get it for the comfort of other riders if every seat in my van was being used. I drive an 02 Honda Odyssey, and our radian (occupied by my 2y6m daughter) is behind my driver's seat, . I sit pretty upright in my seat (and I'm 5'5"), but I still had to move the captain's chair back all the way in order for the radian to not touch my seat. This wasn't a problem, but if I ever needed someone to sit on the third row bench behind her seat, they'd have hardly any leg room. With the adjuster, I can move the captain's chair that the radian is on, all the way forward and still fit a finger in the space. I'm impressed :) It was also really easy to install!When I saw how upright it made my daughter's seat, I was a little curious about how she'd do sleeping. She fell asleep in it with no issues, so I'm happy.I'll also upload pictures to show how much space was gained!
