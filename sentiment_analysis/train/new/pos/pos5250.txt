These protectors seem to be good quality and fit the iPad fairly well. I did have a very small overhang on the edge - about 1/32 of an inch. This is pretty typical of these bargain protectors. I tested the fit before I applied the protector so I know that it wasn't from crooked placement. My keyboard case would catch on the film and pop the screen protector up. Between that issue and trying to get rid of bubbles, I went through all three protectors within a few days.These were tougher to apply compared to a phone for obvious reasons (size). I kept getting bubbles and/or a bit of overhang. For the third attempt, I grabbed a cordless vacuum and turned it on as I applied the protector. I pushed out the bubbles with some extra force before I removed the second film. Had to trim the edge so it wouldn't catch on the keyboard case.I do not have to wipe the screen very often - but don't take that to mean that finger marks don't show up. They do. But this screen has a decent ability to mask stray marks while in use.
