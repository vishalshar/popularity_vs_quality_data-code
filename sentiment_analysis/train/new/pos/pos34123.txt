My 1 year old received this as a Christmas gift today and I was so pleased with it. He already had a Melissa & Doug stacker that I was about to throw away because the paint was chipping badly and they had a product recall on a similar item. This stacker is finished in such a way that it seems the paint would not easily chip and even if it did since it is vegetable dye, no worries.  I love the muted yet rich and warm colors in this toy and my son likes to play with it as much as the other stacker. It is a little shorter with less pieces than the other one, but for a 1 year old I actually prefer that. I will definitely be purchasing more items from this company!
