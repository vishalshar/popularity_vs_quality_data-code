I ordered this swing to have at my mom's house my my daughter and I go to visit. We have a larger Fisher Price swing, which we love, but unfortunately can't take with us. My daughter only slept in a swing for the first couple months of her life, so having one everywhere we went was necessary. This swing not only was small, compact, and easy to move around, but it also worked perfectly. The different setting allowed for my daughter to be swung at the pace she likes, even as she got bigger, and unlike some swings, it didn't get stuck and actually kept moving once she got bigger. There are also vibration and music setting which were great for when she was playing in it. It kept her entertained for awhile and allowed me to get stuff done. Great little swing, and not a bad price too!
