This bottle brush is fantastic.  Why so many complaints people??  Look, if you want to clean your average sized bottle your baby drinks from, not your pumping bottles, or...sheesh...your pumping parts, this is the brush for you.  I've gone through so many brushes where the handle was attached to the brush by a braided wire.  Over a few weeks, these rust and eventually get weak and twist off and break.  The OXO brush head is firmly attached to the handle with a plastic handle.  It's not going anywhere.  I've used this brush for over a year and it is still in fantastic shape.  No wearing down of the bristles and no rust...because it's plastic.  Okay, I agree with other complainers that the nipple brush is a bit odd and useless.  I clean my nipples with a good ol' soapy hand...can't get better than that.  And I've never had the handle twist off where the nipple brush is while using it to clean my bottles.  The holder the brush comes with is fantastic as well.  It plunks down inside and doesn't topple over drying my brush for the next use.  The bottom even opens up for cleaning in case it gets gunky. For the price and durability, this is a great brush! End of story.
