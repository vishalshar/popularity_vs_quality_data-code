Love, love, love these diapers.  I used FuzziBunz about 8 years ago with my daughter, passed them along two years later to my son, and they held up great through two kids.  By the time my third came along six years later, I didn't have them anymore so I decided to go the cheaper route and used pre-folds and covers.  This was okay, but my son soon outgrew the small size and wasn't quite big enough for the large ones.  I ordered six of these for the interim and boy, I'm glad I did!  They have improved these tremendously over the years and they are so wonderful to use!  The adjustable waist and leg openings are the best!  My now 5 month old is over 18 lbs and a big chubby and he is still on the smaller adjustments with the snaps (way better than the Velcro on other diapers, BTW) so I know he'll have lots of room to grow into them.  (Having said that, although these are "one size" diapers, I can't imagine a smaller newborn being able to fit into them without them feeing way too bulky.)  I'm ordering one or two more sets of FuzziBunz to get us through until he's potty trained in a few years.  I know from experience that they'll hold up well, and he's very comfy in them.  Well worth the investment and will save us money in the long run (over disposables.)
