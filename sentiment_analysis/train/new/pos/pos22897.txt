I love these bottles! My daughter has dropped them, sat on them and they do not break, due to the rubber covering. They are easy to wash (dishwasher or scrub brush) and the rubber cover is removable for cleaning. I did switch the nipples to Dr. Brown and they fit perfectly! I would highly recommend this product.
