When my wife leaves me a bottle of milk (AKA White Gold) in the fridge or cooler bag, these are very handy for on the go. It does take about 15 minutes to warm the bottle up, so keep that in mind as it's not quick. The problem can be if the little one gets hungry quick, this could take some time. We use these with the Medela Wide Neck 8oz bottles and have no real issues with them.Overall they are a little pricey, but one of them will usually last for two feedings. The other issue is they aren't instant. But if you are out and don't have access to warm water or some other means to warm up a bottle, these work very well in a pinch. Bottle will be warm and your little one will have a full belly.
