Grandson is unhappy if he does not have this sleeper. I have purchased three from Amazon (from 18 mos. to now 3T) and they are exceptional. For children who are unable or unwilling to use a blanket, I think it makes great sense. Footed pajamas underneath are a must. It gives me peace of mind that he's warmWashes well...I love this item. They can be a little pricey, but they take the place of a blanket that often becomes tattered.
