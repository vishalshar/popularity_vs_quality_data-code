Love these for both my kids (2 and 3 months). I tri-fold them to boost the infant diapers (I use grovia) and use them full size for my toddler to boost grovia hybrids, suatainable babyish fitteds, bgenius. Yes they are short but the point of these particular doublers is trim absorbancy. So when I'm looking in my doubler arsenal for a little boost without the bulk I use these. I have girls so I place them in the wet zone toward the front. These rock for extra absorbancy without bulk!
