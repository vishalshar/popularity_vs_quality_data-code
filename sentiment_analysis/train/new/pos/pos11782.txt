Way to improve on an already great product, bumGenius! I found this diaper much easier to stuff than my older bumGeniuses, and it seems trimmer, too. I LOVE the snaps ... the applix is nice for a quick diaper change and perfect fit, but if you're purchasing a diaper for the long-haul, snaps are where it's at. Velcro just doesn't last, and babies figure out how to get out of their diapers quickly.We have been using bumGenius for years, and they really last (we are still using some of the same ones on our third child that we used on our first!). While we do use other brands as well, it's the bumGenius we save for night time (since they can be double-stuffed), outings, babysitters, etc. They are just so easy to use and don't make our baby look like a bottom-heavy little waddler. While I love a cotton, hemp and bamboo diaper as much as the next mom, there is something nice about the way the poly liners (which bumGenius dipes have) wick moisture away from the baby's skin. If I were wearing a diaper, I would prefer it - why shouldn't my baby get to feel drier, longer?The prints are pretty cute. We bought the red. Not amazing, but better than the plain and rather unexciting colors bumGenius has been offering until now.
