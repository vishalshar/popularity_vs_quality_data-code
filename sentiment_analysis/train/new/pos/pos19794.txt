We love this crib mattress! I am expecting my second child, but since it has been 7 years since my first was born I am essentially starting over. As such, I have done a LOT of research. I finally decided on the Colgate Classica I and am very glad I did. It is well made, sturdy, and very firm as recommended for infants. It is also very light to make changing sheets much easier! I like that it has square corners that give it a tight fit inside the crib, yet sheets still fit well. I also love knowing it is green certified! You can't go wrong with this mattress.
