Just received this today and I'm excited!  My 2 year old son LOVES Thomas and is very motivated by sound/songs so hopefully this will be the perfect addition to make our potty training fun!  The Thomas potty came right out of the box and installing the 1 AA battery was quick and simple. The potty is so cute and seems well-made; smooth/seamless features means it will be easy to clean, and the red seat can be used on regular toilet with the base as step-stool.We had gotten the First Years Hero in Training 2-in-1 potty chair but the soft foam ring with pee guard was so flimsy and would not stay on the seat when my son tried to sit on it; I wasn't going to bother with that and don't want pee all over the floor!  (Will see how this one deals with peeing... other reviews say not so well but the Thomas seat fits into/over bowl so not sure how pee leaks out?)  We ended up giving the First Years potty to my same-age niece.  My son also had difficulty lifting the seat (as he wanted to see the bowl) and I could just imagine over time he would break it... the Thomas Potty seat lifts off easily, which could be a different sort of problem... but one that seems unavoidable with curious children.So far worth it for any Thomas fan!
