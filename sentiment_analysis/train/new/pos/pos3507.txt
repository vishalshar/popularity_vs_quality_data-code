We have used the Eddie Bauer Car Seat Protector for coming up on 5 years.  We first purchased them when our daughter was born, 1 for each car, and the seat protector has paid for itself many times over with the number of spills and stuff that is has kept from staining the seat.  They are strong, sturdy, and our first set it still holding up incredibly well after such a long run of constant use.  We liked them so much we bought a second set when our son was born (since his car seats needed them and our daughter was still using hers).  We have not really used the pockets on the front but they might be useful for some small items or for keeping clean-up bags in your vehicle.
