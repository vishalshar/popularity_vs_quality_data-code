The book is nicely organized and has all the pages my daughter wanted.  She has two books - one for each twin - so she can keep their medical info straight.  It would be nice if it were a higher quality.  My daughter keeps wanting to fold the book in half to make it easier to write in.  But every time she does that the pages fall out of the comb binding and then has to put it back together.  It would be a much better book if it had a coil binding.  The page quality is fine.  It's just the comb binding that we don't like.If the pages become hard to turn it's because the comb has tightened and there isn't enough room for the pages to move.  With the book open and with a hand on the outside of the outer edge of the left-hand pages, and one on the outer edge of the right-hand pages, gently pull outwards.  That will loosen the comb enough that the pages will turn properly.It's a nice size - big enough to be useful, but not so big that you won't want to carry it to the doctor's office.
