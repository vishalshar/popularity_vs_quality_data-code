What a flippin BRILLIANT IDEA! These have made the tireless efforts of our VERY FEW helpers so much easier!With as many babies as WE HAD, I don't know how I kept it together WITHOUT THEM. THey are a staple shower gift, along with the blue and pink velvety baby hangers we bought! New parents, parents of many (HELLO!) every parent needs them. These would even work beutifully commercially!
