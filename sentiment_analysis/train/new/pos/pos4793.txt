These are my go-to toddler cup. I have tried several other styles and brands, and I keep coming back to these. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros: They are easy to take apart and clean, and therefore they have NO mold problems like some of the other styles, which trap mold in hard (or impossible) to reach nooks and crannies. They are lightweight, and easy for a young toddler to hold. My kids were using these 2-handed at age 1, one-handed at age 2, and are still using them at age 5. The handle is shaped like a sideways teacup, so can easily clip to a bag, the stroller, anywhere.Cons: That plastic carabiner it comes with is trash. Any time I buy a new cup, that gets tossed in the recycling bin right away. I use a baby chain link similar to this one instead Nuby 18 Piece Linkables. Also, if your kid is a chewer, these lids won't last long, and they are not replaceable. I called Munchkin once and asked where to buy replacement tops, and they said for this model, they don't have any. I begged. They promised to send me some for free, took my info, and never sent them. I'm a huge recycler / reuser / fixer, so it pains me to toss a perfectly good cup in the recycle just because I have a broken topper.  So if you like this cup, know that you will be throwing away a perfectly good cup each time the top gets gnawed to shreds. I'd say this happens every 6 months or so in our house.
