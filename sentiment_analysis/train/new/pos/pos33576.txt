I receive this activity zone as a gift, when my daughter was 6 months old. In the beginning she didn't understand exactly what to do with it. But as the time passed, she started enjoying and spending greater time playing in it. Ahh...a big relief for me!! I could easily cook, work on my laptop, or even watch television now, no fear that she would come crawling in and open the kitchen cabinets, press the laptop keys, or play with the remote control. Since I am alone at home during the day time, I faced problems using restroom or taking shower as there was nobody around to see her in my absence. But this activity zone solved this problem too. I could put her into it, and easily go in without fearing that she would harm herself or so. She'd easily give me 10-15 minutes and sometimes even more. My daughter is 15 months old now. As the AZ says that 'it grows with your child', it really does. She enjoys playing with it even today, but after a couple of minutes she wants to come out and run around.I was so happy with that gift that I have already bought 2 more for family friends, and planning to buy 1 more for my nephew. All in all, a GREAT PURCHASE!
