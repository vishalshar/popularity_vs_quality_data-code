Works great with a BOB motion stroller. However, no instructions with it and at first I didn't realize some of the vinyl was folded in half and I thought there is no way this will work. Didn't even cover the umbrella of the stroller. Instructions would have been nice but once I got all the vinyl unstuck it was pretty simple. This is a big win! Much cheaper and baby can see out unlike the name brand version for my stroller. Lots of wet walks taking big siblings to school in the morning.
