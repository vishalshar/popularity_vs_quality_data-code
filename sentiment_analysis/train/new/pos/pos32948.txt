This more than met our expectations! It's a good quality, washes well, and is super soft! I was looking for one that didn't have one of those stupid stuffed animals on it because either they rattle and wake up the baby or they are just annoying to put by the baby's head because of the shape and size. My daughter had one from gund, but they are like $25 and I couldn't spend that again for this child. Most babies like to put something up by their face to go to sleep, but using a whole blanket can be scary and dangerous, so these are perfect for that! I actually just ordered another one in pink to replace my daughter's worn out one. Very impressed for the price! The only negative I could say about this is that the satin is a little cheaper quality when it comes to softness. Don't get me wrong, it's still soft, but it's not that dreamy silky smooth soft. Then again, you have to pay for the dreamy stuff ;) so seriously this was great! *bonus: it came super quick. It was processed and shipped within 24 hours of ordering!
