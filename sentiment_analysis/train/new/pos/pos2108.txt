Very happy with my purchase. It takes me around 3 weeks to receive them (because they're shipped from china) but I'm more than okay with the wait because these are much cheaper than others I found on amazon and the quality is not bad at all! They feel like any other brand-name corner protectors. They look a lot more transparent than what's shown in the pictures, which is great! They will definitely protect me from being cut by sharp corners! They come with some stickers that make sure the protectors stay in place!Overall I'm very happy with my purchase. It's such a great deal given the quality of the product and the price!
