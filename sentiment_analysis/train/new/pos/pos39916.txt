I don't understand why this item has been discontinued. I personally know 2 babies who refused to take any nipple but this one because it is so soft and pliable, more like their mothers'.  Breastfed babies struggle with taking a bottle at times, so these were a lifesaver for moms who must return to work.  Bring them back Playtex...please.
