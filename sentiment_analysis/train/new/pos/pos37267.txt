I wasn't sure about ordering Alva Baby diapers because some people had told me that they were cheaply made. Maybe that's true, but I haven't been able to tell the difference between these and my whopping $20 a pop BumGenius new diapers. I absolutely love the suede cloth. I have washed this diaper so many times and it has stayed just as soft as when I first purchased it.It's not too bulky for daytime use, but it also works really well with night time use for my almost 3 year old. The diaper itself is a little big--- this would not fit my 13 week old. The legs are still a little too big from him, but I purchased it FOR my toddler, so I got out of it what I intended.Overall, a great value for my money!
