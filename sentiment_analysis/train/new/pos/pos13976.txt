I bought this stroller mainly for travel purposes.  I was looking for certain aspects in a stroller- that it was lightweight, had a big canopy (my daughter is very fair skinned) and that it reclined.  My husband and I looked at about twenty strollers and this was the one that had all three!  The price on here was great- even with the shipping, it beat the store prices!  The only negative I would have about this stroller is that it was VERY hard to open and close it for like a week after receiving it (it was very stiff out of the box).  Once I broke it in though, it has been wonderful.
