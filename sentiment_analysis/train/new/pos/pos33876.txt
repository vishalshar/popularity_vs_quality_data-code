I have three children, so I have tried many different high chairs over the years in my quest to find the "perfect" one (Graco, Cosco, Fisher-Price, Chicco, Peg Perego, and the classic wooden high chair).  The Baby Bjorn chair beats the heck out of them all!  Everything about this chair is thoughtfully designed and made with quality materials.  The other reviewers have mentioned how small it is, and they are right...it is perfect for tight spaces.  But some of the reviewers said this high chair was too small for a toddler, and that is where I completely disagree.  My 18 month-old, who is 33 inches tall and weighs 25 pounds, fits in it perfectly with a year's worth of growing room.  (I have posted some pictures in the "View and share related images" area to show this.)  I am using the tray on the middle setting for my toddler, and it fits her perfectly, even though she wears big, bulky cloth diapers!  It will be a while before we need to move up to the biggest setting.  And her legs have plenty of room to grow before her knees get close to touching the bottom of the tray.  This high chair is a little different from the others on the market, in that the tray is meant to sit snugly against the child, to keep him/her from being able to stand up in the chair.  (This might be the reason some reviewers feel it is too small for their toddlers.)  The bonus to this is that there is not a gap between the tray and the child, so no food falls down into the seat, and cleanup is a breeze!Here are the dimensions of the Baby Bjorn high chair.  Base: 22"L x 22"W.  Seat height: 22".  Tray height: 28".  Chair back height: 33".It took me a little while to get used to folding this chair, but it gets much easier with practice.  And I love the removable tray, which my toddler has not been able to take off herself (yay!).  I love that this chair is compact and lightweight, because I can easily move it around to wherever we happen to be eating.  In fact, when I am making dinner, my toddler occasionally scoots it over to me so that she can sit in it and watch me.  Gotta love that!One last thought:  my toddler really likes that the tray is lower on this chair, because she can see down into her bowl, and therefore scoop out her cereal more easily.  If she were sitting in a booster seat at our table, she would be sitting so much lower than her bowl, that she would be looking at the side of it.  How could she find her cereal like that?In short, the Baby Bjorn high chair is high-quality, safe, compact, lightweight, SUPER easy to clean (no crevices for food to get stuck in!), and suitable for both babies and toddlers...who could ask for more?***UPDATE***  My daughter is now two years old, 36 inches tall, and weighs 30 pounds (90th percentile for height, 85th percentile for weight, so, quite large for her age!).  This chair still fits her perfectly (I have added another photo to the "View and Share Related Images" area), and we are still using the tray on the middle setting.  I love this thing so much that I even take it with us when we travel!***2ND UPDATE***  My daughter is now 2.5 years old, 37 inches tall, and weighs 32 pounds (75th percentile for height, 80th percentile for weight).  This chair is now getting a little tight for her, simply because her legs are so long.  Her knees are almost touching the bottom of the tray.  (I have added two more photos to the "View and Share Related Images area.)  The tray is still on the middle setting, so she has more room to grow outward, just not upward.  We are now retiring this chair, and it makes me so sad, because I have loved it so much!
