These little water toys are a perfect size for little hands, and provide young children with an innovative way to develop their pincer grip (a crucial pre-writing skill) as children work to squeeze the water out of the 3 zany toppers.When I took these zany little squirters to our neighborhood pool last week, they did prove to challenging for some of the younger children to screw and unscrew the top from the base. Only a couple of the 2 and 3 year olds were able to refill the squirter.This was primarily because the process of screwing and unscrewing base from one of the 3 interchangeable tops was too cumbersome for their wet and unskilled little hands, and the children soon discovered it was far easier to bring each of the little squirters over to a willing adult to be refilled. Four and five year-olds were able to "refill" the squirters without much difficulty, but they quickly lost interest in playing with the toy.So , if you aren't  opposed to sitting by the edge of the pool or bath to refill these bath squirters, then Boon Scrubble Squirters offer young children a fun way to develop their pre-writing muscles.
