I have this installed for 10 months with good success, I expect the success has to do with the installation which is directly into the door frame of our master bedroom. Simple install of a product that seems to be built for something more demanding.In my application, I want to keep my dog out of the master bedroom. I wanted something that could be operated with one hand easily, and would stay open and out of the way when not in use (which is most of the time now that she has got the hint to stay out). I have a nice home, and also didn't want something that was an eyesore.I read a comment somewhere here on Amazon to be sure to install it level, if you want the option to leave it open at times. Good advice.I have both pieces screwed into the door frame, two screws each. Easy install, easy to adjust the width. It's proven very sturdy, all the edges are smooth, lots to like, if you can like a door.
