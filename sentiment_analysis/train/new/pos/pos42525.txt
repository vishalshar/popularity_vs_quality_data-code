We ordered the 3 in one superyard plus this extension to section of a large part of  our living room for our twins to play.  It's very simple to add it on to the super-yard:  no tools required.  The only issue I have with the extension set is that it DOES NOT COME WITH EXTRA HARDWARE for attaching it to the wall, which you will need if:1.  You're using an odd number of panels in the wall-attached configuration and you want the option of easily converting it back to a stand alone enclosure2.  You're using extension parts alone to block off access to an area where a gate is not neededTo explain:  We only needed 1 of the 2 extension panels to fit our space, and were able to swap parts around on the wall attachment hardware to make it work.  There's a great review about how to do this under the 3 in 1 superyard product page in which the reviewer described a fix that won't require you to buy extra parts.  We've now purchased another 2-panel extension to use with our "leftover" panel to block off access to our gas fireplace.  If you want to use the extension, as we do, to block of an area you don't need gate access to, you will need to buy the wall-atachment hardware from the manufacturer:  they have a nice webpage where you can select the parts you need...  but it would be much easier if the parts just came with it...  or if you could buy them from amazon.
