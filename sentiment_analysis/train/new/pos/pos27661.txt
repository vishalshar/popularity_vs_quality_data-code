These bottles are so uncomplicated you will believe you are not properly assembling them.  YOU ARE.  You put the little stick on the protruding silicone under the lid.  You will think you are not sealing the bottle properly because you simply set it on top and are pumping the orange lid up and down...that's it!  That's all there is to sealing these.  And the milk doesn't have the nasty plastic smell of breastmilk bags.  Since the bottles are the perfect accompaniment to breastmilk storage system, it was a no-brainer to attempt using the MilkBank bottle with my first child.  It was literally the only bottle she would take.  It's the only option we presented to my second child, so I got a lot of use out of these!  This particular purchase was made as a gift for a cousin who had her first baby and needed to start pumping for outings.  Easy, seamless breastmilk storage...buy the bottles too!!  This set will come with two nipples and lids, but you will need more than that.
