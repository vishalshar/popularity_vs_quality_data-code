My 21-month old nephew loves using this brush!  The length is perfect--Your little guy or gal can hold the brush (and get a sense of doing it on their own), while Mommy/Daddy/caregiver can hold the brush near the bottom to help the little one hit all the right spots/ensure a job well-done. It's just right for little ones in size and comfort--the diameter is perfect for little hands to grip,  the brush is sized right, the bristles soft yet sturdy, and the "handle" has a comfy grip. We experienced no bristles falling out or anything like that, and the brush is easy to clean and store.We are on our second one for our little guy, and will definitely purchase this one again the next time we are due to change his brush.
