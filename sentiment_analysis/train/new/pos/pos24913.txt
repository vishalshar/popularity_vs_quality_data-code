These plates are great for toddlers! They are nice and deep and my daughter loves to eat out of them. I find she eats better when using these plates than plates we have used in the past. I would recommend you buy them from Walmart though. I got a set of 3 for only $5.00 (not on sale) there instead of $15 on amazon
