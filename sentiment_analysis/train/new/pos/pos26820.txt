I got this for my daughter when she was 2 years old to use in the bathtub.  She's 3 now and STILL plays with this net.  It has held up well and doesn't have to be used only in the bathtub.  She plays with it outside in the sandbox.  She plays with it with her lego blocks and yes she still plays with it in the bathtub as well.  I bought it thinking it would be something she could play with and it would run its course and she'd be tired of it.  But she hasn't tired of it at all and I'm not sure she's going to.  This was a great purchase for the price and it's obviously of good quality that can stand the test of time.  My daughter isn't easy on all her toys so this has been heavily tested for durability.  I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a fun toy that will last.
