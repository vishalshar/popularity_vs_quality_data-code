I don't use it for its intended purpose, I use it to carry/mix my daily shakes when I'm away from home.. I discarded the nipple and ring,  I have a cap to secure the powder and the drink agitator, I simply add 8oz of water (it's 9oz so there's headspace)  and shake.  The slender bottle fits perfectly in my day bag's outer pocket.  Works for me!
