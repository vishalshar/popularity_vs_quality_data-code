I purchased this seat to transition from a rear facing infant seat.  I will be using as a forward facing seat only. Set up was very easy straps adjust very easy. Install took less than 10 minutes very easy anchors directly to car and feels very secure! Seat itself is very padded seems like it would be comfy and the fabric is plush and soft. Harness buckles are not hard to unbuckle but they are child proof. Best part is the extra room we gained in the front passenger seat. I do have a newer mid sized vehicle so that may have aided in the easy installation. This is a great carseat for the price I would recommend buying great quality!!!
