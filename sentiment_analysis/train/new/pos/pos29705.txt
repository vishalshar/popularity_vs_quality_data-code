I bought this as a second carrier for my wife and I to use with our 2 month old baby girl.  Our first carrier was the Ergo Baby carrier - a more expensive carrier that, quite simply, is fantastic.We wanted another one that we could keep in the car in case we found ourselves out and about somewhere and forgot to pack the Ergo.  This Snugli turned out to be the right choice.Pros: This unit was the right price for what we needed: really inexpensive.  Even with the low price it works well for what we need.  It's compact, easy to use, and allows good flexibility: you can wear it in back or front and with the baby facing you or facing out.Cons: It's functional, but not super comfortable.  After extended wear you will feel it either in your lower back or neck.  The straps are thinner than on the other carrier we use and can dig in after a while.  They're also all nylon and not too comfortable if your arms rub on them walking around.Bottom line: I like this as our secondary carrier for shorter use, but am very happy we invested in the Ergo for longer use.  I have no problem recommending the Snugli for those looking for an economical option that gets the job done, but would have them look elsewhere if they want more comfort.
