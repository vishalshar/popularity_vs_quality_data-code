This is WONDERFUL! Once my baby hit about 3 months, he needed something to keep him occupied in the car/stroller. This was much less expensive than some other similar type things I've seen, so I gave it a shot. He's 11 months now, and this thing still keeps him entertained in the car. He loves pushing the doggy's nose to hear music, moving the parts around, and hearing the fish rattle. I like that it has the soft, elastic bands on the side to allow it to fit with different devices, to have some give when pulled and yanked by baby, and to slide pretty easily up the handle to get baby in the car seat without having to remove it.
