This is such a beautiful product. I used it for my son when he was born and it was soo beautiful. The music was perfect and the crib just appropriate. It also has wheels so it can be wheeled around. Overall, it's a beautiful product for someone who needs something affordable. I did find though that the padding in the crib is quite thin. Had to line it with a thicker blanket.
