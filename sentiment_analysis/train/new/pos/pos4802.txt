Purchased this as a lightweight backup stroller for the sole purpose of accomodating my 6ft+ height and yard long stride.  Handlebars are fairly comfortable, but a little to low for anybody over 5'11", and I kept kicking the back of it when I walked quickly.  Rolls and steers very easily, and the locking front wheels are good for off camber and uneven surfaces.  Seat back angle is easily adjustable and the storage basket is adaquate, if not slightly difficult to get to.  It takes practice to fold and unfold it, hence the one star deduction.Good lightweight utility stroller for taller moms or medium sized dads.
