A necessity for the Deuter jud carrier, this sun shade is easy to install when needed (though a little tricky to store when not in use). Our little man doesn't love keeping his hat on, but we don't have to worry about it or fight him with the shade on. It provides plenty of coverage without sacrificing breathability. It also comes with a packable rain cover, though it only covers the top half of your rider. If substantial rain is in the forecast, I'd recommend the full kid/pack cover.
