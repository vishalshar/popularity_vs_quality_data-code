I was looking for a baby gift for a friend who loves turtles and was having a girl.  I spotted the Tillie the Turtle bath set and thought it would be perfect.  The only doubt I had was how soft it would be since I am fussy about towels being soft.  I was not disappointed!  The towel set was embroiderd beautifully and was very soft. It came in the cutest gift box that can be used for storing other things after the towel set has been removed. The slippers would not be used until the child was older, but just the sweetest addition to the set!  I would definitely recommend Tillie the Turtle Bath Time Gift Set to anyone looking for a cute and functional gift.
