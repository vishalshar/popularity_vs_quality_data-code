Loved this organizer! Takes up a small footprint on the counter and I was able to keep all my daughters food sorted and organized. As she got older and had more of a selection, I P-touched the rows to state breakfast, lunch, dinner, fruits, and veggies. It was helpful when I had someone else watching her as they would know what to feed her.  It was also helpful at a quick glance to know exactly what I was low on and needed to replenish.  Would definitely buy and recommend to a friend. I used this for Earth's Best Baby Food and all stages fit well.
