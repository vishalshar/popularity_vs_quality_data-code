Flushable diaper liners are seriously a God-send for me.  I spent months trying different ways of getting solid food poop out of my kid's diapers, and I hated every method.  Sprayers, dunk & swish, "poop-ulas" -- yuck.  I hated them all!  Then I decided to try these.  Boy, am I glad I did!I was originally against using these since part of the reason I cloth diaper is to reduce the amount of non-organic waste we produce (I wish cloth diapers could reduce the amount of, ahem, other waste we output, but, alas, they have not had such an impact) so it seemed counter-productive to add a disposable element to our diapers.But I think I've found a good compromise that both makes poop less gross to deal with and minimizes what we throw away. I use the OsoCozy Liners and the Bummis Flushable Diaper Liners.  When I know I can expect a poop out of kiddo I use OsoCozy since they seem to break down pretty easily in the toilet.  For the rest of the diaper changes when a poop is unlikely (but almost guaranteed if I don't use a liner), I use the Bummis liners.  They can be machine washed and dried, and reused a few times.  If the OsoCozy liners are involved in a #1 only diaper, they have to go in the trash because they break down in the washing machine, leaving many bits of liner and lint everywhere.The reason that I don't use Bummis liners 100% of the time is because I worry that they don't break down very well in the plumbing.  Hell, if they can survive the heavy duty cycle in my washing machine they could probably survive just about anything! I don't mind flushing a Bummis liner on occasion, but I worry that regular flushing of the Bummis liners could cause plumbing issues.  Most of my Bummis liners get thrown away in the regular trash after a few washes.
