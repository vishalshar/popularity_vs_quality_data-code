Seriously, this is diaper bag number 4 for us - we have been using it constantly (even overstuffing it) for about 3 months now. The first two were way too small - the third fell apart after 3 weeks of continued use - this one (minus a few dirty spots) still works like it was bought yesterday!It has a compartment for everything, more than enough space for the helicopter mom (me), and the design is good for my husband to carry around without feeling silly (because he already has a pink giggly girl on his hip at all times) :3 Nothing has frayed or broken at this time, and it is pretty easy to wipe down when it gets dirty though the only place that really shows any dirt is the lighter designed area on the upper half. Repels water - dropped it in a puddle last week and everything inside stayed dry. I was surprised - did not know it was waterproof too :)
