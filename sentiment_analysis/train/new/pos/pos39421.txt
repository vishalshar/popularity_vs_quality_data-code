My wife, kids, and I are extremely satisfied with these dishes. They are much thicker than most stainless steel items. I was surprised with the durability. They're solid. We are also conscious of BPA, Phthalates, and other long term dangers of plastics so we like this safe option. We have purchased many BPA free plastic dishes which we do not put in the dishwasher so it makes for more handwashing. Wish I could go back and buy this before the plastic junk. This item seems expensive, but if you consider that it will never need replaced, it may be more cost effective than you think (cheaper than replacing plastic junk 5 times).Pros:Safe / not a health risk (unlike plastic)Extremely durable / high qualityGreat for putting in the dishwasherattractiveitems stack wellgood size for childrenCons:Expensive (again unless you consider that this will never need replaced.)It is pretty rare that I'm completely satisfied with an item. There isn't anything that I do not like about these dishes. It is expensive, but still a great value since the quality is so high. I would definitely recommend buying this dish set. Maybe buy 5 of them :-)
