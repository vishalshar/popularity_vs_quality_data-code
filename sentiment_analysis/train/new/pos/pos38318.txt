We use this product everyday and it has been great on my baby's bum. We use to use baby wipes to clean after every pee or poo but my baby started developing a rash even though the wipes were chemical free. We would apply diaper rash cream but the rash constantly came back. I then researched for a product to make my own wipes and came across this product. This product has been a lifesaver! After using this my baby has been rash free. I make my own solution with aloe, calendula and olive oil with a bit of tea tree oil to prevent baby's rash and it has been working great. The towels that came with the product are also very soft but I have found another brand that is a bit better with bigger towels and even softer material. We have recommended this product to all our friends!
