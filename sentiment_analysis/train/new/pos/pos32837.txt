I saw this lamp months before I ordered it.  I really wanted it for my baby's room but after seeing the measurements and cost, I kept thinking it would be a very small lamp.I never took the time to get out the measuring tape and stop assuming.  You know what they say about assuming...  Well, finally after shopping for another lamp in every store known to Kansas City, and never being able to satisfy my desire for a sailboat lamp, I finally caved in and ordered this one.I was extremely pleasantly surprised.  It's quite large and absolutely gorgeous.  Every color is true to the photo and the lamp shade is gingham style.  It's lovely, adorable and perfect.  The sailboats are thick and the only issue is with the one in the front, it's a little loose, but nothing a pinch of superglue wouldn't fix.  I would say this is a 5 star order and I would buy it again and again.  It's perfect and I LOVE it!!I never have had any issues with the lighting being too low, this would all depend on the type of light bulb you are using.  After several months of owning this lamp, I would not change a thing about it.  It's absolutely perfect and I'm a perfectionist.  I can't find one complaint whatsoever.  I love it very much and it looks gorgeous.
