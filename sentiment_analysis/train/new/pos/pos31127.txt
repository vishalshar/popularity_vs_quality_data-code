Exactly what I needed. We keep this in the truck since we are always on the go with older kids sports. It keeps the baby in place and has plenty of room. Has survived the diaper blow-outs like a champ! Surface is easily wipeable so the big messes are no big deal. The convenience of having a sturdy & sanitary changing table right in the vehicle has definitely made our outings a little less stressful... which is a huge plus with a new baby. I'll be buying one of these for baby shower gifts from now on.
