We are out of the toddler era at our home, but my children were using many cups a day and tossing them to be washed after a swig of water or milk, so I got these. They are 9oz, which is a great size and they come in various colors (so I assigned one color to each child so they can keep one cup all day). These are constructed very well, very sturdy, and the images that are in the cups help give a grip to the cup. Very happy with these cups...wish they made a grown up version in such high quality plastic.
