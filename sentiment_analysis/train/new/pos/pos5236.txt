I use this in my bedroom along with the matching storage boxes for my custom closet.  I bought these for the colors that match the room's color scheme.  The hamper works fine as a hamper although I do prefer something more rigid so the lid would actually be more useful.  As it fills up the sides warp out so the lid isn't much use.  And the silly cat thinks its one of her play boxes 8-))  But I really do like the colors and it's an attractive solution for my purpose.
