This is a great product, especially for the price. We bought it before our daughter was born and used it in our bedroom next to our bed. Assembly was pretty easy, the wheels took a little pounding to get in place. It's very sturdy compared to the cheaper bassinets made with (basically) pvc pipe. We used it until our daughter was four and a half months old. We were sad when she finally grew too big for it because it was such a nice bed!
