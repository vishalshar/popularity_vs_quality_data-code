My son with 9 teeth FINALLY bit through his first spout the other day.. I admit to not replacing them after a good 8 months or so of use, but they held up well that whole time with daily use, even in the dishwasher (although we don't use heated dry when the children's items are in the dish washer). You will always get wear and tear on any silicone, so this is not a question of poor durability.. I'm actually quite pleased they lasted so long with all the biting my son does... my daughter still hasn't chewed through any (6 teeth), but she tends to be much more gentle. These also fit all the NUK bottles we had (but my twins would only use Dr. Brown bottles because they had GERD so bad) but never used.. Now NUK is the only sippy cup they will actually drink milk out of. We invested in all sorts of NUK sippy cups and so far they ALL work with this spout- which is great news for us! :) Would highly recommend these spouts (as well as their sippy cups).
