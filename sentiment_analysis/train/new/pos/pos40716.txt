Extremely happy with our decision to get this valance as well as the matching crib set. I didn't realize from the pictures online that the green part along the top and elephant's ear is a corduroy material, and the white elephant is a soft fuzzy material. The different textures really add something special, and overall it seems to be great quality. My only complaint is that you can't order it in different sizes - this one is just 12 inches too short for our nursery window!
