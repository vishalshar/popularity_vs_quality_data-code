This diaper bag is the best one I have ever had!!! It is stylish and comfortable to carry like having a fleece pillow on your shoulder and has so may options you will probably never use them all. Their is alot of room for those all day trips with multiple children in diapers with room for snacks and extra outfits.It has a built in changing mat and the inside is lined and is very easy to clean. It is so nice looking you will want to keep it that way.
