I started purchasing Wubbanubs when my son was a newborn. The normal soothie pacifier that the animal is attached to is exactly what was given to him in the NICU. Once we got home with him I was constantly trying to find binkies. I'd drop it and the thing would bounce all over the place. I could never find one when he needed it and searching for that little binky in the middle of the night was not fun! I heard about the Wubbanubs and bought one. My son is now 2 and we still use these! I've had just about every animal possible. He has never used a teething toy as he just uses his binky to chew on. It can be frustrating because when he chews on the nipples he puts holes in them. So I'm constantly buying a few of these every several months. They are easily washed. I just toss them in the wash machine with his favorite blankies. My son has dragged these through sandboxes, mud puddles, bath tubs, and everything else you can imagine! I've never had an animal fall off the binky. These are life savers to us! I now buy one of these for every baby shower I attend :)
