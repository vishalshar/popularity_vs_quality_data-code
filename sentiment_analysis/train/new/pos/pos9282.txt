This product isn't amazing, but it's worthwhile.I struggled to find something to use on the City Mini Double.  I kept coming across reviews for this.  It doesn't fit the city mini perfectly, but it works adequately.  It's a nice addition to the stroller so that we now have drink holders and a pocket to store keys, wallet, phone, or the like.  I don't know of a better product available for the city mini double, so I would buy this product again.
