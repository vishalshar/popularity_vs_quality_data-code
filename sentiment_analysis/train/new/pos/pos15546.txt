It's not expensive, that's the point. It's not cheap either. Padding is thick and comfortable exactly where you need it. Gliding mechanism is smooth and has a nice range of motion.It's hard buying things sight unseen but it's equivalent to the Dutalier one's they sell for $600 at the other places that have a brick and mortar storefront that you have to wait for 8-12 weeks to get (baby is here by then dummies!) Craftsman from the old country don't need to make these things, it just needs to glide well and be super comfortable for mom and baby for a few years, this does that perfectly.Very easy to put together, 8 ikea style screws and you are gliding away into bliss town.It doesn't recline and it doesn't make pancakes or waffles or save you money on car insurance but it's a glider. It glides well, it looks nice, the padding is great and it's comfortable, and it's under $200 for both the glider and the ottoman. Will last through the next few kids and that's all that these things are needed for.
