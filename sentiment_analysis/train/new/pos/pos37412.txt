I want to start by saying my daughter is not quite old enough to try and grab handles yet, but we wanted to get used to them and prepare early.I bought the pack of 12 and was really happy with the quality of these. The holes are big enough to grip the handle with, without being so big that it's unusual. They're easy to install, but aren't too easy to take off. I have to use both hands to unclip them, so I can't see my daughter being able to pry them off any time in the near future. Also, the glow in the dark feature is awesome. I didn't even realize they had that feature until I installed them and saw it later that night.My only complaint is that they're a bit bulky. I have smaller hands and have little bit of trouble grasping the handle through the holes since my fingers just barely reach.
