Bought for our son's nursery. Liked this set because it didn't come with the bumper and from what I've read, bumpers aren't supposed to be used in cribs anymore due to SIDS concerns. We actually hung the quilt above the changing table as a focus piece in the room and centered all the colors around those in the quilt.
