This stroller is a really good deal, and it is AWESOME for tall people, but it could use a couple of small improvements.PROS:1. The handles are great for tall people and easy to switch for partners of different heights.2.  Super basic and narrow design.  It easily glides through aisles in stores and is super compact when folded.3.  The price!CONS:1.  There is really no storage, which is fine because it keeps the stroller lightweight and basic.  However, if you add a velcro cup holder or organizer to the back handles, it flips over if the kid is not in it, even with just a set of keys and a coffee travel mug.  There should be some sort of weight to the front wheels- although that would make the stroller heavier.2.  This is a good stroller for kids up to maybe 2 or 2 1/2 years of age.  My just barely 3 year old nephew is a skinny kid, and he hardly squeezes in.  It is a narrow stroller with a great compact design, it's just better for smaller kids.3.  No shoulder straps/harness.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and my back is singing with joy.
