I bought this for our baby and she loves it. It's a terrycloth texture, but still soft. She likes to gnaw on the blue parts. We call him Flat Cat and he's become a regular part of her bedtime routine, so much that we bought a second for the babysitter's house.Your flat cat will not look exactly as pictured. Both of mine had slightly different variations on the facial stitching (regarding placement, such as a slightly longer face etc.). I find it gives them character and this isn't a con for me.Flat cat is also very easy to wash between uses.When I first got him, I kept him in my bra to give him a familiar smell since we were using him as a comfort object. I think it worked because she took to him right away. Now all we have to do is lay her down with flat cat and she instinctively grabs him and tucks him under her arm. IT'S SO ADORABLE.
