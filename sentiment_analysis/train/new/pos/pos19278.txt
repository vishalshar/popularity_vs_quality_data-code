We love this diaper warmer. 1. fits perfectly in our small changing station. 2. it's winter, so our little guy loves the warm wipes and doesn't mind diaper changes as much as he used to.the only challenge is finding the best wipes that come out the easiest.after reading other reviews, I was worried about wipes drying out, but we haven't had any issues with the wipes drying out.
