Rockabye Sheldon the Turtle Rocker is adorable. This was a Christmas gift for our granddaughter. She just loves it. You can't get her off of the rocker. Now my one year old grandson is riding it. This will be handed down since it is fun to ride and made so well. It's nice for the smaller ones since the back keeps them in and secure.
