First, I read a few reviews that said that it didn't work very well.  I have not found that to be correct. Maybe I have an updated version, or maybe the user that couldn't get it to work installed it wrong.  Either way, mine works really well.One other thing to point out is that baby jogger has designed it really well.  Once you put it on, you don't have to take it off if it is a drizzle and stop sort of day. The Rain canopy can be rolled up and latched out of the way just like the screen can. Oh, and the screen can stay on when you put the rain canopy on.
