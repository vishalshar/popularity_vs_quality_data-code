I bought this for my one-year-old's daycare lunches and snacks and am very pleased with it. I put his morning and afternoon snacks in each side of the divided top compartment and his lunch in the undivided bottom compartment. While I haven't given him anything that involved a significant amount of liquid, I have given him fruit from a fruit cup that I did not drain well at all and it did not leak.As for size, I think it is perfect for him and would likely even be big enough for my own lunch if I used all of the compartments.Overall, I love it and will happily buy more if I get tired of washing the one I have every night.
