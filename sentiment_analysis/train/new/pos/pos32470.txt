The music box for this mobile was not working when I received it. This was disappointing to me, especially since I hate to bother with mail returns. However, when I contacted the seller with my complaint, I received an email reply within half an hour or less. They offered to replace the music box for me, and with no questions or hassle, informed me that it would be sent out the following day. I didn't have to bother with shipping the faulty product back first in order to "prove" that it didn't work. Besides the music box, I am happy with the product. It's cute and easy to assemble. This kind of customer service is enough to make me want to keep this company in mind when considering future purchases.
