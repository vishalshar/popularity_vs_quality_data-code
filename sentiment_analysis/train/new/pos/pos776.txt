As my daughter has grown, it has been increasingly difficult to find a bib/art smock that will appropriately fit her. Sure there are some out there marketed as "Art Smocks" but they are either entirely too expensive (for what they are) or are made of cheap materials that aren't likely to withstand one washing cycle (and I don't know about you, but I REALLY don't want to have to hand wash a bib/smock).This fits the bill, exactly. Made of pliable material, with good quality craftsmanship, it is sure to last us for the next year or two. Can be used, for whatever purpose - easily wiped off and re-used - or thrown in the normal wash cycle for cleaning. Good deal!
