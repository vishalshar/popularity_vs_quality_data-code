I've had the BEABA Babycook Pro for about 2 months now. I use it usually 1-2 times/week. Before I purchased the BEABA, I had the Baby Brezza for a few months so I've got a bit of experience with another baby food maker and I'm going to do a compare/contrast here.The BEABA feels much sturdier than the Brezza, especially the bowl part (my Brezza bowl cracked within 2 weeks and I had to return and get a new one). Seems to just have a higher quality make.The BEABA can make much bigger batches than the Brezza and it's also much easier to make multiple batches one right after the other with the BEABA than it was with the Brezza.The BEABA blends food MUCH better than the Brezza did. With the Brezza, no matter how much I steamed and blended, green beans just ended up being really chunky. The BEABA has no problem blending things like that up really smooth.I have not noticed any build up of minerals or anything else in the steam tank (yet) with the BEABA, but I did within a couple weeks with the Brezza.The Brezza steamed and blended all in one, but I actually like the fact with the BEABA that you have to stop after the steam cycle to dump the food out of the steam basket into the bowl to blend it, because that allows me to regulate the amount of water in the final blended product. I actually hardly ever used the "steam/blend" feature with the Brezza because I usually stopped the cycle after the steaming to dump out water anyway!I worried before buying the BEABA that it would be harder to figure out steam times since it's based off of what level of water you add and not how long you set the timer for (as it is with the Brezza), but that hasn't been a hassle at all. And because the BEABA just steams until all of the water in the steam chamber is used up, there's no worry about dumping out excess water from the steam tank once you're finished as there is with the Brezza.--In conclusion, despite the fact that the Brezza steamed and blended all in one, for my needs, I actually prefer the BEABA. They're both good products, but I believe the practicality and quality of the BEABA is better than the Brezza.
