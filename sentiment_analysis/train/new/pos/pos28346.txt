I like the convenience of this spoon. I can easily pour baby food inside and take the whole thing with me when I go out without worrying about needing a spoon and a jar of food, no worries about the plastic gerber containers opening and spilling, or fumbling to find everything to feed a hungry and cranky babe. The only downfalls are that its hard to clean the small hole that the food pours onto the spoon and that the spoon's civet is pretty deep so my younger babe that has no top teeth yet doesn't get the whole spoonful as some staying in the spoon. Otherwise I love it.
