I'm a huge fan of Lamaze toys because they offer great sensory stimulation. They are safe, colorful, textured and make great sounds. They're also very cute! My baby girl has been enjoying this fish since she was 3 months old. She is now 10 months and always makes "fish sounds" with her mouth when she wants to hold her fish. We have a few of them that we've hung on her stroller and car seat. I like its size, because you can toss it into your purse or diaper bag without adding bulk or weight...and of course, it just makes her so happy.The only negative experience I've had has been when I purchased from "Buy 4 Less UK". Do not buy from them, even if the price is less than the regular price. I ordered 3 more fish and they sent only 1. When I contacted them, they said they would send the 2 missing ones. Nothing came. I contacted them again, and they asked if I wanted to cancel my order (I'm thinking now I should have). I told them I wanted my missing 2 fish. They sent me 1. Now I've had to contact them once again asking for the last one. I'm still waiting...and I've been waiting for 2 months now. Make sure to purchase from Amazon, not a third party seller.
