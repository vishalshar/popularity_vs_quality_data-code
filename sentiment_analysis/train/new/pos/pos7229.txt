Really nice....my son is 5 and this is perfect....I've bought ones from Walmart and the seat are just too hard...this has great padding and has good length and width....Goin to buy  another one for my older son he's fairly large so this is going to be perfect...because of his weight some of the booster seats were very uncomfortable....I would definitely recommend
