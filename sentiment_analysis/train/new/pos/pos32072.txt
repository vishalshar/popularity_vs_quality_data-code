Flensted is tops when it comes to mobiles and Breeze is right up there at the top of the top. Imaginative and cheerful, Breeze moves gracefully at the slightest puff of air turning to show off its many beautiful aspects. I am always puzzled when mobiles, even modern ones such as this, are advertised for a baby's room. Please don't give babies all the fun; Breeze is a real eyecatcher in any room in the house. The mobile comes fully assembled and thank you, Flensted, for including a handful of additional plastic strips in red, blue, green and yellow so that the recipient easily can alter the color scheme a bit. I changed a few of the black strips to red and yellow and now Breeze is the perfect accent in my living room - so much design value at such a nice price.
