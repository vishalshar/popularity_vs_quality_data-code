I loved that these were adjustable and will last a while. And although my little one can get is off (he is 11 months) it takes him a moment to figure it out and therefore a moment for me to stop him, whereas the old Velcro ones were off in a flash! They seem comfortable for him due to the adjust ability and their shape. Best of all they do an excellent job at catching the food - they sit just in the right spot on him to catch the dropped pieces, which he loves going back for after, and they clean up really well with just a wipe. Even the yellow one came out clean after some pasta a red sauce with a quick run around the dishwasher on the top shelf.
