Everyone always told us that a glider was a must have for parents. They are right. It's great for putting our baby to sleep and to feed her. What they did not tell us is the amount of time we would spend rocking our daughter on the glider. This is a great glider for those trying to save money (me). We put an additional pillow for the back and bum. Other than that this glider has done great! I love the fact that it wasn't extremely expensive.
