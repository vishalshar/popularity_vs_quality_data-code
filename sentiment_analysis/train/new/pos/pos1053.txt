LOVE LOVE LOVE these BIBS!!! So Soft, yet soo soo protective. They are huge, but the baby can move his arms freely. They aren't stiff and allow the baby to feed himself easily! They protect clothes so well. They have good expansion to grow with baby. They fit my twins at about 6 months just fine! Will be using these for years to come! Good coverage and the pocket "stays open" so well-it catches all the drips and crumbs perfectly! I bought about 10! You really only need about 2-they wipe clean so well- we just wipe with a rag, or throw in the dish water and air dry. You WON't be disappointed!! Only downside is the price- but when you factor in not using 3 and 4 bibs a day and time doing laundry-totally worth it! UPDATE: I have been using these for 7 months now. Once of the slits that you enter buttons on, did start tearing. Through communication with the company- I realized that I was only using the first hooks on both my twins (they are premature-so they haven't grown too much into them)- then I was drying them on a hook, using the same button. Probably wore it out-being pulled on the hook for 24/7. I contacted the company..they were swift to send replacements. I would purchase these again, esp due to the customer satisfaction issue that they take seriously. Will be purchasing more for my niece! I would recommend not hanging them with the hook that is used often.
