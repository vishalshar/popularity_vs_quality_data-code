Super cute my youngest daughter who just turned two loves it. It is on the smaller side but it allows me to leave the big diaper bag in the car on outings and just carry a few essentials into the store or restaurant. It's big enough for a diaper, small pack of wipes, and a couple of small toys. (By small toys I mean a couple of those connector rings and one of those 2in square soft books.)  I personally like how small it is because I can leave it in the regular diaper bag so whenever we go out I know I have it.I had to let the shoulder straps almost all the way out and I had to let the strap all the out for the front buckle so I don't know how long it she will be able to use it but for the price I think it is worth it.
