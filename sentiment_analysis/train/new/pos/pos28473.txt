We orinally had a wubinub pacifier and my husband accidentally picked up the dr browns lovey. BEST mistake he could have made. We love that the pacifier is off center as we use these for our twins and propping that pacifier is crucial to us sleeping. Now that the twins are teething; we have attached this teether to the other side of the dr browns lovey and it's a G-d send as we now ALWAYS have a teether as we don't leave a room without the lovey. Also, I notice that we don't drop the pacifier/teether on the floor half as often because the lovey is larger and easy to catch. Bottom line, 3+ months this teether is crucial.
