These caps are great.  They turn a bottle into a sippy cup.  When my 20 month old asks for a bottle, I give her one, with a sippy cap on it.  Most of the time she will take it, whereas any other kind of sippy cup offered often gets thrown to the floor in a fit of rage.  I have an assortment of bpa free plastic bottles and Evenflo glass bottles.  These caps will not fit every brand of bottle, and they work best without the valve, although then they are not spill proof.These caps DO fit: 9 oz Parents Choice, 4 oz Ameda (from my breast pump), 9 oz Fisher Price, the 2 oz. bottles that came in the Similac formula sample box that my doctor's office gave me.These sippy caps DO NOT fit: Evenflo glass or plastic, 5 oz Gerber, 5 oz Parents Choice
