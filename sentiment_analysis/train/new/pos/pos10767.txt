I'd like to mention that this clock is totally silent.  It's not something I had thought about when looking for a clock for my nephew's room, as the kid sleeps like he's in a coma.  But I thought I'd mention it for other people's benefit, in case anyone is worried.  I've got several other battery operated clocks of this nature and the seconds hand can wake the dead.The one thing I found a little disconcerting about the clock is that it has no glass nor plastic face over it, so the arms are right there and touchable.  They could very easily get bend or broken off.  If you're going to hang it on a wall, as it is meant, this is probably not an issue, other than perhaps dusting.  But if you were buying this clock to be used in a plate display stand, to get a desktop clock, I'd put it in a place that doesn't have a lot of counter top traffic, so the arms don't get bent.
