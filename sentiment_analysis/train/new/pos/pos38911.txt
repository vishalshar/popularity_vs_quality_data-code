I had suggested to my son that it might be a good idea to have the potty in the bathroom early just so that my grandson would be familiar with it.No sooner was it out of the box when he tried to sit on it - diaper on.  Next was trying to lift the seat which comes up sideways and not with a rear hinge. I'm wondering why that choice in design - unless it is to prevent tip-over while emptying and cleaning it. Once he lifted the seat (not the lid), it tipped over. At that point his father put it in the bathroom. (yes, there was a video)My grandson did use it once at 15 months and apparently again at 17.5 months so having it as a regular fixture in the bathroom might be an encouragement.My guess is that it will take a little more time but I'm all for buying one early and trying a no-pressure, no-frills approach to potty training. If that doesn't work, there are other bells and whistles methods for later.I am considering ordering the urinal type just in case he thinks he has to emulate Daddy soon.
