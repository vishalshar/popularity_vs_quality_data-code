I have the Fisher Price Deluxe Diaper Changer and I love it except I always find soaked items from my Lansinoh Clean & Condition Cloths, 80 Count Value Pack (Pack of 6). The changer folds up so it squishes the moisture out of the pack and all the plastic cases like this one just leak and barely hold any wipes. This case holds plenty of wipes and never leaks. It fits perfectly in the Fisher Price Deluxe Diaper Changer.
