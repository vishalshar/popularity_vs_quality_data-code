What's the difference between this Fisher Price Yellow & Orange booster seat versus the Blue & Green one? Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat - BlueAs you can see from the pictures (but not from the product description), this less expensive Yellow and Orange version does not have the following two features:1. an extra adjustable base to raise/lower the seat; and2. the tray insert and cover.We have both this Yellow/Orange one and the Blue/Green one and find that the extra features are not really necessary.  Our kid actually uses the tray insert and cover as a toy.For a 10 month old, we have the adjustable base at the highest setting on the Blue/Green one.  With no additional base, she sits lower on the Yellow/Orange one, but we don't really find it to be an issue.Otherwise, like others, we really like this product.  Better than a highchair in my opinion, because you can easily wash the whole thing down when needed.  And good to take to restaurants too.
