My wife and I are incredibly happy with this crib. We are first time parents, and my wife is in her 3rd trimester, so we were skeptical to order a crib that we can't feel.This crib is sturdier than most we felt at Babies R Us! We love the design, and the espresso color is beautiful.I put the crib together in about an hour total (including getting everything out of the box and organized/clearing for space in the nursery). The instructions were easy to follow, and the parts were simple to put together.Someone wrote in a review that the only non-solid part of this crib was the plywood mattress holder. But I guess Storkcraft updated this, because now it has a heavy-duty metal mattress holder.We are very impressed overall. I'll update once baby comes to see how it holds up.
