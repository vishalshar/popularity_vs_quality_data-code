A very interesting option.  The bottle is soft silicone.  It holds its shape, but is squeezable.  It takes a wide nipple; I am using the Avent nipples.  So far I like this bottle a lot.While I am not satisfied that even BPA-free plastic is without (as yet undiscovered) risks, I am satisfied that silicone is safe.  And I feel comfortable putting silicone in the dishwasher, which I will not do with plastic.I considered a stainless steel bottle, but I like to be able to see the bottle contents, so I kept looking, and found this.The assembly is slightly more complicated than some bottles, because there is a firm plastic piece that fits over the top of the silicone bottle, to give the collar something to screw onto.  But I am not finding the assembly difficult at all. It hasn't leaked yet (which is a problem with the Avent bottles) and my infant son seems fine with this bottle.Update: We have used this bottle for two and a half months now.  I ordered another one of these.  And I tried the Prince Lionheart silicone bottles, which as far as I can tell are exactly the same thing in other colors.  I have had no leakage problems whatsoever with these bottles.  I have now cleared out my extensive collection of Avent bottles and will use this type exclusively.
