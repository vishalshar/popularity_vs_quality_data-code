I'm a believer that they work. My son had a tough time with all of his teeth. I noticed a difference after I put this on him. I bought 2 bracelets and 1 necklace. The bracelets are different sizes. That is expected the amber are different sizes. At first the bracelets were to big for his wrist I would put it on his ankle. (to small for ankle at 16 months)  now  he wont keep it on he can slide it off his wrist. so I have been using the necklace.
