We needed a way to easily travel with our Graco Play Yard to Ireland.  This little bag did the job perfectly.  After flying to and from Ireland as a checked bag, being transported to three different hotels, and an additional trip to NH this bag is like new.  There is no wear and tear on the bag, it looks great and is still very much in one piece.  As others have said there is lots of room in the bag for more than just the playyard.  On our way to Ireland I put the playyard in, all our toiletries, a fleece baby blanket, a stuffed animal, and a sleepsack and all fit no problem.  The front pocket is perfect for books.  The only way this bag could be better would be if it were easier to roll.  You have to be careful rolling it because it is so long it often tips over to one side and falls off the wheels. I would definitely buy this bag again.  Also it fit within Delta Airline's checked baggage sizes.
