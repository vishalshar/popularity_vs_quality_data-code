I do not understand why so many people dislike this pump!  I went through two others before I came to this one and now it is the only one I use.  My son is now 5 months old.  I have been working and pumping since he was 2 months old.  I discovered that this manual pump produced the most milk in the least amount of time when combined with compressions.I will add that I have rather large breasts and nipples and other pumps were just not a good fit, but this one was perfect for me!
