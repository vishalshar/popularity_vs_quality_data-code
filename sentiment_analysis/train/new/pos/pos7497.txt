Best bottles on the market! Wish I had started using them sooner! It was between these and Dr. Brown's since they both fit my Medela breast pump. I chose Dr. Brown's in the beginning because of the ad for decreasing air and fussiness. I saw no difference in my little one when I switched, just really happy about not having to clean as many parts and NO leaks!! Dr. Brown's bottles were leaking something fierce, which was frustrating not only because it made a mess but also because a breastfeeding working mom HATES to see breastmilk wasted! I'm sure all mom's do for that matter, formula is expensive!
