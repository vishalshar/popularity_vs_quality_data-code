While this bedding looks adorable online, it isn't quite as great in person.  After washing it for the first time, everything came out very wrinkley.  I had to iron everything.  Also, there was a lot of lint which stuck to it.  Perhaps I shouldn't have washed the diaper stacker, but threw it in with everything else at the same time.  I think that is where the stuffing came from that was all over the place.  It looks ok now that I have ironed and de-linted everything.  The comforter is pretty thin, but I guess you really aren't supposed to use those on small babies anyway.  I'm not totally disappointed, but my expectations were not quite met.
