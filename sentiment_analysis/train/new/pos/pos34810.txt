I use this to microwave cut up fruit and veggies in small amounts.  It takes about 3 to 4 minutes in the microwave.  Is perfect to soften a cut up apple or  pear so baby can have fresh made finger foods.  And I continue to use it with my 3 y/o for smaller amounts of frozen veggies, when he is not eating what we are eating or for lunch, or for  bag lunch.  I have 2 because I use this so much, and always buy for friends.
