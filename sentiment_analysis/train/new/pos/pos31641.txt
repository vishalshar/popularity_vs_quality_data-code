I bought this sterilizer because it was significantly cheaper than the Avent brand, and should do the same job. I've used the Avent one many years ago, but am now using Dr Brown's bottles and worried that they wouldn't fit.I've been using the new sterilizer for a month now and am very happy with it. In response to previous reviewers' concerns:* Yes, there is a brown scum sometimes builds up, but like all appliances, it should be cleaned regularly and I think it says more about the quality of the water than the unit...I use boiled water to minimize build up.* The 8oz Dr Brown's bottle WILL fit with a little ingenuity. I don't use the top level but balance the teats etc on the bottle divider instead, and place the straws upside down in the middle bottle holder, caps on the lowest level. I sterilize less bottles so all the other bits & pieces will fit in - usually just do 4 bottles at a time.
