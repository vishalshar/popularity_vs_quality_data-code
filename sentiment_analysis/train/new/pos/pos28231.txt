I love all my Boppy slip covers! They all feel great and look great even after all the spit up we have had on them. After many washes the covers still looks like new! These are the best indeed. I also use the pillow for tummy time and the twins love that..My advice for any mum is buy the boppy pillow and any of the slip covers that you like. They are all great. I know as I have 5 different slip covers:)
