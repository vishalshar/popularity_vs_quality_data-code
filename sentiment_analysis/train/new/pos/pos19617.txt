I love this gate! I initially questioned if it was going to be a pain to put up and take down but it's not. I use it to keep my dogs in my bedroom at night without being crated. It's a wonderfully sturdy, well-made product that I have no doubt will hold up over time. I like that it's all metal and the thing that tightens it to the wall is easy to use and manipulate. Sometimes my 4-year-old crawls over it to come get in bed with me in the middle of the night, too, and I don't worry that he'll break the gate or that the gate will fall down. (We actually got this one to replace a wooden one that broke from him climbing over it!) Great product, great price, would certainly buy again.
