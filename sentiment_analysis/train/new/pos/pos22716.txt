OK so these aren't the greatest, most fashionable looking covers in the world. But they work excellently. I bought three as I had a coffee table and two end tables that were metal with tile tops. The corners were pretty harsh as well as all of the edges. I was so afraid our son was going to bash his head when he was learning to walk. The one for the coffee table fit perfectly. The ones for the end tables I had to gather up in the back and hold together with a wound up rubber band. He could pull the bumpers away slightly but he would always let go. Thankfully he never tried to chew on them. They never lost elasticity or fell off and they never ripped. I did wipe them down once a week to keep them dust free.
