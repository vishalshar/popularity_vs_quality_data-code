I would rather have a plastic chain link versus this cloth strap, but it works just fine.The cloth strap needs to be washed everyday otherwise it will smell. I am big on smells and prefer a plastic chain, but I cannot find one. So this one will do. It stays clasped to his clothes for the most part. I removed the penguin guy and wrap the strap into the soothie pacifier. The little character device does NOT hold the pacifer at all. Just make the adjustment and it is all good.
