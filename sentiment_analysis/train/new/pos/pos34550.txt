I research car seats extensively. I have four kids and only want the safest stuff for them, not the most expensive, but the car seats that will protect them the most. This one was highly rated by Consumer reports, whom I trust, with their testing and the price is reasonable. In fact, it was the only one with an EXCELLENT rating for protection. That made it a no-brainer for me. It is very nice easthetically too and will look great in your car installed.
