I don't believe there is one thing you can buy to soothe a baby a of the time. A baby cries for many reasons. If he's hungry or over-tired, no machine will work. But I have found that this works best after a bottle or after waking up from a nap. If I put him in this while he's in a calm state, he will stay in calm while in it. Some times he will take a cat nap in it. He loves the car, keys, and mirror. He usually stays in this seat for around 45 minutes. This is a lifesaver if I need to get chores done or eat a meal in peace. My husband and I usually put our baby in this while we eat dinner. The design is nice. He is sitting up right and is able to enjoy it with or without the toys. The music is nice and definitely loud enough. You can make it play loudly or softly. The only cons about this are the fact that it uses batteries and the music doesn't last as long as the movement. We are using good batteries and we haven't had to replace them. We have had it for about a month and use it almost every day.
