I gave my son the dinosaur lovie when he was three and a half months old, he is now eight months old and just as in love if not more. He sleeps with it every night and during nap time as well. I will throw it on the floor with him while he is playing and he will choose the blankie over the rest of his toys every time. Now that teething is in full force, this little guy gets a lot of chewing. It has honestly been a life saver on his worst days. He will wake up in the morning and play with him in his crib allowing me and extra twenty minutes or so of sleep. They wash really well too. Dozens of times through the wash and come out looking brand new every time. We love this blanket!!! Grandma has one, there are a couple in the diaper bag and about six at home. We lost one at a family holiday get together so I make sure we have plenty, especially of the dinosaur since that seems to be the favorite. I buy every expecting friend an angel dear lovie for their baby and everyone loves them! Fantastic product.
