*** See my update below the original review for what happened! ***I didn't have the problems other reviewers had with installation, but I didn't have to use the extensions. The install was fairly simple (though the wordless instructions are pretty difficult to parse/follow, like others have noted, because they're not only wordless but laid out really confusingly), and I used a level to make sure everything was kosher.Then I tried to close the gate.Unfortunately, the pressure mount system on this gate leaves something to be desired. The bottom bar bows slightly under the pressure, enough to make the door stick on the bottom open edge pretty badly when it's all plumb. I've opened/closed the gate perhaps 10 times at this point, and the powder coating on the steel and the finish on the wood are both scraping off already.When loosened enough that it doesn't stick, the door is almost ineffective. There's no way to modify the vertical placement of the gate, either, so I'm quite literally stuck with it.I've contacted Munchkin to see if they've got a solution, but if not then I'll have to return this lovely gate to Amazon.***UPDATE:***I contacted Munchkin, and they were super. Within 24 hours I had a rep telling me that the stickiness wasn't normal, and asking me to send a photo of the gate as well as the serial number. They immediately shipped me a new gate, and I didn't even have to return the old one. Now we use the sticky one on a less-used doorway, and the perfectly functioning one on the main thoroughfare. Excellent customer service, and I'm very happy with this and would recommend to anyone. We get lots of compliments on them!
