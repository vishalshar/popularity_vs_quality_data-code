I used to work in a frame and art gallery, so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this & saw the quality. The frame is sturdy and the mat well cut, although it is not acid free.The labels & faux photos are all on the same paper, but that doesn't matter. To display a photo, the best way is to actually tape from the top only (so gravity can do its job) to the back of the mat. I just set the paper insert aside until I had my photos lined up and secured & then lined up the label wording and put the frame backing together.We gave this to my parents (the grandma one and the grandpa one) to let them know about their first grandchild! The ultrasound photo will be swapped for a photo of them holding baby once s/he arrives.They loved it & I would order again! We actually used 4 different frames from this same company for our pregnancy reveals.
