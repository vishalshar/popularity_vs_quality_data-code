I used the Born Free cup as the first sippy cup with both my daughter (4) and my son (1)  Both kids loved them, they provided a smooth transition from the bottle because the top is soft and easy to use.  Its a bit of a cross between a bottle nipple and sippy  spout.  Both kids were able to use these happily at 6 months.  Its not 100% spill proof, but I carry them in my diaper bag with the top provided with no problems.  If needed you can also use the disc provided with Born Free bottles under the spout to make it spill proof.  The newer style (compared to my daughter's version) is even better.  Highly recommend.
