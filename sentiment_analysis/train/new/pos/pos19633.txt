My 12 week old daughter loves this toy. I originally bought it for her car seat and am back to buy a second to have around the house. The velcro loop securely attaches to lots of things yet is easy to take on and off (even one handed!). It's much bigger than many similar toys I considered, which ended up being a bonus because she can reach the toy easily and even bring parts of it to her mouth. It makes car rides much happier for everyone, and keeps her occupied in her bouncer long enough for me to eat lunch, do dishes, or fold laundry.
