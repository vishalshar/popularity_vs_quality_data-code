My son and his girlfriend and infant daughter are living with me now.  Temporarily, I ardently hope.  I bought this thinking it would be such a blessing to them. It turns out it's more for me than them. They have a portable changer that they use all over the house.  I am the only one who uses this when it changing time.  It is as pictured and is solidly built. Drawers roll smoothly, and it sits firmly on the floor. This is no cheap, lightweight chest.  When they find their own apartment, I'm keeping this.  It will easily become a diaper changer for granddaughter's visits or a chest of drawers for others who use the guest room. I wish I had chosen the model with a shelf, but I am not totally disappointed. Oh, by the way, the person who put it together is not particularly adept at such things but according to him it was not difficult; it just took time and concentration.
