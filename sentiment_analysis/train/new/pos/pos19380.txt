I got this organizer to use in my diaper bag, which is really big (23 inches wide) but doesn't have a lot of compartments.  The dividers of this organizer are decently sized for fitting diapers and changes of clothes.  I do wish there were a few mesh style pockets on the outer sides of it for smaller objects.  Overall it's keeping things better organized than just throwing them in the diaper bag.  Right now I have it packed for labor at the hospital so I have more clothes and things in it than I'll actually carry all the time, but I do wish I could get a little more into it.  It stays pretty much open even when there isn't anything in it, but it doesn't quite sit "square"... meaning that some of the pockets are kind of wonky-shaped.  It really doesn't matter, but aesthetically, it does kind of bother me.  For the money, overall I think it's a good organizer, and I would recommend it if you have a large diaper bag with not enough pockets.
