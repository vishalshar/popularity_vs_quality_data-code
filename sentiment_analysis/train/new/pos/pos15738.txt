We are so pleased with this item, that we bought another one (in green) for grandma house!  My son love the toys that hang, he will grab at them and talk to them while he's laying in they play yard.  He also used the bassinet feature when he was an infant and the vibrations, light, and music were all very handy.  He still uses the changing table since the nursery is upstairs and we keep this playyard downstairs.  He's gotten a bit long for it now, but he's still within the weight guidelines.  Very pleased.
