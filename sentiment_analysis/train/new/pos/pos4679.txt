These butterflies are very life like and high quality - they have a 3 D, raised effect on parts of their bodies that you can't see in the picture and yes, they do glow in the dark - the room that they are in receives a lot of natural and overhead light, so the customers who said the butterflies didn't glow for them probably just didn't have enough light in the room - I am very pleased with my purchase
