Buy extra teats, stuff them with fresh organic fruits (mash the fruits up a bit to be able to stuff more into the teat), and freeze em up. My (teething) babe goes into a trance when this thing gets to where her molars will be coming up. Frozen teething comfort, nutritious snacking. Plus, the handle and teats hold up to sterilization very well.Recommend
