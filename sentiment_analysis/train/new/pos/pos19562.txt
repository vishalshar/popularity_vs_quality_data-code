My daughter has been interested in self-feeding and I was searching for an alternative to regular baby spoons.  These spoons may look strange but they work great!  My daughter was able to grasp them in her hands easily (starting at about 8 months) and the fact that they can stand up on their own on the high chair tray has been helpful.  I just dip the spoon into the food and pass the spoon to my daughter and she chows down.  She is so excited to be feeding herself!
