I first bought the Safety First kit but they did not fit most of my doors . The Kidco kit fit my handle door knobs and doesn't lock out the opposite handle. My kids immediately studied the kit and moved onto the one door that did not have a lock.I knocked down one star because the clear is ugly. I probably should have gotten white, but now I will just match with the 'clear'
