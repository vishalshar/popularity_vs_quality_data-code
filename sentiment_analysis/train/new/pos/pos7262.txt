My baby is 7 months, and very particular about her pacifiers. We had to try several different types before we found the NUK brand. She had a lot of trouble keeping other brands, such as Avent, in her mouth, due to the shape. But these, she loves! The only complaint about NUKs is that when I wash them, and they are submerged, sometimes the inside of the nipple fills with water and it can take a while to flush out the soap. And it's not just these Hello Kitty ones in particular. My daughter has 8 of these, of all different types and they all have this issue. Maybe they are supposed to be like that? However, we have turned this to our advantage, because we fill up with the nipple with fresh cold water and freeze the paci...which is the only thing that will calm her down right now; she is cutting her first two teeth at once, and she is extremely fussy. So my only complaint is not really a complaint at all. These Hello Kitty ones have an adorable design, and I really like the handle on them and how it fits around the pacifier; it doesn't get caught on anything this way, like when I'm changing her clothes. Awesome product, I would highly recommend!!
