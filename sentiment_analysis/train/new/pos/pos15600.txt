This is our second booster seat. The first one was NOT a peg perego and had been purchased from Walmart.It was reasonably priced- $50. After using the first booster for about 3 months I started to see all the flaws that the cheaper booster had. What we really like about the Peg Perego seat is that it reclines and that it latches into the vehicle. Both of these are very important! We went from using a Britax seat that was very comfortable for our son to sleep in, to a booster that was so straight up and down that my son would fall asleep and have trouble breathing because his neck was cranked so bad. The Peg Perego seat slightly reclines back enough that he can lay back and sleep with no issue. The other issue we had was every time our child would get out of the vehicle the seat would move. It wouldn't move a ton because typically the seatbelt was still holding it in, but if the seatbelt popped out it would hit the floor. This was super annoying!!! I'm thankful the latch system keeps it in place, not to mention I feel like he's more secure with it anchored in. We love this seat, and I think its definitely worth the money as it will be used for a few years yet.
