This monitor is exactly what I needed.  My child sleeps with a fan on for white noise.  I needed something that would pick up her voice above the sound of the fan.  This monitor does just that.  I do hear the steady hum of the fan through the monitor (which is to be expected) but I can hear her making even the slightest noise.  Most monitors aren't sensitive enough to do that.  The volume can go from extremely quiet to very loud.  A lot of newer monitors don't get loud enough.  I need it to get loud so that I can hear her when I'm doing dishes, taking a shower, even running the vacuum.  The range is great too.  I can run next door to borrow something (taking the monitor with me) and the sound is great (we have 90 ft. wide lots too).  The base (child unit) has a soft blue glow, which acts as a very soft night light.  The parent unit also has a soft blue glow that flickers when noise is made.  Since there is a fan running, the light is constantly flickering.  It does not bother me at all.  I can't see it when my eyes are closed so it doesn't prevent me from sleeping.  Even if it did, all you have to do is face it away from you.  The sound is so good, you still hear it no problem.
