My son has always loved tags so I bought this blanket for him when he was around a year old. It quickly became his comfort object. He is 21 months old now and still takes this blanket EVERYWHERE. I actually bought 3 more so that we could have a rotation of clean blankets available.As another review has stated, I personally don't think the tags are overwhelming. I actually prefer the "taggie's" brand because their tags are looped and not flat, so they are open in the middle. My son's favorite part about the blanket is putting his fingers through the holes.
