I ordered this last Christmas when I knew I would be cooking a Ham and in and out of the oven for a majority of the day.  With a toddler, I was concerned she was going to open the door when I was busy doing something else.  It sticks up above my oven door about half an inch, but what I did was just cut the sticky back and left on the backing on the portion that sticks up above the stove.  A year later, and that lock is still on the oven door.  I never leave my daughter unattended in the kitchen while its on anyways, but I love the piece of mind that I have a few seconds to get to her before she opens the oven door if she does try.
