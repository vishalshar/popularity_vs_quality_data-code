I have two of the smaller bowls and now 2 of this size.  One pink and one blue.  The design of the bowl is great for children learning to feed themselves, or feeding a child and keeping their hands out of the food, their mouth, etc.  Feeding with one hand and keeping control with the other has never been easier.  My children are out of this stage now but we still use the bowls as much now as ever.  My children love to dip everything.  These bowls are great for that.  The shape keeps the dip down to one end so they can dip easily without refilling as much.  The bottom and the shape of the bowl keeps them from knocking it over when dipping.  We also use them for crafts sometimes.  Great for water color because they don't tip.  We really use them everything.  I really need to get more.
