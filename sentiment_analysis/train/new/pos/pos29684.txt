I bought this product after having another very basic monitor that would wake us up at night with interference and static. As others have said this monitor has insanely bright LED lights. My son has a sound machine in his room so the LED light is always blinking. We put one of my black sports bras over it and we can't see it. Next it has a cool function where it can be silent until baby cries, only problem if your baby isn't a big crier then its a little worrisome. My son has to cry pretty loud to activate the feature. Next the distance is great. We live in a town home and it works perfect on all three levels and two decks over when we BBQ with our neighbors. The battery is my biggest issue! The life on it is pretty terrible. Even on Eco mode I get about three hours before it starts beeping to be plugged in. over all though it is performing very well. Sounds a crisp and clear, no interference or static. Overall happy with this product! Have not used the extra functions yet.
