love it got the hat to match. it is thin and stretchy so great for swaddling infants and snugging them in without getting to hot. would be a great swaddle blanket for any weather. my son is a year old now and still uses it. looks exactly like real acu pattern. would be a great gift for a military or die hard american friend! i would purchase again. great price as well
