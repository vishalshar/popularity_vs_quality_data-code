A friend told me about California Baby helping clear up her baby's acne. I bought this set because of the price, and the travel size bottles. This is one of my favorite baby purchases. I did help clear up the acne, and the cradle cap my son got a few weeks after being born.  Now that he's cured of those poor skin conditions, we use this for baths before bed. The scent is calming and helps soothes him to sleep. When we put the creme on his face, he actually smiles from ear to ear.
