We have gone through 3 soothers.  The Fisher Price Rainforest, Baby Einstein  and the Bright Starts.I hated the Fisher Price Soother because it only stayed on for 11 minutes, which disrupted my baby, and the water dried up so the fish no longer moved, it just hung above the water.  Also, the hardware was a hard plastic strap that was difficult to fit on the cribs (Kendall by pottery barn) and just a major pain to deal with for battery changes.I would recommend the Bright Starts and the Baby Einstein soothers. Best of all, their hangers are the same so I am able to change them between the two babies without hassle!  To change the batteries you do not have to remove the hanger from the crb, there is a button you press and the soother slides right off! I love that feature!The music isn't too loud and the lights aren't too bright, we had that one annoyance with  the Baby Einstein soother, but not annoying enough to stop using it. My baby likes this and the music/ambiance stays on long enough to allow him to fall asleep. I am very happy with this and I would give this as a gift.
