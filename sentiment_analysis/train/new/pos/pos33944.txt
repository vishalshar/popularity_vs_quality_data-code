I have to first say that I read just about all the reviews on every product that I buy here on Amazon BEFORE I buy.  I gotta tell ya I had mixed feelings when I made this purchase but am overwhelmingly pleased with the quality and performance of this product.I saw alot in the reviews that the sound quality was not good or could be better; BAH!  sound quality is fine so long as you don't set the radios up next to or on top of flourescent lights or too close to electrical outlets.The extra receiver is great too, especially with the light up feature.  When I'm in the garage working on my car or whatever, I don't miss a thing even if I can't hear the monitor I can see the red lights light up when my daughter starts to stir.By the way, the garage receiver has already been through the paces as far as "drops" go...still works fine.  Just don't go driving over the darn thing or throwing it at the wall and you should have them for a few kids!  lol
