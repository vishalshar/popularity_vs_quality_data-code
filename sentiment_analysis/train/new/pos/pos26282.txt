We purchased this set for our daughter's nursery, as I'm sure most others did as well.  It is beautiful. I looked long and hard for a nursery set that wasn't too "much."  This one is feminine but subtle, and the pink is a light, calming shade.  We purchased the whole set, including the lamps, mobile, flannel blanket, stuff lamb, and wall decals and we receive compliments on her room from everyone who comes in! I also love that this is one of the few crib sets that doesn't include the crazy plush bumpers that are not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for SIDS safety reasons.  Thank you for giving me eight great pieces without wasting my money on pieces like the bumpers that I wouldn't use.  Great product.
