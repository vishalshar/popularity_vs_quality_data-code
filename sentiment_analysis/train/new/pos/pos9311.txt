I usually don't write reviews if there are several on the board, however I was shocked to see so many bad reviews, and it's ovbious to me that those reviewers who said their child pulled the tray top off, didn't properly attached it.First, you have to put this tray together as it comes in two pieces, the center piece that attaches to the front of the bumbo attaches to the top piece AND YOU HAVE TO HEAR IT SNAP. After that you never take them apart, there's simply no need (and looking at it I think it'd be really hard to do actually) the whole thing together is the tray.Then to attach the tray to the Bumbo seat SIT YOUR CHILD IN THE SEAT and slide the top tray part over the middle hump of the bumbo, then slide the center part under the bottom of the Bumbo seat.There is no way a baby could pull the tray off, as you will find it requires a little effort to remove it by an adult in fact, as it should be.I have NEVER taken my baby out of the seat with the tray on it, and I can't find the instructions now but I'm pretty sure it said something there about that... in any case, the Bumbo snuggles your baby in a way that I think I would hurt my baby's legs if I pull him out with the tray on anyway... or maybe my baby is just too fat! (LOL)But seriously, this tray is great... before, when I sat my baby in the seat he'd look at his toys on the floor with a sad face, because they were just out of reach for him, now they can be placed on the tray and he'll play for happily for a long time.Also, THIS SEAT IS NOT A HIGH CHAIR AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AS ONE there's a BIG WARNING about that on the seat, actually... your baby could get out of the seat and fall, so if you place it on a high surface your baby could end up hurt. This seat should be use at floor level only.
