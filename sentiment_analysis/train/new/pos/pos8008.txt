I bought these for my son about 1 1/2 years ago. He broke one of them somehow when he was still crawling because he was able to unplug it. But the other one worked for several months (with me unplugging it regularly)  before the bulb finally blew out. Yes, it takes bright sunlight to turn off the light. Yes, it is difficult to find replacement bulbs. But after months of carrying the blown out bulb in my purse for comparisons, I finally found a bulb at Home Depot! I bought a two pack of Philips Indicator Clear 6w, 120 volt bulbs with candelabra bases that fit this night light perfectly. Now the second light is still working with no problems.
