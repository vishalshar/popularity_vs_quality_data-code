I was looking for a "lap top" type of toy like many other parents on here since my little one loves my lap top. He's obviously smart enough to know the difference, but even so this toy caught his attention for a while. It's small and the lid does snap shut fast catching little fingers, but all in all its a decent toy. Hes amazed, briefly, with the light up pictures in the mirror. I've only encountered one problem with the toy, sometimes when the buttons are pushed down they dont always play a song or make a sound, not sure if its just a defect in my particular toy or in general, but for the price it was worth it just to get a few mins of solo play time.
