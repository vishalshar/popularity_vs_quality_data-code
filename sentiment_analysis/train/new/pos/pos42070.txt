We had a summer baby and had little use for all the gobs of tiny flannel baby blankets you somehow collect.  I was on the search for something better, and found it in these blankets.  They are definitely on the pricey side and were a bit of a splurge, but it is hard to put a price on calming and comforting your infant.After washing the blankets fluff up and get softer like cloth diapers.  The patterns are nice and the colors have held up well.Traditional flannel baby blankets are way too small to do a proper swaddle.  The Luna Lullaby blankets are very genoursly cut and have enough give to them to allow you to get a nice snug swaddle.The included CD is helpful in learning a few different swaddling techniques.  Be sure to watch it a few times, and don't watch it for the first time while baby is screaming and your trying to figure out how to wrap him up the right way! It will take lots of practice until you can do it as well and fast as the woman in the video does it.The only reason I didn't give these 5 stars was because the price is a little high.
