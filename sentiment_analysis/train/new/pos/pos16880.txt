This blanket is soft! I had wanted to buy at least one special blanket for our baby who is due soon, and was excited to find this one for such a good deal on Amazon, because they usually retail for $65. My husband and I love it, and now want to get one of the larger "Chenille Throws" for ourselves. The blanket is plush, warm, and comfortable. It seems well made too.
