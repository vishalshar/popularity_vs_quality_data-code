I received this today and I was shocked to see the quality of the little toys, the mirror came glued outside the sun shape with the edges hanging out! I OBVIOUSLY HAD to buy super glue and reattach it to the sun shape base, that simply ticked me off, but overall I think it's not too bad, my 11 weeks old son instantly started looking around with wide eyes and talking to himself, which I take is a sign that he is a fan. there are a few extra rings to hang extra toys which i like cause i hung his favorite rattles as well. the size of the mat is very nice in my opinion and the colors are bright and cheerful. I would have given it a five star but the mirror really bothered me, first because it had the edges out and could harm the baby, second cause this was expensive, I would have expected this from a $30 one, not this.UPDATE: seller have been great regarding this matter, I highly recommend them, they issued me a refund the same I sent them a complaint, and apologized although it's a manufacturing issue.
