We use both this one and the one with handles.  I can confirm that the lids do need to be assembled correctly in order to be leak-proof.  It's really not that tricky - you just need to be watching what you're doing.  Once the lids are on, these cups are amazing.  You can keep milk cold inside for 5+ hours - and we just went through a HOT Florida summer!Make sure to remove the white plastic valve from the yellow top when you put them in the dishwasher.  Otherwise, the valve is so good that you will leave whatever your child was drinking in the "nipple" through the entire wash cycle - eeew.If I could change one thing about this product, it would be a bevel-ring on the inside of the blue/pink screw top to make sure that the yellow top was placed in correctly and evenly.  (oh and Thermos, if you're reading - sell replacement valves :)
