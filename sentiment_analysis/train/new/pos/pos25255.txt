I am a huge fan of sleep-sacks.  I've been putting my 8-month old daughter in these since she outgrew swaddling at about 5 weeks of age.  I started with the Halo Sleep Sacks but I have accumulated quite a few sleep sacks of different brands at this point.  Unfortunately, most of the ones you can buy in stores are for small babies, and my daughter has outgrown these now that she is 20 lbs.  What I love about this particular sleep sack from Kiddopotamus is that it is large so my daughter can use it for a while, and even better is that it has long sleeves.  All the other sleep sacks I find in store are sleeveless, which are fine for the summer.  But now that winter is here, and my daughter's room doesn't get too warm at night, I love giving her the extra layer on her arms.  Now if I could only find a sleep sack that had little mittens attached to cover her hands.....All-in-All, this item is a must-have.
