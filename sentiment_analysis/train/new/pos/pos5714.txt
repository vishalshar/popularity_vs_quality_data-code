This was a present that I received, and I couldn't be happier with the selection!  Its a beautiful color, seems sturdy, and is traditional with a modern flair!  We were in love with the idea that the changing table can be detached and used as a nightstand in the future.  We are first time parents, and it took us only 2 hours to put together.  My husbands only complaint was that the drawers were difficult to get to work just right - but it worked out in the end and they slide out great.Two notes:  There is a huge ugly sticker on the inside of the crib on the top of the left rail that we can't get off.  And on the front rail there is a plastic protector that has some tiny packaging foam in it that we cannot get out.  These two issues are not a big deal to us since we plan to have a bumper and guard rail.. But it is worth mentioning.
