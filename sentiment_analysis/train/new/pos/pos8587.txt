This is one of the best blankets that I have found for the money! My baby girl LOVES this blanket. It is soft and heavy enough to keep her warm in the cold but light enough to not roast her out in the warmer temperatures. It has held up beautifully in the wash. My daughter won't sleep without it. It is made from quality materials. The colors stay bright and cheery wash after wash. Literally from the photos what you see it what you get. The pattern is pretty and subtle. The knit that it is made with is nice and tight. I would definitely buy this blanket again!
