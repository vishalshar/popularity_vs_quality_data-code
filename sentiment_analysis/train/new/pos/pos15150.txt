I got six of these that came with the Nuk Baby Food blender, and I liked them so much I ordered six more. They're great for portioning out your baby food and saving it for later. They freeze well (though the lids have a tendency to pop off if you over-fill the cup when the baby food expands during freezing), and for some reason, the blue cups aren't the same shape as the blue cups that came with the baby food maker, so the lids aren't interchangeable. But otherwise, no complaints!
