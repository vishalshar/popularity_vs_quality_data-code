It's not supreme quality, but it is better than some I've seen. It is very soft with a satin trim and holds up well in the washing machine. I bought this blanket for my 18 month old daughter, for a bit of extra warmth on chilly nights and for her to cuddle up with in her crib. The blanket has been such a hit that I'm back to order one for my 3 year old son who keeps stealing his sister's blanket because it's so "cozy".  I would recommend it to a friend and I would/am buying it again :)
