With my first daughter we found after trying every sleep sack under the sun that these were the best overall.  We've been using them with my second daughter and I still feel like they are the best but there are some really annoying things about them.The biggest problem and the reason I can't give 5 stars is their durability. They are not something that you can pass down to your subsequent babies because they last about as long as it takes for your baby to graduate to the next size.  Part of that is the fact that your baby will leak every fluid imaginable onto them which prompts you to wash them regularly, but then compared to some other regularly washed items we've had, they just can't withstand it.  I told my wife they are good for 1.25 babies and so with our second daughter I'm having to buy them again.
