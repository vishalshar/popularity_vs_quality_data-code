I'm very surprised that this Monitor didn't get such a great review.  I find it to be very soothing for my baby and a relief for me.  My baby loves to watch the moons & stars - whether it's on the ceiling above her or on the wall beside her while she's inside her crib.  I've seen, read and heard about other monitors, but this one caught my eye because of its transmitter which you can speak to your baby from another room, be able to turn it "ON" from another room when it shuts off, and the fact that you can have your preference of the music ON or OFF with the glowing Moons & Stars coming from its projector.  I can be in the kitchen, two rooms away, and when the music ends, I just need to press the "ON" button on the transmitter and it begins to play the music again.  My baby is not even 3 months old and this monitor really relaxes her and helps her fall asleep.  My baby watches, listens and she begins to giggle, smile or gurgle as if she was enjoying a movie.  The only thing I can complain about, which really is not such a big deal,is the reception of the transmitter.  If you're speaking on the telephone and you press the "ON" button on the transmitter, you get some static.  But, this is a very, very minor thing compared to the happiness that I get from my baby and the relief it brings to me when I'm busy doing things in the apartment.  I'm very happy with this monitor and I feel it's worth having and I would recommend it very highly.
