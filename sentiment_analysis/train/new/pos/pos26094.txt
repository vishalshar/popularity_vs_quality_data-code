My daughter is diagnosed with Down Syndrome and is low tone.  She has minimal upper body strength and at 7 months is unable to sit up without assistance.  This roller piano is great.  She actually uses her fingers to roll the keys.  There is a reward for her action because of the music.  There are too few of these toys available.  The only improvement that can be made is if there was a leg or something to prop it up higher so that when she sits up she will be motivated to stay in an upright position.
