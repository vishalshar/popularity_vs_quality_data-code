It fits the crib mattress well, but the skirt is a little short. To be fair, the mattress is in the highest setting, but the skirt won't touch the ground even when the mattress is completely lowered. Not a big deal for us, but it might be for someone trying to use that area as storage. We have a DaVinci crib. Also, the fabric is pretty wrinkly even when it was straight out of the dryer.
