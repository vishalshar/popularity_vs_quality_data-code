Adorable comforters! My daughter is 18 months old and she gags a little using them so I just packed them away and will try to give them back to her by Christmas time. Maybe a little big for a smaller baby? Or maybe it's just my baby and her weird tastes. LolAll in all we love them and can't wait for her to love them too!
