So far we haven't had any issues with the foldable potty seat. It slides around just a little, but I just try to be careful when putting my daughter on the seat and taking her off. We've used this on a few different public toilets and it fits nicely as long as you place it to the front of the toilet and not the middle and the rear. I always wipe the public toilet down with a clorox wipe before placing the folding seat down and I have found that it helps the foam cushions located underneath the folding seat to have better grip. It's very easy to clean and I use a gallon sized ziploc bag to store it rather than the plastic case that it came with. The plastic case that it came with has a snap closure, but still has a large enough opening that makes me think the inside of the diaper bag isn't protected well enough from germs. I didn't care much for the case for this reason. My plastic case had a tear at the seam when my package arrived anyway so, it wasn't any good and the gallon sized ziploc  bag works just fine because there are no openings. I just change it everytime we're finished using the seat for the day and after I've disinfected it. It folds up really nicely. It's small and compact which is what we were looking for when on the go. It folds up to be about the size of a tablet. I have an Ellipsis 7 and it's about the same size. It bends just a tad when I place my daughter on the seat, but not enough to make me worry that she'll fall in, and I guard her on the toilet always. My daughter is 21 months old and 26 pounds if that helps anyone. We also haven't had any issues with pinching, and hopefully we won't, but as I've stated earlier, I'm very careful when placing her on and taking her off of the potty seat. I'm also very sure to make sure that when I unfold the seat it's "snaps" into place. Once again, really good product and no issues so far after several uses on different public toilets and our toilet at home.
