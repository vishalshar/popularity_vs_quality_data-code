We got this for our first road trip, and she loves to play with the frog, and it fit great on our Chicco Keyfit.  We could slide it down on the handle so her face was visible through her mirror.  She loved playing with it when she would wake from a nap and or just got in the car seat, but after a while  9 hours there, and 6 hours back  she got over the novelty, and just wanted out of her seat.  She was amazed when she discovered how to play the song, but then to our slight annoyance she just kept playing it over and over.  and the beads in the turtle constantly rattled, but not enough to wake the baby.  Maybe it was being stuck in the car for so long made us realize it, but she really didn't fuss most of the trip till about the last hour or so on each end, and we would have to say it had a lot to do with this toy bar being introduced.
