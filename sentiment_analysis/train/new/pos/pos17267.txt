We purchased this toy as part of our 4-month old's "natural" and wooden toy collection to replace his plastic (and made-in-China) toys. We like it because it is made in Germany and is created with all water-based non-toxic stains on natural wood. He loves it for many reasons - the sounds that it makes, the fact that he can wrap his tiny fingers around the rings, and it is one of his first choices to teeth on as well (he has 2 teeth and working on more). We will be purchasing additional toys from this company in the future.
