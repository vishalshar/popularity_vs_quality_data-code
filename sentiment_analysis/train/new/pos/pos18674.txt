Wish we had bought this sooner.  We used it on an internat'l trip, and use a big Baby Jogger City Select the remainder of the time, but this is totally convenient for quick trips around too.  Now I keep this one in the back of my car and the Baby Jogger on special occasions.  The Maclaren is light and portable but sturdy and reliable too.  It was a little heavy on my back to carry around the airport when my son didn't want to sit in it...but it's much lighter than any of the other options.  I know I could have gone with the lighter Volo model, but it was really important to me to have the reclining feature.  This seat reclines all the way down so my son can lay flat to nap which helps a TON to keep him sleeping longer b/c he is actually comfortable rather than tossing and turning in a 45 degree recline. Overall this product is great.My only complaint is that I wish it came with a sturdy and affordable travel bag for flights.  The old bag isn't sold anymore b/c everyone complained that it fell apart and was a piece of junk.  The new "locker" bag costs as much as the stroller so it's just not a practical option.  We bought the Uppababy G-series stroller bag and the stroller fit in there well with the wheels on.  The bag was mistook for regular luggage rather than gate check however.  Good thing for us the Maclaren stroller is built well b/c it made it through normal baggage check for pickup without damage.
