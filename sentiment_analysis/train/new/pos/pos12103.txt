We originally found this seat in the red print and we couldn't be happier to have found it in the blue/light blue pattern for our little boy.At six months old, we started using it to take him to the store where he could sit up or lay down comfortably with all the padding in it.  It's easy to use, it prevents him from touching the handle, or the sides and picking up germs from the cart.The best part are the loops that you can use to attach favorite toys as a distraction when the baby is fussy or restless.  (It's also great for hanging your sunglasses on out of his/her reach) as you shop.I am so glad we bought this for our son...it has no downside.
