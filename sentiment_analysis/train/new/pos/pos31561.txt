I just loved this stroller.  It is light weight, I can fold it easily and throw it in the back of my wagon!We have horses, so I chose this as an off roader, and it lived upto every bit of it!  It will go anywhere!  The seats are very spacious and recline very easily.  You can have a new born in one side and a toddler in the other and it accommodates really well.I used this until my son was 50lb and my daughter 30lb!  You really no not notice the weight unless you are going uphill!  (They have to ride bikes now!)I highly recommend this, it is durable, rugged and stands upto the beating the kids will give it!  Five stars!I also had the single version of it before I got the double, also an outstanding product.
