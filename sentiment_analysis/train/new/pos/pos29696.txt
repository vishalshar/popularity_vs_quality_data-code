This beat the Bjorn and Moby hands down for us.  You know you are using it right, because it is so simple (the problem with the Moby is the lack of physical structure), the baby sits more naturally in it, and it is good up to 40lbs (problem with the Bjorn is the hip support is lacking because that is what allows you to wear the baby facing out, and it maxes out at 25lbs).  You will need the infant insert for months 0-3 until their hips develop enough to be worn without it.  The only drawback is if you have a big baby (born at 9-11lbs).  In which case your only option is the Bjorn for those first few months.   Our big baby was just too big to be comfortable in the insert (same with the newborn position with the Moby) and not developed enough for either to be used without them (hips too fixed, no neck control).  We thought about getting a used Bjorn for the first few months, but it was still too pricy for something he would grow outgrow in a few months, so we just waited the 3 months to use the Ergo.10-Month Update:  We love this carrier, and so does our boy.  The shoulder straps are ergonomic in both front and back positions and evenly distribute his weight (27lbs!) on our hips.  Don't get me wrong, it doesn't make a 27lb baby feel like a feather, but it makes carrying him around for more extended periods of time possible.  My only complaint with the performance model is that the material of the shoulder straps is not comfortable on bare skin, a flaw so irritating I had to knock off one star.
