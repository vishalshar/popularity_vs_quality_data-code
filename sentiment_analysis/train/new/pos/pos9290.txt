This is flat out a very adorable toy. The voice is clear as a bell in English, although the voice sounds like a little boy so of course its not clear diction. Its a big "baby talkish"... cute actually. The body fabric is very soft and a pretty shade of white. The eyes are very tightly stitched machine embroidery as is the nose. Its very well made. That said I do think that nearly 26 dollars for a 6 inch stuffed toy is expensive. I didn't pay careful attention to the description and missed that it is so small. I was expecting something twice this large but that is my fault, not the description's.  But when it comes to my grandkids money tends to be no object. For a toy that has a mechanical voice box sewn into it, it is very soft and huggable.
