I didn't expect to get too much out of this pump since it was so cheap but I have gotten a ton of use out of it. I did just have milk back up into the tubing and the motor, but that was my own fault because I didn't flick the little door on the valve open before I started.  I called and was helped right away, and everything is being replaced for free.  The pump does come with a lot of parts, I only use the adapter and put my own little medela bottles on when I pump.  I threw all the other extra parts away, they were just taking up space.  I am a working mom and have used this to pump 5-6 times through the day for the last 2 months.  I get anywhere from 4-7oz each time.  I found the easiest way to clean everything is to get the Munchkin sterilizing bags.  Rinse all your parts, put them in the bag and microwave for a few minutes.The bag is definitely not stylish, it's kind of a cheap crunchy brown, but it definitely serves its purpose!  I would recommend this to anyone not wanting to spend a fortune on a pump.  I had a very expensive Medela with my first baby and this works just as well!
