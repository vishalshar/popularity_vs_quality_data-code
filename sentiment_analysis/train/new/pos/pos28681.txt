I was really excited to actually find this for $40!  I've been wanting to buy it forever!  It is really cute and the quality is decent.  I was a little disappointed when I received it and the material seemed kind of cheap.  After washing it in warm water it already seemed to fade a little.  The monkeys and other stiched on details are nice.  The color was slightly different from what I expected but still nice.  It's not the typical bold pinks you see in little girls rooms, so I liked that.  The bumper is nice and sturdy, yet soft.  I also like how each of the 4 sides tie on separately.  Other crib sets I've had in the past never quite fit right when it was all in one piece.  In case you were wondering, the set comes with:  bedskirt, 1 sheet, quilt, and bumper.  I've seen this sell at Target.com and BabiesRUs.com for $120.  At that price, I think I would have been a little disappointed, but at $40, I can't complain.  Overall it a cute set and we all like it in the new baby's room.  I can't wait to accessorize!
