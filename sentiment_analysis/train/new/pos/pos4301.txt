I bought these from Amazon for my youngest, who is 9.  She would always complain with the medium and larger rackets that the birdie would "phase through" (her words) the racket, so that's why she could never hit it.  After getting these, she has a much easier time playing.  They don't seem to phase through as much, lol.One thing to note, these were only $3 at my local Dollar General, same exact set, so I bought another set for backups.
