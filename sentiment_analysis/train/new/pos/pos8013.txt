I ordered 2 of these to take to my trip to Disney World with my five month old daughter and my 13 month old nephew. My daughter can't sleep with light on so this was what I found that would work best for us! It did do it's job although it does not completely block light out. They both managed to take pretty good naps while using these. However, my sister and I both have an Uppa Baby Cruz stroller and this didn't fit too well. It was an awkward loose fit, but it managed to stay put with the velcro straps and covered them both completely! I do plan on using this from now on whenever my baby needs a snooze.
