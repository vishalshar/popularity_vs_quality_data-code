Let me start by saying as a mother to 4Month old twins this product has made our life much easier! It has served its purpose however there are little things that need to be tweaked. First, if it is low on water and you try to warm a bottle it won't just turn off and their is no low water signal so it just burns the bottle and the tray leaving a horrible burnt smell. Secondly, this product leaves a residue in the water chamber after just a few bottle warms. Lastly, they need a better design for the timer and buttons they seem cheaply made and often have to be gently tapped to find the right setting. These are all minor issues sometimes the bottle heating consistency is off a little.
