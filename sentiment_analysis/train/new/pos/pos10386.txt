I was drawn to this diaper cover for a couple reasons. One, because a friend suggested it to me. She used this product on all 3 of her kids. And two, because it does not have exposed PUL so its soft against baby's skin, yet waterproof. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because on the smallest setting its still too big on my 9 month old, 20lb, chunky leg boy. Ive tried different prefolds and inserts and its still too big. However, it fits great over a fitted diaper! So, its not a total loss because it still gets used. Just not with prefolds and inserts which i wanted to use it for due to the non exposed PUL. Overall im satisfied but it DEFINATLY does not fit birth to potty training.
