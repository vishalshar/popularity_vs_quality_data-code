I have a Recaro Pro Ride convertible seat.  While I love the seat, it does not have a cupholder of any variety.  My DD is quite particular about things and when she's done with her water, she chunks it overboard.  Of course, she wants it again a few minutes later and throws a fit because she can't reach it and I can't typically get it for her while on the go.I found this little item in looking at options to solve my delimma.  It looked like it would work.  I just got it today, and it fits perfectly.  The little clamp opens up to about two inches, which is plenty to get over the thick edge of the carseat, even with the seat's padded cover.  I was able to get it pretty snug.  It does rock a little if I apply pressure, but I don't think it is such that my two year old could either knock it loose or askew.  I can't speak to its longevity as I just got it, but I did want to let people know it DOES fit over a ocnvertible seat edge.  I can see how it might break if you're too rough with it or try to overtighten it, as it is just made of plastic and it would be easy to strip the threading.It does come with a little snack bowl that has a lid.  That side of the holder is shallower than the one intended for a cup.  The cup side also has little rubber gasket things that help secure the cup.Even if this thing only survives a year, it's not expensive enough that I would mind replacing it.  I think the upcoming road trips where I won't be listening to a screaming kid due to a tossed water bottle will be worth it.UPDATE 6/2/13:  It's still going strong!  We have had no issues with either of the two pods we bought.  They have been removed and replaced several times for cleaning purposes, and the threads are still holding strong and the units look brand new.  I even bought a third one for DD's toddler bed for her water bottle, since it was getting lost among the dozens of stuffed animals and books she keeps in bed with her. :)
