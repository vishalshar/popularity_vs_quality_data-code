I love this stroller because it's big and sturdy but there are definitely pro's and cons.Pros--It's very well made.-You can turn the seats any way you want them.-The seats are comfortable.-For being such a big stroller it's amazingly easy to navigate.-It's got a HUGE basket underneath for discarded jackets, diaper bags, sippy cups, shoes and whatever els your kids throw down there.-It took about 20 minutes to assemble and the instructions are very clear and simple.-It collapses easier than most single strollers.-Unlike a lot of side by side double strollers it fits in every doorway.Cons--It's HUGE.-You need some trunk space to put this thing in.-You have to take the seats off to get it really flat. So be prepared because it takes several minutes to take the seats off, fold it up and load it all up in the car.-You kind of need a plan where you are going with this bad boy. I took my kids to the doctor and had to do a three point turn to get it out of the hallway.All in all I love it. The only thing I would change is that I would make it collapsable with both seats on.
