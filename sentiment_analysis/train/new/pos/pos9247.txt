My 7 month old son has 7 teeth and likes to gnaw on anything that gets put into his mouth, but with so many teeth, my husband and I really wanted to start brushing.  This set is perfect.  I can use the tools instead of a finger brush or piece of cloth (both wind up getting my finger smashed by strong gums) to clean his gums, then use the brush to lightly brush over his teeth.  Is he getting a great clean?  No, probably not, but he is getting used to the idea that we stick stuff in our mouth to clean our teeth which will be useful as he gets older.  And to my mind, at least we are getting a little water in there to rinse off the sugars of the day.  Not a perfect solution by any stretch, but definitely better than nothing.
