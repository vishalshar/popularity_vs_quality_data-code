I was wary to buy this valance because I read all of the reviews stating the valance did not match the bedding set.  However, I decided to purchase it anyway because my room has 2 windows and only one valance comes in the bedding set.  I received the valance today and I am happy to report that it matches the Lambs & Ivy 5 Piece Bedding Set, Enchanted Forest that I purchased from Amazon in December 2012 perfectly.  I'm not sure if some of the reviewers who received valances that did not match had the older Enchanted Forest set and that's why they didn't match, but I am 100% pleased and satisfied with my purchase.
