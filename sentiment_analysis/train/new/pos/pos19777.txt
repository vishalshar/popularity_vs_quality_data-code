Love this doll. I purchased it for my 13 month old  before the holidays. I looked EVERYWHERE to find out how tall it is- for the record she is  approximately 11 and 1/2 inches tall I hadn't seen  it posted anywhere else. The under side of her skirt is  a satiny fabric that my daughter likes to  play with. She is a sweet little doll. She has a happy little face and is very soft.  I am very happy with the  purchase, the price and the size :)
