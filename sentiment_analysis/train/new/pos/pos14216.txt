I've been using them for over a year now and I love it! I do see the difference with and without the pad. When the wipes warmer are without the pad, the wipes get kind yellowish and they get dry easily. With the pad, it keeps the wipes really warm, moist and white. It works great with most of the brands. I initially use pampers wipes but then we shift to the walmart generic brand (is a LOT cheaper) and works great!. Is a great product and I love the fact it keeps bacteria and fungus away
