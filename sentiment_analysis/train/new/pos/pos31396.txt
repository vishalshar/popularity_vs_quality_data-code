I would like to say that when I first looked through all the reviews I was pretty comfortable, but a little put off by the 1 star review on here.  I also have a childcare business and I thought this would be a cheap yet comfortable seat to sit in for the little ones.After receiving the product I can tell you that it is not in fact hard to clean... if you're not slightly off in the head.  The straps are EXACTLY the same as the other fisher price seat that I bought.  If you want to take them off.. yeah.. it's not "super easy"... but what you need to ask yourself is ... would you want it to be super easy?  Would you want the straps coming out easily when your child is in there?  no.  This is a safety thing, but they are easy for an adult.  You will need to push the large piece through the hole... it will be hard, but not impossible.These pieces are designed to stay in place for your child to be comfortable and secure... the best way to disinfect is to take a bucket of bleach water and a wash cloth and go to town, but if you feel the need to remove them... you ARE able to.As for it not being very big... I can say that I set my 5 year old girl in it and she fit just fine.  My son is 18 months and in the 86% for growth and he fits in easily.. I have a larger 3 year old at daycare who is about 65 pounds and he fits in.... Unless you have a very large child, don't be alarmed by the negativity on here... some people will honestly complain about anything and everything... This is a solid buy, from a solid company and it's very safe.  I would gladly recommend this to anyone.
