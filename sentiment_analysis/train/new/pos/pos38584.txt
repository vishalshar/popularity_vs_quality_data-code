Highly recommend this product, I have more than one & we LOVE them!!! You can attach the carabiner to shopping carts, purses, strollers, backpacks, etc. I particularly recommend these if you have an EXTREMELY IRON WILLED CHILD!!!! That type can NOT be forced to comply but can be persuaded & those backpack leaches that "force" a kid to comply only makes those kids rebel MORE...this is a WAY better option & still keeps them within a short distance, & you can tell quickly if they let go, it frees up your hands to push a stroller or a shopping cart & the carabiner allows you to connect several handles so for people with twins it would be awesome! I've carried multiple young kids to a ballet performance in Downtown Memphis before & simply used these hooked to my purse & it allowed me to be able to maneuver the streets well while keeping all the kids in my party safe. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE these!
