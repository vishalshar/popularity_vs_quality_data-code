I bought this stool for my 18 month old so that we could start teaching her to brush her teeth at the sink. Plan is to transition the stool to potty training. I looked at a lot of stools on Amazon before ordeing this one. I am extremely happy with it! I like how this stool has a solid base, with the non-slip padding at the bottom. I was worried about thes stools tipping over, but this one is very sturdy. I also really like the non-slip grip at the top. When my daughter stands on it in her PJs, she doesn't slip at all. I would highly reccommend this stool if you are looking for something safe, sturdy, and functional.
