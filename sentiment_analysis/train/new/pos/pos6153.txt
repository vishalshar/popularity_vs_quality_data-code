We have a Philips Avent SCD510, and Philips no longer sells batteries for this older-model unit (of course). I thought we would have to buy an entirely new monitor but decided to give this battery a shot first - if it worked it's sure a lot cheaper than a new monitor. Just wanted to post this review to say if you are in the same situation, yes, it works! It fits just fine, it charged up, and is holding a charge just as it should. Two thumbs up so far.
