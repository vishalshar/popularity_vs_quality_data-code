The Hexagon Polka Dot Playpen is very portable and in its folded up form, it's like the size of a large plate. It has a carry tote so bringing it on the go is no problem and it doesn't take up a lot of storage space. The one thing that surprised me is that this playpen is a lot bigger than I expected, so make sure you have enough floor area for it. It's big enough for you to fill it up with plastic balls and make your own ball pit. Despite it being big, it is very light to hold. I also noticed that the playpen is very durable, even if your child crawls out of the playpen by trampling over the walls, no damage will be done to the wireframe. One thing you should take caution of is when you remove the band because the playpen will pop open! So make sure your kid isn't nearby when you open it up. There's no door for your child to crawl into or out of the playpen.
