I can't give this a bad review, as it is well made and functions as designed.My daughter isn't a big fan of pacifiers, however, and though I was quick with the camera, she was quicker, spitting this out so fast it could have been a Kung Fu move.She wasn't even curious about it once it made its speedy departure from her mouth.  She's normally curious about everything.Oh well.  A wise man once said, "Don't try to understand women.  Women understand women, and they hate each other."
