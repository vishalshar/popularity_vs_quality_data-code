I don't know where to begin!! This walker is everything I have hoped for. It has the cutest activity toys to keep my 11 month old busy..even my 3 year old loves to play with them lol.. I was pleased to see that this walker can either walk on carpet and on non-carpet surfaces. All I had to do was un-screw the plastic stoppers on the bottom of the walker and it was easily converted-- to be used on carpet!!  It doesn't fold up for storage but still worth it! I had a fold up walker with my first child and actually disliked it so much! It would unfold sometimes if it didn't click up right..I live in a small space and it sits well in the corner, it doesn't take up that much space! If you are looking for a great walker, that has A LOT of fun activities to play with and a huge snack tray, with super cute design buy this one! :D
