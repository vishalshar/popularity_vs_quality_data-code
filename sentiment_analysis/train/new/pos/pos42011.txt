OK... my baby is big, and tall.  He was born at 10 pounds 22 1/2 inches.  However, I can't really imagine any baby that would fit in this at 9 months (which is what the listing claims).  To be specific, when laying flat it is 24 inches from the shoulders to the bottom hem.  That hem is gusseted, but I am talking about a FLAT measure.When your kid fits - it is awesome!  Warm and snuggy.  I like this better than the sleeveless version.
