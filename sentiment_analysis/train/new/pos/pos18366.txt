I have had this necklace on my child since he was 3 months old. Never have taken off. Still looks brand new. He doesn't even realize he has it on because he is 1.5 yrs now and he doesn't know what it's like to not have it on.. very cute and it twist on and off easily. Never has got caught on anything or tangled and there is knots between each bead so if something were to happen with it.. it wouldn't let off loose beads.. PERFECT little necklace and he has a mouth full of teeth and has done only drooling with this no crankiness that I can remember
