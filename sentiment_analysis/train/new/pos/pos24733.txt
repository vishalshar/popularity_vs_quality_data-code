This was fairly easy to set up. I needed to use the instructions, though.  Since adding this second camera, I had one instance where the original camera's video stopped coming up on the screen. After unplugging the original camera and removing the handheld battery and resetting it,  it started working again.  It's nice to have the monitor automatically toggling between my kids' rooms at bedtime.
