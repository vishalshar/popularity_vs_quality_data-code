Perfect size for me and my husband, and he doesn't feel like a diaper bag at all. Looks good on him as a messenger bag, so he's the one carrying it most of the time. Good for me!My daughter drinks only formula now, and the bag is easily fit for 3 bottles and all the miscellaneous she needs for 12 hours.Highly recommended.
