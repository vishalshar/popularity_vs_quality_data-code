I like the latex nipple because it is softer than the silicone ones and it is easier for my babies to get a good seal on them while eating.  They are so hard to find anymore though.  I have used them for 3 kids now and this last time about a third of the nipples we bought were defective, which was disappointing.The flow is between a slow and a medium in the Playtex silicone ones so the label of "fast flow" is a bit off.  However the flow has been just right for my babies so that is not an issue for me.Because of the nature of latex you do go through these faster than silicone ones.  We did replace them about every 3-4 months depending on how many we had in rotation.Because my babies could get a good seal on these and it prevented a lot of spilled and wasted milk they were worth getting and I will get them again. (hopefully, they solve the problem with so many defective ones though)
