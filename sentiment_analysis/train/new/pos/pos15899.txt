These are THE BEST baby gates out there. When my daughter was little we had a climber who scaled the regular baby gates like a monkey so in came Dreambaby. Because of the vertical slats she couldn't get her foot in anything to catapult herself over the gate. That was about 8 years ago and we still own and use them. We still have one gate upstairs in case the littlest decides to travel half asleep down the stairs, another at the top of the basement stairs to keep the kids out of hubby's office space during meetings (they can open it now so it's more of a visual sign to them to leave him alone when the gate is closed) and we just purchased the two-pack deal to keep the new fluffy child (puppy) contained to the kitchen. These gates have withstood quite a bit of abuse from the kids, a move to a new home and they still look new - they are durable, easy to open (both ways which is awesome) but not so easy for young children to open (it took my daughter years to figure out how to open them) and they're tall which buys you time. I also like that they have the extension pieces in case you have a wider doorway and they don't look like baby gates - they're more stylish and will fit in with any home decor. Obviously we would purchase again since we just did!
