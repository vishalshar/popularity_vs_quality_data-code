This is the perfect sized brag book.  I gave it to my mother and she carries it around with her everywhere.  It fits perectly in her purse and hold just the right amount of photos that people she's "bragging" toaren't yawning after 20 minutes of baby photos of a kid they don't know.  The colors are bright and the dog is adorable and the construction of so far has helpd up really well and believe me it is getting its use.
