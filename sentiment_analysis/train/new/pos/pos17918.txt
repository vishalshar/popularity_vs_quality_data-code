We ordered this toy for our 7 month old.  We had seen other stroller toys but they all seemed kind of girly with bugs and flowers.  We liked the musical theme. Our son loves it! In fact, we recently went to our county fair and were there for a quite a long time.  Every time we'd take the baby out of the stroller he'd wiggle and reach for his stroller.  He loves to "chew" on the microphone.  The drum doubles as a snack holder and he knows how to open it and enjoy his snacks. The toy is very easy to attach and I would imagine it would fit almost any stroller.  We recommend this toy to any parent that uses a stroller on a regular basis.
