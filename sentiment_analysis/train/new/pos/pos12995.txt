Love this crib set it's so adorable and made of good quality material I haven't used it yet being that my son hasn't arrived. But I'm sure he's going to love it, the quilt is soft and comfy also right when I received the crib set I washed all the items even the bumper I followed the directions and washed it on delicate and it came out looking even more brand new dried it on tumble press and it came out wrinkle free didn't leave it in the dryer that long though only for about 10  minutes or less I must say it is made of high quality and for the buck you can't go wrong I also purchased the music mobile separately and I must say that it's so adorable I'm going to purchase a fire truck rug and the lampshade that goes with the set and then I'll have the whole fire truck theme for my little one, for what you pay you sure do get alot of items so I wouldn't hesitate on purchasing this item again I highly recommend it.
