This bag is essentially a ripoff of the Columbia backpack, down to the pattern of the stitching and the color scheme. It has almost all the same features as the Columbia bag at about half the price. I actually like this bag more because it's a little longer and not quite as thick, so it fits better on my back. The straps are much more comfy than the Columbia version as well - it could be due to the different shape, but it doesn't pull against my shoulders like the Columbia. I miss the extra front zipper that gives you access to the main compartment, but not that much. The different shape also keep the main zippers closed better than the Columbia. I"m not as crazy about the insulated bottle pocket - it's shallower and harder to fit more than one bottle at a time with an icepack, which you'll need to keep anything cold for more than a half hour in either bag, but I eventually figured out a way to stuff two bottles in with the icepack, so no harm done. Haven't noticed yet if the insulation works better or worse than the Columbia, but it seems to do the trick. Not a perfect product, but few of them are these days. Seems to be well built, tho, and I expect to get at least as much life out of this one as I did its Columbia predecessor - about 2 years.
