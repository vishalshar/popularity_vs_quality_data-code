This washcloth's purpose in life is exfoliation. Think of it as a small, more effective version of the nylon scrubby shower cloths you can get at any drug store, and not a replacement for your everyday washcloth. Don't go buying a bunch of these for your home or guest room thinking they're going to be super-soft, cuddly, general-purpose washcloths. They're not.The material is definitely silk. It's raw (tussah) silk, not the smooth, shiny reeled silk you'd find in most special occasion fabrics. The fiber's rough, which is ideal for its use as a scrubby. I would avoid using it with soap, or any other products that have a high pH, as they'll damage the fiber over time. Even if the directions claim it's machine washable, I would hand-wash it with a mild detergent and let it air-dry. Since silk will mold if it's damp too long, it should be thoroughly air-dried between every use, too. Since the cloth MUST be wet to work properly, that's definitely something to be aware of.This thing absolutely demolishes skin roughness, but it's easy to overdo it. For the hypersensitive skin on my face, and especially around my eyes, I have to use a very light hand and barely touch my skin with the cloth. If I'm not careful, it'll take too much off and leave me red and sore. I've been using it on my legs and underarms after shaving, and have seen a noticeable reduction in razor burn.This little cloth is fantastic -- for its intended purpose.
