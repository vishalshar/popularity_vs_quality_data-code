I'd recommend this to anyone with a dishwasher. Small items get washed at our baby-free house all the time- lids to water bottles, parts for equipment like Camel packs, plastic teaspoon measures that I'd prefer on the top rack, household decor items, parts for the pet fountain, etc. This holds it all. Even items that are small enough to fit through the holes don't do so, they stay in place. I don't know why dishwashers don't come with these!
