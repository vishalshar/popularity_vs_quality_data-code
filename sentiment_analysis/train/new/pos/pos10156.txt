These are well-made, nice-looking gates, and they are reasonably simple to assemble and install. We did not bother screwing the mounting caps into our walls -- we have plaster-finish drywall and found it much simpler to just use the pressure bolts without the mounting caps. Because we are using them to keep our dog out of a cat area, we mounted them above the baseboard rather than at floor level as shown in the directions. That leaves room for the cats to scramble underneath, and accommodates our baseboards.I would have given this product 5 stars were it not for the 30+ minutes it took me to scrub off all the ugly warning labels (I bought 2 gates). The labels are on both sides, the whole length of the gate, and you can't just peel them off -- you have to soak and scrub, and even then it's impossible to get all the adhesive off. Really stupid of the manufacturer not to use adhesive labels that are easy to peel.I don't know that I would choose these gates if I had a toddler to contend with. My dog is not smart enough to figure out how to open them, but I am pretty sure that my kids would have gotten through them in no time. You would need an additional latch (like the kind you use to child-proof cabinet doors) to really secure them. Not a big deal, but important to know going in.
