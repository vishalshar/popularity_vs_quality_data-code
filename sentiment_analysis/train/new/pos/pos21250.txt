This was one of my daughter's favorites when she was a baby. She absolutely loved the scrunchy pages and all the different textures. I got this as a lightning deal and otherwise probably wouldn't have purchased this if I would have had a chance to look at it. I wasn't all that impressed with the pictures and textures as they weren't all that stimulating, or so I thought! It's for the best that I didn't have a chance to check it out because my daughter would not have been with one of her favorite things to play with!
