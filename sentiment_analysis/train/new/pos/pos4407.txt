Recieved this today and was very pleased by the ease of set up. We have a Britax B-Agile stroller and this adapter clicked right into place using the car seat connectors that came with the stroller. We have a Chicco Keyfit 30 car seat and the seat snapped in and out of this just as easily as it did the Chicco stroller that it came with.There is also a belt attached to the adapter for added security but the seat felt very sturdy even without it.I thought the adapter would have to be removed to fold and unfold the stroller, but was very pleased to discover that it doesn't actually interfere with the folding at all!Overall I am very pleased and can't wait to use this with our soon arriving baby #2.
