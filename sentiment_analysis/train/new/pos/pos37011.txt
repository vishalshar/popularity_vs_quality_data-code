I decided to write a review for this product after having used it for multiple years.The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the position of the chain (it hits the side of pooh's head / back most of the time) and how thin the fabric that makes up the shade is.  For a more rambunctious child, you may want to purchase something more durable or expect tears in the fabric or broken base.We keep it always on, plugged to an outlet controlled by a switch so our son doesn't have to touch it to turn on the light.
