I am very upset that this product now costs $11 per page of gum (8 pcs).  I purchased it a year ago for 2.29 a box (16 pcs of gum)!!!then it went off the market and I can't find it retail anywhere.  No one can tell me what happened.  I may just suffer with dry mouth; this is now too expensive to chew.
