These were basically what we expected. I like that it was a 2 pack so my husband and I both have 1 for our car. It is slightly too long for my car window (I drive a pathfinder ) but I guess this means it should fit a variety of window sizes. I am impressed how well the suction cups are working. My husband put it on weeks ago and despite the kids slamming that door repeatedly, and outside temperatures ranging from 30 degrees to 75+, the shade hasn't moved. I would recommend and or buy these again.
