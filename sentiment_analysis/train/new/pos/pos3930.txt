I always trust Baby Einstein products. This item was easy to assemble and I had it up and running in 10 minutes. My daughter is 4 months old and enjoying the Discovery Center very much. My only problem is that in the product description there was no mention of specifications...Like on the box it states right on the front (original Baby Einstein packaging was used in shipment) that it is for children who can sit on their own unassisted. Also, it is for children up to 25 lbs and 30 inches tall. If they can walk, or even take a few steps, this is not for them. This all would have been nice to know had my daughter been older, or had I decided to purchase this item sooner. My daughter isn't sitting unassisted yet, but she's literally days away so I am not too worried. I sit with her and she is not left unattended while in the Discovery Center. But like I said, if I had wanted to purchase this item sooner I'd be pretty upset that I paid for this and that wasn't made clear. Why would i want a large box with an item for my daughter taking up space in my apartment if she can't use it yet?! But other than those two small problems, I see nothing wrong with this. In my experience with this no toys have fallen off, everything is easy to assemble, and easy to clean. I'm excited for all the playtime I will have with my daughter involving this toy! (The hand puppet lion is especially fun for interaction with baby, just thought I'd mention. Smart!)
