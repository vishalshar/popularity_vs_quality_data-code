I had never seen this little inventions until a cousin of mine came to visit with her little guy.  What in the world was on his feet?!  Answer: Sock Ons.  Now I was pregnant with baby number 4 and was sold right then and there.  She gifted me two pair of the first size and the only time I had any trouble at all was when my baby was wearing really thick and fuzzy socks...and one foot only came out one time total.  My baby is now 10 months old and I had to go ahead and buy the next size up because they work so well and with winter coming on socks are becoming a must.  These truly are "Clever Little Things That Keep Baby Socks On!"--no stretching of the truth at all.
