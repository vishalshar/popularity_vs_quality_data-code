Many moms or reviews of baby products said we wouldn't need a wipe warmer, so when my baby was born, I hadn't bought one. A couple nights and many shrieking late-night diaper changes later, I decided they were CRAZY. The warm vs. cold wipe on my newborn's butt made the difference between her crying (and needing 20 min of consoling) or staying sleepy at 3am. When you haven't had more than a few hours sleep in a few days, the difference is worth 10x the price of this warmer. GET ONE.UPDATE 4/2014: Our little one is now 8 months old and this warmer still has it's place of honor on the changing table. While she isn't as fussy about the cold wipes when she's awake and happy, at night, the warm wipes still help a lot to keep her calm and sleepy. Not too many of my 1st-week-home purchases have made it this long! Still working great even after constant use for 8 months. Wish they made a portable version for on the go.UPDATE 3/2015: Our girl is almost 19 months now, and this warmer is still going strong. Read: 19 months of constant use, being always plugged in! She still really prefers the warm wipes to cold ones we use when out and about. I did try some battery-powered warmers for on the go, but wasn't impressed like with this one. Still very highly recommended. Its stood the test of time, and the diaper-changing war zone. :)
