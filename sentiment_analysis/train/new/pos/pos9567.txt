If you have the Kiinde system of pumping/storing/feeding, then this organizer is a nice to have in the early stages.  I didn't give it 5 stars because honestly, I didn't use the organizer for long.  My milk production outpaced what the organizer could handle in the early days.  But when I went back to work and started using more bottles, this organizer became helpful again. I love all of my Kiinde bags, bottles, etc. - I just don't feel that the organizer was one of the more useful pieces of the system. If you have not yet committed to the Kiinde Twist system....do it!  It is one of the best systems around and I plan on doing it again with baby #2!  It makes life so much easier and makes heading out the door fast and clean.
