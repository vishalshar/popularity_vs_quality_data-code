I don't use that description loosely here, this crib light has rescued our sleep and sanity a few times a week since we bought it.  Each time our daughter (10 months old) wakes up and is put back down by the crib light, we breathe a sigh of relief and say "sooo worth the money!".It is a simple product, with switches that you can easily find even fumbling in the dark with a baby in your arm.  It is safe - it attaches firmly to the side of the crib.  The lights are soft and soothing, but just bright enough to see the baby.  The sound is just like the sound of mom's heartbeat that you hear in an ultrasound.  That sounded gimmicky to us at first, but it really works.  The sound stops after about 10 minutes - plenty of time for her to drift back off to sleep.The only con I can think of with this crib light is that, by design, it stays on while in voice activation mode and drains batteries a little.  It isn't "idiot proof".  You have to remember to turn it off when not being used.  We kept forgetting to turn it off and it drained the batteries in about a month.  If you remember to turn it off, they will last much longer.Overall, I highly recommend this product for any new parent trying to help their baby sleep through the night.
