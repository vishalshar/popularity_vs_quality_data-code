I bought this because I needed a toy for baby in the playpen and there was nothing else around this price.  It did not seem to have a lot of activities to keep baby entertained but surprisingly, she likes it.  She likes it even more now that she can pull herself up to a standing position and she can play with the toys uptop.  It makes music, which is always a plus for babies.  I would def. recommend.
