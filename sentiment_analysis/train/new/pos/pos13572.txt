I really like this stroller, I got the Viola, It arrived very quickly and was fully assembled.  I bought it for air travel but i have taken it around with me a few times.ProsAngles very wellnot the lightest but a reasonable weightthe recline is easy to handleCanopy is nice and wide, although it could angle lower to keep direct sun out of her eyesfive point harness seems difficult for a child to open my daughter is 9 months so I guess I'll find out laterNice height and width in seatNice size basket, can get small items out of while still reclinedEasy opening and foldingRubber Wheels and locks are real secureGreat handle bar height, covering has good friction tooGoes up to 55lbs carrying weightConstruction seems really goodConsI wish it had a peaka boo window, I have to pull back the canopy to see my daughterdefinitely not all terrain strictly for well paved  smooth surfaces, to be fair it was not marketed as all terrainnot sure how well the colour will deal with the elements its not as deep and bold as i would like, I think I'll spray with Scotch guard to make sure it's water proofMy daughter is a little tall her legs dangle off the seat even in full recline, I wish the end of the seat pull out/ was flexible to bend or extend,An adult cup holder would have been niceAll in all this item serves my purposes, my daughter loves to ride in it she kicks her legs up and down as we go and is comfortable enough to fall asleep.
