I bought this because I was away on business for 4 days and had a ton of milk. I only had my medela 4 bottle cooler and ice pack so that clearly wasnt enough. I used my amazon prime and got this delivered the next day and was I pleasantly surprised! It is much better thant he medela in that it has 3 ice packs that cover the sides and bottom of the bottle. I had to travel for about 8 hours and they were still very much cold when I got home! I also had NO problems through airport security as the TSA officer said the bottles were small enough that they didn't need to test. I will be replacing my medela cooler with this one (it also fit nicely into my medela bag).
