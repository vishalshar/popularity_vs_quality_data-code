This is a good product and you can't pump without it.  The life of these membranes is a lot longer if you don't pull on them to get them disconnected from the yellow valve.  Instead, try pushing them out from the yellow valve by pressing on the little knob inside with your fingertip.  My first set of membranes lasted less than a month because I was constantly pulling on them to get them disconnected.  My new set has been going strong for over 2 months now with no signs of wear and tear since I've been pushing them out.
