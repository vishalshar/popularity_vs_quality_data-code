It works very well.  I bought this one along with a Deluxe stroller weather shield to see which one I liked better.  This one was nice, with the pouch and did it's job very well, but I liked the Deluxe better because the sides could be opened or closed, and the cover in the back is longer, so I felt my stuff under the stroller was better protected.
