I purchased several different seats of this type in an effort to find one my twins like.  This is the only one they will use.  I like it because it sits on the bowl, not on the seat so no wetness gets on the seat.  One of the other types I purchased only fit over the seat and I had to wash the adult seat every time they used their potty seat.  I like it because it folds very flat and fits beside the toilet when they aren't using it.  And I like that it is very easy for them to get out and put on the toilet themselves.I did not give it five stars because it didn't last long enough.  First the plastic bolts that hold it together broke and I had to replace them with metal bolts.  Then eventually the step cracked and I feared it would soon snap in half.  But I do have three toddlers all using it, perhaps it would last longer for just one child.The other thing I wish was different about it is that I wish the potty shield in front was a little higher, the twins are boys and until they got better at it we got a lot of messes.
