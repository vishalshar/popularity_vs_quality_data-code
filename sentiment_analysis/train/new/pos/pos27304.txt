At first I wasn't sold on this machine, but after having used it for sometime I LOVE IT.Pros:The hot shot just makes me feel better...I know some people say it really doesn't do anything but I figure it's better than nothing as formula isn't sterile!The bottle comes out the PERFECT temperature every single time.It's SO awesome pushing two buttons and having the perfect bottle (with the one caveat below about the water level).Cons:Really loud beeping and running sounds...but you get used to them. Guests can't believe how loud it is when they first hear it though hahaWater (especially the hot shot) dispenses poorly and sometimes gets on the outside of the bottle (we use Dr. Brown's bottles so they are more narrow). The cooler water doesn't stream out consistently...sometimes goes more right or left so you have to make sure the bottle it perfectly centered!After measuring and checking over and over, it dispenses just under the ounce it claims to dispense (a little less than 4 oz when on the 4 ozsetting). We've checked with different bottles (including the Tommee Tippee) and measured the water. We've only used the 4 and 5 oz settings so far so it may be different for the other amounts. Not a huge deal, we top off with other water, but it does kinda defeat the convenience of the machine. The main reason for the 4 instead of 5 star rating.
