These finger puppets are just perfect. We got them for my 5 month old as a stocking stuffer. The bottoms are their little bodies, makes the arms look appropriate. The finger holes are up in the head, an elastic ring behind the stuffing. If you want them to stay on, you must push your finger up into the head. Not a problem for me, but I saw a lot of other reviews saying the were way too big. Good quality sewing and material. No small plastic eyes or noses for baby to accidentally choke on when he inevitably takes them off my finger and starts chewing on them. I would definitely recommend them to a friend. I might even buy some for one who's expecting.
