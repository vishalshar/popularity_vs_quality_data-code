Love this hamper! We have three children and have used a number of various styles of hamper, and this is my favorite for the kids! Sturdy canvas structure, cute characters and colors, handles for carrying to and from the laundry room, and the handles fold down to make a hole in the top that kids can use to fill the hamper on their own (my older kids like making a game out of that). It's been a couple of months now since we got the goat style and I definitely recommend it. We actually ended up buying the deer and octopus styles for our two older kids because we liked it so much!
