I looked everywhere for a wedge pillow that I could use for my back during pregnancy. I know it's advertised more as a between the leg or under the belly pillow but I got it mainly bc my boppy body pillow was not enough support to keep my mid to lower back comfortable at night. I found myself on the couch for a couple weeks before I realized I just needed good support on my back to sleep well. This wedge pillow, when used in conjunction with your body pillow is an excellent system. I hug the body pillow and place the wedge pillow (thin side) under my back to give me that additional support I was unable to get with a regular pillow. Then when I turn in the middle of the night to the other side the wedge pillow acts as nice support for my belly. That way Im not transferring my body pillow back and forth all night as Im tossing and turning. I hope this makes sense! Get one, it works! Oh and it the perfect size, not too big, not too small, not too soft, not too hard. It's the goldilocks of wedge pregnancy pillows ðŸ˜‰
