We received a number of receiving blankets for our son's baby shower, including Carters, Wamsutta, and these.  After 8 months these are still my favorites.  The Wamsutta blankets (30" square) were just too small, and the Carters blankets were cut odd - after a number of washings I noticed the corners no longer match up when I fold them, and they are nowhere near as soft as these Koala Baby blankets.  I still use these for my 8 month old as a summer blanket (not swaddled) for naptimes and nighttimes.  These are the softest receiving blankets we own, and the first ones I pull out of the drawer if we need a light cover for our little boy.
