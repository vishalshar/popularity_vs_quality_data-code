My baby girl still loves to be swaddled.  At 5 months and nearly 20lbs swaddling has become increasingly more difficult.  We have lots of swaddle blankets.  Our collection includes the expensive A+A brand (both with and without bamboo) and while the A+A brand is nice and loved by many, more often than not I am pushing them aside for one of these.  Why are they better?  They wash better than other brands and are softer after multiple washes.  The ones I ordered before my daughter was born still look brand new.  These blankets are also 3 inches larger than other brands.
