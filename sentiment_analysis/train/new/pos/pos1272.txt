I just ordered this product and am beyond excited for it to get here! I read comments that it didnt have a mattress as advertised but i see they have now changed that. Since i saved $8.00 which made it only $32.00 and didnt have to pay shipping cause it was free I just bought a mattress with it for $10.00. All together basket and mattress I only spent about $48.00 dollars and some change. Which i feel was an awesome deal. I only hope I am just as excited when it shows up, but I feel I will be because I just had a baby last year and wanted a moses basket so bad but didnt get it, i was very bummed.
