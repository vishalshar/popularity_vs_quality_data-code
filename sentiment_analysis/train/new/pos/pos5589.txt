I bought two of these because I have a daughter and a godson who are teething, and, well Bacon!My godson is 4 months and not into the exciting part of teething, so he was 'meh.'My daughter, on the other hand, went to town on this thing!It has the same soft rubbery consistency as her shoes, which used to be her chew toy of choice.  Now she's all about Bacon, just like her old man.I might get one of these for myself, for those tragic, heartbreaking times where no Bacon is to be found.Anyway, she's 8 months old, and she gums that Bacon like it owes her money.  She doesn't seem to notice the lack of flavor; specifically, nasty floor flavor that she seemed to cherish when gnawing on her shoes.  She also doesn't appear to miss the chunks of whatnots her shoes pick up from the floor.  Sadly, I don't believe these really taste like Bacon, but at least she's getting practice with the shape, and somewhat the color (it isn't a convincing replica of Bacon).She has dismissed, sometimes violently, other non-Bacon shaped teethers.  This one, however, was embraced as family.Really, the only important thing here is that it relieves her teething pain.  It does so exceptionally well.  I don't really care what it looks like in that regard.But, if it can look like Bacon, BONUS!Highly Recommend!
