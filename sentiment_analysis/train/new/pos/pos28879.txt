I bought this hoping it would help the little one enjoy tummy time more.  He hated being on his tummy and face planted whenever we tried.  Because he has a mild case of torticollis, the pediatrician emphasized how important tummy time was so he could strengthen and stretch his neck. This item has made tummy time easier on him and has help strength his neck quite a bit.  It's nice because he is up a little higher and is forced to lift his head.  The only draw back, which is noted in almost every review, is the fact that the mat doesn't stay put.  While on it, he will grab the toys or mat itself which will cause it to scrunch up.  Overall, I think it was a great buy since it's helped so much with his neck.
