This bath tub mat is great! Incredible graphics and a nice material that feels "grippy" under my feet. I like that it is machine washable- although I can't say I've done so yet- but I like the option. Well made and sticks to the tub better than the last mat I had. Our toddler loves the illustrations! It's fun to play "I spy" with this mat.
