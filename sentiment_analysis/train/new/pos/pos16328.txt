I love this stroller, it is lightweight and compact.  my daughter is perfectly happy in it.  i use it to run quick in and out errands like the bank and post office.  I also use it around the house and when we travel on a plane. the seat is easy to get on and off to wash and holds up well.  my only complaint is there is no cup holder in the front bar for my daughters sippy cup
