We have two of the original Kiddopotamus PiddlePads and I thought they were the greatest things ever! These are so much better with the design improvements. The hole fits over the buckle on the carrier/booster seats which helps anchor it in place and the flap that semi-covers the buckle strap aides in keeping crumbs, etc. from falling down in the crevices of the buckle hole. The fitted fold design helps it fit and mold better and they really do hold a lot! Our now 2.5 year old is into training pants and they don't hold nearly as well (or as much) as a standard diaper does, so when she has a blow out these really help out a lot. With our second one on the way, we went ahead and ordered more. Its a great idea to keep one extra for every carrier/booster seat in the vehicle (or stroller) just in case you really don't like taking apart car seats to wash them all the time.We have two of the older style PiddlePads and they don't stay in place nearly as well, although they are much better than nothing. These new ones also seem to be a little thinner which should be a little nicer in the summer months too.
