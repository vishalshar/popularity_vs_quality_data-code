Very happy I purchased this product. I was looking for something cute to store a few diapers and a small pack of baby wipes for my daughter. This is roomy enough for me to fit 3 diapers (size 3), a pack of baby wipes, and a disposable diaper changing pad and I still have room for my cell phone. Works great when we go out to the supermarket or to restaurants and I don't have to carry a big baby bag with me.Not only is this cute, but it is also very well constructed.
