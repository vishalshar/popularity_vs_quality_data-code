I was somewhat weary to spend $19.99 for stretch mark cream, but after trying every other brand with no success I was desperate!Almost immediately after applying Tummy Honey the maddening itching stopped. A few days after using it my existing stretch marks faded in addition to no more new stretch marks appearing! I love it! Tummy Honey is not greasy; you can wear it all day and not worry about getting nasty grease marks on your maternity clothes. I don't know about you, but when I'm pregnant I have enough stains on my shirt from my all my food throughout the day...Why am I so clumsy when I am pregnant?Another great use for Tummy Honey.....it heals dry cuticles and hands! I use what I have left over from my pregnancy for my hands and feet at night...WOW!Great product! Great price...think about it...How much is a tummy tuck these days? My skin is worth $19.99. I spend that on facial moisturizer, $20.00 for a pedicure, $20.00 for a manicure....why not my tummy?
