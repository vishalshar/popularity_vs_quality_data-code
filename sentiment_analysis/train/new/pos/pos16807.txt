I got these for my daughter and so far she likes them pretty well. I started giving them to her around 3.5 months to gnaw on. Since these shouldn't be frozen they don't get super cold but I think that's probably a good thing, my little one is more tolerant of it that way. These are a pretty decent size about 2 3/4 inches in diameter, so easy enough for her to hold. The only thing is the antenna are pretty hard and since they stick out that;s what she goes for immediately. The package I got had red and orange, they are very cute and pack well into my diaper bag too! I would recommend these or give as gifts.
