I don't think I've ever written a review, but this gym has been such a big help I thought I should.  Our 2-month-old baby is completely captivated by this thing.  If he's ever fussy and I can't find a position he likes, I put him on the mat and about 75% of the time he's happily gurgling and cooing and batting at the toys instantly.  It's like I threw the happy-baby switch.  He can reach the toys, so he gets some feedback about where his hands and feet are, and there is crinkly stuff in the padded "floor" of the gym that he kicks enthusiastically.  It has made it possible to take a shower or do quick chores, and I feel like he's getting a lot more out of it than he would lying in his crib.  The motion of the arch rotates everything enticingly and helps hold his interest.  I do wish there was a setting with motion but no sound, but as baby toy sounds go, it's not so bad, and honestly, he loves it so much I could handle much worse in the music department.  It's semi-portable--easy to take off the curved arms, and the bottom is foldable cloth, but the arms do not collapse, and they're long, so if you're traveling you need to have a big suitcase.  I thought this was ridiculously expensive as baby toys go--especially since in my experience babies often like the packaging the toy comes in more than the toy itself--but this has been worth it.  I might even buy one for a friend.
