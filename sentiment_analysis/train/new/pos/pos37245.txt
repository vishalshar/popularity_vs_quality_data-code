This is the best baby food maker you can imagine.  It's very quick and thorough.  We use it in the little reservoir as well as with the hand blender put into random dishes of steamed veggies, meat, fruit.  Just put a cloth around open containers to contain the spray and you're good to go.  I recommend this to all of my friends with babies.  It works so well that we use it for smoothies and shakes for ourselves, too.
