I did so much research before deciding on a high chair, my baby was already 13 months when I purchased this product. So far, so good. If you are looking for a chair with lots of bells and whistles this ain't it. However, if you need a basic high chair that is sturdy, versatile and easy to clean with a fairly small footprint then this is 4 U! I was originally considering a chair that was over three times the price of this one. However, it had no recline feature and only a five point harness. The SimpleSwitch provides 2-position recline and the option of using the five point or three point harness. This chair is easy to assemble. However, just pay attention to the marking on the legs. They are not all the same. My bad:) The tray is easily removed with one hand. It is nice and large. You can position it pretty snug against the baby so there is minimum food in their lap after mealtime. I have a counter height table. So I was concerned that the chair would be too short. However, its tall enough so baby feels included in family meals. The cover is easy to remove and wash. Also, the booster seat can be placed on your chair when child is old enough. Furthermore it's good for traveling. You can throw the booster seat in your trunk. The legs snap into the footrest for convenient storage. What more can you ask for the price?
