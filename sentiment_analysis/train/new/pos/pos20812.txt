Love these bags!  They are of excellent quality!  They are a little pricey, but compared to others - well, there is no comparison.  In general, I've been impressed with the One Step Ahead merchandise.What I use them for:Large - use for traveling occasionally to gather toiletry type items (a chi hair straightener fits lengthwise almost perfectly)Medium - everyday use to hold 4 - 4 oz bottle of milk to send to daycare (clip to the diaper bag and go, bottles - to help you gauge size - are the drop-in liners with the pump and store caps)Small - everyday use to hold breast pump accessories (Medela flanges, valves, adapter, etc)Pros:High qualityEasy zipper closureClips makes easy to attach to virtually anythingCons:Can buy individual sizes - I'd buy 5 more of the medium if I could, but don't want to pay for the whole set... although I will be looking to buy one additional set when it is again available
