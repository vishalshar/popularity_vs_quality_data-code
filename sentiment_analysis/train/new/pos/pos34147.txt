I use it daily since baby was 7 weeks old. It is easy to put her in there, even if only to wash off her bottom.  Since baby started to hold her own head up, she loves it.  Now at 3 months, she is starting to splash her hands in the water. 6 months update:Elena got diaper rash when we started on solids and this tub makes it easy to wash off her bottom at each diaper change.  I fill tub 1/3 with warm water, drop 3 tablespoons of org apple cider vinegar and stand her up and rinse of only her bottom.  Very versatile.
