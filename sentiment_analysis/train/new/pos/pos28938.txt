The car seat itself is excellent- we found it rated highly for crash test safety in Consumer Reports and we've been happy with it-- have used it from our daughter's birth to the present (14 months).  We've used it both with and without the base and it's been reasonably lightweight and easy to install.  The stroller is also high quality and with a newborn in the car seat snapped into the stroller you feel like your baby is protected by a tank.  However, the stroller is VERY heavy and large even when in the folded position.  Takes up a lot of room in a standard trunk, so not good for trips with other baggage involved unless you have a large vehicle. As soon as she could hold her head up on her own we had her in an umbrella stroller. What I wish we'd done is purchase this car seat alone along with one of those more compact and lightweight car seat frames that converts it into a stroller (e.g., Graco Snugrider) for use when she was an infant & the umbrella stroller for her older stages and skipped this bulky, heavy stroller entirely.  Not a huge deal though-- I don't think there would have been a lot of savings from the price difference and luckily we have room in our apartment for the stroller.  Something to consider if you are very short on space or have a small car.
