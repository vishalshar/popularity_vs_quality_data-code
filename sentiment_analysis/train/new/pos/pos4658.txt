I ordered these socks as my son hated wearing shoes in house. The days when he has cold, or not feeling well, i try that he walks in socks atleast. He did fall many times in his normal day to day socks, so i looked for something with non-skid sole.These socks are great!!! They don't restrict my baby's feet like shoes does, giving him flexibility to walk like barefoot, but also makes sure he doesn't skid or fall down. The designs are beautiful and colors are super vibrant. I have received so many compliments whoever sees the socks, for the beautiful patterns.They are a little big on my baby who just turned one, but i guess he will grow into them soon. They wash well too, another bonus :)
