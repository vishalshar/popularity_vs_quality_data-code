Other people have mentioned issues with the paint chipping off, but I haven't had any problems of that sort so far - we've been using this for over 3 months now.  I got this for a great price (I think it was around $30), and although there aren't any sounds or flashing lights, that's great because it doesn't need batteries!  The toys are still all fun, and it was awesome watching my daughter interact with them more and more as she grew older (we started letting her play in it when she was only about 3 months old).  She even loves what I thought would be the most boring/ignored part, the bendy leaf next to the flower.The one thing that isn't as great about this is that the little ratcheting lion hanging off of the "tree" mirror no longer ratchets, it just kind of moves around... not sure when or how that happened, and it doesn't seem to bother her any.When we first started using this, she was much too short, but we just put a pillow on top of the platform so that her feet were able to touch the ground and she wasn't just crotch-dangling.Assembly was not really that difficult, the hardest part was putting the seat fabric on... some of the seams didn't seem to quite match up right, but with some effort we got it going.
