This crib was a pain to assemble, especially the drawers! That said, it is really sturdy and looks better than it does in the photos. Overall, a great quality item for the price and I would purchase it again.Pros:Trundle is nice for storing extra blankets, etcThe drawers on the changing table are really convenientFits crib mattress perfectlyGreat price for getting both a crib and changing tableCons:Difficult to put togetherFinish scratches easilyYou can't have the changing table assembled without it being attached to the cribThe crib facing side of the changing table has vertical rails that baby can get her arms caught in(I wove a receiving blanket through the slats so she couldn't do that anymore)
