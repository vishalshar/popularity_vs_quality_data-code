My sister in law and I were both looking for high chairs online at the same time. I bought this one, she bought Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair . The miswivel reclines, swivels, the back comes off for use as a booster, the tray clicks on instead of slides so it's easily done with one hand plus it has a removable tray insert, and it travels very easily from home to grandmas, and sometimes to work with me. The fisher price is HUGE,about the size of a small car seat, does not swivel, and she has a hard time lugging it around with her. I LOVE MY SEAT!!!!One thing I would fix.....The shoulder straps get in the way a lot, and I had a hard time getting carrots out of them. In my opinion, all high chairs should have dark colored straps. Heck, just make them all orange....LOL7/3/11.....I still love my Seat! Baby will be 1 next week and is learning to feed himself. This chair wipes soooo easy, or just throw the pad in the washer. Straps too! My straps go in with the whites so they get bleached.....white straps are still a pain, but they are easy enough to remove and replace after washing. Still looks like new! Took the shoulder straps out months ago. He hated them anyway. I have put the whole tray in the dishwasher. Oh and it went on vacation with us. Took it 600 miles so I wouldn't have to use ANY other highchairs!
