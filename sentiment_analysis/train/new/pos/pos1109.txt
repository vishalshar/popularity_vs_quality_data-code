I love my snoogle (7 months pregnant).  Can't say it enough--but, I wish they sold the snoogle with a pillow case.  Since they do not:), this cover is pretty invaluable.  For everyone considering the snoogle+cover+carrying bag (yes, you'll wish you had that too), it seems a crazy amount to spend for a pillow, but I couldn't find a way to sleep comfortably otherwise and the accessories just make it easier to clean (the cover) and store during the day (the carrying bag).
