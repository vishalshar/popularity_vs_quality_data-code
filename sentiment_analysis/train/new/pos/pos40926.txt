I'm really happy with this pump and the entire Avent system. I bought it to use during my leave and to keep at home when I go back to work and it is working very well. It's easy to assemble too after you do it a couple of times and the parts clean well with hand wash and in steam bags. I pump store and freeze with this to the avent bottles so its really convenient.Like:- decent price for all the add-ons and features.- can be transformed to a manual pump (that's how I started using it first) with the included handles- comes with replacement parts, valves, those are the fragile parts here, so I expect to replace them in a few months.- electric plug + battery pack, so I can use it outside of the house- the rhythm setting is clever and you can get more milk while adjusting to your letdown stage- the petal is comfortable I have nothing negative to say, I only wish it had a car charger.
