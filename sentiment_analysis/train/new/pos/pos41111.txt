So far it kept my iPad safe from several drop incidents by my preschoolers. The bottom cushioning is thicker than the top side. One corner of my iPad top side is dented but still ok. It is not easy to put in and take out, so the kids cannot take it off from the iPad, but I can manage to do so easier using my own way. I normally do not need to take it off except when I need to take out the SIM card. I like that it is not too big in size that I can put it in my bag when going out.
