This is a nice keepsake. I used it to get the imprint of our 15 day old's hands and feet. We etched the baby's name and date too and it is nice.The whole endeavor could take up to an hour based on how the baby reacts to your pressing his/her hand into the clay. Mixing was easy. Make the imprint as soon as the clay is kneaded because if you wait for some time and then press the hands, the clay will look a bit cracked wherever pressure was applied. It looks great from a bit far, but from very close, don't expect a hi-def imprint as you see in the pictures, but still you can see those little lines on the hands and feet.Would recommend it as it is fun time making the imprint and in a few days, you have a solid keepsake. Really worth the time and money. Ours has been 4 months now. Hope it lasts a long time.
