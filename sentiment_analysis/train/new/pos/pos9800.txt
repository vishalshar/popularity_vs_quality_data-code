I love this carrier!!!! I am part of a baby wearing group and have been able to borrow a number of different types of carriers. I have tried ring slings, wraps, Mai tai's and structured carriers. I borrowed the Catbird Baby Pikkolo and it was by far my favorite. So much so that I just had to buy my own. I love it.My daughter is now 5 months and this carrier works perfect for her. She is held nice and tight but is still able to look around and see the sights. She is very wiggly normally but does well in the carrier. Other carriers often feel like they loosen over time. Not the Pikkolo . Little one is nice and secure the whole time she is worn. I love how the side straps can be tightened by pulling forward or back. Definitely a plus that other structures carriers do not have.I got the plain black carrier as my husband also really likes this carrier. While I love some of the catbird baby designs, the plain one made more sense for him to be comfortable using it as well.This carrier is a life saver for running errands. When grocery shopping I wear the baby and the whole cart is free for my items. I have a really great stroller but I HATE taking it into stores or tight places. It's so hard to maneuver. Now I can just put little one in the Pikkolo.I highly recommend this product. If you have any question about it feel free to ask. I love talking about baby wearing.
