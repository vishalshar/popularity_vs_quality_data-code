I bought this set for my 4-month-old baby on Christmas and she really likes both of them, esp. the ring. When playing with the phone rattle, however, she likes it until she bops herself on the head trying to make the rattle noise! So, usually I let her play with a louder rattle--(Bright Starts Rattle and Shake Barbell Rattle, bought here as well)--and I shake the phone rattle so she doesn't have to shake it so hard and smack herself just to hear the noise. :)
