Good sturdy construction. It's not very portable but I don't know of any pack n' play that is truly portable. I have yet to get my daughter to take a whole nap in it, mostly because she is attached to falling asleep in a sling and doesn't like to sleep alone. Also the sleeping surface is a bit hard. I do use the changing table a lot. I'm hoping to get more use out of it as a place for her to sleep in the future.
