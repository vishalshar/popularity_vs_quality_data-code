We've been using this product for appx. two months and it is simply the best swaddling option EVER!We were given a number of receiving blankets to use when swaddling our son but our little Houdini managed to pop his arms free almost every time we wrapped him up. We had also purchased a Kiddopotamus but he managed to get his hands out along the middle where the flaps fold across... problematic as it meant that he could pull the flaps up and over his face.Then we remembered The Woombie had been recommended by a parenting class instructor so we decided to give it a shot and it has been the easiest and most effective thing we've used to date. We like it so much that when he outgrows the two newborn sized Woombies he has, we're ordering a few in the next size up!UPDATE:Still really love this option but the manufacturer changed the closure on the little flap that protects baby's face from the zipper. Instead of a snap it's now velcro which we've found less secure and since the one we received had only a single stitch around the velcro instead of a zig-zag stitch that would tack down the edges, the raw edge of the velcro scratch our baby's chin. My solution was to use a seam ripper to remove the velcro and have a snap set instead.
