Ok, so my son was not much of a paci baby. But @ 4wks old he had a condition that required surgery at Kosair's Childrens Hospital. This is the one they gave him but it was orange. He now loves it! We tried Nuk, Mam, Gerber, and even the gumdrop's @ walmart. The difference that i can see is that the ones (gumdrop) @ walmart have a very slick texture to the nipple part. I thought well if its the same brand it will be the same product. NO that is not the case. The ones from this company and the hospitals have a satin like texture to the nipple which is what my son wanted. The bummer about all this is that they have orange and blue for boys, but they read : Full-term, or you can get a newborn. To me that sounds like newborn would be smaller in size than the full term. Something like the mam nano vs. mam 12mos+. This is not the case, they only have 1 size which is full term. It was fine for my son he weighed 5lbs 9oz @ birth and now @ 7wks 7lbs. 11oz. So either way its fine it doesn't take up his whole face. But what bothers me is that this company sells 2 orange, 2 blue...1 in full term 1 newborn they are NOT the the same price. They charge more for the orange full term. Just look on amazon or the company you can see the price difference so i thought they would be different, but NO! Just makes me angry that they just have 1 size, but several prices, and no combined shipping even though i ordered all 4 through the same company. But at least i can say they are what i wanted! Just wanted someone else to know in case you consider getting the newborn or the Full term.
