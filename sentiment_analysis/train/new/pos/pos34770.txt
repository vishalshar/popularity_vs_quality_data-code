I'm an adult and I have very sharp corners on some of my furniture. I kept getting scratches and cuts from them, and so were my guests. That's never good. That's when I discovered these corner bumpers/guards.— THINGS TO KNOW —Two things you should know:1) They aren't child-proof. These corners are stuck on with tape, and besides, do you honestly want to permanently add corners to your nice furniture? I think when the packaging says "Childproof it!", they meant "protect your kids from sharp corners", not, "this is child proof so they can't remove it". That's my interpretation of it.2) These are more compact in size compared to other brands. While other types are bigger and softer, these are smaller and denser; both achieve the same purpose, with only a visual difference. Do you want giant obvious cushions on your furniture, or something more subtle? I personally prefer this compact version.— TO APPLY —You are provided a sheet of 3M double-sided tape. They go on the inside flat parts of the corners (three pieces of tape on each corner). Test one out on a real corner to see how they fit before peeling off the tape. Each should be flush to a corner without any space between the guard and your table. Repeat for the other three corners. Once applied, the cushioning makes a world of difference for furniture safety.— CHILD SAFE —These are child safe—not just to protect them from sharp corners, but they are 100% non-toxic, are latex-free, and made of fire-resistance materials. That's good for kids and adults.— SUMMARY —If you have kids or sharp furniture, protect them/yourself, and your furniture, by getting corner guards. Don't forget to get different colors to match.
