I cannot say enough good things about this suction cup bracket from Boon. I received my Bug Pod from a friend who was done using it, but she did not include the installation kit. As a result, I had been using double-sided foam mounting tape to connect the bracket to the tile of my bathroom wall. And let me tell you: it did not work. I was having to reapply every two days at best, but the concept of the Bug Pod was so good that I just couldn't give up on it.When I finally wised up and decided to google ways to connect it more effectively to the wall, I came across this magnificent product. And for $6??? I couldn't believe it. I had spent double that on wall mount tape already!When it arrived, I was naturally skeptical of its ability to stand up to the constant yanking of my toddler given how terrible most suction cup products are, but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. I followed the directions for affixing it to the tile - use rubbing alcohol to clean the surface of the tile and let dry completely - and attached the Bug Pod.Fast forward to three months later and this has literally NOT MOVED AN INCH from where I first applied it. It has not come loose, it has not slid down, it has not popped off - it has remained in exactly the same place as when I first attached it. My daughter pulled down on the handle of the Pod extra hard the other night and it rotated ever so slightly, but that tiny, minute movement is the only movement that I have see in three months.I haven't ever written a product review on Amazon, but I really had to write one for this. I honestly wish everything I ordered worked as simply and effectively as this little guy. Problem solved.
