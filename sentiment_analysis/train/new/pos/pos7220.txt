I bought these when my son learned how to open the take and toss cups and I love them (so does my daycare provider).  When I first bought them they were a little hard to screw off and on, but after a couple times it was fine.  There is a little bit of an art to making sure the lids are on properly, but when they are, they work great.  My son throws them on the floor and it doesn't open or leak.  If you tip the cup upside down, again, if it's on properly, it does not leak.  I've had no trouble with them, and would definitely purchase them again.
