I was searching for a pacifier like Natursutten that didn't cost a crazy amount of money. I loved that these come in a pack of three for under 20$ - safe natural pacifiers should not have to be a luxury item -  it also made me happy to read that they are made from a single mold so it is unlikely that pieces will just break off in babies mouth. It is interesting to hear about the trees they are made from if you are ever interested in looking it up. I also was worried about the smell but it is not at all as strong as some reviewers make it seem and smells to me almost medical. The pacifier is soft and flexible and I was happy for the orthodontic shape for baby's mouth. So far I'm impressed!Edit- as a newborn baby didn't like these. It took a week or two in soothers before we transitioned to these pacifiers. They seem to stay in his mouth better than the soothers now so we use them interchangeably. Also the rubber smell has seriously diminished in the few short weeks we have been using them.
