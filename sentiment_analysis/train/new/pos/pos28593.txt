I use this bowl all the time. When I got mine the hinges were a bit tight but i applied some Pam and it was fixed. I  was debating on getting other bowls because it has a cap in the picture  but this came with a cap. It was fast UPS shipping (3 Days) also it was packed in its box well. If the hinges would of flowed easier I would on gave it a 5 star but the main thing that brought it down is the bowl cant hold much of a content.
