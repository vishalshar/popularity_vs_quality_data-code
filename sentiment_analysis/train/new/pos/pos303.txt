I got this pail reluctantly since there were so many terrible reviews about this one and most people praised the diaper champ.  I got it because I was able to get it free through a work incentive program, so i thought I'd try it out.  Now that i have it, i would have paid the $50 or so for it.My daughter is 3 months old now and I haven't had to change the batteries yet.  I can use the target stretchy grocery bags in it... i'm sure you can use others but those tie the tightest when i have to throw the diapers out. I love the touch free aspect so you don't have to let go of the baby on the changing table to throw away the diaper.As far as the smell goes... there is none! We are in a small apartment and have it in our bedroom and haven't smelled the dirty diapers once.  However, when we went to visit a friend who has a baby the same age as ours.  We used their "diaper champ" and both my husband and I noticed that their diaper pail smelled bad and didn't like having to reach over to turn the handle thing.Some other negative comments people have made about it are that you have to empty the diapers frequently. I only have had to change it every couple days at the beginning when you change a million diapers a day, and now that we're changing diapers less, i probably empty it once or twice a week.  Besides, i don't like to have dirty diapers sitting in my house a long time anyways.I've noticed that this pail is not available at BRU or Amazon anymore, I am glad we got one and I hope they show up at the stores again soon.
