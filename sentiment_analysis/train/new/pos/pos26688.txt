This matches the rest of the turtle reef set. It's not as soft as I thought it would be and not as well made as I thought it would be but very cute and my son likes it. The print is not as bold as in the picture. The set is made in china and not a lot of cotton fibers. If I had gotten to feel the materials before deciding on the pattern (which I LOVE, so cute), I probably would have decided on a different product. I don't think the quality is worth the price at ALL but all baby items are over-priced anyway. -- update-- My son has had this blanket awhile now and it hasn't gotten any softer through quite a bit of washing. But it looks like it will last for years and doesn't hold stains. I would like to say if you are reading this and you think this blanket is a microplush type material... it's not. Probably just polyester and it's a little scratchy on the edges. Just a warning. I still really dig the turtle theme and my son loves the whole set.
