I was looking for a non-skid mat to put in my kitchen sink when bathing my son, and this looked like a good candidate, but I was frustrated by the fact that the description on Amazon doesn't provide dimensions of the product. Even on the manufacturer's web site I couldn't find dimensions. So, for anybody else out there wondering...the frog is about 17 1/2 inches wide at its widest point (rear toes) and about 18 inches long from eyes to tail. It works well in my kitchen sink, but the toes do curve up the sides a bit.
