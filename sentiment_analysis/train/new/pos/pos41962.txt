I won't review the basic My Brest Friend product here, because there are tons of reviews elsewhere (just see any of the basic models).  (But yes, for what it's worth, I heartily recommend the Brest Friend over the Boppy - I bought both and used the Brest Friend exclusively, at least for the first 4-5 months when baby was small.  After that the Boppy worked just fine and I preferred it as it was easier to take on & off with one hand.)  If you're reading this, you're probably wondering if it's worth buying the "Professional" model over the regular model.It seems like the "Professional" model is marketed primarily to hospitals and lactation consultants, but I think it's a must have for home use.  I originally got one of the regular Breast Friend models, with the 100% cotton cover, and my little guy promptly pooped on it... and milk was also dripping onto it fairly frequently.  Although the cotton cover is washable, the pillow insert itself is only supposed to be spot cleaned .. which didn't feel very hygienic or durable.  And for some unknown reason, the manufacturer does not make a waterproof liner like Boppy does.  So, I bought this professional model - it may not have a cute design on the cover, and yes the top is plastic/vinyl so not super soft, but it is much more practical.  I put a burp cloth over the top so my little guy primarily makes contact with that, and if poop or milk gets on it I can just wash it and easily wipe the blue cover underneath clean.  I'm surprised more moms don't buy this one.  Highly recommended!EDIT: After 5 months of use, I still highly recommend this pillow.  The only downside I'd add is that the material is not breathable.  If I don't put a cloth layer between my baby and the pillow, his head/body get sweaty and start sticking to the pillow.  Probably not too comfortable for him.  So I just make sure to always put a layer in between.  The Aden + Anais burp cloths are the perfect size/shape (crescent-shaped) and work great.
