I bought these for our grandson when he was 6 months. He was too young to to understand stacking but these were easy to hold, to chew on, and to bang together. He's 14 months now and these are still his go to toys when he comes over. I love how they can stack in any order, even mixed upside down anid others that are right side up. The centers are the same size for each ring.
