Loved the look of this crib online, and it had good reviews.  It goes well with the mid century aesthetic in the rest of our home.  The only complaint I have is that some of the slats on the bottom don't quite fit flush with the frame.  It's purely cosmetic, and doesn't affect the safety of the crib, so isn't worth the hassle of returning it.  Just has a gap that isn't pleasing to the eye.All in all, we're happy with the purchase, and look forward to seeing our daughter in it this fall!
