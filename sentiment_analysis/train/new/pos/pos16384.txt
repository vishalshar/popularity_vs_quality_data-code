I'm an ER nurse and we use Exergen's temporal artery thermometers in our ER. They are much more accurate than underarm or in the ear, although the gold standard is a rectal temperature, which can be upsetting to children.I actually wrote my Master's research paper on these thermometers, and here are a few tips in order to use them accurately:1. run the thermometer from forehead (above the eye) all the way into the hairline. DO NOT LIFT the thermometer at all!!!2. repeat this 2 more times3. take the HIGHEST of the 3 readings. It is always important to take the HIGHEST as it is most accurate. There is a chance it didn't read right on the artery so it wouldn't be as high, which is why it is best to do 3 readings.4. clean the head of the thermometer with a Q-tip and some alcohol occasionally to help it read accurately.5. If your child is sweaty, the sweat dries off quickly and cools their skin temperature, so it isn't as accurate! In this case, it is better to run the thermometer over their carotid artery on their neck- off to the side of the voicebox. Run the thermometer side to side, and not up and down.If you follow all of these steps, this thermometer is quick, easy and very accurate. I highly recommend it over any other form of temperature taking for young children.
