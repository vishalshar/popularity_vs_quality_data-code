It's sometimes hard to tell how warm the bath water is since it's all dependent on who's testing the water.  My husband always feels as if the water is too cold but I always feel like it's too warm.  I bought this to avoid our daily disagreements about water temperature.  Our sons doctor told us to keep the water luke warm to avoid drying out his skin (he has bad eczema).  The thermometer is very cute and floats in the water.  It reads from 90 to 100 (odd numbers are displayed) and the numbers change colors depending on the temperature of the water.  It takes a bit of skill to read the number though since it's not like a digital thermometer but a gradual read out.  The numbers become visible when the temperature is reached.  For instance, if the themperature of the water is 95, 95 will be green while all numbers below that will be blue, and 97 will be white.  When we first started using it, I thought that since the 97 was visible that meant the water was 97 but it's the green number that matters.  I tested this with another thermometer to be sure.  In reality the exact temperature shouldn't matter much but it's always good to know.  The only negative I can see with it is that I was hoping my son would be able to play with the frog but the edges of the temperature strip is sqaure and is a bit sharp.  I take it out after drawing his bath.
