Hope our third child is as wonderful as our third monitor!  FINALLY, we have a monitor that works.  We live in a very old house with very thick walls and have had no problems with static.  We also have acreage and our swing set is quite a ways from the house, and the monitor still has no static and doesn't do the "out of range" beeping everyone has talked about.  The only time that beeping has occurred was when we had it in the kitchen.  There seemed to be a bit of interference with the frig and other gadgets.  We just moved it to the living room, and it has been perfect ever since.  If turned all the way up, this monitor is extremely loud, so you can have it a couple rooms away and still hear it.  Also, love that it charges while plugged in.  I always had problems keeping batteries in our old one.
