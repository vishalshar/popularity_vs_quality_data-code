I bought this tray to use with my Britax B-Agile and it's not as great as their other items.  The stroller sits way too high up and far away from baby which defeats the purpose of having a tray.  It's so I could put the sippy cup and snacks on while going about our day with the stroller.  This tray works much better for my 4 year old toddler because he's older and taller.  He can easily reach the tray so that's why I'm giving this four stars.  My 4 year old gets to use the stroller if I'm babywearing his sister so I would recommend this tray for a toddler.
