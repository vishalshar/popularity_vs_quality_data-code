We had a "colicky" baby, that the doctor's thought was acid reflux but I knew better and after 2 months figured of constant screams of pain, figured out it was a dariy protein intolerance.  Anyhow, swaddling was a lifesaver, but not totally on its own.  We did the "happiest baby on the block" with the 5 S's, swaddle, side, shush, shake/sway, and suck - the combo was the only thing that soothed our baby and at first we only had swaddle blankets and trying to swaddle our first newborn while screaming and crying and fighting us, two exausted parents with headaches, this made it SO simple and convenient.  I ended up with 5 of them since we used them so much - our son spent a lot of time swaddled his first few months of life, and actually until he "told/showed" us he was ready to not be swaddled which was arounf 5 - 5.5 months.
