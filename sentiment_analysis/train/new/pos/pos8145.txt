There are a couple of things I dislike about it: The bottom cushion is very thin and can hurt after sitting on it after a while.  I can't imagine sitting on it for more than thirty minutes at a time.  The problem can be remedied by adding a homemade cushion, but the color can be difficult to match.Second, the base of the chair doesn't seem very sturdy.  I've occasionally leaned a bit further forward and back, causing the chair to tilt at its base.Third, the arms are very short and armrest small.  While it's OK for my small figure, there's barely enough space for my husband to rest his elbows (he is tall, but not large).That said, it is a nice chair and I do recommend it for its price range.
