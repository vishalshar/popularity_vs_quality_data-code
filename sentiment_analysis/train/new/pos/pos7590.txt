I've had this pump for over a month now and I love it. One of the best purchases I've ever made!! I have a Medela pump in style advanced that I've useed just while at home but it's so loud, heavy, and bulky. I wanted something that I could use at work that would be quiet and easy to lug around. This pump is all that and more. It is SUPER quiet, easy to put together and use, surprisingly comfortable, lightweight/compact, and it is perfect for on the go! I use it now more than my medela! I will say that if you are used to a medela, this pump is totally different and might take a few times to get used to. But it is much easier to use, expresses milk just as well (for me anyway), and is better for traveling, etc. I would recommend this pump to any mother....and if it doesn't work for you, at least you didn't spend an arm and a leg!Pros: lightweight, quiet, efficient, low cost, soft/flexible flangesCons: No letdown setting, not compatible with other collection bottles
