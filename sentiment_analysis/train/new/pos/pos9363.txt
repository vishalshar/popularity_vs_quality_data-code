I bought this in Feb '09, and have used it alot already. I REALLY like it - it's big, but both kids (2y & 9mo) have plenty of leg room, even when facing each other. It is a bit heavy, but I am 7mo pregnant, and I can fold & load it into the back of my Excursion without breaking a sweat. :-) Seats are easily adjusted, and it's not that much of a pain to take it apart to fold it. It steers soooo easily, and make even sharp corners without running into other things. The basket underneath is HUGE, and can handle the largest of diaper bags.With that said, the cup holder for parents is flimsy - it constantly seems as if it's going to come off (it hasn't yet tho, but I'm scared to use it). I also wish there was a cup holder for the little ones. I've had a hard time getting the hang of placing the seats where they're not in the way of each other. If they are placed back-to-back, the rear seat can't really recline like it's supposed to cause of the first seat being in the way (or maybe I'm not doing something right). I also wish there was a way to fold it with the seats attached, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet. And I think it's a tad overpriced, too.All in all, I'm glad I bought it. Shipping was really quick from here, as usual. It's a real eye-catcher when we're out-&-about. LOL The kids LOVE riding in it, so it must be comfortable to them, which is the most important thing!
