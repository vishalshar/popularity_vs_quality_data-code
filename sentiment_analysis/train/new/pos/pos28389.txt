My 4 month old son cried and screamed in the car EVERY car ride we ever took in the car from 2 weeks after birth on.  He hated the car seat so much that he eventually would start to cry just seeing my husband and I getting the car seat ready for him to go in it.  We tried toy after toy for the car seat and if my husband and I were together riding in the car one of us would always sit in the back to help entertain/distract him, but that never seemed to work either.  I found this music mobile while browsing for other toys for him and read all the reviews of parents raving about it so I ordered it deciding it was worth a try.WOW!  This mobile is amazing!  My son loves it.  From the very first time we hung this from the handle bar he was a different baby riding in the car.  I like how the music isn't too loud as to annoy me in the front seat so I can still listen to my own music softly upfront.  I also like how there are two different sides for him to look at, although we have only used the side with the plush bugs hanging down.  For entire car rides he will just stare up at the mobile and watch each bug slowly go around in a circle.  The music most often than not eventually lulls him to sleep which was another thing he never allowed himself to do prior to purchasing this toy.  This mobile is worth every single cent spent on it!
