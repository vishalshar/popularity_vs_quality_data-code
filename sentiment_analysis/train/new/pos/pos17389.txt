For the people posting that it faded-- the reason why it fades is because you got a car wash. If you remove the magnet before a car wash then it'll stay yellow forever. I forgot to remove mine and then it faded and started peeling but that was my mistake. Normal weather (sun/rain/snow) won't make it fade
