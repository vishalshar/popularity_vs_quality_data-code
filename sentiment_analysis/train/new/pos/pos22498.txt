I love this crib sheet!! My daughter's room theme is owls, and I also purchased the matching pillow and velour blanket. Haven't gotten the blanket yet, and will be writing my own review on the pillow, but the crib sheet is excellent. The border is elastic all the way around, not just at the corners, so it fits a little loose but I like that it would fit most sized crib mattresses. What's even better is that I have a down comforter the size of her crib mattresses, so I can stick that on it under the sheet, and it provides comfort for my daughter and fixes it being loose!Note that all you will receive is the actual crib sheet that is white with the owls on it. You will not be receiving the blue bumper or that pink thing in the middle of the picture.
