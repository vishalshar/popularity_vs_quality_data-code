OK, just to start out:  These things aren't perfect.  They don't magically make it so your kids don't throw juice boxes and they don't vacuum.  However, they do do the job they are supposed to do pretty well.  The reason I'm buying a third one is to protect "my" car's seat from our third car seat.  We already have two of these in my wife's vehicle and they're still doing the job admirably (we've had them for roughly two years - the same amount of time we've had our twins.)  Admittedly, there is one that is fraying along one of its edges.  However, it's certainly going to continue to fulfill our needs.I bought these things based on reviews a couple years ago, and as it turns out, the reviews were right.(As a side note:  they are sitting under a couple of Britax Marathons...)
