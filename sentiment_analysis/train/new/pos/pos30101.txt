I purchased this gate in April 2007 to keep my dog contained in the kitchen/ dining room area where the entry way is rather wide. I have a dog that is less than 20 lbs. and this product is perfect for him. It allows him to run in a contained area without worry of him messing up the floor and it's stylish. The doggie gates that come wide were rather expensive so I chose this as an alternative and I have been extremely happy with my decision.  I highly recommend this as a doggie gate. I'm sure if this is used for a baby (under 20 lbs.) it would be great too (my dog is a Jack Russell mix - high energy and bouncy. Apparently, my dog got the memo not to jump on the gate. Please understand that he does exercise that ability often! My only complaint is that sometimes, Sometime I have to twist the handles to tighten a little more than I think I should and the doorway has a perfect circle where the paint came from tightening the spring tension rod to the wall on the top rightside.
