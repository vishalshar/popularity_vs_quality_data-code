The appliques look great on the wall. They are very cute and look great in our baby's room. I would give this product a 5 if the qppliques actually stayed on the wall. I had to buy some adhesive spray to make most of them stay on the wall. So be prepared to buy some adhesive spray. Even after using the adhesive spray a couple still would not stick.
