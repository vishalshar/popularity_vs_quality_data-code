I was searching for a small potty to introduce potty training to my 10 month old.  I wanted something that looked similar to an adult potty and was small enough for a tiny potty trainer.  This potty has been perfect!  My daughter is now 15 months old and she goes in this a few times a day.  I was a bit worried about the splash guard at first, but she seems to be able to sit on it without hitting that part.  It is a great little potty for those who don't want something bright and distracting.
