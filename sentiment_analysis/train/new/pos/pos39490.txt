This is an absolutely adorable costume and well worth the money but it has a couple of drawbacks:- Had to sew the peas on permanently - the velcro fasteners fell off (they were just glued on).- It's enormous, so it didn't really fit my daughter until she was 9 months old.That said, there's nothing quite as touching yet entertaining as seeing your baby dressed in a peas-in-a-pod  costume...it really makes the "aawww's" come out.Also, in case you can't decide what to dress your baby in for the first Halloween:I was debating whether to dress her as a bunny or as peas and a friend said, "she can always be a bunny, but it seems to me she can only be a peapod her first year."  Good advice.  Somehow almost symbolic of life's early journey itself.
