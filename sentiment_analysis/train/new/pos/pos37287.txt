My little girl likes this toy. I put it on her swing/bouncer seat and she seems happy with it for about 10min or so. She is 11wks. The colors are bright and the toys hold her interest. The sun plays a tune when the star attached is pulled on, but the music is like a play piano in that it is kinda sharp sounding and my little girl really doesn't care for it. In fact, she cried the first time I pulled it. However, she really likes looking at the sun and it tilts downward so she can see it which I like. She bats at the other two toys. Overall I mostly like it because it's cute and pretty much does what I bought it for. One thing I don't like is that the little straps that hold it don't hold it in place on the swing/bouncer seat (we have a graco 2 in 1 swing) so it sometimes slides to one side when she pulls on the toys. They don't fit tight as shown in the picture (at least not on this). I haven't tried it on her car seat so it may be different depending on the shape of the bar on the seat you attach it to. The straps are elastic kinda like those straps you buy to hold a bed sheet on the bed and the clasp together with velcro. It does attach securely to the bar, but the straps just can't be pulled taunt so is can slide.
