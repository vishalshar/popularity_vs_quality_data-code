The moment I showed it to her on St Nicholas Day, my then five month old broke out in the biggest grin and immediately reached for this thing. We already had the HABA Sunni, which she also loves. She plays with her Kringlringl daily, loves holding it in her hands and chewing on the wood. Great quality. Bright colours. Four months later and the stain has held up, even though the toy itself is clearly 'well loved' and has been banged repeatedly and forcefully against every surface imaginable.UPDATE: I'm not sure if it's her age or just that she's bored by now of the same toy, but she has lost interest at 9 months old. She might regain it, she might not. Based on personal experience, I'd recommend this toy from about 4/5 months until about 9-10 months, or until your baby starts to gain interest in more interactive toys. I still recommend it, as the 4 months that she did play with it, she really loved this thing.
