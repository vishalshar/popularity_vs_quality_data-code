This is not made for a crib that has all curves since it will cant to the side (or forward or backward) since the mounting is designed for a straight flush crib.  It is wind-up which I like over a battery but it doesn't go for all that long.  This seems better for looks than it is for music and a spinning thing to keep the baby interested.  It does look very nice and does a decent job on the music and spinning part but again, for maybe lasts 3 minutes at most.
