This is such a cute little lovey! My daughter fell in love with it immediately. So much so that I bought two more in case anything should happen to the first. It's soft and silky and great quality. For those looking for an actual blanket this is not for you. This is not going to cover anyone. It's a security blanket. Something for a little one to snuggle with and hold onto.
