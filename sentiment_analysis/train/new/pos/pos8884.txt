I absolutely LOVE this stroller. With two kiddos I've become a stroller snob. This stroller offers indoor and outdoor versatility. I'm very impressed with the tires -actual rubber and the front can either swivel or be locked in place. It's durable but not huge. It's very compact when it's folded. I can still get groceries in the trunk of my compact SUV along with the stroller! I like the extended umbrella. Baby is always shaded. The basket isn't huge but it holds more than I would expect. Setup was a breeze! I didn't need my husbands help at all. I purchased the BOB snack tray and an off-brand stroller organizer for drinks and snacks. I'd recommend both of those as great accessories. Overall, I'm very pleased I made the investment and I recommend this stroller to other parents!
