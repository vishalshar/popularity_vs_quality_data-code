I happen to be a Child Passenger Safety Technician but I brought these seats for my 8 year old twins. I am all about extended harnessing but we were at the maximum height of our 5pt seats. I thought long and hard about boosters, cost and proper fit. My twins have long legs and this feet is deep enough to accommodate a long thigh, wide enough for their bottoms and the light is a nice bonus. If I have one complaint, the light needs to be more directed down instead of out as it interferes with my night time driving.
