We just received this today.  We are still waiting on our son to arrive however I love it from what I can see and feel.I was able to put it together in about 30mins the 1st time.I think next time it will not take as long as I will not have to read instructions.  :)I have read reviews that it does not fit through doors.  It fits through ours fine.I think if this is a concern maybe measure the door ways prior to ordering to see if this is something that might deter or irritate you.I found it to feel much lighter than I expected.  It does not feel it's weight and I have no upper body strength ;)Above and beyond it feels very sturdy and safe.  I was able to move it around from side to side and not feel like I could break it.The bassinet pad is soft and slight cushy to feel which is nice.  I have not placed sheets on it yet.I am very pleased and happy with my choice with the Chicco.I will update once our son arrives.  :)
