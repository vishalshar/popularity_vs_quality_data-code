we have tried number of different strollers and this one exceeeeded expectations!!!it is light, but strong!!! it is so easy to go off road as well as to navigate in a grocery store especially whenyou need to back up or make a rapid right or left, it just doesn't get stuck, i guess the front wheels have some kind ofhorizontal wheel bearing so it makes it move any direction with the minimum effort. Off the road impression the stroller has shocks when it quickly absorbs the impact over the obstacles and the child doesn't jump up. Folds this stroller very tight and if you have a small trunk it will go just right in and even leave some space for some extra bags or a medium size suitcase to go under it or next to it. We are finally happy! Oh, the final - our daughter really likes to ride in it, the fabrics are made of a very nice material. The Hood covers pretty good, you can see what she does thru the plastic window that connects you with the child. 3 cup holders, good size basket under the sit and the adjustable seat for babies who fall asleep. A little tray table with the cup holder helps her eat her snack or play a little toy that she can move from tray to a cup holder that makes her a little more busy and more tolerant during our shopping trips! It's just great!!!
