We bought this monitor after putting our daughter into her own room for the first time, and realizing that I can't tell a I-want-my-pacifier sound from a I'm-just-letting-you-know-that-I'm-rolling-over sound based on the muffled speaker of a classic baby monitor alone. So, after reading the reviews on every monitor within our price range, we chose this one. It has a tiny screen, but it doesn't really matter when all you're looking at is the baby anyhow. The picture is very clear, and you can see your baby very well even in a dark room with no lighting other than the power button on the camera. About that, the camera's blue power button does cast a blue haze over the crib, but it doesn't seem to disturb the baby. The parent unit is nice, and I don't have any complaints except for the fact that it flashes a bright blue light when charging, which is all the time. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong and turning it off when it's supposed to be charging in the daytime, but it charges all night regardless of the fact that it's plugged in all day. So far it's not portable at all, as it's always charging and won't hold the charge if you unplug it. The sound quality is very clear, and I can even hear the rustling of the sheet in the crib when my baby moves. Overall it's a great video monitor for the price, but don't buy it if you really do need to carry the parent unit around with you, because you'll never get it farther than the charger cord will stretch.
