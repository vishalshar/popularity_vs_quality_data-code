Okay, let's get real.  Babies are messy.  Baby food is messy.  If they can mash it and spread it everywhere, then it will happen.  If you are a clean freak, then don't have a baby!  Other reviews say this chair is smelly, hard to clean, etc.  I love my Prima Pappa.  After my messy 7-month old boy finishes his meal, he gets a wipe down and so does his chair.  It takes about 30 seconds to clean.  Once or twice a month (maybe), I give it a good overall cleaning with a little bit of mild soap and water.  I have never noticed the chair looking gross or smelling gross.  House guests compliment me on how clean I keep things, considering an infant lives here.  (Ha!  If they only knew!)  If there is ANY high chair that exists that no one has to clean or wipe down daily, please let me know.  And...whoever invented it will make millions!  In a nutshell, all high chairs have to be cleaned, so just face the facts.  It might as well at least LOOK good.Overall, I am very pleased with the look and quality of this chair.  It was so easy to assemble and is very easy to roll around wherever we are eating!  The other high chairs at the store were just plain ugly and had just as many cracks, straps and crevices to clean.A good friend of mine had a Graco high chair with a removable tray that you could pop in the dishwasher to clean.  She thought this would be super easy!  Well, her baby boy soon learned that he could also pick up the tray.  After that, anything that went onto the tray also went up into the air, onto the floor, and even onto the ceiling.  The Prima Pappa tray also removes but is "baby proof."  Unless baby has Go-Go-Gadget arms, then this tray will stay put.  Between all of my friends who have kids, we have owned every kind of high chair available.  This is by far the best...
