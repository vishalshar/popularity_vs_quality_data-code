I bought this crib sheet because of the positive reviews I read online.  I can honestly say that I don't regret my purchase, and I even placed an order for more (with a reduced price to boot).  The soft, knit jersey feel feels great and I know my baby is comfortable when he's sleeping on it.  GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY!!
