Yes, it is just a basic carseat, but from reading reviews and alll, I knew that's what I was getting. The color is lighter than the pcture shown. I can see where the canopy might be an issue not staying in place. I bought this as an "open box" deal for a little less than $40 so I'm certainly not complaining. came in the original evenflo box and that's all it was. Just the top had been re-taped. I love the material, It's not plain cloth so it will be easier to keep clean without having to take it apart to wash so much. I was worried about the discription not stating the expiration since it has been discontinued but it was manufactured 1/21/2014 and doesn't expire until 2020.  For me personnally this is great. 4th baby and I like simple and lightweight. I didn't want a heavy seat with all the complicated add ons.
