I'm a fabric developer, so when I saw some of the negative reviews on this product after trying it for myself, I felt obligated to write a review to explain WHY these are so great!Yes. They shrink and will continue to shrink. But the reason is because of the ultra loose double basket weave. The purpose of this loose weave is to allow a place for the liquids to be absorbed. You could never have a weave this loose for apparel due to the shrinkage, but for a burp cloth, it's perfect!The yarn used to weave these cloths is a very low spun cotton. Again, the reason this type of yarn is used is because it allows the cotton fibers to do what they do best -- absorb. This will allow for a bit more pilling as you use and wash the cloths, but if you're looking for a cloth to absorb lots of liquid (milk, spit-up, etc), than this is the cloth for you.The only thing I would change about this cloth is the basic overlock finish. This does look quite "ratty" and could be improved upon by a higher quality finish like a hem stitch.If you are looking for a stylish or pretty burp cloth, this probably isn't for you. If you are looking for a BASIC, very absorbent cloth, buy these!
