This is amazing.My son, who is almost a year old, is barely able to sit up. He has Williams Syndrome and is delayed in some milestones due to poor muscle tone. This miracle bath pillow allows me to bathe him in the tub, without him slipping around or falling. The fabric and fiber filling allow the pillow to fill with the same warm water that is in the tub, but it drains quick and easy to prevent any kind of mildew or odor. I love this bath pillow, and I think it's a must for special-needs kids. Sponge baths on the counter are a thing of the past in our home.(My son is 17.50lbs and hasn't outgrown this pad)
