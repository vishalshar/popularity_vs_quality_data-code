I have 3 children. All we buy are Britax car seats. All my Britax have these Diono buckles. From infant seats on up, the Diono buckles are many orders of superior to the "break easy" Britax buckles. The Diono easily install and are a very nice resilient hard plastic. They close with a satisfying click and  seem unbreakable. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
