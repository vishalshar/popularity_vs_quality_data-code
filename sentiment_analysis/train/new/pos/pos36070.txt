These are the length of a size 3 (16-28 lbs) HuggiesHemp diaper inserts:--must be "prepped" in order to make the diaper ready to absorb liquids. (Prep by washing and drying three times or more. Can also prep by boiling for 15-20 minutes.)--become more absorbent as they are used (washed, then dried)Joeybunz inserts:-- they work! They work! They work!-- will make the diaper a tad bulky, but the benefit of using these as a doubler is worth the extra padding!--using as a doubler= I pair the microfiber insert (that typically comes standard with any cloth diaper made for inserts) with this hemp under . I place the microfiber against the inside of the diaper and the hemp facing the outside. The microfiber will quickly absorb the liquid, and the hemp will absorb AND hold the liquid for a long period of time.If you have a heavy wetter (as I do), it will be perfectly normal to experience some leaks in the beginning. As you use the pads more often, the absorbency increases and the leaks should go away. *Note that generally speaking you have to change cloth diapers as often or maybe a tad more often than disposables. I have a heavy wetter, and must change the diaper at a maximum of 3 hours in order to avoid a leak. (Although I'm more comfortable with the idea of changing every 2 hours.)http://www.babykicks.com/productInfo/care.cfm
