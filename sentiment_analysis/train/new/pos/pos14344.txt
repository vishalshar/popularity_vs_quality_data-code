My grandchildren opened this last night at a Chanukah party.  The 7 month old and the three year old were both entranced.  The individual components are weighted so they can stack the balls in all kinds of leaning confections.  The adults gathered around and played with the toddler to see how much off balance would still work.  He then balanced it with different sizes on the bottom.  The seven month old put the items in his mouth and tottered them around.  He liked them because they are approximately balls but do not roll off so quickly so he can explore different properties, and tastes.  The components got a hard handling given the adult participation and I didnt see any scratching or chipping.  The toy itself  is bright and attractive.  I always like a toy that is fun for the parents too, and this fulfills this wish beautifully and colorfully.
