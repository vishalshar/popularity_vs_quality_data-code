I bought this dresser a few weeks ago and it was pretty intimidating.... I work for a high end furniture store as an Interior Designer so I was already pretty skeptical. Opened the box and was immediately relieved to see its actually wood,  phew, it's not PLAM (plastic laminated practical board) started to pull out the pieces to assemble, and it was pretty easy. The construction is pretty good quality, doweled and bolted. I used my ratchet set to tighten it up. It's not dovetailed on the drawer fronts or anything, but still very solid. Would have liked wood on wood center glides, but the side glides are better then no glides at all. Still need to get some little felt or rubber pads so the drawer close loudly. Dust guards could be added pretty easy too if I wanted. Overall I just love it! I also got the chest and crib from the same set and I'm equally pleased!
