I love these inserts because they are easy to use, fit the CR Gibson baby book pages perfectly and are nicely weighted to help protect the pages while still allowing little ones to look at the baby book.  My only complaint as other reviewers have mentioned is the price.  It is VERY steep for 5 sheets!!!  Especially, when you consider you'll need 30+ if you want to have an insert on each page in the baby book.  I wish they provided a few with the baby books and offered more for the price.
