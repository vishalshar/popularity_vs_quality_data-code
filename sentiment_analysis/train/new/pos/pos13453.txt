Very easy to use and save your time. The entire process takes 6 minuts and use only 3oz of purified water. When the sterilizer is done, it'll notify you. If we forget to add water, the beep sound will warn you (we love this feature) We forgot to add water to the micrewave steriler and Medela freezer caps were melted. We were terrified and replaced all bottles, nipples everything due to the plastic concern. The steam makes everything clean perfectly. We use Dr. Brown & BornFree wide neck bottles. They fit in the racks very well. We stack up everything the way we like and don't worry the design of the racks. My baby is 5 month old and the sterilizer is working very well. We find the best price at Amazon. Highly recommend it for the first time parents!!
