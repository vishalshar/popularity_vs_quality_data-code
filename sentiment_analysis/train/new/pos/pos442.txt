I am a first time Mom and I use this Boppy daily! My son loves to sit in it and he does drift off to sleep in it too. Both my husband and I prop our son up in it to interact with him and we don't have to worry about him tipping over. It is nice to have on the sofa with you so you can give your arms a rest with out the worry of the baby rolling off. It is also another place you can put the baby with out having to keep putting him in a bassinet or crib all the time. Great for tummy time too.I use it for nursing and do not have the problem of it moving around. In the hospital I used pillows and they worked fine, but the Boppy works much better for us. Pillows do have to be adjusted to get the right position for latching and the Boppy does not. I do recomend getting comfortable with some back support before nursing with the Boppy.Very good product and I do recomend it to all.
