Really cute, my daughter feels grown up with her backpack and gives me a little peace of mind. My daughter always holds my hand, is very well behaved but one time while shopping she pulled away and darted into traffic. I never wanted to know the answer for "would I jump in front of a car to save my child" but sadly I now know for a fact I would and have! This one occasion terrified me, I could have lost her if I was slower, with this I don't feel like I am walking a dog or demeaning my little girl, but feel better knowing she can't do that again, even though she has never tried since and it has been 6 months, one time would be one too many!
