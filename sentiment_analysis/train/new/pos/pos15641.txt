I never write reviews, but I almost didn't order this product because of all the bad ones so I decided to quickly write one! Maybe I should do it more, since I always read them!Anyhow, this doll is great for my little one (15 months). I love that Scotty is anatomically correct! As the other reviewers have said, he does leak a bit when you do not feed him correctly (slowly and at the right angle, like the directions say). However, when he has water in him he "pees" just fine, with just a gently squeeze of his thigh. My recommendation is that you don't allow your child to actually "feed" Scotty (they could just pretend with empty bottles) but instead fill Scotty up when the child is not around so when you are ready to "pee" him he is good to go! If you do this it will save you a lot of trouble with the leaking and with having to feed him slowly, and really a child of potty-training age is probably not going to figure out what's going on anyways!I say if you are looking for an anatomically correct doll to assist your child with potty training this doll is awesome! I gave it 4 stars because yes, there is a small amount of leaking, but if you feed him slowly and correctly it is very minimal and is worth it to have a doll that pees in my opinion!
