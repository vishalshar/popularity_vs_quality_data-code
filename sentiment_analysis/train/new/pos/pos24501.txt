This is a very cute mobile that I bought to go with the Love Bird bedding set. Despite being pastel colors, my 3 month old is really into watching/listening to it. It is a typical, windup mobile so it doesn't run for more than a couple minutes. I just run it to distract her when I need to set her down a minute. If you need something to play the song longer you'd probably need to look for a battery operated one. Overall, it's a pretty addition to a girlie room.
