This was a sanity saver when our daughter was about three weeks old and would no longer sleep in her bassinet. She would only sleep if one of us held her, put her down and she woke and cried. A friend gave us a hand me down Rock n' Play and when swaddled and placed in this our daughter would sleep for two hour or more stretches. Finally we could sleep! She was always congested, so the incline helped her breathe, and the raised sides "hugged" her and gave her comfort. We exclusively slept her in this until she was about two months old when we were finally able to get her to sleep in her bassinet again. But besides a sleeper this is a great safe place to put your infant when you need to do any number of things: go to the bathroom, take a shower, eat dinner, do a load of laundry, clean the kitchen, etc. It's light and portable so you can move it to any room in the house. It folds up and transports in the car easily. I always take it when visiting family or friends so I don't have to be holding the baby all the time during our visit. It's great for playing with your baby because it sits them up slightly and they can see you clearly. Our daughter is four months old now and we still use this daily. She still takes short naps in it but mainly it is used for playing and as a containment unit. We loved our hand me down Rock n' Play so much we bought two more for use at her two primary caregivers' homes. We would never have survived the first four months of our daughter's life without this product. Highly, highly recommended.
