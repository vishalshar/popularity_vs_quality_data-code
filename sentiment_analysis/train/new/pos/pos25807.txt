I am very happy with the quality of this product.  This product is going to provide entertainment for a long time to come. It is very well made.  It is worth the money.  Not only do you get a shape sorting product but you get a little house that your child can use to store their toys and or carry them around.  I like that this house is soft and you don't have to worry about your baby falling on it and hurting herself.  All in all, I was concerned about the high price of the item but once I got it home I am extremely happy with it.
