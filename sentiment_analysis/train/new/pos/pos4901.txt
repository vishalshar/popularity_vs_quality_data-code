I bought this bowl for my dog, yep, the dog.  I wanted a bowl for water when I travel with my dog.  He is a service dog, so travels with me everywhere including airplane flights.  It is hooked to the outside of my carry on when I travel.  It is less expensive than similar products for pets, has a protective lid and the plastic is child safe as opposed to the mystery plastic used in a similar pet produced product.  Only complaint is the lid pops off sometimes when I am dealing with all the pre flight things at the airport.  But since the top and bowl have holes on the tabs and I have a ring through them with a clip it does not get lost.  It has worked great, been banged around and cleans up fine.
