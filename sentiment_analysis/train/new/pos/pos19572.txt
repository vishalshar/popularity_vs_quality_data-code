I know some people looked us strangely to put these on our twin granddaughter who are 18 months old but with a 5 year old and crazy people in this world it was out solution because they don't always want to be pushed around a stroller.  We took them to a park and tried them out.  Some people don't agree with this safety feature but it's nice to have handy in case you need it.  They run away in lightning streaking fast and as a grandmother -- I don't trot around as fast.
