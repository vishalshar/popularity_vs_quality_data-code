What can I say... This is absolutely the best nursing pillow there is. I registered for another nursing pillow, I will not mention the name of it (rhymes with loppy.)  when I got my 6 pound newborn home and tried to nurse with that pillow I was extremely uncomfortable. My back was killing me and it did not offer much support of my newborn. I had heard about the My Brest Friend, but wasn't sure if it would be worth the money. I was hesitant, but I ordered it.  Best decision EVER.Pros: lower back support for mom. Check check and check! Holy cow! When you're feeding your child every two hours it starts to hurt your back. This pillow has just enough lower back support to ease that pain. It also has a memory foam-like feel, it super sturdy so you can rest baby on top of it, which then puts less strain on your wrists. It is the perfect place to start tummy time with your newborn, too.Cons: I can't think of any. I read reviews saying it smelled, but I didn't smell anything except for the laundry detergent from the cover.Excellent purchase for breastfeeding moms. FYI, at six weeks, my baby decided we no longer need it anymore. She's strong enough to be cradled in my arms to nurse and now prefers the closeness that we have in doing so. It was a lifesaver when I received it!
