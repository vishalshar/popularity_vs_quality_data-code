I bought this item to create a Mother's day gift for my wife. The product was easy to use and easy to clean off of the baby's hands. We have triplet boys, so they can be a handful when trying to do any kind of activity like this with them. I found this item to be so easy to use and now we have a keepsake that will last a lifetime. I would recommend this for any parent trying capture hand or footprints to create a lasting memory of their little ones. I don't give out too many 5 star ratings, but this product definitely earned it!
