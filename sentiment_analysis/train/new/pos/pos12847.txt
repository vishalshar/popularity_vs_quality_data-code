One of my twin boys started removing bibs before his first birthday.  I found a really cheap bib with a tie closure at the party store, and it worked---but it didn't last too long.  It is very hard to find tie closure bibs--and I am not sure that they are the safest.  I tried the baby bjorn bib, which works great for his brother, but he tears it off.  He actually seems to enjoy this bib.  He puts his arms out to out it on.  He leaves it on for the whole meal. And then--he takes it off when he is finished.  The fabric is comfortable. It washes easily.  I was trying to find a short sleeve version with a tie closure, but he doesn't seem to mind the velcro.  I think the sleeves help to keep the velcro from rubbing on his neck too much.  I love that it is longer and wider than most bibs, because it covers more.  I have less mess on clothes and highchair than I do for his brother.  I guess I should bet another one!!
