If you love the pattern, go for it.  The cute sheep look just as pictured.  It is "soft enough".  Personally, I was hoping for one of those ooooh heavenly levels of softness and it simply does not have that. The non-sheep side is plenty soft against baby skin for an everyday cozy blanket, but it won't be one of those go-to insanely plush- want to snuggle up blankets.  For that I guess better to test in store.  Have not yet washed to see how it holds up or softens up in wash.
