I needed an extra crib sheet to bring to my son's daycare.  I try to buy organic when possible, and I thought that the jersey knit would be slightly warmer for the fall weather.  This sheet is very thick and soft.  It feels like a very high-quality t-shirt.  It stretches easily over a standard crib mattress, yet does not stretch out excessively while in use.  I got the "cornhusk" which is pretty much exactly as pictured.  I wish more of the colors were available online right now (the only ones at this time are cornhusk and terra cotta), but I like the feel of this sheet so much that I might buy another one regardless of the color!
