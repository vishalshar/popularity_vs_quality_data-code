My 20 month old son puts everything in his mouth and likes to chew on everything.  We bought this to give him something "safe" to chew and to help with his 2-yr molars.  He calls this his "key" (based on the shape) and chews on it regularly.  I like that it easily reaches his back teeth (where those molars are coming in) and doesn't just work as an infant chew toy would on the front teeth.  When we catch him chewing on something inappropriate (or mouthing us since he knows not to bite) we hand him his chew toy and everyone is satisfied.  The material seems very durable and easily washable.
