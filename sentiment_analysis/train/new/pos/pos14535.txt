This backpack is very good quality for the low price. It is all quilted on the outside but not on the inside. The inside has a hanging cloth that has a small zipper section and in front of that are two slip pockets, one has elastic on the top of the pocket and other one does not. The front outside zipper section is very big. Comparing this to a Vera Bradley no it is not quite like a Vera but the price is also not as high. I think it is probably the best buy for the money for a quilted backpack. Also the straps on this backpack are microfiber not cloth like on a Vera. Overall this is a pretty and very functional backpack. I have a Vera backpack and wonted another one so I bought this one because it was alot less money. I was very pleased with it and glad I saved my money. I still love Vera but this is just a little different. I hope this helps for those of you who are Vera lovers But want to save some money and try this one. I think you will not be disappointed.
