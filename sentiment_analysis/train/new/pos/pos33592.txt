I just received this bedding set today. I was a little nervous because the price was so low that it wasn't going to be the best of quality. When I opened the package and started pulling out the pieces I was amazed at how intricate the set was! There are many different types of materials (corderoy, suede etc.) used for the squares and sports balls giving it so much depth and detail! The stitching is perfect, as are the colors, and even all the extra wall hangings and decorative pillows are made so nicely. I am so pleased with this purchase!
