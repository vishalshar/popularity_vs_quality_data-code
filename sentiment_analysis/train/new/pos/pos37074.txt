My son LOVES his turtle! The picture doesn't show that there are 3 stars on the turtles back. Super cute. The turtle is quite large and comfortable for snuggling and reading a book or watching some tv. The price is quite reasonable for the size and quality. I already threw this into the washer and the dryer and it held up beautifully. Love this turtle. We call him Tubby!
