I love these sheets. They are a true black and white, which is difficult to find in baby items without going the speciality route.These fit my standard crib perfectly and don't bunch up at all. I have washed them many times and there has been no fading on the black or any issues with elasticity loss.They are a classy looking crib sheet for my little girl with both quality and safety in mind.
