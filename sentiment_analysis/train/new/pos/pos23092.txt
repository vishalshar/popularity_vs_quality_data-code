Just yesterday I really got to test out this new item and I was very happy with the results.  My husband, myself and our 1 yr old son visited a popular theme park.  Normally, we keep the stoller cover in the stoller's storage area as a precaution, but yesterday due to cloudy skies we used it to cover our stoller before each ride.  Lucky for us because as we were on a 15 minute ride it began to down pour, when we got back to our stoller however it was quite dry, the only problem is that due to the side vents the seat was slightly damp in some areas but never the less my son was able to sit in it and snack happy and dry while we marched in terrential rain the whole way back to the car.  Bottom line, in heavy rain its has an slight issue with the side vents but they could be very useful in other situations, for the money this is a great item and it saved the day as far as Im concerned, from now on I will always carry this cover with me.
