I have had this item for 2 years now.  We had twins and needed to keep an eye on both.  We had to contact customer service to replace a faulty piece, but they handled it great.  The item has been going strong ever since.  The temperature on the camera is not accurate, but we don't even use that.  The handheld unit takes some getting use to for nagivation and switching between scanning the cameras and individual cameras, but after a few uses it's easy.  The sound is pretty good and picks up cries, with very little if any background noise.  The zoom feature isn't the greatest either, but again, not a feature we use.  The ability to move the cameras with the remote is nice and helps you get things lined up just right or even search around the room.  I was surprised by the range the camera can move.  Mounting is easy and there is plenty of length on the power cord to go from the ceiling down to a plug several feet away.  The talk-back feature is great and we use it all the time to talk to the kids.  I would give it 5 if not for the original faulty piece, but other than that I would highly recommend this item.
