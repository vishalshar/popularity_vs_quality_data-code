This item was originally purchased as a gift for my grand daughter. I loved it so much that I kept it and got her another one. The lid comes off the container and it is divided into 4 sections. There is a small hole on the top which you can position over the snack or item of your choice. It is nice for babies on formula because you can measure out the amount of formula for one bottle. What I use it for is the salad toppings in my lunch. I put sunflower seeds, walnuts, raisins, cut up cucumbers or grated cheese. Then I take the whole lid off and dump into my salad at lunch time. I have also used it when traveling as a snack container.
