Have been very happy with this talking thermometer.  Takes only a second or so to work and then reads the temperature to you.  This has the added benefit of entertaining a squirming 9 month old.  She will be still for a second because she's waiting for the voice to come out of the thermometer.I've use this almost exclusively on her forehead.  On the rare occasions when my daughter had a fever and I wanted to be doubly sure, I tried it in her ear.A couple of things that might be helpful to know.  It worked great from the second day until now but right out of the box it gave wild readings, obviously several degrees low, on several healthy adults I tested it on. I almost gave up on it but then tried it the next day and it's been good ever since.  Not sure why...but I test it on myself and sometimes my wife pretty much every time I use it (and take my little girl's temperature from time to time to see what a "normal" reading is and so she'll be familiar with the experience).  It always gives reasonable results.The other thing is it takes a very reasonable second or two to wake up when you first take it out of the drawer and push a button.  If you're dealing with a sick squirmy child you want to remember to press the button and turn it on before you put it against their forehead or in their ear.
