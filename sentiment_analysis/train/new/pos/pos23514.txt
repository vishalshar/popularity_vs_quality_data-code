My favorite baby blanket for swaddling. Perfect!We spent so much money on "swaddling blankets" but my little ninja could get out of those in seconds. I learned how to swaddle with a thermal blanket like this one and there was no looking back. Google "Super Swaddle" on Youtube and find the one using a stretchy blanket.We had several of these blankets when my daughter was a baby and they were our go to blankets for swaddling. Now, I get them for every single baby shower I go  to regardless of whether or not they are registered for them. We still to this day talk about the super swaddle and these blankets (our daughter is 6).This blanket was a life saver!!
