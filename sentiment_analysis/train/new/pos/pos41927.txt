We just moved into a home w/hardwood floors & both of my dogs are getting up there in age, one of which has diabetes & is losing strength in his back legs, so standing on a slippery hardwood floor to eat is not very easy these days. This Playmat is the perfect solution!! Not only does it give my Labs a solid, comfortable surface to stand on, but it also helps protect the floors from having the bowls pushed around (they're actually elevated on baskets, and the baskets sit up against a wall now, so they don't move around either). The mat, when completely assembled, comfortably holds both of my Labradors; my female is 66lbs and my male is 88lbs. And it seems they have found the mat to be so comfortable that they even lay on it from time to time. It's easy to clean (the hair vacuums right up) and I thought I'd have to glue all the pieces in, but I haven't had any problem with the "paw prints" popping out. The colors are also great and compliment my blue/brown color scheme throughout the living room. I would not hesitate to purchase a 2nd set, and I would happily recommend it to anyone with dogs!
