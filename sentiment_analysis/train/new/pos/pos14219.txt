I have had this guard on my oven for a month and after some modifications, it is working great.  First of all, I must say that my toddler is nuts - he is a strong-willed explorer and had a need to figure out everything.  I would never walk away while I am cooking, but it keeps him safe while I am cooking on the stovetop.  I did have to make some modifications though.  This is what I did:Based on other bad reviews, I didn't even attempt to use the adhesive strips that were included.  I used 3M 10 lbs adhesive and they are on good.  I heated the stove before putting them on, cleaned the surface with a degreaser and then alcohol, and waited 24 hours before attaching the guard.Also, my guy figured out how to pull the guard off, so I used gorilla tape to tape the guard together and to the adhesive plates. I does not budge. See the attached photos.Like I said, it's not perfect, but with a little improvements, it is doing what it's supposed to do - prevent burns. Well worth $15 and an extra $5 for the extra adhesive and tape.Update after a year:  as I write, I am waiting for the stove to heat up so I can change the adhesives on the stove guard.....again.  Don't get me wrong, I still love this guard, but you need to be aware that you will be changing the adhesive every few months.  For me, it's well worth the time and effort.  A little goo gone, alcohol and elbow grease is all you need to take off the melted and hardened adhesive residue.  The actual guard has held up well, cleans well and no melted spots or weakening.
