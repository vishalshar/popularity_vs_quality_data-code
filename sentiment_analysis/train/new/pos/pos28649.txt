This is the second one we've purchased. They are just very simple. They are also suppose to be good for their posture compared to other walkers. The only thing I did not like about it is the music it plays, but my son loved it so that is what matters I guess. My son walked really early. Not sure what part of that this walker had but it took him 2 months between getting this and walking on his own.
