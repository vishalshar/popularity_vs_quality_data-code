I gave this to my mom, just as a little way to say I love her. She absolutely loves it. The fur is very, very soft. And I had to push the fur away from it's eyes. But then the appearance is fine. It's in a good condition. The size was smaller than I thought it would be. It can sit in one of your hands.
