As a self-proclaimed "minimalist" parent, I appreciated the Fold and Go's simplistic and stylish design. It really does fold nicely, and I've put the cover through the wash several times (not through the dryer!) and it still looks brand new. It's true that it doesn't actually bounce (at least not for little ones), but the vibration is nice. I rarely use the nature sounds (wind, rushing water, and a heartbeat) and I have only heard the music option by accident. My finicky daughter dislikes her swing, but loves this vibrating chair and cries when it turns off after 20 minutes. Recommended for any parent who has an easily overstimulated little one.Edit: I wanted to add that I couldn't put my little one down for the first month of her life, so we never used this when she was just born. I would agree with other reviewers that this is probably not the greatest seat for undeveloped necks. When my little one fell asleep, I often leaned the seat back a bit by propping the front edge on a folded blanket so she could recline a bit more (as many reviewers have noted, there is only one position on this seat). I'm sure that doing this is not recommended by the manufacturer, but I found the position to be stable enough as she dozed next to me.
