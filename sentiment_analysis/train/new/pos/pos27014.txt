This bedding is really cute! I love the bright colors and nice pictures! I bought it to compliment my KidKraft Firetruck themed toddler room for my 19 month old. It matches the room nicely, it keeps it fun for a tot his age, my only problem is the blanket is incredibly thin! In the winter, I will need an extra couple blankets- its by no means a comforter type blanket. Its probably perfect thickness in the Spring/Summer, but certainly not for Fall/Winter.
