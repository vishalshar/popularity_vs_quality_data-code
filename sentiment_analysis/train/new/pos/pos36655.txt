I got these for my 5 year old who is going into kindergarten next year.  We also have the Munchkin uppercase ones but she needed help identifying the lowercase letters.  We are now able to match the uppercase set to this lowercase set! I had no idea that this set included multiple letters such as vowels and other frequently used letters! Not only am I able to help her with letter recognition but we are also able to spell some words!  Bath time learning at its best! My kids (i also have a 3 year old) LOVE these and they stick great to the tub. We will use these for many years!
