I got this for the diaper bag and absolutely love it.  I found a few other First Years items (grooming kit, medicine tote, bottle tote) that match in color and are just nice to have.The clippers are invaluable.  Not just for baby, but for me as well.  I can clip a nail on a teeny-weeny hand or I can clip a jagged edge on my own nail. The files really come in handy for this.  Definitely get some of those separately so you can have extras.The thermometer is great.  I have about 3 different "under the tongue/arm" ones that I'm always using.  Results aren't really fast, but considering the price and the fact that most people can't afford an ear thermometer for the diaper bag, it works well enough.The rattle is pretty good.  I got a similar rattle with Winnie-the-Pooh, just to add some variety.The aspirator is good for travel, but get a preemie nasal aspirator for home.  However, I like how you can open this one up and clean it out.  Most that I've seen don't have that feature.The medicine dropper is pretty good.  About average for what you're going to find.  I also have one from the First Years with Big Bird on it.  It doesn't have an end cap, but it works just as well as the one that comes with this set.You can't go wrong with this set, or one like it.  Whether you use it at home or in the diaper bag, just having these little tools all right there is nice.
