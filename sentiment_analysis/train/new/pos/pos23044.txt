We have two of these, so that should tell you something right there.  My son loves them, although of course your mileage may vary on that.  He's six months old and has been using them since birth.  He learned to hold it on his own very quickly, I'd say within a few weeks, which is awesome because Soothies are the only pacifiers he'll take and they don't stay in for more than five seconds on their own.  My main reason for bothering to write a review, though, is to note how well they wash.  I wash them several times a week because he drools and occasionally spits up on the stuffed animal part, and they still look brand new.  I put them in a zippered pillowcase and throw them in with my regular cold-water laundry, although I don't use softener when these are in the load because I don't want to leave residue on the pacifier nipple.  They can't go in the dryer, but they dry very quickly at room temperature...within an hour or two, which is astonishingly quick for a stuffed animal and awesome because of course the quicker they dry the quicker baby can have them back!
