Our son was rolling over and planting his face against his old padded bumper.  This bothered us for breathing reasons, but without the bumper he would push his arms and legs outside the crib, get stuck, and cry.This resolved both issues.  He places his face against the hard material, but can still breathe.  The wedge shape also keeps his arms and legs in.The only reason I did not give this four stars is due to the price.  There is no way this should cost $60 (maybe $30) but in my opinion this is way overpriced.  There doesn't seem to be an alternative we could find, so hopefully another company will enter this market to make the price reasonable for others.
