My son had outgrown both his infant tub and his inflatable ducky tub, but wasn't quite ready for the tub without any added protection from bumping his head.  These do the trick!  They suction cups do have a little trouble sticking, but this could just be the shape of my tub.  In some previous reviews some people had mentioned that the bumpers raise up above the water level, of course this happens - they're filled with air and a few suction cups aren't going to keep them from floating.  This hasn't kept the bumpers from doing they're job for me though.  My son has gone to fall over many times in the tub and where he normally would have hit his head in the tub, he bumps softly on these instead.  I would definitely buy these again.
