I purchased this to use with the Bob Duallie I bought, which unfortunately my toddler was too tall to fit in. I returned it and purchased the Baby Jogger City Mini GT Double and this parent console/cup holder works GREAT on it! I don't use it for the workout gear it came with so I can't speak to that but I use it to stash my phone, wallet, chapstick and 2 beverages while taking walks with the little ones. So happy this cupholder fits the City Mini double! Did I mention it's amazing and fits EVERYTHING in it's zippered pocket?? You need this. Worth the money.
