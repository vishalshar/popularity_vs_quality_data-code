This wrap has worked well for 2 kids (so far).  This wrap does not have leg gussets so sometimes the diaper sneaks out, but that can usually be avoided with practiced fastening.  I use it with a basic prefold.  The velcro (aka hook and loop) is worn and not as strong.  I have found putting an extra strip of hooks over the top to be a good "lock."This wrap has worked well for 2 kids (so far).  I like the leg gussets that help keep it all in.
