Living in a major city, my husband and I have a Jeep Liberty stroller for going shopping and on long walks.  We love it though it does fold down, when we rent a compact car for car trips, the jeep liberty stroller does not fit easily into a small car, so we needed to find a collapsable smaller stroller-enter the kolcraft tour sport.I bought kolcraft because they make the jeep liberty, and because it was cheap $35!  having already bought a cheapy $20 stroller from zellers in canada (our target) it was horrible and made for someone who is 5ft tall, the handle bars do not go up very high.  The kolcraft however is very comfortable to push (the handles are at least 5" higher) and easy to fold, and I would recommend it to anyone and may start giving it as a baby gift.
