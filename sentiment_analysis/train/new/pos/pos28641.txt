I have been searching for a clamp-to-the-table  booster seat for a birthday gift for a 1 year old.  About 20 years ago I owned a similar product and it was so convenient...not to mention lots more sanitary than a public high chair.  After reading all the reviews and studying the details of this brand, I decided that the Chicco sounded like the best of the bunch.  I am very satisfied with this product.  The only assembly required out of the box was to snap the legs onto the frame.  The frame is metal and they use the push and snap, pin in the hole locking system. The included instruction manual is very easy to follow.  The Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair is sturdy when properly set up, the red canvas material is easy to wipe clean or remove and throw in the washer.  I can see that the parents can get years of use out of this product.  By the way, this seat is much better than the one I had years ago.  You can set this one at the table even if you don't have much strength.  You just slide it on the table and easily push up each of the ratcheting locks under the table. Then twist the knobs to tighten precisely.  When traveling. the seat was designed to fold almost flat without having to disassemble it.  The folded legs become the carry handle, but I am going to look around for a heavy tote that I can carry it in just so I can sling it over my shoulder and carry it hands free when I babysit.
