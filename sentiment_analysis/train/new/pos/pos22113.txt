My kick mat just arrived today and it looks like a very nice quality product.  The fabric edges look like a durable material.  The middle part has a bit of a foam quality to it.  Hopefully it will help hide the grime from little shoes and wipe cleanly.  The top strap buckles around your headrest and cinches tight.  There is a second strap you can't see in the pictures that wraps around the body of the seat to secure the bottom of the mat against the chair back.  If you're not interested in having a big black strap visible on your seat, wrap the strap around the seat, un-velcro it, and then just tuck the straps between the chair bottom and seat back.
