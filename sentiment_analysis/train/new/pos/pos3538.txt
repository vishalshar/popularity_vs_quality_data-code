I bought the Quinny Zapp, Quinny Buzz, and the Maxi Cosi car seat.  We first saw this brand when we were stationed in Europe, and HAD to buy it when I found out I was having a baby.  It is very stylish, and we get LOTS of compliments from people asking, "Where did you buy that stroller?"  People always stop us and give us compliments on the LOOKS of the stroller.  Though when they ask the price, they are extremely shocked at how expensive it is.Pros:Great looks!Compatible with the car seat.Handles very good on bumpy surfaces.Turns easily.Very comfortable for my child.Telescopic handle is a great feature since I am 5 feet tall, and my husband is 6'1.You can turn it front facing or rear facing.Cons:The straps are way too short!!!  I was expecting to use this for my child till age 4, but she is now 18 months and the straps are WAY TOO TIGHT!  I tried using the shoulder straps as a lap belt, but now she tries to stand up and escape out of the stroller.Pretty bulky, so I hope you have a lot of trunk space.
