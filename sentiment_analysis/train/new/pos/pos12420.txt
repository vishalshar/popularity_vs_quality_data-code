We chose to baby-wear instead of lugging car seats after reading the benefits of the former. The product itself is well made and looks to be genuine. I was worried of ordering this carrier since a lot of reviewers on amazon have been complaining of fake ergobaby being sold. So I went with a more non-popular color, though my husband who wears the baby more often did have his reservations. However once it got to us, he loved it. It's not very girly, and the purple is a very flattering color even on a lot of men ( well, my husband atleast. Lol)Love the small pocket in the front for keys and money : maybe a quick run at the grocery store or a long walk around the block. And the sun-shade is a nice bonus.However the carrier itself is a pain to put on and off. If you have another person with you, then it's easy, but if you are doing it alone, I suggest you to sit in the car next to the car seat, wear the baby and step out. juggling your baby and trying to get her in the ergo on the street may even be dangerous.
