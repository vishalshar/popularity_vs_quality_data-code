I like this mobile. It moves slowly but smoothly. The music is great and sounds like the actual tune. It has several ones by the way.The figures are beautiful and my baby seems to be attracted to it. He makes sounds to it, kicks and flaps arms when it plays.I never use the remote control. It seems to me it is for lazy people. I mean come one, who can be to lazy not to look the baby and turn the music from far away.Anyway, the sound of the ocean sounds a little different than a real ocean, but it works. I hoped the one that has the fish would sound like a whale or dolphin, but in my case it just sounds like the ocean again. So I think I need to call baby eistein and ask about it.Anyway my baby seem to enjoy that sound and that is what matters, it is for the baby and not for me.The strap that holds it seems secure.I am only a bit concerned about the string that holds the mobile and it somehow getting loose and the whole mobile falling on my baby but that is just me being too stressed about it. What it is , it comes with a string and the string has a knot on the tip of it and that string you put it in a slot and the knot holds the string. I particularly would have liked somthing more secure.Overall a great mobile for the price.
