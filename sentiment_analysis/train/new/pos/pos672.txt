To everyone who has given this product a negative review because they can't choose the color - your child doesn't care what color their bottle is, only you do.  Is it inconvenient?  Yes.  But is it really a deal breaker?This product works great.  My daughter is/was exclusively breastfed and loves her MAM pacifiers.  We didn't know that MAM made bottles as well (they're not readily available in the area we live in) so we tried giving her other bottles when she was an infant.  Unfortunately, she just squawked and bawled at them and we gave up on bottles for a while.  Needless to say, having to feed directly from the breast is not always convenient nor practical and doesn't really allow my husband and I to have a night out by ourselves - or let me have much freedom at all, for the matter.Around the time she turned four moths, I found a MAM bottle at a baby store an hour away from us and - hurray! - she took to it right away.  Unfortunately, I left the bottle at her grandparents' house in another state and haven't had time to buy another one.  Now that she's started solids and the weaning process has begun, I've decided to introduce formula to her in another attempt to give mom and dad some freedom.  So I bought her one of these.  Again, she has taken to the bottle like a dream and loves being able to hold on to the handle and control the bottle, making feeding so much easier and more pleasant.  I am so thankful for MAM.FYI, we received a blue bottle and she could not care less.  By the time she does, she won't be using it anymore anyway.
