I have the Medela Pump-in-Style and desperately needed another option besides the battery adapter. Being a full time working mom I use my pump three times a day, five days a week. That doesn't include any times at night where my little one might sleep through a late night feeding. So needless to say my battery count was racking up. The battery pack uses eight AA batteries and the adapter was "eating" them like candy. I was desperate for another option that didn't cost me $15 (box of 20) every week and half when my batteries died. Whether you pump as much as I do or not, if you have the Medela Pump-in-Style and have access to an outlet then this is a must have! My only regret is that I didn't buy this sooner!
