Both of my children were born with full heads of hair. To keep them from rubbing a bald spot, I lay this little blanket behind their head when they sleep and in the car seat and no bald spots. My eldest kept rubbing his cheek on his and we soon realized it would be his favorite blanket. Best of all-it's small!! Our daughter is still a newborn but if she chooses a favorite blanky, I hope it's this one due to size.
