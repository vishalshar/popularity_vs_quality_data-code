Great toy, my baby started grabbing it at 3 month-old. It is light enough that if he wont hurt himself if he flings it at his face; yes this happens a lot if your baby tries to put everything in his mouth. Plastic is also easily cleaned with soapy water. Note: the O-ball we received does no match the one currently pictured (but matched the image that was up at the time).
