Tired of the "plate throwing" stage?  These mats are an ideal solution for eating out with a baby or young toddler.  When it comes to stuffing the diaper bag, I'm a minimalist.  But, these were essentials for us. Every time we used them, we had at least three people stop to ask us where we got them.  I now add these to all baby shower gifts!
