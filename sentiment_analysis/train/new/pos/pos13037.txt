We needed a product to secure our television without drilling into our walls. This product seemed to be exactly what we were looking for. A couple things to note: 1) The VESA screws that come with the product did not work with our television, a 46" Samsung. We were able to locate screws that did work at our local hardware store, for less than a couple dollars. Although the product included 8MM screws they were not nearly long enough. We ended up using 2 CAP SCREWS 8MM x 25MM, which fit perfectly. 2) If you are securing the TV to your TV stand you may want to note that if your TV stand is not solid wood (meaning it has a fake backing) you will most likely only be able to screw in 2 out of the 3 screws that are required to secure it properly. 3) The wood screws that are included are cheap and strip easily so be sure to pre-drill your holes or upgrade to better screws. With that being said, it still seems to work well and it's pretty secure with the two screws being used, instead of the three. Overall I am please, I just wish it came with the correct screws to save me the extra hassle.
