I don't know what it is about this toy, but my son was IN LOVE with it. I took him to the store at around a couple months old, and he picked this toy out (I held up a bunch of similar toys, and his eyes lit up and he tried to grab it). We called it "ladybug" and he was obsessed with it. In fact, we had to buy one for him to play with at home, one for the car, and one for grandma's house. Eventually we had 4 of these things. We only had one get "overpulled" and stay stuck down so that it didn't "jitter". My son would hear the word "ladybug" and his eyes would light up and he would get excited. There are two colors, and his favorite was the one with the red face and polka dot wings. He didn't love the purple faced one as much. He's 10 months old now and we have one attached to the side of his crib, and he still loves grabbing ladybug and pulling on it!
