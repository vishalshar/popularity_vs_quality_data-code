Negative...Nothing remarkably negative.  I suppose they could stand to be a bit bigger.  I have up to 5T on them now, I don't see them working for anything much larger.  I do have larger kid velvet hangars, they do exist.  I use these MOSTLY for my son in 3T.Positive...Great deal for velvet hangars, the price was nice.Slim profile allows you to hang more clothes in the same space.No slip, even if you hang slippery material on them, keeps things from inadvertently ending up on the floor.They are much more attractive and pleasing to the eye (in my opinion) than plastic or metal hangars.  If aesthetics matter to you, take note.Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase.
