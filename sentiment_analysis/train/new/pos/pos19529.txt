So far we are liking this chair, easy to bring places for sure and we have to have two because we have twins. A couple things to improve the chair would be a lip on the tray on the side facing baby - round foods - like Kix - roll right off into lap or on the floor, not cool! The tray could also stand to swing out of the way without having to remove the whole thing and find a place to set it. An adjustable foot rest is needed, my twins are a year old and their feet aren't even close to the rest.....annoying.....dangling.  Maybe a mom needs to design a highchair? I do love that when using without the tray, my babies can bounce and go crazy in excitement and the chair is stable, will not tip over if buckled into place as they should be.********UPDATE****** The twins are nearly 2 and feeding themselves, which makes food everywhere and they are VERY easy to wipe clean, love that.  They both climb into their own chairs and back out again (with or without the tray on) and they are 25 + 29 pounds and they chairs DO NOT TIP OVER, awesomeness! Their feet still do not touch the rests. The lack of a lip on the tray is still an issue. The Tray is still very difficult to remove & replace and the buckles are still "stiff", I thought over the months of usage they would loosen up but have not, at all.Even with these issues I still love the chairs and so does everyone whom sees them!
