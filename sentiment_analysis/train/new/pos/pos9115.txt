I wanted a rain cover for our stroller, and netting for the carseat and/stroller.... this gift pack WITH monkey cost less than those 2 items separately! The covers fit my Graco System very well, and my Jeep jogger-type stroller well enough. I haven't had the raincover out in any real rainstorms yet, but the coverage looks fairly complete, with good ventilation, too. The mosquito netting held up well the times we used it this past August and September. I recommend this product and will probably purchase it for future Baby Shower gifts.I only gave it 4 stars, as a little carry bag would have been nice.
