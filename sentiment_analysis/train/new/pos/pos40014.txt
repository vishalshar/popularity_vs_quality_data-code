These are sooo perfect for me! I LOVE rubber duckies and actually have a collection and I also run a licensed animal rescue that is all animals but mostly cats so the combination is absolutely perfect. As soon as I saw these I ordered them haha.... With the extras (you get four of each - with four different colors/breeds) I'm going to use as gifts for people who donate at an adoption event I have coming up. I definitely recommend these to anyone who has children or as gifts for a baby shower, baby or toddler's birthday or christmas gift, or to give away as party or wedding gifts! BUY BUY BUY! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!
