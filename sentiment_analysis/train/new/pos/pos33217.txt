I just received the taggies pink giraffe in the mail today.  My daughter, who is 3, liked it right away.  Probably since it was pink.  It is intended for my 9 mth son.  He hasn't had too much of a chance to play with it, but he has enjoyed it from the little I've seen.  It is a bit bigger then I thought it was going to be. It comes to my son's nose when he is sitting up and they are both on the ground.  This is not a toy that can easily fit into a diaper bag or large purse and go.  The bigger size does mean that the tags are easier to grab onto since they are larger.I think I will be letting my daughter have the giraffe if she wants it and I'll order the lion or zebra for my son and see if they are a bit smaller.Overall, I think it is very cute and I think my son will enjoy it.  The size was just a surprise.
