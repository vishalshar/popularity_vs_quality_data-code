Love this sippy cup, and so has my son - for over two years now!  The spout is softer, which is great, it DOESN'T LEAK, which is the best, and easy to see when the liquid has run out.  I've tried countless sippy cups over the past few years, and, this is by far the winner.  My son has always liked this one the best, and the same for us.  We have about 5 of them.  One of them we keep filled with water in his bed at night, and, we've never had a leak.  I've read that a few people complain about cleaning them, or keeping them clean, but, it's really simple - I make sure to wash his (even the one that only has water in it) at least once a week in the dishwasher.  If you get one of those snap lid baskets they sell for kids stuff in the dishwasher, that's the best.  I take apart the cup, put the white filter thing and top in the basket, then the cup in the dishwasher like any other cup, and it gets completely clean.  Here's the other key - like any other sippy cup or bottle, don't put it back together after cleaning until it is 100% dry - that prevents any mold/bacteria from building.
