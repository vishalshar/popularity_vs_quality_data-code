I am writing this review so that people can buy this product with confidence.  After reading the other reviews I was nervous about the bumpers not having ties on the top and bottom.  I just received ours the other day and there are in fact ties on top and bottom.  What does make this product a bit challenging to secure to the mini crib is that the bumper is all in one piece so you have to position it just right to fasten the ties at the corners to make it secure.  The ties could be longer but you can tie a double knot just fine.The cotton is soft enough and the thickness is good to prevent our baby from waking up when he thrashes his arms out in his sleep.  These bumpers will work just fine until he is ready for the bigger crib.  Overall this is a decent product for the price.
