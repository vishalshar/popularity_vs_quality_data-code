I have used mixie bottles for 2 years now. I joined the mixie bottle club when my daughter was about 5 months and I used stage 3 nipples. Now with my third child I ordered these when she was about 4 weeks. I have been looking for stage 1, but I didn't seem to find it, so when I ordered stage 2 I was hesitant on whether or not the flow of stage 2 would be too fast for a new born. In some reviews, it states that stage 2 has 2 holes and stage 3 has 3 holes in the nipple. When i received my stage 2 nipples, there was only one hole. At home, we use medela new born bottles. In the Medela stage 1 I noticed it has one hole and my stage 2 mixie nipples also had one hole. So I thought maybe the hole in the mixie bottle nipples were just bigger? Nope. I tested them myself and both nipples flow alike.At 4 weeks, my newborn was able to used stage 2 mixie nipples without choking or spilling from the side of her mouth. She didn't have a problem adjusting to both bottles which is great! She is now 3 mos and is still comfortable drinking out of the stage 2 nipple.
