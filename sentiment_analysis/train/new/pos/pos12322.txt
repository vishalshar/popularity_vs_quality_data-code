This chair works great. We needed a short booster to fit under the table so our nearly 2 year old could scoot in close. The back of the chair (green part) removes easily with release mechanism in the back, makes cleaning easy. Will be a good booster seat with the back removed too once our boy learns to sit at the table without trying to escape!Here's a photo of the bottom, has four long rubber feet.
