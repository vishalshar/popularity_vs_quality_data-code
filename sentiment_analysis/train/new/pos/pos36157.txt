Being a first time parent I did not know how to keep the baby at the optimum warmth level in winter. My baby is October born. This was a perfect find! This is how I get him ready for bed: a side snap shirt, a sweater, diaper and a pair of pants. This cotton wearable blanket on top of all of of the above and a hat to cover his ears. This has been working for him for the past 2 months.The sleeveless blanket is not too warm, not too cold. Goes on and comes off easily without having to make the baby cry. You don't have to be an expert. I love it. I ordered the Small size. Would recommend it to all my friends who're having a baby in fall/winter. Not sure if it'll be useful in summer.Update: 6/3/2014I'm still using the same blanket in summer. As it's not too warm, not too cold, and with the funny weather this year, this is perfect for the night. Would still recommend.
