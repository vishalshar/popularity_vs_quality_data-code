Godparents can be hard to get a gift for. My wife and I wanted to get something small as a token of appreciation for the baptism of our son. We ordered both the Godfather and the Godmother version of these and overall were very satisfied.I think the biggest thing to note is the picture doesn't really do the glass justice. The outer border is actually etched glass effect, not white. I thought they were very nice. The pattern on the Godfather one is a little more masculine with the Godmother being a little more feminine. A very subtle, but nice distinction.I had no issues putting in photos to either frame and would have no hesitation buying other Malden frames after my experience with these.
