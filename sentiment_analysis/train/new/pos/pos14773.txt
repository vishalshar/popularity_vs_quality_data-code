This is SUPER cute!  It is absolutely an heirloom item.  There are different shapes on the back of Homer's head that the child can press to play different songs.  One plays Take Me Out To the Ballgame, the others play educational songs about colors, numbers and letters.  It is very well made.  The box indicates that it is for children from 1-3 years old.
