This product is a must have if you have hard floors.  We live on a concrete slab and our flooring is vinyl on the main level.  I purchased this product as well as the Kneekers brand.  This ones by far my favorite.  Let me first state that I purchased this for my seven month-old boy.  He is always above the 80th percentile for weight and >98 percentile for height.  He is extremely active and fast!  We have owned this product for three months.Leg Size:  f you follow the instructions this product will work for a baby of any size.  They come unstretched.  Follow the instructions and stretch them out until they fit your LO's legs.  When you wash them, they will shrink and be ready for stretching again.Sliding:  These give great coverage and there is lots of area for sliding.  Unlike with the Kneekers, the entire surface area of the pads will provide cushion as it may slide up and down a little.  With the Kneelers, I had to constantly readjust them and it got quite frustrating.  With these, I only adjust at diaper changes and they could really go longer.Overall, a great product!
