We bought these for our twin girls and couldn't be happier. They are great for storing/transporting food. We have stored very liquidy foods such as applesauce and have never had them leak ever. We use these to feed our kids out of daily for every meal (we use them with the OXO spoons) and we also take them on the go for meals on the run. The bowls are durable and have survived numerous drops and the lids always stay tightly attached even with falls. I was a bit worried about the white plastic in terms of discoloration, but they have maintained their whiteness and resisted staining from everything --- mashed up carrots, tomatoes, even blueberries.
