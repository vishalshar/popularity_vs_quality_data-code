I LOVE this Rockabye Raffi Giraffe!  I actually ordered a less expensive Giraffe on Amazon (Happy Trails Giraffe Plush Rocking Animal) and returned it due to poor construction, quality, damages upon receipt, etc.  I am so happy I ended up with this one.Pros:  It is low to the ground so you don't have to worry about little ones safety...BIG PLUS!  It comes ready to go out of the box...no building necessary...another BIG PLUS!  The colors are BEAUTIFUL...brown, blue, green, orange, cream...very well suited for a Nursery.  The material is soft and the Giraffe seems well built with quality construction.  I also LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that this is MADE IN THE USA!Con: the price was a bit high on Amazon (with PRIME) compared to other sites (about $20 dollars more!), but I wanted the assurance to return had it arrived damaged,  or not as described, and I didn't want a hassle and PRIME is hassle free!FYI, other reviewers report problems with the audio/music.  It certainly isn't the best sound quality but you can still understand it.  Some of the songs are not traditional but I don't take issue with that and I still think it's fun!  Overall I highly recommend!
