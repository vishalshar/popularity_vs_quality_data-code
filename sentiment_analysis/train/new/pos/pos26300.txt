Stylish booster seat that holds up well over time. We purchased it for our first child, and after over three years, it's held up well! We recently purchased another for our second, and she loves it too. It is a nice alternative to the cheap plastic booster seats, and better matches our dining table and seats. I just wish it wasn't so expensive, and that it was easier to clean - the foam part is easy to wipe clean, but when things get stuck further down by the buckle, it's much more challenging to get out. We've only used these seats after our children have turned three, and don't really bother with the harnesses as they are a hassle and our kids are old enough to stay in their seats without accidentally falling out.
