My 4 month old daughter absolutely loves her new doll. This doll is ideal for an infant. It's soft and plush with no small pieces that can be easily swallowed. It is brightly colored and small enough to be handled by a baby. It also looks exactly as was seen. She will probably outgrow this doll as she gets older but, it is absolutely perfect for her at this moment. Thank you for making a doll she can relate too. We are very pleased with our purchase.
