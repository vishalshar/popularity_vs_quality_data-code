I was first skeptical before buying these bottles after reading certain reviews on how they claim that the milk can spill or seep through the nipple holes. Well, so far after using these bottles for several weeks not one drop has leaked and I absolutely love these bottles.  I was also initially worried about these bottles breaking since they are heavy glass but I have already dropped them twice on my hardwood floors and not a crack.  So they are very sturdy.  However, I am sure if I drop them outside on the concrete they would break.  I would suggest buying baby bottle silicone covers.  I have not bought them since I mostly stay indoors with my baby. One negative aspect on these bottles is that the ounces are completely off a little over 1.25 ounces.  So when I measure 6 ounces in one of my Medela breast pumping bottles and pour them in these glass bottles it shows the 6 oz as a little over 7.25 oz.  So besides those discrepancies I prefer to keep my breast milk fresh for my baby in these glass bottles as glass bottles are known to preserve milk longer. Just thought of another possible negative aspect on these glass bottles; the clear nipple covers are very difficult to remove and snap so tight that they do not come off if not sealed tight.  This can also be a positive thing as it is securely covers the nipple of the bottle. You cannot complain as this price is very worth trying these bottles.
