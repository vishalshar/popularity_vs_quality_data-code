Great for any baby! They slip on with ease and stay on through kicking! Normally stay on unless they rip them off. Provides hours of little giggles and smiles from your little one. When I first purchased them I thought they may be annoying but when it stops the crying- it isn't annoying! Much better than loud music toys and they get exercise, have fun with colors, discover toes, etc. They also tend to end up in the mouth but they don't end up goopy.Easy to clean, hours of entertainment, giggles instead of tears- worth the small investment for your baby!
