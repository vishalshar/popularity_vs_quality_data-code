We just moved into a "new" house, where we have a very heavy & full-height folding window/doors with metal frames, which, if/when it closes on a windy day, can smash an adult's hands. With our little girl running around, however, we needed to get something, fast, but didn't know which works best....so, we got this along with a couple different ones from "Safety 1st" and another from Rhoost. When ordering, however, we thought that this might be the least desirable/effective,...but...as it turned out, this one my Munchkin is the best one for us. 1st, it's much thicker than it appears in the photo (maybe 3/4" ?) and it's of a very high quality. It's also not completely hard so that the door will be "cushioned", but it's solid enough to stop a fast closing heavy door without too much give to protect even an adult's hand. It also adjusts very easily to the varying thickness of the door...and...just as importantly, stays where it's placed, high enough and away from the reach of our little ones. It's also made of durable material so, it doesn't absolve moisture or dirt and is super easy to clean (which is important to us w/ our little ones around). We also thought that the grey color might be a problem, visually, but....we found that it's better that they "stand out', visually, so that we know, instantly, that it's on the door, from afar. BUT....this is best to pair with "Rhoost", since kids like to put their fingers between the jamb, as well.
