This is a great bath toy! All my kids love it.  It was a gift for my 2 year old son, but my 4 year old son + 7 year old daughter play with it, too!  The magnetic 'hook' works well.  The reel actually turns and makes a clicking noise that my 2 year old loves.  As a mom, I love that the sea creatures are different colors and shapes.  I can ask my 2 year old where the star is or the green fish. So fun.  I would give it 5 stars, but I don't care for bath toys that squirt.  No matter how vigilant you are about squirting out the water at the end of the bath a little always remains...meaning they'll be gross after a while.  But the description of the toy was clear, and I bought it even though squirting toys are not my favorite.  And I would definitely buy it again.
