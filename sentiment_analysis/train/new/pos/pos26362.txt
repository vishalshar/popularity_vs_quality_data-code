I love our Kushies swim diaper!  I love to take baby in the bath with me, but after getting a nice big poop in the tub, I ordered this diaper.  Last night she pooped a nice big stinky, and it stayed in the diaper and out of the water and off me!  That's all I ask for.  The only problem I see with the diaper is that the velcro is positioned so that you have to do the diaper up pretty tight or the hard side of the velcro will poke into baby's skin.  Because of that, I would advise ordering the larger size if your baby is close.  My baby is 12 pounds, but I'm about to order her a couple in the medium size, which starts at 14 pounds.  She's just about to outgrow the small.Here's the sizing from the package:Small  6-14 lbs/3-6 kgMedium  14-25 lbs/6-11 kgLarge  25-40 lbs/11-18 kgX-Large  35-50 lbs/16-23 kg
