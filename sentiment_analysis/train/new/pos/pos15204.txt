ONE GREAT UNIT. EVEN WITHOUT SOUND OR TURNED DOWN, LIGHTS LET YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. LIGHTS BLINK WHEN THERE IS SOUND, ANOTHER LIGHT BLINKS WHEN THERE IS MOVEMENT (WHEN SOUND HAD BEEN TURNED DOWN OR MUTED). WHEN SOUND IS ON ... ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS CLARITY OF SOUND AND STILL BEEPS WHEN THERE IS MOVEMENT BUT NO SOUND. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT NOT ONLY FOR BABIES, BUT MY WIFE HAS SEIZURES AND CANNOT TALK, BUT IF SHE MOVES, THE MONITOR LETS ME KNOW THERE IS MOVEMENT. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. NOT ENOUGH STARS CAN GIVE THIS UNIT JUSTICE. ALL I CAN SAY........ IF YOU HAVE BABIES, OR HANDICAPPED PERSONS N THE HOUSEHOLD ............. GET IT!  DON'T WAIT UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE !!!!
