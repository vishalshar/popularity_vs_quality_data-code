Well, this is every bit as adorable as I'd hoped, and a little smaller than many messenger bags.  It's also better-padded, even though messenger bags are so often used as laptop bags.And then I got to the inexplicable water-resistant hand-wipe-only foam mat.  The . . diaper . . . changing . . . mat?Yes, this is a diaper bag.  Oh my heavens - my SO already thought I was nuts for picking out something so whimsical and childish.  Wait until he finds out it's a diaper bag!I had a good hearty chuckle, removed the diaper-y bits, and will still wear this around campus, despite being a grown up with no children to diaper.  It suits my purposes just fine, but if you're giving this a as a gift, be forewarned!  And remove the diaper-changing-mat!Update:  I'm really happy with the extra padding in this bag.  It adds some insulation!Second update:  The bag says "surface wash only."  It's not kidding.  The bag was utterly destroyed in the gentle cycle of my wash machine.  I was warned, I suppose, but I don't believe in dirty bags, so I won't purchase a replacement!
