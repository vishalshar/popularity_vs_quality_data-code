Great product.  Installation was not as easy as it should have been.  If you have baseboard trim, be prepared to improvise.  Had to cut a small piece of trim to attach the top mounting bracket so that the unit would be level top to bottom.  While they provide hardware, the hardware only works if there is no baseboard trim.  The screws provided were not long enough to go through the top bracket, through the piece of trim used to keep the top bracket level with the bottom baseboard trim, and then enter the drywall anchors or wall stud enough to engage them.  I had to get longer screws not only because of the upper bracket issues, but even if you did hit a stud and had no baseboard trim, I did not feel the provided screws were sufficient to penetrate the stud deep enough to be secure once going through the thickness of drywall.  If you are going to have this at the top of the stairs to keep your kids from falling, get longer screws and hit the studs.  I certainly don't want to risk it coming out of the wall while they are pushing on it.  After it was installed, the product itself is great.  Very easy to use, and looks great without taking up much room at all.  Wish it could move locations easily like some other gates, but overall we are very happy we went with this brand because the mesh is very thick and strong, unlike some other brands we have seen.
