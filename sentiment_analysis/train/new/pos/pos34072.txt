A well made pice of equipment. I originally purchased this gate to coral my own kids. They then grew and I didn't need it for them any longer. This was en placed into service at a preschool facility. You can imagine the use and abuse it gets and through it all it is still going strong. Eight years later. That's right about 2 or 3 in my house and 5 in a preschool. No better endorsement than that.
