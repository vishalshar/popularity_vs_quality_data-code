We have the Eddie Bauer Adventurer "Sport" travel system.  Just as everyone else said, it fits the infant seat PERFECTLY.  If you have an Eddie Bauer Adventurer seat & you're wondering if this fits, then you can stop wondering.  Simple to install with the LATCH system in my 2007 car, it was ready within a few short minutes.  Built solidly, a good price, & essential for 2-car families like ours.  Like others, we'll be dropping the baby off (at a parent's house) for the other to pick up afterward.  Can you imagine the pain of removing & adjusting the seat base for each car, twice a day?We can't.  That's why we bought this.  Pop the seat in in seconds, pop it out in even less, & be on your way.
