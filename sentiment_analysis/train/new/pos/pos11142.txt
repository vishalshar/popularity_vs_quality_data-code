We are very happy with these bibs for our infant. They only have fabric (no vinyl backing). The fabric is soft and does not have any embroidery or other additions that make it stiff (and less usable). With the backing of white terry cloth it is easy to fold over and finish wiping up spit-up with the backside if the front is too messy.The bibs that we received were the same color and pattern as shown in the picture (on the front side - the back side is white terry cloth). I have washed them 3 times so far, and they have not started fraying or showing any other sign of wear.The velcro attaches nicely and detaches easily. The velcro detaches with a quieter sound that other bibs we have. The only reason I mention this is our little one startles at the velcro sound so close to her ears, and these seem better in that regard. (To avoid the velcro sticking to anything else in the wash, I just "close" the velcro so it only sticks to itself)Overall we are very happy with these bibs.
