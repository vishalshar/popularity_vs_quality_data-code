Overall, I am extremely pleased with this travel system and I highly recommend it to all mothers with babies. Unlike my previous travel system, I found the initial assembly to be quick and easy. Since becoming a mother, Iâ€™ve noticed that baby equipment often comes with instructions that can be difficult to follow which has left me feeling unsure if I was using the equipment properly in the past. The instructions for the Spectra Travel System and Prodigy Infant Car Seat were so clear and concise that I felt confident that I was using it correctly and that my child was secure.Stroller: I was amazed at how lightweight the stroller is, and I love how easily it folds up with just one hand. The swivel wheels in the front of the stroller make it much easier to turn while pushing.  I have to say that one of my favorite features of the stroller is the extra-large storage basket where I always comfortably place my diaper bag, changing pad, and shopping bags.Car Seat:The car seat is very sleek in appearance and the material is nice and soft. My 7 month-old always looks nice and comfy while sitting in it. The SmartScreen technology never fails to impress me as it lets me know if the car seat is installed correctly. My favorite feature of the car seat is the one pull adjustment strap. With car seats I have used in the past I would have to literally take apart the seat to readjust the straps, which was always a hassle.  Babies are constantly growing and the one pull adjustment strap allows for the baby to always fit securely in the seat.I was given a sample of this product to review. However, my opinions are my own
