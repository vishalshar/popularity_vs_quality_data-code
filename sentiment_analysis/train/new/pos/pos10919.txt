The solution to everybody's problem with this product is simple. All of the low ratings all refer back to the same issue with this product. During assembly there are 2 bolts that fit into square slots in the seat that are intended to hold them in place while you tighten the nut. Everybody has the same complaint that the bolts begin to strip out the plastic slots in the seat as soon as you start turning the nut which makes it impossible to tighten them all the way. The reason that this is happening is that the nuts have a plastic ring on the inner, top edge that is there to prevent it from unscrewing. That plastic ring is not threaded to the bolt. As you screw the bolt in, it cuts the groove into the plastic. Here is the problem. The plastic ring inside the nut is harder than the plastic off the seat. So when the bolt gets to that point in the nut it stops and starts stripping out the square slot. Since the bolts have rounded tops you can't use a screw drive to hold it straight. So what you have to do is this. BEFORE you put the bolt into the slot in the seat, hold the end with a pair of pliers and screw the nut on down past the plastic ring. Once the nut has been threaded the first time a groove has been cut into the plastic ring and it will now tighten onto the seat without stripping the plastic.
