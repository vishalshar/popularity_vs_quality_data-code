I'm sure these are great for babies but I got them to see if my blind and over 100 year old mom could use them. They do work well but they are a bit to small for an adult. I wish these were made in a larger size. You may want to think of making the bigger ones because there are no good eating tools for old people with limited movement in their shoulders.
