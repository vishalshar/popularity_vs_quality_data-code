I actually bought this as part of our potty training system for our 3 year old along with the Summer Infant Little Looster Potty Training Stepstool and the Carex Health Brands Toilet Support Rail. The toilet seats in our house are kind of high and my son was having a difficult time transitioning from a stand alone potty to and actual toilet until I put together all 3 to make our 'super big boy potty' contraption. He took to it right away. We have Oval toilet seats and I was nervous about buying a potty seat that may not fit securely on the toilet seat. This did the job! I have to omit one star though because after 10 months one of the securing pegs came off right into the toilet and we could not figure out how to get it back on securely without it falling back in the toilet and us having to fish it out. We still use the seat because my son is use to it now, but it slides  a bunch now and it not as secure as it was initially.
