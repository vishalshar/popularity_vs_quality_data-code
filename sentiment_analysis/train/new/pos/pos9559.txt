These were PERFECT for my 10 month old's crib. He had previously been a stubborn paint-eater from the crib rails instead of sleeping. As soon as I put these wraps on the rails, he started falling asleep quicker at night and nap time because he wasn't as distracted by the alluring crib paint. I don't have to worry about waking up in the morning to find him with paint chips all over his mouth and exposed wood on our crib rails. Peace of mind for me as a mama to know my son isn't ingesting paint, but they are also just really cute. I have the pure white ones (I bought 2 for both long sides). They were easy to install, they feel soft and durable, and they have held up for about a month already just fine.Overall, these are fantastic. My only regret is that I didn't buy these sooner and save some awful damage from my crib rails.Tips:- Make sure the worded label is facing on the outside of the crib, not in. It was kind of difficult to figure out which way the little ties would face until I fully installed it facing the complete wrong direction.- Tie the little strings in double or triple knots to avoid your baby from ever gaining an interest in the knots and potentially trying to chew, pull, lick, or play with the strings. I was able to tie three knots on some of the strings so they weren't dangling whatsoever.- Buy TWO of these if your crib has equal sized sides. See the picture posted to this review to get an idea.- Hold off on washing these if you can, as I've heard they will form little beads (fabric pilling) after a good rough wash or two. I actually haven't washed these yet as I'm afraid to let that happen and have my son choke on the pilled fabric balls.- Buy it to match your nursery decor! The white color look amazing with our all-white furniture.
