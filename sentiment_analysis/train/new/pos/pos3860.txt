My daughter and I found Little Giraffe when she was pregnant with her first daughter. The blankets are the softest I have ever felt. My granddaughters have both blankets and blankeys and I give the blankeys as gifts. Yes, they are more expensive, but the colors, designs and fabrics are worth every penny. They wash up beautifully (I hang ours to dry and then soften with a dryer sheet for a few minutes.) I also have the gorgeous eggplant-colored blanket at my house. The girls sleep with theirs and they still look new after several years. If you want quality and long-lasting items, buy Little Giraffe.
