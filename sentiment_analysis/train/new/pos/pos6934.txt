I bought the Nuby after I read on many sites that this is a great transition cup.  I had an 18 month old who was too attached to her bottle and didn't look like she was going to leave it anytime soon.  I wanted to transition her to a cup but nothing worked.  I bought at least 6 different cups which she liked to drink out of once in a while but nothing that she considered permanent that should would give up her bottle for.This "cup" is kind of cheating.  It still has a nipped on it which is the first stage nipple. So it's really a bottle in the shape of a cup.  But that's what worked for her.  She accepted it right away.  Now after just a week I've gotten her to just have her milk in her bottle and everything else in her Nuby.We're progressing and that's what's important.  I would definitely recommend as others have.NOTE: My only complaint is for Amazon and not the product itself.  They don't specify a color.  When I ordered the invoice showed 'Girl Colors'.  The first one I ordered came in pink which was fine.  Then when I saw it was a winner, I ordered 2 more and they came in an Aqua - also fine - and a blue one with trains which was clearly for boys.  I wrote Amazon and the rep didn't seem to care at all and brushed me off saying that there was no way to choose a color.  Disappointing.
