These Munchkin Snack Catchers are my FAVORITE!! The lid always stays on and the snacks never fall out-even when the cup is upside-down. Even treats as small as Kix Cereal stay in the cup. My daughter has been able to EASILY get snacks out of this cup since she was just under 1 year old. I will continue to buy these snack cups!
