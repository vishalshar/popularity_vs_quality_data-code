My mom ordered this for my 18month old and it is awesome. Of all the pottys I looked at, I couldn't find one I liked. I didn't see this until it arrived and it's awesome. My son didn't play with it too much. Just enough to get familiar. There isn't too much going on so he knows exactly what it's for and has no misconceptions of it being a toy.The arm and hammer scent smells wonderful... but it doesn't stay in. I've tried everything to get it to stay and when it landed in the potty  (after gently closing it) I stopped using it. In my opinion, it's still a great potty and I will probably buy another for my younger sons.
