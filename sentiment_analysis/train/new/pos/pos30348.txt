I returned this seat.  But I still give it four stars.  Odd, I know.  I ordered this seat based on price and good reviews.  I still stand by that decision.  It is a very capable seat with no negative traits.  If you're looking for an affordable seat with great ratings, look no further.  I, however, got snotty and wanted more features.  I don't regret this decision, but if you aren't as picky as me, this seat will do you just fine.I bought this seat without consulting my wife.  Oops!  It was well reviewed, cheap, and shipped free with prime.  Score!  I got it, installed it, life was good.  Then we went to shop for seats for my wife's car.  Off to BBB we went and I saw the splendid fields of seats of all varieties.  Some $75, some $400.  Some had features that I'd hate myself if I paid money for.  Some seemed like a cheap lawn chair held into your car with rubber bands.What I soon realized was that the most common feature of the mid to higher end seats was quick adjustment of the height of the shoulder straps.  You pull a lever, bang, strap and back rest slide up and down.  This seat: not so much.  You literally have to reroute the straps to a different set of holes through the back of the seat.  Is this a big deal?  Probably not.  But I, clearly, will pay for convenience.  You'll probably only have to adjust these straps TWICE in the entire life of your child.  Apparently that's too much for me.  And as I continue this review, my shame builds.Also, this seat doesn't have a recline feature.  Another thing that I'll probably rarely use but I like having it.  Again, stupid.  And the great irony is that this seat has a very solid, built-in cup holder.  My new stupidly expensive Boulevard does not.  Annoying.All in all, this is a GREAT value seat.  If you don't mind rerouting the straps twice in three years.  You are in luck.  Buy this.  It's great.
