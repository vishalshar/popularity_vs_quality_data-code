Ok mattress for Baby. However, after 2 months of use for my newborn, you can tell where she sleeps. There is a very slight sag in the middle of the mattress. I went with an inner spring mattress instead of memory foam in hopes that this wouldn't happen, but it did. Hopefully it will get her through a few years without much discomfort.
