We tried the following vented bottles:- Dr. Brown wide- Playtex Ventaire- Mam- Born FreeThe Dr. Brown bottles were a relative PITA to clean.  The Playtex Ventaire and Mam bottles are both vented from the bottom, and their venting mechanisms are very similar.  They're much easier to clean, but tend to leak when warming up milk/formula in them.  This happened in bottle warmers, and even when we tried warming the bottles in a cup or bowl of hot water.  We did notice our baby really took to the nipples on the Mam bottles though.  After using those, she rejected all other nipples.  The Born Free bottles are vented at the neck, similar to the Dr. Brown bottles, so they have no leakage issues when warming up milk/formula.  They're also a bit easier to clean than the Dr. Browns.  After receiving the Born Free bottles, the first thing we did was replace their nipples with Mam nipples, so we can't comment on the Born Free nipples.Also, in the product pics that MLM uploaded of the bottles being melted in a microwave sterilizer, I'm not sure which brand of sterilizer that is.  We have the Avent microwave sterilizer, which looks identical, but have no issues with the bottles melting or discoloring.
