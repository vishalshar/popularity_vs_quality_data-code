Probably the best purchase we made!  It is very easy because it is touch free so I don't have to worry about spending a lot of time opening and closing something while my baby is on the changing table.  Totally keeps odors out too!  It has a chamber you put the diaper in and after the lid shuts it rolls over into the dirty diaper bag below.  It also takes any type of garbage bag so I don't have to purchase a more expensive special brand.
