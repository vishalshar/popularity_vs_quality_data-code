Although we bought this to use on a few vacations, my 3 year old daughter mainly uses it to play with her stuffed animals.  It is cute and moderately comfortable, though I am not blown away by the quality.  The blanket does not reach the foot of the nap mat, which seems strange to me (and my tall child), so she always uses an additional blanket when actually sleeping with the mat.  That said, I realize it is marketed as a "nap mat" and not a sleeping bag or travel bed, so we are mildly satisfied with the purchase.
