I've seen a ton of milestone stickers and really was drawn to this pack. I love the vibrant color and they look so much sharper in person.These stick great and best part when your kids grabs to crinkle or eat they bend without wrinkling the sticker. The adhesive works great through multiple removals, piles of drool and have never ripped or become unusable.I think these ties are darling and cannot sing the phrases high enough!
