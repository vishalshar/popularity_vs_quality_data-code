I bought this set on June, 3rd... It arrived faster than I expected. I didn't wash it since I am due just in late September so I don't know how it will look like after washing, but the whole set is pretty nice... I like the colors and the fabric... The set has a lot of pieces that goes all really cute together. Compared to the sets I've seen at Babies R Us the finish is a little inferior (but of course is way cheaper than brs too), but still really cute and totally worth it. It's all embroidery and looks really comfy. The picture they show to sell it is poor... The set looks nicer than the picture, the colors are brighter.
