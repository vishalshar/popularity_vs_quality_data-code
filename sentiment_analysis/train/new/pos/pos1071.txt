I wasn't expecting much from this blanket, but I figured for that price I could use it to lay on the floor during diaper changes and wouldn't mind if it got destroyed.  As it turns out, it is actually of decent quality, very soft, well made, the pattern is bright just as it's pictured and bigger than I expected.  It isn't very thick at all but will be perfect for days when it's just a little chilly out but not downright cold.  I will definitely be keeping an eye out for more of this brand at this price.
