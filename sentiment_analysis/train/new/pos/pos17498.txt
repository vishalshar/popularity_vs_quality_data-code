The chewy tube is much smaller than I expected it to be. But it works perfect regardless. I got this, after pediatrician recommendation, for my 14 month old who grinds his teeth at random times of day. (Not just in sleep)It looks like it became his favorite thing now, it is very easy to hold in those little hands and he even already figured out how to make the whistling sound. I think my son prefers this chewy thing over other teething toys because of the "tube" idea.I also need to add that since we got this I can confidently report big change in his teeth grinding habit. He did this today for a little bit, ONCE (!) after several days of 'non-grinding' so I think this is a huge improvement.Fancy little thing. Really helped, I would absolutely recommend this to others with similar problems.
