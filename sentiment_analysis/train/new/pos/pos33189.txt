This has become an essential part of my toddlers night time routine.  He refers to this as "Moon" because of the stars and moon pattern the turtle projects.  When he first transitioned from a crib to his toddler bed, these really gave him comfort and helped him be more at ease with his room.  Every night now, this gets turned on before he climbs into his bed.  It has a few settings for Orange, Green and Blue.  My child prefers the blue so he normally switches that color on.  It can filter through the three colors as well.  The batteries last a really long time in this because it shuts itself off after about 15 - 20 minutes so it doesn't just run all night long.  My wife and I actually use the lights to tell whether he is up or not, because when he wakes up the first thing he does is turn the lights on this turtle, and he will keep turning the lights back on until he falls asleep.  The lights are not bright by any means so it has never kept him awake either which is nice.  I highly recommend this toy to others as my child really likes it and I have nieces that have used the same toy and equally liked it as well!
