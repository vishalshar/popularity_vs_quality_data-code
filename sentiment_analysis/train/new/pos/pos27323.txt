Do yourself a favor- get the version with the walk-thru gate! I bought this about 6-8 months ago, and overall, it's been very useful. The biggest downside is stepping over it all the time. I'm not a clumsy person, but I have tripped over this more times than I can count. Even with my baby in my arms, and have skinned my shins and fallen completely to the ground on occasion. I am now pregnant, and have a toddler, so now I am concerned, as is the rest of my family, about falling while pregnant. My mother in law said she injured herself while pregnant stepping over one of these. If you have a kid and buy this, you will eventually want the gate. Unfortunately, the separately sold gate piece only comes in an obnoxious multi-color, and is $50 bucks. Or you can buy a whole new set that does have a gate included. Save yourself money, pain, injury and frustration and just buy the gate version. I wish I had.
