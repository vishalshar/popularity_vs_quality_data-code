This mobile was the perfect finishing touch to our son's Dr. Seuss themed nursery.  He absolutely loves the colors and one of his first smiles came as a result of watching this mobile. The red, black and white colors helps him to focus and follow the characters.Although there was a part missing, the seller was quick to rectify the problem.The only real issue is that i wished the aong played longer.  It feels as soon as i wind it and turn to let baby relax, the song is finished before I reach the door.
