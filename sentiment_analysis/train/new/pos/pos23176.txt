Expecting our first child, we purchased this carseat after reading numerous reviews of many different brands and styles. We decided to skip an infant seat and use this one rear-facing for the first year. The seat arrived promptly, looked great and I am sure it will function very well. However, two major points:1. I would highly advise, if possible, to get a measurement on how it will fit in your car. Borrow one from a friend, request a dimension from the company, anything. It "fits" into my '08 Subaru Impreza behind the passenger seat, but the seat has to be all the way forward, so no one over 5'0" can ride in it. Not good for mom and dad to drive together with baby in the back.2. While the instructions are fairly straight forward, I quote to you from p.37 of the instruction manual: "Step#13: Ensure the angle indicator ball is the green with to keep the child's airway open." How can a reputable company print something like this? Are all the other instructions, even when they make sense, correct?I am not unhappy enough to return the seat, I think we will use it and enjoy it in forward facing position, but for now we had to get a separate infant seat which fits behind the driver and passenger comfortably and provides great infant neck support.Update: 2.5 years later, we've been enjoying the seat! It was tough while we kept it RF (for 2.0 years) because you do have to put the headrest on once your child is 22 lbs to continue to RF, at which point it becomes the size of any other seat with the same RF weight and height limits (like the Graco MyRide 65 which we also have). Once you FF, it's a beauty. Everything is easy to adjust, like the strap between the legs which is near impossible while RF. The straps glide easily through the buckles, the fabric comes off very easily. My favorite thing about it - the ease of install with a seatbelt for RF position. So I am upgrading my original 3 stars to 4 because it has proven to be a nice seat and I would recommend it to others.
