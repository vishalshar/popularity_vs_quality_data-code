PROS:  Mobi Cam was suggested to us by a good friend who had purchased one after trying many other types of monitors with no very good success.  All other monitors seem to function on the same frequency as my wireless laptop and cordless phone whereas the Mobi Cam does not.  With the other monitors we were restricted to placing the receiver on the floor in certain locations which changed daily otherwise you would not be able to hear my child all you would hear is static.  Extremely irritating especially if you wanted to nap.  The Mobi Cam works flawlessly without static and provides nice audio as well as great video.  The voice activation feature works great to conserve batteries and also allows you to get some things done instead of staring at the monitor the whole time watching in amazement what a baby does when no one is around.Con: Base on both the receiver and the transceiver are not the most stable but I do like the fact that the belt clip functions as a stand you can lean the monitor back against.  If they could only make the bottom of both flat and not rounded it would be perfect.Definitely recommend over all other monitors.  We previously had a Fisher Price and disliked it greatly.
