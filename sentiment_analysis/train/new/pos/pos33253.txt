Made in China. I have no idea why they're called the American Baby Company. Seems a little disingenuous.Other than that, the blanket is fantastic. It's huge so a great size for swaddling. Additionally, it is VERY stretchy and grippy so it really stays put when you swaddle with it. It's not a thin blanket. Here in Washington DC, we use it as a snug under layer and put a thick blanket over when we go out in the winter. It washes extremely well (we've washed it probably seven times now) and it remains very soft and the same size.
