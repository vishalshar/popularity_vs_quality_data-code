So there is this misconception, that keeping cloth diapers all sealed shut will keep us from smells.  Not so....  Urine itself along with fabric fibers especially non natural ones like polyesters, will put an ammonia smell out like you can't imagine. The older the kids get the stronger the smell.  And you don't even need to wait more than a day for ths to happen....  So the more I tried to suffocate the smell, the worse it became.  Frustrated, I was tipped off by the science explanation of it which made perfect sense and decided to try it.  I would try to paraphrase it all, but I'm sure it wouldn't come out right, so just trust me.  Anyway, open air method causes the diapers to not marinate so to speak.  By sealing them, we are essentially steam cooking our diapers in the natural acid.  By leaving them open the air keeps that from happening.  Just to experiment, I tried a few for almost a week.  Even by that time still no smell.  If you put your nse right up to it, maybe you could get barely a whiff.  If you are still concerned tho, there is a swatch of terry cloth attached inside that you can use tea tree oil or any other oil as a neutralizer.  The only thing I find comical is that this bag and the Fuzzi Bunz bag are exactly and I mean exactly the same.  The difference, fuzzi bunz is in th US with great customer service while Charlie Banana is in China and difficult to reach.  Both function the same, just more color options here...  This is the perfect solution for a cloth diaper pail.  Keep n mind that those of you who soak, dunk or completely rinse vs. spray off you will most likely get leaking at the bottom with the zipper.  The zipper is made for quick dumping into the laundry.  Personally I don't use it because I'd rather push the diapers inside out and have the bag wash inside out as well.  If you do soak and dunk, I would recommend a thick towel at the bottom to cover the zipper and deter leaks.
