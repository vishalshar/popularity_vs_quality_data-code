Very upset that my shipment was late that's why I gave a rating of 4 stars. However, the necklace is absolutely beautiful. The rose quarts isn't really pink it's more of a white but the necklace is still very nice looking. It's a little too big for my 4 month old so monitoring is very necessary until she fully grows into it.
