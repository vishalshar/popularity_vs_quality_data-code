We have the Carter's Jungle Jill crib set, but it comes with a plain white sheet with pink polka dots. I was wanting something a little more colorful & stimulating than just that. These sheets are so adorable & match the set perfectly. They fit the crib mattress well & with these prices, how can you go wrong?
