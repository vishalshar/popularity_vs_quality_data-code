I have tried both disposable and reusable.  The reusable doesn't show through as bad as the disposable, plus they are much more comfortable. I saved a lot of money using these.  I received a pack of 6 for a baby shower gift.  I am still using most of the first 6 (had to throw two away because they got worn down and caught on some velcro) and my little one is almost 7 months old.  I decided to order 2 more boxes because I wanted to be able to use them every day of the week (not just 3 or less) and cut out using the disposable ones altogether. Only downside is if you are bursting at the seams (those that nurse know the difference between full and bursting) with milk and let down sometimes it can soak through (I've only had this happen once in the middle of the night when my little one slept for almost 10 hours and I didn't pump during those 10 hours).
