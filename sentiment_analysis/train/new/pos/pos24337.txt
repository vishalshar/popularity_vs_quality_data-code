The most compelling thing I can mention as a reason to buy this seat is a detail that gets tucked away in the rest of the marketing material: this seat is engineered to double the required crash test ratings.The car seat industry is only required to meet a fairly low standard to be able to sell their product, and they're not required by law to reveal the results of their crash tests, so no one does.That's why it's refreshing that Graco has an offering marketed to be safer for your baby! That's what "SafeSeat" means.Other than that, I only sort of like the car seat. The LATCH hooks are less user friendly than the buckles of our old Chicco car seat base, and though this seat is designed to support babies up to "30 pounds", our tall 9-month old is pushing the limits of the slack in the safety belt.I also don't like the levelling system of the base, or the cheap "level" (really a free floating plastic dial) to indicate the seat is at the proper angle once installed.The design of the seat would only earn three stars, but the safety factor of the car seat earns it one extra.I'd certainly recommend the seat overall, and would definately purchase again.
