It took almost four years in business in our veterinary hospital before a toddler tried sticking his mom's keys into one of the outlets in an exam room. We ordered these to fill all the open outlets the next day, and they fit nice and tight. If you're looking for an outlet cover that you can easily remove because you use the outlet frequently, this isn't the product to purchase. We don't use most of the electrical outlets in our exam rooms and lobby, so we love knowing that when Sparky the Key Poking Toddler is back our way he won't be able to access the outlets ;)
