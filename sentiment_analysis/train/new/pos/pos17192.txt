I purchased these caps hoping they would fit my wide mouth Born Free bottles and they do!!  I plan to pump directly into the Born Free bottles that my baby will drink from in order to minimize loss of breast milk from transferring between containers. They will make storing the milk in the fridge much more convenient and when I tested them they did not leak at all. So glad to have found these as Born Free does not currently make storage caps of their own.
