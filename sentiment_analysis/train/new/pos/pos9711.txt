My daughter is 9 months and never took a bottle or pacifier I been trying all types of bottles to use for her but nothing worked . Finally I found this bottle and she's starting to get used to it. Maybe now I can have a couple hours to myself lol .. Only problem is I bought the pink bottle and got blue.
