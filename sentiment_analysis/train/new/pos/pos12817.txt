Love this bouncer!!  I am a neonatal nurse and we are constantly holding and rocking fussy babies as part of my job.  I have never seen a bouncer that works automatically, but in both parent and nurse circles, we always say that would be the most amazing invention.  Well, they did it!  I was really hesitant to blindly buy this off amazon given the mixed reviews.  I searched every baby store I could think of but was unable to see it on display anywhere.This bouncer has three settings: on, green lights on, and orange lights on.  Supposedly its "on" and "gentle" but we cannot tell much difference between the green and orange settings.  My baby was born at almost 10lbs, and from the beginning this bouncer has worked perfectly for us.  She is 4 weeks old now and its still our go-to item.  I really wish I had this for my colicky baby #1, who I spent many HOURS bouncing in her bouncer.  This is just gentle enough to allow baby to sleep comfortably and just "rough" enough (and rhythmic enough) to keep her from fussing.I would say it bounces about 1" up and down when she is in it, just for a visual.  And, its a pretty quick motion, maybe 10 bounces in 5 seconds?  Something like that.  I wished I had a visual when I was buying it online and unable to see it in action.I would def recommend this- and do- to all my mom friends.  We def need to buy one of these for my hospital unit as well!  Thanks for reading and happy bouncing!
