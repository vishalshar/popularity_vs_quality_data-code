Update 6/11/16:  We have used a total of 10, 5 Oz and a 11 Oz bottle in the past year (some kept at grandma's and some at our house).  Our baby just turned 12 months old and we are going to use the sippy spout next.  We have two colored bottles, one pink and one purple. There are no paint chipping problems in the past year.  We are very pleased with these bottles.  We did change to MAMs nipples.Update 9/7/15:  bought one pink color 5 oz bottle.  Pleased to find that there are no paint chipping issues.  The bottle has not been dropped on any hard surface yet, I will update the review if I find any future paint chip issues.Update: 8/27:  Have bought 8 of the 5 oz bottles in total and am very pleased so far with durability and ease of heating in Avent bottle warmer.  Have changed to MAMs nipples Medium flow as baby prefers these over the stock low flow Pura nipples.Bought a 5 oz and 11 oz in bare metal due to the continuing reviews with paint chipping.  Have since purchased two 5 oz. in bare metal. Bottle heats up in under a minute using a Avent bottle warmer, can also heat by running hot water over bottle while swirling it. This time saved is priceless when you have a bawling hungry baby during the wee hours of the night.Unfortunate to learn about the reported chipping as the colors are a cool feature. Wish there was a response from Pura Kiki on whether this issue is fixed.  "Sticking" with no paint model for now.
